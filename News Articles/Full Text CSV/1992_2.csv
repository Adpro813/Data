https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/31/world/a-debut-for-the-ukrainian-peacekeepers-in-bosnia.html,John Burns,1992-07-31,,1014,,The New York Times,World,News,article,A Debut for the Ukrainian Peacekeepers in Bosnia,A Debut for the Ukrainian Peacekeepers in Bosnia," **********From his position atop Hill 689, Capt. Sergei M. Vshivtsev of the Ukrainian Army has a picture-postcard view of Sarajevo, a terra-cotta city gleaming in the summer sun, surrounded on all sides by moss-green mountains. **********Like the hikers who used to come here in better times, Captain Vshivtsev, part of the first military unit from the newly independent Ukraine to take part in the United Nations peacekeeping force, chose the hilltop for its command of the surrounding terrain. The hill is named 689 because it is that number of meters, or about 2,250 feet, above sea level. **********Also like hikers with field glasses, the 34-year-old native of Dnepropetrovsk brought with him equipment to enhance the view. This morning the equipment sat in a trench, a tank-like contraption all glistening white and marked ""U.N.,"" with a radar dome. **********At a command from Captain Vshivtsev, the vehicle's auxiliary diesel engine was started and the dome was raised into a vertical plane, demonstrating the horizon-scanning techniques that officers here hope will help them lessen the level of deadly fire directed into and across this city. **********The vehicle manned by Captain Vshivtsev and three other Ukrainian soldiers is a counterbombardment radar. Drawn from the front-line equipment of the Soviet Army, the device monitors howitzer, mortar, rocket and tank fire originating in a wide arc of terrain at the eastern end of the bowl of mountains that encircle Sarajevo. **********In time, the United Nations command in Sarajevo plans to amass enough data, from the radar on Hill 689 and another at the eastern end of the city, to pinpoint responsibility for every major fusillade. In this way, the officers say, they will be able to assign blame -- either to the Serbian nationalists besieging the city or to the Bosnian troops defending it -- for each breach of the so-far notional cease-fires the United Nations is supposed to monitor. **********That, at least, is the plan. But this morning, the United Nations convoy that ascended Hill 689 from Sarajevo, up three miles of winding, precipitous dirt roads, found the Ukrainian soldiers and the 10-member Canadian unit protecting the site in a disconsolate mood.  Returning to Basement Bunkers **********On Wednesday night, the night sky over Sarajevo was lighted up by the heaviest shelling in weeks, so intense that residents returned anew to the basement bunkers where they had sheltered at earlier stages of the siege. **********On Hill 689, midway between the Serbian and Bosnian Government positions on the hills to the north of the city, the radar site came under direct fire, and Captain Vshivtsev closed the equipment down so the Ukrainian and Canadian soldiers could take shelter. **********It was an experience suggesting that the contending forces, experienced in the game of cat-and-mouse with the monitors, may yet have the last word when it comes to policing cease-fires. **********Demonstrating his radar after a night in a bunker did not please Captain Vshivtsev, a slightly built man with a Soviet officer's reluctance to discuss operations. All he would say was that the radar had identified 122-millimeter howitzer fire from a position four and a half miles east held by Serbian forces, and that after a second shot from the same firing position, the equipment could pinpoint a gun's location within 50 yards. **********The overnight fighting was followed by an unusual alarm today when United Nations forces closed Sarajevo airport to the month-old relief airlift when pilots of incoming planes reported that they had detected Serbian radar in the hills around Sarajevo. **********According to the United Nations, this violated the agreement under which the airport was reopened: the Serbs had promised to remove all antiaircraft guns and associated radar within 25 miles of the airport. United Nations officers demanded that the hillside radars be switched off, the Serbs complied and the airlift resumed. **********The incident caused new concern about Serbian intentions, but the New Zealander who is overseeing the radar operation, Lieut. Col. Richard Gray, argued vigorously with reporters over the responsibility of the Serbian forces for the continued fighting. **********""They could destroy the whole city,"" the colonel said. ""They have enough firepower out there to flatten the city 10 times over, but they don't want to."" **********He added that he had spoken with Serbian troops at the hillside gun positions. ""They don't want a war,"" he said. **********Even before the radar reached the hilltop, the Ukrainians learned the hard way that their first peacekeeping mission was not likely to be an easy one. Not long after the two units were unloaded from a jet transport plane still bearing the markings of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, a mortar attack on Sarajevo airport damaged one of them. Spare parts were ordered from Ukraine and the soldiers, part of a 400-member unit here, hope to have the unit operating within a few days. **********Just being here is a dizzying experience for the Ukrainians. As the Soviet Union broke up, each soldier had to make a wrenching choice between the Russian and Ukrainian armies. About a third of the officers here are ethnic Russians who chose the Ukrainian Army because of family ties in Ukraine or because they belonged to units that were substantially Ukrainian. **********At the United Nations headquarters here, the soldiers eat in the cafeteria alongside Russian Army officers, some of whom are ethnic Ukrainians. **********On the Ukrainians' sleeves, there are the handsome blue-and-yellow badges of the Ukrainian Army. But their uniforms and equipment are wholly Soviet, as are the reminiscences they trade with their Russian counterparts, mainly common experiences in Afghanistan, where they served as members of the Soviet occupation force between 1979 and 1989. But in some matters, a Soviet officer remains a Soviet officer, regardless of the uniform he wears. **********When Captain Vshivtsev was asked how it felt to be a former Soviet officer working with Canadian soldiers in a country that spent 40 years balanced between the Warsaw Pact and NATO, the granite-faced Ukrainian officer interpreting for him cut in quickly: ""Now, the captain will show the antenna system in operation,"" he said."

Eagleburger said that NATO was preparing contingency plans to enforce the no-flights zone and that the United States was prepared to provide aircraft in such an operation. **********Options ranged from overflights to what Mr. Eagleburger called ""more muscular measures."" He acknowledged that if the ban is enforced, it could put United Nations troops at risk of retaliation and that it was a ""possibility"" that they might be forced to withdraw, at least temporarily.  Warning to U.N. **********The NATO decision came as the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, warned that United Nations troops in Bosnia may be attacked if Western nations attempt to enforce the ban on flights. **********The Serbs are reported to have violated the ban on flights 225 times since it was imposed in October. But there is no proof that they have resumed combat missions. **********NATO has already contributed personnel and equipment to the United Nations peackeeping operation in the Balkans, and its ships are in the Adriatic, helping to enforce a blockade. NATO reconnaissance aircraft are providing data on violations of the flight ban. **********On another issue, Mr. Eagleburger warned Ukraine that its relationship with the United States will suffer if it continues to delay ratification of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the strategic arms reduction treaty slashing the arsenals of nuclear weapons in the United States and the former Soviet republics. The Ukrainian Foreign Minsiter, Anatoly Zlenko, told Mr. Eagleburger earlier in the week that the Kiev Parliament would not take up the issue until January at the earliest. **********Mr. Eagleburger said he made clear during the meeting that the United States ""is not particularly happy with the delays,"" adding that he expected ""ratification and without reservations,"" and if progress is delayed much longer it will ""inevitably have an impact"" on the two countries' relations."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/business/us-weighs-bigger-cut-in-farm-trade-barriers.html,,1992-02-26,,465,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,U.S. Weighs Bigger Cut In Farm Trade Barriers,U.S. Weighs Bigger Cut In Farm Trade Barriers," **********The Bush Administration may push for bigger cuts in agricultural trade barriers than are called for in the current plan to reform world trade, a United States trade official said today. **********United States trade officials, appearing before the House Agriculture Committee, endorsed a farm trade reform proposal from Arthur Dunkel, Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based trade organization. **********But Julius L. Katz, deputy United States trade representative, said the plan fell short of the Bush Administration's desire to slash farm export subsidies and trade barriers, and the United States might press for bigger reductions. **********""Another concern is that the reduction commitments for export subsidies do not go far enough,"" Mr. Katz said. ""If modifications are made to Mr. Dunkel's text, we will seek improvements in export subsidy commitments."" **********The Dunkel plan for an agricultural trade agreement calls for reducing export subsidies by an average of 36 percent over six years, starting in 1993. **********Those reductions ""would be meaningful for a lot of commodities in the U.S.,"" Mr. Katz said. **********Richard Crowder, Agriculture Under Secretary, also at the hearing, said that by rough calculations, United States farmers' net income should increase by about $1 billion by 1998 as a result of a GATT agreement.  Farm Program Spending **********Mr. Crowder said United States agricultural exports would increase by $4 billion to $5 billion, and Government spending on farm programs would drop by $2.5 billion. **********But Representative Thomas E. Coleman, Republican of Missouri, said: ""American agriculture in general thinks it's very marginal whether the Dunkel text helps them or not. We hope that you won't look at the Dunkel text as a success and declare a victory."" **********Mr. Dunkel offered his plan as a way to revive the talks, which have been deadlocked mainly by differences between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies. **********The talks, which are entering their sixth year, address a broad range of trade issues, but disputes over farm trade have been the sticking point. **********If negotiators reach a pact this spring, governments still would have to give final approval and pass laws to put the new trade rules into effect. Several United States officials said it was unlikely Congress could do that before 1993.  A Reluctance to Compromise **********In another indication of French reluctance to compromise on reductions in agricultural subsidies, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Minister of Industry and International trade, accused the European Community's negotiators of exceeding their mandate. **********The European Community officials have been discussing the possibility of limiting the tonnage, as well as the financing, of subsidized grain exports. Yet the community's member countries have not endorsed the negotiation of any limits on tonnage, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said at a breakfast in Washington sponsored by the European Institute, a public policy group here."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/29/world/arab-israel-on-regional-issues-start-in-moscow.html,Thomas Friedman,1992-01-29,,1437,,The New York Times,World,News,article,ARAB-ISRAEL ON REGIONAL ISSUES START IN MOSCOW,ARAB-ISRAEL ON REGIONAL ISSUES START IN MOSCOW," **********A Middle East conference opened here today, with Israel for the first time sitting down for talks on regional cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the other Arab gulf countries, but the meeting was overshadowed by the Palestinians' absence. **********The Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said the Palestinians were barred from the conference by the United States and Russia, who objected to the presence of Palestinians from East Jerusalem and from outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said it was the Palestinians who had refused to come according to the terms set out in the invitation, and he added that he was ""disappointed"" that they had missed yet another opportunity to advance their cause. A Lot of New Faces **********The opening day of the conference was full of unusual scenes and contradictory emotions. The setting of the meeting was bizarre: 24 countries gathered in food-strapped Moscow in the dead of winter -- in the same Hall of Columns where the Stalin show trials were conducted in 1938 -- to discuss regional development of the Mideast. **********The discussions themselves seemed to combine some strikingly dramatic signs that the age-old Arab-Israeli conflict was thawing -- and some very strained speeches that suggested it might not be changing much after all. 'Who Would Have Imagined?' **********Today's high point may have come when the co-chairmen, Mr. Baker and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, gaveled the conference to order and looked out to see sitting before them around a rectangular table a lot of people who have never sat together before: Russians and Americans co-sponsoring a peace conference, the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait sitting alongside Israelis, and China and Japan for the first time joining Mideast peace talks. China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Yang Fuchang, went out of his way to walk across the room and warmly embrace Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy. **********""Look around you, ladies and gentlemen, at the parties who are gathered at this table,"" Secretary Baker told his fellow delegates. ""Who would have imagined even five years ago that the United States would launch a new partnership with a democratizing Russia?"" **********The American and Russian co-sponsors envisaged this two-day conference as a vehicle to open a dialogue between Israel and the wider circle of Arab countries -- Tunisia, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- about regional problems like arms control, water, the environment, refugees and economic development. **********Algeria and Yemen had planned to attend but did not show up once it became apparent the Palestinians were not coming. The Syrians and Lebanese had never planned to attend the meeting and urged the other Arabs to join them, but they would not. **********The hope of the co-sponsors is that if Israel can be drawn into negotiations with the wider Arab world, this will demonstrate to the Israeli public the potential for real acceptance around the region and therefore make Israel more willing to trade land for peace with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians in their separate negotiations, which were started in Madrid and are being dealt with separately from this conference. **********When the United States and the Soviet Union invited Arabs and Israelis to open direct peace talks in Madrid last October, the invitation included plans for a multinational conference that would follow two weeks later. It was also envisaged that it would be held in Moscow, but because of several technical problems it was delayed. **********In the meantime, the direct talks begun in Madrid between Israel and Jordan, Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and the Palestinians were followed up by two rounds in Washington, one in December and one in mid-January.  Moderation and Stubbornness **********Today's session was confined to 10-minute speeches by each country, and the Arab delegates made it immediately clear that they had no intention of engaging in any serious regional cooperation with Israel until the Palestinians were brought into the process and Israel agreed to trade land for peace with its immediate neighbors. **********Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, like all the Arabs present, gave a low-key, relatively moderate speech. He nevertheless captured the mood of the Arab delegations when he declared that no matter what statements were made here today, ""We cannot make or attain specific progress if Arab lands continue to be occupied and the Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their right of self-determination."" **********The speech by the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Levy, was also generally conciliatory, but made clear that Israel viewed regional cooperation with the Arab world as something that could and should progress independently of talks over territory with Israel's immediate neighbors. Levy, Alone **********None of the Arab ministers, save for Egypt, applauded Mr. Levy's speech, or spoke with him. The standoffishness was symbolized by Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, Chief of Planning for the Israeli Army and a member of the Israeli delegation, who was taking photographs with his Instamatic camera of Jordanians seated next to him, but was too uncertain to speak to them. **********The chilly atmosphere between Arabs and Israelis was inadvertantly summed up by Mr. Yang. Trying to express the idea that no one should expect progress overnight, he said: ""As the Chinese saying goes, 'It takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep.' "" Who Is a 'Palestinian'? **********The dispute that kept the Palestinians away is likely to bedevil this conference, as well as the separate Arab-Israeli negotiations. **********The Palestinians insist that their delegation be made up of a cross-section of their community: Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and from the refugee diaspora abroad. The Israelis insisted, and the United States and Russia backed them up, that the rules of the Madrid conference applied here, and therefore the only Palestinians with whom Israelis have to negotiate are Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza. **********The Palestinians countered that just because they had made a pragmatic compromise in Madrid, accepting Israel's terms in order to begin separate talks on Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, that did not mean that at this conference to discuss broader regional questions, they should make the same compromise. A Compromise Rejected, Twice **********Mrs. Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said during a news conference outside the conference hall: ""We wanted to address the world and speak out on behalf of all the Palestinians people, but unfortunately we were excluded."" **********At the eleventh hour, Mr. Baker offered the Palestinians a deal: He added refugees to the list of regional issues to be discussed in the working-group negotiations, which are to be set up tomorrow, and said the United States would back the Palestinians' demand to send diaspora representatives to such a session. The Palestinians said this was not enough. **********Mr. Levy immediately rejected this proposal, too, saying: ""If those whose participation we object to do arrive and if this runs counter to the agreement, they will meet by themselves.""                    --------------------       Protests Among Arabs **********BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- Syria condemned the talks in Moscow today, thousands of Palestinians in Lebanon went on strike demanding a boycott of the conference and pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalists staged sit-ins at mosques here to oppose what they termed ""the negotiations of capitulation."" **********The Syrian Information Minister, Mohammed Salman, said in an interview published in the Beirut daily Al Sharq that the talks would only play into Israel's hands. ""How can there be discussions on regional issues when no progress had been achieved at bilateral negotiations,"" he asked. **********Israel also announced that it was sending reinforcements to what it calls its security zone in southern Lebanon to head off what an army spokesman described as ""terrorist attacks"" and possible violence by guerrillas of the Iranian-sponsored Party of God. **********Fundamentalist soldiers of the ""Islamic Resistance Movement,"" led by the Party of God, killed one Israeli soldier and wounded another in a raid inside the zone last Sunday. **********Clerics who lead the Party of God told worshipers at a mosque in the Bir al Abed quarter in Beirut's southern suburbs that holy war ""against Israel and America must be stepped up."" Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the party's general secretary, said Israel and the United States would use the talks ""to tighten their hegemony over the Arab and Islamic worlds."" **********In Palestinian refugee districts in Lebanon, marchers protested and shops and schools were closed."

""People were skeptical of the report because the last report estimated demand one million barrels higher than it was."" **********January crude oil finished 14 cents lower at $18.94 a barrel. Oil products finished mixed. Heating oil for January delivery closed 0.08 cent lower at 54.22 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline for January delivery closed 0.12 cent higher at 51.42 cents a gallon. Further Fall Seen **********Mr. Yu, like other traders and analysts, predicted crude oil futures could fall further still. ""The market is oversupplied,"" he said. ""There's too much oil here and in Europe, and not enough demand or cold weather."" **********Oil futures have been tumbling all week amid disappointment that OPEC did not agree to larger production cuts for the first quarter when oil ministers met last week in Vienna. OPEC set a production ceiling of 24.9 million barrels a day, which was about 400,000 barrels short of expectations. Many traders expressed concern that OPEC would even adhere to the new quotas."

Coincidentally, two of the four executives whose pay is understated are Steven J. Ross and N. J. Nicholas Jr. Until this year, when Mr. Nicholas resigned, they were co-chief executives of Time-Warner, which publishes Fortune. **********For the 1990 rankings, the magazine decided it would count only one-third of the value of stock options worth more than $5 million, and it informed readers that the missing two-thirds would show up in 1991 and 1992. The policy, which pushed the four executives down in the 1990 rankings, was meant to reflect the long-term nature of such incentives. **********This year, however, the magazine's new compensation consultant, the Wyatt Company, decided that option grants should be recognized in the year of grant, no matter how large. And so instead of showing up as the second-highest-paid executive in 1991, Mr. Ross is No. 43."

That was 51 percent lower than net income of $17.9 million, or 17 cents a share, for the 1991 period. Tandem's revenues rose 3 percent, to $502.9 million from $489.3 million. **********Earnings were down from the 1991 quarter because the company's costs and expenses rose more than the modest gain in revenues, said George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in New York. **********Mr. Elling, who had expected earnings of up to 5 cents a share, said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about Tandem's report. **********Tandem, like other makers of large computers, was hurt by the recession. In the first quarter of 1992, Tandem lost $94.6 million after taking a $98 million charge for layoffs and other restructurings to help cut costs in an increasingly competitive market. **********""We are pleased that our efforts to restructure Tandem did not disrupt our business and are beginning to show results,"" said James G. Treybig, the president and chief executive. **********He said domestic business was up, suggesting that the United States recession may be dwindling, but business was mixed in Europe and down in Asia, usually a strong area for the company, he said."

That makes the campus an attractive target for many corporations. **********""It's a market that doesn't save,"" said Glenn Yago, vice president of corporate development for the American Passage Media Corporation, a Seattle marketing company. **********So now a handful of nimble marketing firms have sprung up to help large corporations maneuver on college campuses, following in the footsteps of unsuccessful efforts by Business Week and Newsweek, whose special campus editions failed. **********In the 1990-91 school year, companies spent a combined $140 million advertising on college campuses, according to Strategic Marketing Communications, a firm in Ridgewood, N.J. The advertisers included American Express, Citibank, Apple Computer and local pizza shops. **********About seven million students attend four-year colleges and five million more attend other colleges. They students' combined spending power is $30 billion, according to American Passage Media. The average student spends $135 a month on discretionary items. **********There is a dual rationale for pursuing students. Many students are good consumers in their school years; they are much more likely to own compact disk players than the general population and buy twice as many recordings as other consumers. Unencumbered by mortgages and children, many students spend freely on clothes, movies and potato chips. **********Then there is the ""leaders of tomorrow"" argument. Students will grow up and be rich and powerful and someday write memos ordering their corporation to buy only Apple Computers. **********Numerous marketing studies show that people tend to stick with the brands they begin using when they leave home and become independent for the first time. Winning over a consumer in college ""is a lot better than trying to convert them five years down the road when somebody else has their brand loyalty,"" said Stuart Himmelfarb, a vice president of the Roper Organization, a New York research company. **********In certain categories, students are big players. Credit card companies are currently the biggest marketers on campus. Virtually all creditworthy adults have at least one credit card, leaving college students as ""one of the few demographics left where you can put a new card in someone's wallet,"" said Carl Bryant, vice president of marketing for American Passage. The company estimates that about half of all credit cards issued each year go to college students. **********The recession has been felt on campuses, however. A study released earlier this month by Roper found that 54 percent of students have credit cards, down from 65 percent a year earlier. **********Still, the card companies have replaced Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing as the top spenders on campus. ""Beer marketers have largely abandoned the college demographic,"" Mr. Bryant said. ""It has become politically incorrect."" **********Phone companies, recruiters -- including the military -- and local pizza restaurants are other big college advertisers. **********Students, however, are harder to reach than those who trudge along in the broad grooves of the mainstream because they don't watch as much television and far less prime-time television. **********So companies like Whittle Communications in Knoxville, Tenn., and American Passage have devised numerous ways to get the attention of students. Whittle, which is broadcasting news and commercials in elementary schools, got its start publishing guides for bewildered freshman, new to the campus of the University of Tennessee. **********Now, each fall, the company distributes 1.2 million boxes, filled with shampoo, shaving cream and other personal-care products, to incoming freshman. Whittle is paid a fee from packaged good companies to include their products. **********On a stroll through campus, a student will unknowingly come upon advertising arranged by American Passage up to a dozen times. The company publishes the directory of classes for about 80 colleges. Corporations like Microsoft, the software giant, can arrange to have recruiting advertisements appear next to the listing of computer courses. **********American Passage also arranges to have advertising placed in college newspapers and supplies stands for distributing the newspapers.

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/20/business/the-executive-computer-zenith-looks-for-blue-skies-beyond-the-air-force-contract.html,Peter Lewis,1992-09-20,,1204,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,The Executive Computer; Zenith Looks for Blue Skies Beyond the Air Force Contract,The Executive Computer; Zenith Looks for Blue Skies Beyond the Air Force Contract," **********The news earlier this month that the Zenith Data Systems Corporation, a division of France's Groupe Bull, had won a $740 million Air Force contract for 300,000 desktop computers marked the third time in four recent Government contracts that Zenith caught the gold ring. **********While the final disposition of the contract is not yet certain -- the Air Force decision has been protested by the Compuadd Corporation of Austin, Tex. -- Zenith Data already holds 37 percent of the Federal personal computer market, based on machines now installed. Those contracts have provided the company with a solid base. **********But to flourish it must parlay its success in the Government sector into a greater share of the corporate computing market. It has taken a strong step in that direction with its newest machines, designated the Z-Station, Z-Server and Z-Note computer. **********""They're headed back,"" said Bruce A. Stephen, director of PC hardware research at the International Data Corporation, a market research company in Framingham, Mass. ""They've been through a down period, but I think with their recent improvements in products, this may help their cachet in the market."" **********Once the leader in portable computers, largely on the basis of earlier Government contracts, Zenith Data stumbled badly in the late 1980's. **********""Our market share calculations show them dropping from a 6.1 percent share of the Intel-based PC market in 1988 to 2.1 percent in 1991,"" said Michael K. Kwatinetz, a research analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, an investment research company in New York City. **********Significantly, Zenith Data won the latest Air Force contract on the basis of its standard business computers, not models specially modified for the military. Now the higher manufacturing volumes expected under the contract may help Zenith Data compete in the broader computer arena with its larger and richer rivals, Mr. Kwatinetz suggested. **********The Air Force contract, known as Desktop 4, was originally won by Compuadd and Sysorex Information Systems Inc. of Falls Church, Va. Zenith Data and several other losing bidders protested the award, claiming that the procedures had not been fair because in its attempt to expedite the decision the Air Force had knocked out all other bidders on the technical grounds. The Air Force agreed to reopen the competition, and Zenith Data won. **********Zenith Data executives bristle at talk of a ""comeback,"" noting their previous Government contracts. But there was a considerable gap between the second and third awards, and Zenith appeared to be catching some Z's rather than making them. Competition intensified, especially in the portable category from the Toshiba Corporation of Japan and the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston. Zenith did not respond. The period culminated with the sale of Zenith Data to Groupe Bull, which had previously acquired Honeywell Inc.'s operations in the United States. **********Once the sale was completed last year, Zenith Data got a new president, Enrico Pesatori, hired by Groupe Bull from Olivetti. He stepped on the gas, and Zenith Data completely overhauled and redesigned its line of desktop, server and portable computers. The new systems are very impressive. **********""They upped their R.&D. budget by 235 percent"" in the last year, said Mr. Stephen of International Data, ""and the fruits were the Z-Station and Z-Note lines. They're very ergonomically appealing and have good feature sets."" The Z-Station was introduced after Zenith bid on the Air Force contract, which it will fill with older models. **********More than any other company's line of products, the Zenith Data Z-Note and Z-Station computers are designed for use in a modern corporate environment: Each machine has built-in network connectors, can be fully upgraded to incorporate future technologies and has features making it easier to use. **********""They've had very aggressive rollouts both in the notebook and desktop arenas,"" said Randal A. Giusto, senior PC analyst for Workgroup Technologies Inc., a Hampton, N.H., research company. **********The Z-machines are also packaged in stylish new cases designed by Frog Design Inc., based in Menlo Park, Calif., that created the looks for Next Inc., Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems and several others. **********Attractive products, of course, are just one part of the success equation in today's PC industry. Zenith Data faces the challenges of the economy as well as the competition. **********""There's a price war going on, we're in the middle of a recession and corporate computer managers are cutting back on purchases,"" Mr. Giusto said. ""What you need to compete in the marketplace are low prices, attractive products, effective channels for distribution, and loyal resellers."" **********Zenith Data overhauled its distribution system earlier this year, and the best way to sum it up is that the company, based in the Chicago suburb of Buffalo Grove, Ill., will sell a computer any way a customer wants to order it up. **********The company has a network of authorized dealers; a direct sales force that works with large corporate, Government and education accounts, and now catalogue sales operation to satisfy customers who prefer to order equipment by phone. It also plans to start selling some models in computer and office supply stores. **********As of last week -- in the current climate prices can change week to week -- catalogue prices for the Z-Station desktop computers ranged from $1,699 for a 25-megahertz Intel 386SX model with an 80-megabyte hard disk, to $3,799 for a 66-megahertz i486DX model with 200 megabytes of storage. All models come with 4 megabytes of system memory. **********There are basically two different styles of Z-Station, a sleek ""pizza box"" unit with two internal expansion slots, and a larger four-slot model. The user can choose either the industry-standard architecture (ISA) slot configuration, which is suitable for most business applications, or the more powerful EISA (extended) configuration. **********The prices include built-in hardware and software for attaching the Z-Station to local area networks using the Ethernet system. More than half the computers used in businesses are now hooked to a network, making this a very important feature. **********The only catch is that there are three different types of physical wiring for Ethernet networks (thick, thin or twisted-pair), so a $99 adapter is needed to connect the Z-Station's network port to the proper wiring scheme. **********Another snazzy feature is the ease with which the computer can be upgraded. A single screw opens the case, and the internal components snap in and out without tools. **********Zenith Data is still more widely known for its portables, which fight in one of the most competitive arenas in the complicated computer industry. The new Z-Note notebook computer costs from $1,999 to $4,999, depending on features. Like the Z-Station, it comes with built-in networking and snap-in components. **********Perhaps the portables' slickest feature is an optional attachment called the Readydesk, a $149 device that weighs less than a pound and attaches to the back of the computer. The Readydesk has parallel and serial ports, two PS/2-type ports for attaching a mouse and a full-size keyboard, a monitor plug for using a color VGA desktop monitor, and an AC power plug -- all of which allow the Z-Note to be used on the desk and on the road with a minimum of hassles. **********Compared with some desktop ""docking stations"" used with other portables, the Readydesk is cheap and elegant."

The early 1992 burst of consumer spending has faded, and American consumers are reaching for their wallets not to spend but to pay off debts. ""There is a worrisome trend toward prudence,"" said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. **********Last week the Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit outstanding fell by $3.8 billion in April, the largest one-month decline since June 1980, when credit controls were crunching the economy. **********That is not, to put it mildly, the normal course of events after a recession ends. ""There is no past recovery where we can find this happening,"" said Susan Sterne of Economic Analysis Associates in Stowe, Vt. Ed Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said it is raising the chances of a ""triple-dip recession."" **********The weakness in credit creation has lasted longer than anyone expected. It used to be assumed that consumer credit always rose, no matter what. After all, the figure showed declines in just nine of the 120 months of the 1980's. So far in the 1990's, it is down for 14 of the 28 months reported. **********Until last week, analysts could at least take comfort from retail sales, which seemed to be moving along at adequate levels, if not at the smart pace of January. But the Commerce Department said, in effect, ""never mind,"" and revised downward the figures for February through April, at the same time announcing a puny 0.2 percent increase for May. **********Wall Street's reaction was to heave a sigh of relief. When stock prices slipped early last week, the seers somehow concluded that inflation fears might have something to do with it. But the evidence of a weakening economy reduced those fears, and, according to the Wall Street consensus, provided another reason for the Fed to cut interest rates. This generation's economic patent medicine, guaranteed to cure whatever ails you, is lower rates. **********In fact, lower interest rates may be part of the problem. With bank savings rates so low, the much higher rates on loans seem extortionate, and that may be discouraging some would-be borrowers. Or perhaps the trend reflects a demographic development, with the heavy-borrowing age group of 25- to 34-year-olds now declining for the first time since the 1950's. Maybe, suggests Ms. Sterne, ""the 1980's taught the consumer it was more rewarding to own financial assets than tangible assets. He would rather buy G.M.'s stock than its cars."" **********In the long run, it is probably good for Americans to save more and spend less. But for now the figures throw doubt on the belief that consumer confidence is growing, and they make a vigorous recovery appear even less likely. **********And that, in turn, makes it probable that most of this quarter's earnings surprises, unlike the first quarter's, will be the kind that make stockholders cry rather than cheer."

A senior Administration official said the sanctions, imposed by the United Nations in June and endorsed by the conference in London, had stopped about 80 percent of Serbia's imports. **********The official said that in an effort to increase this percentage, nine specialists in border traffic, including members of the United States Customs Service, would be sent to Romania and Hungary next week to assist in intercepting Serbia's imports, particularly oil, which is being smuggled by barge up the Danube to refineries in Serbia. **********In line with the London conference's call for protection of minorities in the region, two United States officials are to join international monitors in areas of Serbia with large minorities. These are Kosovo, the home of 1.7 million ethnic Albanians; Vojvodina, with 350,000 ethnic Hungarians and various other minorities, and the Sanjak, a region with more than 200,000 Muslims. **********Their task, the official said, will be to evaluate the threat posed by the Serbian nationalists in power in Belgrade and to report on attempts to drive the minority populations out of Serbia. **********In addition, the Administration has stationed an official in Macedonia, the southernmost former Yugoslav republic, to report on threats to its sovereignty. He is Robert Frowick, a retired ambassador with considerable experience in Eastern Europe; he arrived last week in Skopje, the capital. **********Warren Zimmermann, the last United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia, is to coordinate Washington's involvement in the Balkans. **********On leave from his new post as director of refugee programs at the State Department, Mr. Zimmermann is also Washington's representative on the 22-nation steering committee set up to implement the decisions taken in London. The committee, based in Geneva, is led by Cyrus R. Vance, a former Secretary of State, representing the United Nations, and Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, representing the European Community. **********A senior Administration official said stronger enforcement of sanctions is intended to increase pressure on the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic. The official said the Administration hoped this pressure would generate support for Milan Panic, a Serbian-born American businessman and opponent of Mr. Milosevic's policies who was named Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in July. **********Some Administration officials had dismissed Mr. Panic as a puppet of Mr. Milosevic. Now, they note with satisfaction that Mr. Panic has beaten back an effort by Milosevic supporters to oust him, has dismissed the chief of Mr. Milosevic's secret police and has forced the resignation of Vladislav Jovanovic, the Foreign Minister forced upon him by the Milosevic camp."

Van Caneghan, was among the strongest advocates for listing of the issue, PNF Industries, a manufacturer of flame retardants. The largest shareholder of PNF is Alfred Avasso, a convicted arsonist and a former Amex member who was barred from association with the exchange six years ago. Since Mr. Avasso's relationship with PNF was disclosed in July, the Amex has tried to have the company removed from the list and has begun an investigation of how it was accepted. **********Investigators for the exchange found that Mr. Van Caneghan had known Mr. Avasso and was aware of his connection to PNF but had not informed the exchange even as he lobbied for the listing, officials who were briefed on the preliminary findings said. **********The investigators also found that Mr. Van Caneghan had not disclosed that he had a personal financial relationship with Mr. Avasso, the officials said. They added that the details of that relationship were not fully disclosed but appear to involve loans between the two men. **********In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Van Caneghan acknowledged that he knows Mr. Avasso, saying he met him when both men worked on the Amex floor. He added that he had not known of problems with PNF before it was listed but declined to comment further. **********The Amex inquiry has not found any indication of illegal activity. But a range of officials, including other board members, expressed deep dismay that a governor had failed to stop a listing that has since become one of the most significant embarrassments to the exchange. **********The Emerging Company Marketplace was introduced in the spring with great fanfare by James Jones, the chairman of the exchange, who said he wanted to provide a marketplace for issues that did not meet the Amex's listing standards. These companies were portrayed as the future winners of the marketplace. **********But PNF derailed those hopes. **********An article in July in The Wall Street Journal detailed the background of Mr. Avasso and his run-ins with the law and securities regulators. In the Amex's investigation of PNF before its listing, Mr. Avasso's connection had not been noticed, and Mr. Van Caneghan had not disclosed it, Wall Street executives said. **********Wall Street executives who have spoken with Mr. Van Caneghan said he believed the other Amex governors were aware of Mr. Avasso's past and his relationship with PNF. **********Mr. Van Caneghan also might not have viewed Mr. Avasso's submission of falsified option orders, which led to his being barred from the exchange, as an irredeemable transgression: In 1977, without admitting or denying guilt, Mr. Van Caneghan and nine other traders consented to a finding by the Securities and Exchange Commission that they had engaged in fictitious options trades. Investigation Is Continuing **********The connection between Mr. Van Caneghan and Mr. Avasso first came to light after Mr. Jones ordered an internal review into the listing. The inquiry, which is still under way, is headed by Bevis Longstreth, another member of the board of governors who is a lawyer with Debevoise & Plimpton and a former S.E.C. commissioner. **********Along with Mr. Longstreth, the review is being conducted by other lawyers with Debevoise. They are charged with evaluating the policies and procedures for screening applicants for the Emerging Company Marketplace and examining the procedures as they were applied to PNF. **********The preliminary findings of the investigation were presented to the board of governors at a recent meeting. Sarah Luke, a spokeswoman for the Amex, said none of the exchange staff knew the contents of the report, and that Mr. Jones was the person most closely watching the inquiry. **********Mr. Jones was said to be unavailable for comment yesterday. A message left yesterday for Mr. Avasso at PNF in Upper Saddle River, N.J., was not returned. **********People who were briefed on the inquiry said they were shocked about the disclosure that Mr. Van Caneghan had known of Mr. Avasso's connection with Mr. Avasso but had said nothing about it."

But analysts said much of the gain came from cost-cutting, not real growth. **********William Leach, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the quality of Campbell's earnings was far weaker than the reported gain indicated. ""How they got there was not entirely satisfactory,"" he said. **********Analysts said earnings improvement came from keeping down expenses and a lower tax rate. By cutting costs, Cambpell's has reported a string of strong quarterly results, but Mr. Leach said yesterday, ""This probably marks the end of the 20 percent gains."" **********Third-quarter profits increased to $91.5 million, or 36 cents a share, from $76.4 million, or 30 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Sales rose 3 percent, to $1.54 billion, compared with $1.49 billion last year. Full-Year Earnings Estimates **********Based on yesterday's results, Mr. Leach slightly reduced his full-year earnings estimates for Campbell's to $1.87 a share. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, Campbell's shares slipped 75 cents yesterday, to $33.625. **********The company said frozen food sales were down substantially for the quarter as a result of heavy price competition in the category. Earnings were also lower because of heavy marketing support behind the national introduction of LeMenu New American Cuisine dinners and the introduction of other new products in the Swanson line. **********David W. Johnson, president and chief executive of Campbell, said, ""This was a very good quarter considering the recession and generally drab competitive results."" He said the company's soup business grew strongly in the United States, Canada and Britain. Soup volume in North America gained 11 percent, bolstered in part by the acquisition of Sanwa Foods. **********""We continue to spend aggressively on both advertising and promotion to support a wide array of new product initiatives,"" Mr. Johnson said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/15/business/gm-and-its-union-plan-to-encourage-early-retirements.html,Doron Levin,1992-12-15,,891,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,G.M. AND ITS UNION PLAN TO ENCOURAGE EARLY RETIREMENTS,G.M. AND ITS UNION PLAN TO ENCOURAGE EARLY RETIREMENTS," **********The United Automobile Workers union agreed today to a set of sweeping early-retirement incentives for hourly workers at the General Motors Corporation, signaling that the union recognizes the gravity of the auto maker's problems. **********The incentives come as the No. 1 auto maker is feverishly cutting costs, closing plants and shrinking itself over all to regain its financial health. All told, the company has announced plans to close nearly two dozen car and parts-making plants over the next several years and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs, the bulk of which are held by union members. **********It was not immediately clear how many G.M. workers would elect to retire early, but the package of incentives is one way the auto maker hopes to shrink its hourly work force about 13 percent, to around 250,000 employees by 1995, from 288,000 now. Thousands Took Previous Offer **********In 1990, the last time the company offered early-retirement incentives to blue-collar employees, about 7,000 workers accepted a different plan. Under the latest plan, only older workers with at least 10 years of seniority may qualify. **********The agreement to pay G.M. workers to retire early -- and the union's acceptance of the terms -- tacitly acknowledges that the auto maker believes it cannot afford the $3 billion of job-security benefits it negotiated with the union in the 1990 contract. **********With that accord, negotiated under the supervision of Robert C. Stempel, who was then the chairman and chief executive, G.M. workers in effect were promised they would receive almost full salary whether or not there was work for them. G.M. now has more than 37,000 workers on layoff, or about 13 percent of its blue-collar workers. Financed From Training Fund **********The latest incentives will be financed with as much as $450 million of a $600 million fund previously set aside by G.M. and the union for training programs. The spending will not require a new charge to the company's earnings.  The money was set aside under the terms of the current labor agreeement as a job-security measure to retrain workers. Although the incentives will use money that might have gone to such training programs, the union said ""sufficient funds will remain to insure full operation"" of such programs. **********Officially, the company declined to say how many workers were eligible for the new plan, but financial analysts said they had been told by the company that between 5,000 and 10,000 workers were expected to take the offer. **********Today's agreement is a small but positive sign that relations are amiable between John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive who took over in early November, and Stephen Yokich, a vice president of the union who is its chief negotiator with General Motors. **********Last summer G.M. endured a series of local labor walkouts, raising doubts whether the leadership of the auto maker and the union were on good terms as the two sides wrestled with G.M.'s problems and approached negotiations for a new labor contract next summer. **********""We have said all along that we sought a problem-solving relationship with G.M. management, and this agreement demonstrates that we can work together to address the challenges faced by the union and the corporation,"" Mr. Yokich said today.  He explained the agreement to about 300 representatives of G.M. locals today in Dearborn, Mich.; a ratification vote is not required. **********Gerald A. Knechtel, G.M. vice president of personnel, said today, ""We commend Steve Yokich and the U.A.W. for their cooperation and efforts in structuring this agreement."" **********Mr. Stempel apparently believed in 1990 that the car market would have picked up by now and he was confident that he could expand G.M's business prospects and revenues and limit layoffs. But financial disaster struck G.M.'s North American operations in 1990, 1991 and the first three quarters of this year as more than $12 billion in pretax losses piled up. **********Mr. Stempel, who one year ago announced the closing of almost two dozen plants and a plan to eliminate more than 70,000 jobs, resigned under fire in late October. **********One group eligible for incentives is G.M. workers 62 or older, who are scheduled to retire in the spring. Each worker would receive full pension and health care benefits, plus a $10,000 voucher toward the purchase of a new G.M. car and $3,000 to help pay income tax on the voucher. **********The second group eligible is workers age 50 to 61 with 10 or more years of service. They would receive full pension benefits but no voucher for a car. They would, however, be allowed to earn as much as they could at other jobs without facing the pension reductions that the contract now specifies for retirees who get such income. **********Today's agreement covers active G.M. workers, including about 7,000 on temporary layoff. **********Also eligible are 20,500 workers in a ""jobs bank,"" people whose last job has been eliminated and are doing community service or working in nonautomotive jobs, but drawing full pay from G.M. Workers on extended layoff -- those who have no definite return date and are not part of the jobs bank -- are not eligible. A G.M. spokesman said about 10,000 workers were in that category."

The new talks will include even hard-line unionists who bitterly opposed any talks with Dublin the last time around. **********The only major Northern Irish party that will not be allowed to attend is Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A., which refuses to renounce violence in its campaign to end British rule. **********Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, announced the breakthrough after meeting in Belfast with leaders of the four Northern Irish parties taking part. The Governments hope the North-South talks will breathe life into negotiations in the province on setting up a broadly based regional government to supplant direct rule from London."

Israeli Welcomes Discussion **********Avi Pazner, Israel's Ambassador to Italy and a participant in today's talks, said, ""It's an important day for us because it's the first time that the Vatican says publicly that it's ready to discuss diplomatic relations with Israel."" But he made clear some issues were not open to negotiation. **********""The Vatican has certain interests in Jerusalem -- convents and holy places,"" Mr Pazner said. ""But the status of Jerusalem is not an issue. That's not going to be discussed. Period."" **********The diplomat seemed to indicate, however, that the Vatican's broader concerns would figure in the talks. ""We will discuss all issues and what's of special concern to Israel is the agreement to discuss diplomatic relations,"" he said. **********Since Israel's founding in 1948, the Vatican has resisted full diplomatic relations, citing over the years its concern for the plight of Palestinians, worries about free access to all holy places and the question of Israel's 1980 annexation of East Jerusalem, which the Roman Catholic Church does not acknowledge.  Mideast Talks Ease Concerns **********The Vatican has also shied away from full relations for fear of endangering minority Catholic communities in Muslim countries and of alienating Catholics among the Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Some of those worries have eased with the United States diplomacy that has brought Arab, Palestinian and Israeli officials into direct negotiations. **********""When the Palestinians or some Arabs of the area have been sitting down around the table with the Israeli authorities, no concern can be found when we begin official conversations with the state of Israel,"" Mr. Navarro-Valls said in answer to a reporter's question. **********The creation of the new commission, Vatican officials said, reflects the Catholic Church's concern to have full access to all sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict as peace efforts continue and the Vatican seeks a voice in the future of sites sacred to the three great monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. **********""It's more than likely that the pace of things will reflect the pace of the peace process as a whole,"" said Rabbi David Rosen, interfaith director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith in Jerusalem. **********Mr. Navarro-Valls acknowledged that peace efforts had helped inspire ""a disposition"" to open formal contacts, but insisted the timing was not related to either the United States-sponsored talks or Israel's recent change of Government. ""Contacts started before the peace process,"" he said. Vatican Envoy in Jerusalem **********While the Catholic Church has long recognized Israel's right to exist within secure borders, the Vatican is represented in Jerusalem only by an Apostolic Delegate, a church emissary appointed to deal only with church matters but not accredited to the Israeli Government. For its part, Israel maintains a small office attached to its embassy in Rome to look after its dealings with the Vatican. **********If diplomatic relations were established, it would permit Pope John Paul II to fulfil a long-standing ambition to journey to Jerusalem. Pope Paul VI visited the Holy Land in 1964, three years before the 1967 war that led to Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem."

In fact, the name ""sick building syndrome"" has been given to an array of symptoms among office workers that are sometimes associated with indoor pollution. **********In part, the problem can be attributed to the increased energy efficiency of modern buildings. Because of better insulation and a tendency to let in less fresh air, the air becomes stale and contaminants linger. The latest standards recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning require four times as much outside air as older standards. The challenge is to improve air quality without increasing energy bills as fresh air is brought into the building. **********Semco Manufacturing Inc. of Columbia, Mo., has developed what it describes as a total energy recovery system. The system uses a rotating ""wheel"" that consists of an aluminum framework coated with a ""molecular-sieve"" desiccant material, which attracts water vapor. The molecular sieve is a powdery ceramic material able to separate molecules based on their size. **********The company says the system provides selective adsorption in which airborne contaminants are allowed to pass through unadsorbed, while water vapor is captured from the exhaust stream. The water vapor is transferred from the exhaust airstream and mixed with the fresh air from the outside. **********Michael L. Boles, Semco's product manager for systems, said the system ""transfers temperature and moisture in the most beneficial direction."" Thus, in the winter, the warm water vapor that is mixed with the fresh air from outside reduces the extent that outside air must be heated and humidified. Similarly, in the summer the molecular sieve transfers heat and moisture from the outside air, reducing the cooling and dehumidification required in the building. **********Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta have conducted tests that introduced high levels of pollutants on the exhaust side of the recovery system and concluded that the Semco system's wheel did not transfer measurable amounts of pollutants into the incoming air. The researchers said their tests of Semco's system showed that it was possible to increase the fresh-air ventilation in a building without significantly increasing the amount of energy used."

""There is no handling whatsoever, no mention whatsoever, of the word 'withdrawal.' "" **********He said that there might be elements in the Israeli paper that would appeal to Syria and that he wanted time to study it. But he said no document could be acceptable without dealing with Syria's fundamental desire for a complete Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war. **********""It is not very encouraging,"" Mr. Allaf said. ""It is not serious. But from there to say there is a deadlock, I cannot say that."" **********Israeli officials said their paper was being submitted as a framework for the talks. The Syrians have already presented one of their own. **********The Israeli paper contains three parts. **********The introduction was the Israeli vision of peace with Syria. **********The second part proposed the terms under which such a peace would be made. In that section the Israelis said United Nations Resolution 242, with its ""territorial dimension,"" would apply to any Israeli-Syrian peace settlement. That was a strong hint that the Israelis were ready for at least a partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights. **********The third part of the paper was a proposed agenda for the negotiations. **********The talks resumed today after a 10-day recess during which the parties consulted with their Governments. The current round of negotiations is scheduled to end Sept. 24. **********Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, said that this document was only a draft and that his country was open to reformulating parts of it, provided the Syrians addressed the points important to Israel. **********Speaking in Jerusalem this morning, before the start of today's talks, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made clear what those points were. He said withdrawal from the annexed Golan Heights would not be considered by Israel until the real terms of a peace accord with Syria become clear. **********He also stressed that any peace treaty with Syria would have to ""stand on its own"" and could not be linked to progress in talks with other Arabs, including the Palestinians, the Jordanians or the Lebanese. **********""As long as these two issues will not become clear to us, we will not enter into any territorial discussions,"" Mr. Rabin told the Israeli radio. **********""The purpose of the peace negotiations between our two delegations, the Israeli and Syrian, is to achieve a peace treaty: that is to say, open boundaries, diplomatic relations, embassies, normalization of relations. And, second, that a peace will stand on its own feet and will not be dependent on what will be achieved or will not be achieved in the other circles of the Arab-Israeli conflict on which we negotiated with different delegations."" **********Israeli officials who spoke on condition of not being identified have said that over the last few weeks, Israel sent messages to Syria through various parties saying it needed a ""public assertion"" by President Hafez al-Assad of Syria's willingness to negotiate a complete peace accord with Israel, suggesting that it would respond to this with a pledge to withdraw from at least part of the Golan Heights. **********Such an assertion was made publicly by Mr. Assad in a speech Wednesday."

In one current instance, at least, the answer seems to be yes. **********New advertising for Quaker Rice Cakes is helping the Quaker Oats Company to achieve strong gains in sales volume and market share, by reshaping longstanding negative attitudes about how the product tastes. **********""I don't think it was any secret that rice cakes had become the butt of a lot of jokes about tastelessness,"" Tricia Magel, vice president and account director at Berry-Brown Advertising, the Quaker Rice Cakes agency, said in a telephone interview from Dallas. **********""What we found in consumer research was that people who tried and rejected rice cakes felt they tasted like Styrofoam or cardboard,"" she said. ""And even if people had not tried rice cakes, that was what they thought."" **********Julie Vogel, assistant brand manager for Quaker Rice Cakes in Chicago, said Quaker hoped the introduction in the late 1980's of flavored rice cakes, in a variety of flavors like buttered popcorn, apple cinnamon, white cheddar cheese and nacho corn, would ""bring back the lost users."" **********And to a large degree, she added, that was what happened, as the line's sales climbed 25 percent, to $138 million, from July 1990 through June 1992. **********Still, she continued, ""people who hadn't tried rice cakes still thought they tasted bad"" -- a serious problem, given that a fundamental goal was to move rice cakes more into the mainstream, by converting skeptical nonusers. Ms. Magel mentioned another problem: research had determined consumer awareness of flavored rice cakes was low. **********So out went print advertisements that Ms. Vogel said featured ""pictures of women on a beach looking really skinny, sort of along the lines of old Tab commercials."" In their place, Berry-Brown created ads that presented an arresting image of a foam cup with a piece bitten out. **********""If this is what you think of rice cakes,"" the headline read, ""wait till you taste 'em now."" **********""Before this campaign broke,"" Ms. Magel said, ""we tested it versus a campaign that delivered a strong taste message without the comparison -- and people didn't believe it."" **********For all the effect of Berry-Brown's campaign, both the agency and Quaker hastened to add that their efforts to alter consumer perceptions were strengthened mightily by the success of an additional flavor, caramel corn, introduced in the spring. **********Quaker Caramel Corn Corn Cakes, as they are redundantly named on the package, have 50 calories a cake, compared with 35 for varieties like plain and buttered popcorn, but they offer the taste of caramel popcorn without fat or cholesterol. (Bruce Poole, Quaker's general manager of light snacks, ascribed that to the ability of flavor houses ""to extract the flavor of butter from butter without taking the fat with it."") **********A print ad for the new variety shows kernels of caramel popcorn spilling out of an old-fashioned, brightly striped tin. ""Remember the taste of caramel popcorn?"" the headline reads. ""We do, too (but we forgot the calories)."" **********Ms. Vogel said that the caramel corn flavor ""has really been blowing off the shelves,"" adding that it is already the nation's best-selling variety of rice cakes. The new flavor fueled a 55 percent increase, to $6.7 million, in Quaker's rice-cake sales in the last four weeks, she continued -- an outstanding feat in a rather prosaic product category. **********What Quaker and Berry-Brown have been able to accomplish also appears to go beyond getting consumers to scribble ""Quaker Rice Cakes"" on their shopping lists. **********Chico-San, the nation's No. 2 rice-cake marketer behind Quaker, has quietly changed advertising agencies. Effective June 1, Chico-San's parent, the H. J. Heinz Company, moved its account to the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago from Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston."

Many more are believed to be buried under the mudslide or to have been swept away in the Tipuani River running next to the camp. Officials said there were as many as 130 injured. **********The mudslide struck the town of Llipi, about 45 miles northwest of here, at about 5 A.M. Monday. A wall of mud that civil defense workers said was as high as 35 feet buried the village and pushed houses into the Tipuani River. Torrential rains were said to be the cause of the slide and had greatly swollen the river. **********""The camp disappeared totally,"" said Jesus Mantilla, general secretary of the local miners union, who had been in radio contact with the town. ""None of the houses were left."" Road Links Are Poor **********Although Llipi is only 90 miles from La Paz, it is in a region so remote that it is a 15- to 20-hour drive from the capital. Even landing strips in the area are hours away by truck over poor roads. **********The first Government plane flew over the site early this morning, and rescue operations were just beginning this afternoon. The Government is relying primarily on a small fleet of helicopters to bring in supplies and remove the wounded. **********Civil defense officials said they could not account for 90 percent of the residents of Llipi, which could mean that more than a thousand people perished. Officials warned it was too early to have an idea of the total number of deaths. **********The miners were part of the Llipi Limited Cooperative, a typical small mining operation in the country's mountainous region that work in crude, often dangerously built mines. **********The Government and local rescue workers are being hindered by the fact that they really don't know the identities of the miners that were working in the mine and their families present at the time of the mudslide. **********The mining cooperative official said that there were more than 300 families in the area and estimated that the population was at least 1,200. **********This afternoon the air force announced that there were 17 bodies had been identified, 46 people were known to have disappeared and at least another 200 were unaccounted for whose names are not known. **********""Practically the entire camp has been swept away,"" said Gen. Darto Gomez Garcia, commander of the Bolivian air force, after he had toured the area. ""Some escaped because they were working on the night shift and others because they got up out of bed when they heard the roar of the avalanche."" **********But General Gomez said it would be days before the number of dead would be known. View From the Air **********In a flight over the area, the tin roofs of the tiny adobe and wood homes were visible strewn around the area, and debris filled the river banks. One bulldozer was clearing away the debris to uncover victims. **********It was evident from the scarred mountains for miles along one side of the Tipuani River that the subsoil is little more than loose red clay. When soaked with water, the barren soil readily falls in an avalanche. **********Reflecting the precariousness of the rescue effort, in which vehicles have to travel miles of dirt mountain roads, a pickup truck bringing supplies to Llipi went over the side of a cliff this afternoon into the river. Ten of the 20 passengers riding on top were killed. **********Residents of Guanay, another town on the banks of the Tipuani River, said that only a few trucks had passed today with supplies and relief workers. **********It was clear that Bolivia's meager fleet of helicopters and rescue vehicles would take days to mount a full rescue effort. The air force had to bring in most of its helicopters from around the country to begin rescue operations. By this evening residents along the river said they had only seen two helicopters in the area."

Experts now say overall insured losses from the storm will probably rise from the original $7.3 billion to between $10 and $15 billion. Rise in Premiums Possible **********Although Allstate has adequate capital to pay its claims, the high losses of the nation's two largest insurers of cars and homes, State Farm and Allstate, indicate a growing likelihood, some analysts said, of increases in premiums for consumers in those personal types of insurance. State Farm has estimated its losses from the hurricane at $1.5 billion. **********Allstate, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company, said in its announcement yesterday that it had correctly estimated that it would receive about 159,000 claims, but that it underestimated the severity of losses to homes and interiors. Kathleen Hogan, a company spokeswoman, said recurrent rains after the hurricane had significantly increased damage. **********""From a financial standpoint we are a very solid company with more than adequate surplus for catastrophes like Andrew,"" said Wayne E. Hedien, Allstate's chairman and chief executive. **********Last week, Sears said it planned to make an initial public offering next year of 20 percent of Allstate's shares as part of a plan to spin off all of the parent company's financial services operations. **********William B. Bitterly, an analyst with Northington Partners in Avon, Conn., an institutional investor specializing in insurance issues, said the additional losses for Allstate probably would not have a major impact on the price of the Sears offering. Allstate will lose the investment income from the $500 million in additional losses, which will have an impact on earnings, he said. But he added that Allstate had benefited from higher prices and fewer losses in its personal automobile insurance business in the last 18 months. **********The big question hanging over the property and causualty industry these days is whether the psychological shock from Hurricane Andrew in combination with the losses of capital to major insurers will force them to start raising rates in commercial lines of insurance, where competition has kept prices low. **********A tightening of that market in the mid-1980's brought sharply higher prices for businesses and even for government institutions like schools and day-care centers. Analysts remain divided over whether such a ""hard market"" is in the offing."

Shearson holds a big stake in First Capital's parent. **********The plan requires the approval of the Los Angeles County Superior Court. **********""We have a rehabilitation plan that protects every policyholder dollar,"" said John Garamendi, the California Insurance Commissioner, who made the announcement in New York with Shearson executives. The plan, he said, ""provides the greatest possible value for all the company's policyholders."" **********But policyholders would face restrictions on withdrawals for a number of years. Those who wish to surrender, or cash in, their life insurance policies must wait five years to receive 100 percent of their value. **********""This is not attractive for many customers,"" said Joseph Belth, a professor of insurance at Indiana University and editor of a national newsletter, The Insurance Forum. ""They will have to take a choice between taking a substantial loss immediately or having their money tied up for several years."" **********At the time it was seized, on May 15, First Capital had assets of $4.5 billion. It has 190,000 life insurance policyholders and 62,000 annuity holders in 49 states. A Stake of 28% **********Shearson is the largest investor in First Capital Holdings, the insurer's parent, with 28 percent of its stock. The bailout is intended to protect Shearson customers, who bought the bulk of the First Capital Life policies, as well as shield Shearson from potentially large lawsuits. **********Policyholders who decide to surrender their policies before the rehabilitation plan starts will receive 75 percent of their value, according to Shearson's chairman, Howard L. Clark. **********Those who decide to keep their policies now but cash out before the end of five years will be penalized. Policyholders will receive 75 percent for cashing out in the first year, with the percentage increasing to 95 percent for selling in the fifth year. **********More than 36,000 First Capital Life policyholders canceled their contracts between Jan. 1, 1990, and last May 13, when the insurer was seized. In an unprecedented move, the plan allows for those customers to reinstate their policies or, in some cases, to recover a portion of the surrender charges they paid. **********Policyholders who choose to turn their contracts into annuities will be required to receive payment over at least a seven-year period and will receive an interest rate of at least 4 percent."

W. de Klerk of South Africa with a red-carpet welcome today on the first visit by a South African head of state to black-ruled Africa's most populous and wealthiest nation. The visit represents the most significant stride forward for Pretoria in its campaign to win acceptance from the rest of the continent. **********Mr. de Klerk flew into this newly established capital at the invitation of President Ibrahim Babangida, who made the gesture after South Africa's whites voted in a referendum three weeks ago to support Mr. de Klerk's efforts to dismantle the nation's apartheid system of strict racial segregation and pursue negotiations to grant South Africa's black majority a share of power. Mr. Babangida has been a leader in black-ruled Africa's campaign against Pretoria for its racial policies. **********The symbolism of the visit here was all the more important because President Babangida is also the head of the Organization of African Unity, which includes all the nations of the continent except for South Africa. **********Mr. de Klerk's visit also follows an announcement earlier this week that the Ivory Coast was establishing full diplomatic relations with South Africa as part of the broader reconciliation with a country long regarded as a continent's pariah. **********Though Mr. de Klerk's two-day trip to Abuja was presented as a simple working visit, he was greeted this afternoon with the formalities accorded an official state visit, including a military honor guard and band at the airport, a 21-gun salute and a formal state banquet tonight. **********The red-carpet reception given President de Klerk had to be particularly meaningful for both visitors and hosts who were mindful of the years that Nigeria stood at the forefront of international opposition to apartheid. **********""Today we welcome you as the man who closed the book of apartheid,"" President Babangida said in a toast to Mr. de Klerk at the banquet tonight. Mr. Babangida spoke of Mr. de Klerk's ""courage and determination"" and put the leader of South African's white minority government in the same category as black leaders like Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu and the late Steven Biko, the black South African dissident whose death in prison became a rallying point for opponents of apartheid around the world. **********""History has kept us apart for many reasons for many decades,"" replied President de Klerk, without referring specifically to apartheid. ""Tonight we can say that the barriers of history have been broken down."" **********Mr. de Klerk stressed that his country wanted to be accepted as part of Africa and urged Nigeria to join it in cooperating in the economic development of the continent. President de Klerk's visit to Nigeria, his 12th to another African country, now appears to have shattered the isolation that the rest of the continent imposed on South Africa because of apartheid. **********This morning, before Mr. de Klerk's arrival, Roelof F. Botha, South Africa's Foreign Minister for 15 years, began talks with his Nigerian counterpart, Ike Nwachukwu, and told him, ""This is the most important visit of my career outside my country."" **********Mr. de Klerk previously met Mr. Babangida at ceremonies in Namibia when that former South African colony gained its independence in March 1990. An invitation to Mr. de Klerk to visit Nigeria had been under discussion and was issued after the referendum in South Africa on March 17. **********The issues expected to be discussed by the South African and Nigerian Presidents go beyond bilateral relations, which have not officially existed. They include the question of South Africa's admission to the Organization of African Unity, of which President Babangida is chairman, and the role both countries can play in promoting Africa's economic development. **********The South African Government regards Nigeria as one of four regional powerhouses in Africa. The others are Kenya, which President de Klerk visited last June, Egypt, which he hopes to visit, and South Africa itself. **********But Nigeria, with a population approaching 90 million and an economy sustained by oil production, has been considered the key to South Africa's acceptance by the rest of the continent. **********South Africa now maintains diplomatic links, most of them under the guise of trade or other informal missions, with about 20 African countries. But only two, Malawi and the Ivory Coast, have exchanged formal diplomatic recognition. **********While South Africa's trade with other African countries has reached about $4 billion a year, Mr. Botha told journalists last night that trade with Nigeria totaled just $4.4 million last year. **********""For the two economic giants of Africa there is vast potential for trade,"" Mr. Botha said. **********While the Nigerians made Mr. de Klerk welcome here, they have not hidden their wish that he move faster on ending white rule at home. **********""We are pleased with the progress so far,"" Mr. Nwachukwu said to Mr. Botha, ""but we perceive a quicker progress is needed."" **********Nigeria's newspapers have greeted the visit cautiously. One, the National Concord, said Mr. de Klerk was entitled to ""a handshake, not an embrace."" **********""Time was when any dealings with South Africa were considered an abomination,"" wrote Sully Abu, a columnist for The Guardian, another Nigerian newspaper. But times have so changed, Mr. Abu said, ""that a South African President is actually here in flesh and blood, walking the red carpet and being wined and feted by a Nigerian leader."""

The scenario predicted by the House Banking Committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez; Ross Perot, and other influential figures was of a December surprise. They warned about an avalanche of bank failures, concealed by regulators and set off by new rules that take effect on Dec. 19 and require tougher and swifter action against the weakest banks. **********But the deluge is turning out to be more of a trickle. **********""The sky is not falling,"" said Andrew C. Hove Jr., chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But while many bankers are celebrating the fact there will be relatively few casualties, regulators and some lawmakers are still keeping their champagne bottles corked. They acknowledge it will be hard to repeat this year's record profits and point to California and the Northeast as signs that significant parts of the industry are still in for rough times. **********On the whole, though, 1992 has been a remarkable year for most banks. **********Reaping an unanticipated windfall from the lowest interest rates in decades, many of the nation's banks, large and small, have been strengthening their balance sheets. Such steps have been taken not only to avoid the wrath of the regulators, but also to take advantage of special new benefits for being strong, like lower deposit insurance premiums. **********At the same time, the regulators have managed to avoid a raft of December and January failures by already taking over some of the sicker and larger institutions, including the Meritor Savings Bank of Philadelphia; the Heritage Bank for Savings in Holyoke, Mass.; the Howard Savings Bank of Newark, and the First City Bancorporation of Texas. **********As a result, at latest count by both Washington officials and outside analysts, only about two dozen bank companies holding about $2.5 billion fall below the new guidelines requiring that they have shareholder capital of more than 2 percent of assets. These banks are ripe to be seized in the next few days unless they are somehow able to raise more money or persuade regulators to give them more time. **********An additional 136 banks with assets of $36 billion are in the second-worst category and will require closer regulatory attention and possible seizure farther down the road, but not immediately. This is from an industry of more than 11,000 institutions holding assets of more than $3 trillion. **********And regulators are revising their estimates of bank failures for 1993 and 1994. The new projections are expected to show marked improvements over earlier forecasts. **********Some industry problems still lurk on the horizon, however. **********Slumping real estate markets in California have shown few signs of bottoming out. The Northeast continues to suffer from economic problems like high office vacancy rates that are still taking a toll on the banks. **********The number of banks, particularly large ones, on the closely watched ""problem list"" has been declining very slowly and still constitutes about 15 percent of the industry. Completing the savings and loan bailout will still require at least an additional $45 billion to $50 billion in new spending to shut down institutions and provide seed money for the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which protects depositors of failed institutions. **********And any jump in interest rates could cause a new round of serious problems for even more profitable banks, many of which have been booking profits by buying Treasury securities whose values would plummet if rates rise. Interest Rate Trap **********The concern is that the banks, by locking themselves into long-term fixed investments, could be devastated if inflation accelerates and forces them to borrow money at higher rates than their investments. That is precisely what happened to the savings and loan industry in the 1980's. **********""It's impressive that the banks have the highest capital ratios since 1966, but there are still dichotomies within the industry,"" said Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who was recently selected ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee. ""Strong banking is in inverse proportion to proximity to the coast, and to some degree, by size of institution."" **********He and other lawmakers expressed particular concern about any increase in the Federal deficit, which could provoke interest rates to rise and begin to take bank profits, and even some banks, down. **********Mr. Hove of the F.D.I.C. said that while the regulators were closely watching the exposure of banks to swings in interest rates, he believed the industry was in no immediate danger. He said that about 1,200 banks, holding 10 percent of the industry's assets, have 20 percent or more of their investments in fixed-rate instruments of five years or longer. **********""That shows those banks have a 20 percent exposure, but it also means that they do not have an exposure for the other 80 percent of their investments,"" he said. **********He also said that because the industry would have its best year since records were compiled in the Great Depression, the $5.5 billion deficit of the bank insurance fund, which protects depositors, would doubtless improve by the end of the year."

Corn for July closed at $2.61 a bushel, up 1 1/2 cents. Oats for July settled at $1.51 1/2 a bushel, up 3 3/4 cents. **********Commercial interests and commodity funds were large buyers of most grain and soybean futures, said Roy Huckabay, an analyst with Linnco Futures in Chicago. Wheat Counters Trend **********Wheat for July moved in the opposite direction, falling 0.75 cent, to $3.62 3/4. The July contract was hurt by speculation that Russian exports would slow. The May contract, however, gained 5 1/4 cents, to $3.84 1/2 a bushel, bolstered by exports that were already scheduled for shipment. **********At the New York Cotton Exchange, cotton for July surged in reaction to forecasts for dry, hot weather across the Delta, particularly the northern Delta, said Sharon Johnson, a cotton specialist with Cargill Investor Services in Atlanta. July cotton rose 1.93 cents, to 62.55 cents a pound. **********At the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy futures slipped. **********Oil for delivery in June settled 0.2 cent lower, to $20.76 a gallon. Unleaded gasoline for June lost 1.11 cents, to 63.71 cents. **********A larger-than-expected drop in distillate stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute after the close of trading today limited losses in heating oil, with June heating oil closing 0.31 cent lower, to 57.21 cents a gallon. **********Coffee for July delivery rose modestly after news that the board of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute had voted to suspend coffee exports for two or three weeks. July coffee closed 0.8 cent higher at 63.75 cents a pound at the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. The gains were limited because the move was seen as symbolic and unlikely to affect long-term prices. **********Orange juice for July rose amid anticipation that supplies would be tight this summer, with Brazil's harvest already delayed. July orange juice rose 3.05 cents, to 132.95 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/11/business/greenspan-asks-pause-in-stimulus.html,David Rosenbaum,1992-01-11,,1127,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Greenspan Asks Pause In Stimulus,Greenspan Asks Pause In Stimulus," **********Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that he expected the steep cut in interest rates that the Fed ordered last month to be sufficient to get an economic recovery started and that he did not foresee a need for further rate cuts or for budgetary stimulus. **********""That is my expectation; that is my best judgment,"" Mr. Greenspan said in answer to questions from sharply critical Democratic senators. **********But he said the economic circumstances today were extraordinary, unlike any he had witnessed in his four decades as an economist, so he could not be sure he would not have to change his mind as the year wore on. Unusually Large Cuts **********This was the first time Mr. Greenspan was questioned in public since the Federal Reserve reduced the interest rates it controls on Dec. 20. The unusually large one-day steps pushed the rates to their lowest levels since the 1960's. **********A one-percentage-point cut in the discount rate to 3 1/2 percent and a half-point drop in the Federal funds rate to 4 percent were possible, Mr. Greenspan said, because inflation was under control. The discount rate, largely symbolic, is what the Fed charges banks for loans. The Federal funds rate, the benchmark for other short-term rates, is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. **********The Fed chairman said he believed the new low rates, as they worked their way through the economy -- ""the pipeline,"" as he called it -- would lead to new stock offerings and lower bond rates. That would mean individuals and companies were working down their debts and should mean a sustained recovery this year, he added. **********Mr. Greenspan testified before a joint session of the Senate Banking and Budget Committees. Congress is in recess, and only a few senators, mostly Democrats, showed up. Attack White House Efforts **********But the Democrats who did -- Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Alan J. Dixon of Illinois -- used Mr. Greenspan as a prop for another public attack on the Bush Administration's economic policies. **********The Democrats are advocating tax cuts and spending increases to give the economy a quick jolt. Mr. Greenspan said such steps would be unwise because once budgetary discipline was breached, it would be difficult to ""rein in"" and would ""create problems for the economy over the longer term."" **********Mr. Greenspan is held in high regard in Congress because of his economic expertise and his patient and respectful temperament. But today, for one of the first times in his more than four years as head of the central bank, he was under fire from the lawmakers. **********Senator Sasser blamed the Fed for causing the recession, saying it had kept interest rates too high for too long, and declared, ""I think it's time for the Fed to be at least as forthright in fighting recession as it has been in fighting inflation."" **********Senator Riegle said that it was fine to worry about the long term but that ""people have to survive in the short term."" **********And Senator Sarbanes declared, ""The Fed has not moved quickly enough and far enough in monetary policy to address the short-term problem."" Bobs and Weaves **********In his characteristically pedagogic manner, Mr. Greenspan responded softly to each wave of attack, saying that there was ""an awful lot of monetary stimulus in the pipeline,"" that stimulative fiscal measures were ""premature"" and that interest rates were already ""down to the lowest level in a generation."" **********Repeatedly, as the senators tried to pin him down about whether further interest rate cuts would be necessary, Mr. Greenspan bobbed and weaved to avoid a direct response. ""I try to be as oblique as possible,"" he said, grinning, at one point. **********But eventually, he had this exchange with Senator Dixon: **********Q. I take it that you believe that the modest drops in the rate of the discount window finally culminating in the 1 percent reduction you authorized in December of this year should bear fruit in the near future? **********A. Yes, sir. **********Q. In other words, I take it then that you are saying to us that you believe that that series of modest discounts ultimately culminating in the 1 percent drop will show fruit without any additional imposition of . . .? **********A. No, I said should; I didn't say will. **********Q. At least you expect it to? **********A. I think that is my expectation at this point, but I wish to emphasize that these are very unusual circumstances, and one has to be very chary about one getting a conviction and locking it into cement at this stage because we do not have a rational capability of holding a conviction in this type of environment.  Economy Clearly 'Struggling' **********Mr. Greenspan's assessment of the economy was the same as the one he gave the House Ways and Means Committee three weeks ago. Basically it is that last spring the economy began pulling out of the recession, which began in the summer of 1990. But by last fall, the recovery had stalled, and now it is clearly ""struggling."" **********The reason, he said, was that the economy was left so badly out of shape by the corporate mergers and buyouts, the overbuilding of commercial real estate and the household borrowing and spending boom of the 1980's that the recovery could not gain normal momentum. **********Still, Mr. Greenspan added, the data today were not so bad compared with other recessions since World War II. But he said today, as he did three weeks ago, that consumer worries about the long-range health of the economy were the worst he had ever experienced. Exchange Over Inflation **********An exchange between Mr. Greenspan and Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, was a prime illustration of how politicians and central bankers view the world differently. **********Mr. Greenspan, whose contact with the public is minimal, said he was surprised that the mail the Federal Reserve received about interest rates was not so much from those who wanted further rate cuts as it was from retired people who live on the interest earned on savings and had seen their incomes pared by the lower rates. He said that he was sympathetic to their problem but that he hoped the slowing of the rate of inflation would help them retain their purchasing power. **********Maybe so for some people, Senator Kassebaum said. But for her elderly constituents, medical costs are continuing to rise at an abnormal pace, and that offsets any other benefits from lower rates of inflation."

Lastinger Jr. wrote in 1971 about the growth opportunities for banks in Florida, where his family had lived for more than 150 years and where he planned to spend his entire career. He landed a job with Barnett Banks Inc. upon graduation and put some of his ideas to work as the state blossomed. **********More than 20 years later, Florida is still growing, but banks are consolidating, and Mr. Lastinger, now Barnett's president and chief operating officer, has emerged as one of the executives driving that trend. Last Monday, Barnett announced that it would acquire First Florida Banks Inc. of Tampa, a merger of Florida's two oldest banks that would solidify Barnett's rank as the state's largest. **********Although Barnett, based in Jacksonville, had on several occasions in the past few years approached the Lykes family -- which owns 32 percent of First Florida as well as vast holdings in the fruit, meatpacking and shipping businesses -- it was not until early April that the family said it would entertain proposals. **********Mr. Lastinger then led a Barnett team to evaluate First Florida's operations, including two businesses that Barnett coveted: a $4.5 billion trust operation and its data-processing services for other banks. **********At daily meetings with senior Barnett executives, he played devil's advocate, posing questions about the deal and possible reasons that it might best be avoided. **********""I was making sure the assumptions were rational and objective, and not driven by ego or emotions,"" said the 49-year-old Mr. Lastinger, a former naval air intelligence officer. **********The deal has sparked a range of emotions on Wall Street, however. While some analysts say the banks fit well together, others say First Florida's price tag -- 2.4 times book value, or roughly $800 million -- is on the high side. Barnett's stock appears to reflect that concern, closing Friday at $35.625, down from $39.25 before the merger announcement. **********Mr. Lastinger defends the acquisition price, promising Barnett can save $66 million in noninterest expenses in 1993, in part by closing up to 100 branches in shared markets. First Florida also has more commercial real estate problems than Barnett, but Mr. Lastinger said Barnett believed that the $104 million set aside by First Florida to cover problem loans is more than adequate. **********""We have a base of information that is much more extensive than any analyst has,"" said Mr. Lastinger. ""It's more important what people say two years from today than what they say today."""

After spotting a newspaper ad for an investment seminar sponsored by the brokerage firm A. G. Edwards, they signed up for a free meal at the nearby Eastwood Lake Country Club, where a broker, Robert Hicks, presided. The just-retired couple ""kind of liked this fellow,"" Mr. Woodruff said, so they visited Mr. Hicks in his office and let him take over their portfolio. **********Today, two of the three limited partnerships they purchased are bankrupt. The third ""isn't worth much at all,"" said Mr. Woodruff, who says he has lost between $100,000 and $120,000 on the three investments as a result of misleading advice. Usually, a newly retired couple would modify a portfolio in a more conservative direction. The Woodruffs' broker advised the opposite way, selling their conservative utility stocks and municipal bonds and buying some of the diciest stuff on the risk continuum. Both Mr. Hicks and A. G. Edwards declined to comment. **********Some investors try to make themselves financially whole by taking action against brokers when they think they have been wronged. The Woodruffs cannot. **********Like a number of other investors who bought limited partnerships in the 1980's, they are learning the hard way that, even when they have a legitimate case, there are six-year limits on filing arbitration claims against brokers. No matter when they learned that they had lost out. **********Investors in more liquid securities like stocks, bonds and mutual funds tend to notice more quickly when their investments sour or prove to have unexpected costs, because monthly statements alert them. Not so partnership investors, many of whom bought in the early and mid-1980's but got their first inklings of trouble only late last year. That is when securities firms began to switch from using pie-in-the-sky purchase prices on their monthly statements to using an estimate of market value. And that is when investors began to barrage the stock exchanges with requests for arbitration hearings against brokers who sold the partnerships. **********Almost as quickly as investors requested hearings from stock exchange-sponsored arbitration panels, the very brokerage firms that fought passionately in the 1980's to keep customer disputes out of court fled to their local judges. Their beef: the arbitration requests should not be honored, and the six-year limit is a six-year limit, period. ""We've been fairly adamant that the rule says what it says and means what it means and should be enforced as written,"" said William Fitzpatrick, general counsel at the Securities Industry Association. **********But arbitration directors are becoming more flexible on the six-year limit. The rules say an investor must file a claim within six years of the ""occurrence or event giving rise to the act or dispute,"" said Deborah Masucci, director of arbitration at the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. In the case of limited partnership disputes, Ms. Masucci has surprised the industry by beginning to interpret the ""occurrence or event"" as being the date an investor becomes aware of a precipitous decline in a partnership's value on a statement. **********That does not sit well with brokerage firms, which have begun what Allan J. Fedor, a plaintiffs' lawyer, calls ""litigation terrorism"" against investors who try to utilize the new leniency of arbitration panels. The firms ""are using anything they can grab onto to run arbitration cases into court,"" Mr. Fedor said. ""It doubles the workload"" and winds up being too costly for some investors, he added. **********Some courts are ruling that a case from more than six years ago is eligible for arbitration, but investors cannot count on that. The brokerage firm Edward D. Jones objected to an arbitration hearing and managed to get a favorable ruling from a Midwestern judge who said the case -- which had already been heard and decided -- was not eligible in the first place because of the time limit. ""Any brokerage firm in the circuit in the Midwest where that case was heard is going to go to court now,"" Ms. Masucci said. **********Some plaintiffs' lawyers have tried to use that arbitration ban as a back door into court. Investors are largely banned from court because virtually all brokerage firms insist clients sign an agreement to arbitrate -- rather than sue -- in the event of a dispute. But plaintiffs' lawyers sometimes make a successful case that the elimination of arbitration as an option should entitle them to a day in court. **********Members of the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration will meet by telephone conference this week to continue hashing out proposals to clarify the muddy issue of who decides whether a claim is eligible. Considering that the Securities Industry Association is a voting member, there is not likely to be speedy agreement. **********A simple proposal would change the written investor arbitration code in such a way that arbitration panels could be empowered to admit or deny a claim based on when an investor discovered a problem -- as opposed to the date an investor bought a security. That would allow investors whose brokerage firms kept them in the dark about market value to file claims involving partnerships sold to them more than six years ago. But Mr. Fitzpatrick says any extension of the six-year rule simply is not fair because brokerage firms cannot properly defend themselves in such cases. ""Memories grow dim,"" and records are gone, he said. **********Members of arbitration conference may eventually agree on language that keeps the eligibility question out of the courts, but investors in the meantime will need to accumulate a good deal of detail about legal decisions in their states if they have owned a disputed security for more than six years. For now it is limited-partnerships that investors and brokerage houses are sparring over. ""But we don't know what financial vehicle it will be next year,"" Ms. Masucci said."

Moreover, unfilled orders, a leading indicator of business activity, fell for the eighth straight month, to the lowest level since August 1989. **********""The level of shipments continues to exceed the level of new orders, so the manufacturing sector continues to run down its order backlog,"" said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Chemical Securities Inc. **********""As long as that happens, there will not be big gains in production.

Is Facing Growing Discontent," **********The Palestine Liberation Organization and its leader, Yasir Arafat, are facing a growing wave of discontent, as several other Palestinian leaders have begun to question Mr. Arafat's style, his political judgment and his financial management. **********Discontent with Mr. Arafat has been raised not only by members of the movement's leadership but also by growing numbers of Palestinian intellectuals, rank-and-file P.L.O. members and ordinary Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories and elsewhere. **********These protests come a year after the end of the Persian Gulf war, as the P.L.O. leadership continues to reel from the repercussions of its support of Iraq, including the loss of support and money from Arab sources. Furthermore, the embattled organization is facing new challenges, including an ascending new Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories that demands a bigger say in decision-making and has gained a new prominence by its performance in the Middle East peace talks that started in Madrid. Past Challenges Survived **********Mr. Arafat has survived many challenges to his authority since the early 1960's, when he founded the Fatah movement, the main P.L.O. faction. Several senior Palestinian figures say he will survive this challenge, too, but the open questioning of his leadership has damaged the P.L.O.'s unity, contributing to a process that has marginalized the organization. **********As examples of the challenges to Mr. Arafat, last week in a stormy meeting of the 18-member Central Committee of the Fatah movement, Hani al-Hassan, a top official of the group, submitted a scathing written critique, according to officials who attended the meeting. It questioned Mr. Arafat's approach to the Madrid process and his failure to renew ties with Saudi Arabia, once a major financial and political backer of the P.L.O. **********Khalid al-Hassan, his elder brother, who is a founding member of Fatah, also criticized Mr. Arafat's monopoly over decision-making, and his exclusion of senior Palestinian leaders in favor of a younger generation of aides who carry out his orders without question, people who were present said. **********There were more criticisms in a meeting of the 100-member Revolutionary Council, also in Tunis last week, said people who were at that meeting.  Several spoke of the vacuum of leadership at the top, and many participants told Mr. Arafat that his failure to replace three men who have been killed -- Khalil al-Wazir, Salah Khalaf and Hayel Abdelhamid -- has blocked the decision-making process. 'Basic Changes' Demanded **********In an interview with the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat that appeared a week ago, Mr. Hassan pointedly said, ""I want basic changes, which consist of the return to true democracy in a comprehensive way and the return to collective leadership, also in a comprehensive way."" **********In a recent, well-publicized editorial in Al Fajr, the East Jerusalem Palestinian newspaper, the publisher, Paul Ajlony, charged that ""financial corruption is rampant and only getting worse"" in the P.L.O., which has vast financial resources estimated at several billion dollars spread around the globe. **********Al Fajr denounced P.L.O. officials and representatives inside and outside the occupied territories, saying some of them are living lavishly in villas and on large expense accounts. The newspaper said there were many abuses in the allocation of money that was meant to help Palestinians in the territories but instead ended up in the bank accounts of organization officials. **********Top advisers to Mr. Arafat like Bassam Abu Sharif dismiss much of the criticism as part of ""a plan to cancel the national rights of the Palestinians."" **********But in a conversation about the debate in the Palestinian movement, Mr. Abu Sharif said, ""The existence of bureaucratic obstacles, negligence and cases of lack of discipline inside our organizations is an expected thing because our organizations are like state organizations in any country, which cannot be free of such practices."" **********As one example of the new challenges the organization is facing, participants in the Tunis meeting blamed Mr. Arafat for his inability to handle the growing strength of Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian movement in the Israeli-occupied territories, which has capitalized on the sinking reputation of the P.L.O. in the Gaza strip and the West Bank. P.L.O Trounced in Vote **********Three weeks ago, Hamas candidates trounced the P.L.O. in an election for the board of the Chamber of Commerce of Ramallah, a city with a large number of Christian Palestinians who normally would never vote for an Islamic fundamentalist. **********""It was a vote against what everyone here called the 'Fatah mercenaries,' "" said a West Bank resident who spoke in a telephone interview on condition of anonymity. ""It's a small election, but the message is loud."" **********This erosion of power has been compounded by a number of other developments. The loss of money from virtually all the Arab oil producers, estimated at several tens of millions of dollars, since the gulf crisis, has badly bruised the P.L.O.'s functions. **********While Mr. Arafat ordered all the organization's bureaus around the world to slash spending by 35 percent, several Palestinians said that only the lower echelons of the bureaucracy had suffered, while top officials favored by Mr. Arafat had hardly been touched. Many Are Demoralized **********The result has been a palpable demoralization of the estimated 20,000 or so among the rank and file who do much of the research, planning and daily work. A few days ago, Ahmad Abdelrahman, the P.L.O. spokesman in Tunis, complained that the monthly $200,000 budget for his office had been eliminated. **********He also said the gulf war had cost the P.L.O. a monthly subsidy of $6 million that gulf states are no longer paying. **********Another blow has been the revelation of a continuing stream of disclosures about the organization's secret operations and personnel by former Communist governments in Eastern Europe. **********In a new book, ""Illusions of Triumph: An Arab View of the Gulf War,"" Mohammad Heikal points out that after decades of cooperating closely with East German intelligence services, Palestinian organizations were shocked to discover that the East Germans had given Israel mounds of information about their operations. Poland, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and others have also revealed P.L.O. secrets. **********The issue of leadership, too, is a difficult one. Mr. Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, was killed by Israeli commandoes in his home in Tunis in 1988. Mr. Khalaf, who oversaw all security affairs and was known as Abu Ayad, and Mr. Abdelhamid, known as Abu al-Hol, were both killed in January 1991 by a Palestinian from the Adu Nidal organization who had been planted in the P.L.O. staff in Tunis. Many Palestinians complain that Mr. Arafat, instead of replacing such leaders, has expropriated their functions using minor aides who are sycophants.  Personal Prestige Declines **********These challenges for the 62-year-old Mr. Arafat come as his personal prestige among Palestinians is on the decline for the first time in several decades. **********Among other things, Mr. Arafat's frequent assertions that he was ""married"" to the Palestinian cause have collapsed with news of his recent marriage. The marriage to 29-year-old Soha Tawil, his secretary, has caused much consternation, being seen as a frivolous whim. While she is a Christian, that is not as important to mainstream Palestinians as her relative youth and the wedding's effect on Mr. Arafat's statements about marriage to the cause. **********An American official who closely follows all Arab affairs said in a recent conversation that the emergence of new Palestinian figures from the occupied territories like Faisal al-Husseini and Hanan Ashrawi, who are leading the Palestinian delegation in the peace talks, had further diminished any desire in the Bush Administration to resume any dialogue with the P.L.O. **********""At this point, the only thing talking to the P.L.O. can do is get us in trouble with the Israelis,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We have decent Palestinian interlocutors. This is a big loss for Arafat."""

A Quiet Yes.,Market Place; Was Japan's Trading Rigged? A Quiet Yes.," **********Little-noticed legal decrees handed down last month by Japan's Fair Trade Commission may have finally offered a partial answer to the most persistent, unresolved question from last year's securities scandals: Is the Japanese stock market rigged? **********The decrees show how Japan's leading securities houses created bogus trades at will to generate profitable stock trades for selected clients, largely in an effort to win their highly lucrative securities underwriting business. Well over $1 billion in such improper profits was created from this trading over a period of at least four years. **********The commission also made it clear that the boards of the brokerage houses explicitly approved what they knew was improper behavior, because of the profits they would earn by gaining the underwriting business of those clients. **********Until the decrees were handed down, it was not clear how pervasive the wrongdoing was, or how it affected the basic fairness of the market. The Finance Ministry, which is the principal stock market regulator, had conducted its own investigation, but in considerable secrecy. The mostly ""voluntary"" punishments it handed down were ambiguous about placing blame on the brokerages and indicating how serious the offenses were.  The Fair Trade Commission, which enforces Japan's anti-monopoly laws, has traditionally been known for its lax enforcement and meekness before Japan's powerful corporate interests. But its decrees -- the first such documents made public in the entire scandal -- paint a devastating picture of the operating methods of Japan's big securities houses and the thinking of their top executives. **********""The issue here is that these kind of actions undermine the credibility of the markets,"" said Akio Yamada, a director of Fair Trade Commission. **********Mr. Yamada said that the decrees resulted from an independent investigation by his commission, and that each of the securities houses -- Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi Securities -- had formally accepted the terms in writing last month. The decrees carried no punishment, but if the law is violated again, those involved could be sentenced to jail and fined, Mr. Yamada explained. **********The decrees could have a big effect on how some investors -- particularly American portfolio managers, who have poured billions of dollars into Japan over the last year -- view the propriety of putting their money into the Japanese market, which has been wallowing in a slump for two years. It could also help provide the basis for some damaging lawsuits, some lawyers contend. **********Charles R. Stevens, a partner here with the American law firm Coudert Brothers, said some large American investors were contemplating suing their Japanese brokers on the grounds that they were rigging the stock market to favor only a select group of Japanese customers. **********""It's as if the smoking gun is on the table from the beginning, since the securities houses are prevented from denying these facts,"" Mr. Stevens said. **********Adding to their problems, the Big Four are also facing an intensive investigation of their American operations by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. **********Although the S.E.C. has yet to acknowledge this investigation, people familiar with it said that the Japanese brokers were likely to admit to and settle charges that some of their executives in the United States acted for years as brokers without having registered as such, a violation of American law. **********A key purpose of the American law is to protect investors against fraud and to prevent markets from being rigged or manipulated. It also bars people from acting as brokers who have committed serious offenses, something Japan's Finance Ministry conspicuously failed to do after its own investigations last year. If the Japanese brokers do settle the S.E.C. charges, it could further harm their already shaky credibility. **********After the Finance Ministry investigated last year, the securities houses announced the resignations of a few top executives, voluntary pay cuts for some executives and changes in sales procedures. The ministry ordered some branch offices temporarily suspended, but no individuals were named. Nor were documents made public. **********Representative of the decrees issued by the Fair Trade Commission was one handed down to Nomura Securities, the world's largest securities house. The following were among its key points: ***********Nomura not only paid improper compensation to favored clients to cover stock-trading losses, but it provided the payments to raise substandard returns on selected portfolios, which it managed on behalf of the customers. The Finance Ministry never explicitly acknowledged that the payments were made to improve returns. Such compensation suggests more clearly than any previous evidence that the brokers offered guarantees in advance to customers about what their minimum returns would be, which is prohibited. ***********A key reason Nomura offered the improper compensation was to win the underwriting business of corporate clients or to maintain their brokerage business. This was the first time an explicit connection was made between the improper compensation and the aim of using it to earn profits elsewhere. ***********Despite receiving an order not to pay such compensation, from the Finance Ministry in December 1989, Nomura's board met on March 13, 1990, and authorized the payments, which continued for a year. ***********The improper payments followed a thorough review of the discretionary corporate accounts Nomura managed, which makes clear that the compensation was not done on an ad hoc basis, but was a clearly organized corporate strategy. **********The brokers appear to have carefully weighed the risks of breaching the law against the profits they would gain from winning the underwriting business of clients. Nomura, in fact, controlled about 11 percent of the commissions from brokerage activities during the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1991, and a huge 27 percent of the underwriting fees. **********Some market experts have described the lucrative underwriting business as one of the last remaining and most profitable cartels in the Japanese markets. **********""Underwriting fees are unusually high in Japan, so this was a natural way for these firms to do business,"" said Takaaki Wakasugi, a professor of finance at Tokyo University and co-head of a financial research institute at the University of Michigan. ""There is a sort of cartel in securities underwriting here that keeps fees so high."" **********Added Bob Greig, a partner in Tokyo with Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, an American law firm, ""You get some idea of how important this issue was when you see at how high a level it was taken up and of how much they stood to gain."" **********Each of the Big Four securities houses have offered assurances that they are mending their ways. But the practices were so pervasive, and the Finance Ministry's orders for reform seem to have been so weak in terms of rooting out and punishing the individuals involved, that some market experts remain skeptical about how much of a difference the scandal will really make in the long run. **********""They are just disguising their old business styles, waiting for the market to rise again,"" Professor Wakasugi said. ""In that respect, real change has not taken place yet. I'm not sure when it will."""

The police, who had refused to negotiate with the prisoners, suffered only minor wounds. **********Many Brazilians were shocked, their outrage heightened by stark photographs of rows of rough pine boxes filled with bodies shattered by bullets and mutilated by attack dogs. **********But in a poll taken shortly after the assault, 41 percent of respondents said they agreed with the action of the military police. The remaining 59 percent told Sao Paulo's Estado newspaper that they disagreed. 1,264 Killed so Far **********""The next time the shock troops will kill 300,"" said Roberval Conte Lopes, a former military police captain who champions killing criminals, making his appeals on his radio talk show and on the floor of the state legislature where he is a deputy. ""If they kill 1,000, it's fine by me."" **********Human-rights workers here say the prison killings were the outgrowth of a shoot-to-kill policy by Sao Paulo's military police, a state unit that patrols this city, the largest in South America, with 15 million people in the metropolitan area. **********In 1988, the military police in Sao Paulo State killed 294 civilians -- fewer than one a day. **********This year, not counting the prison killings on Oct. 2, police figures indicate they killed 1,264 civilians through the end of September -- almost five a day. About 85 percent of the killings are in the state capital. Take No Prisoners **********""The highest level of police-violence conflict among democratic countries in the world is in Sao Paulo,"" said Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, director of Sao Paulo University's Center for the Study of Violence. **********By contrast, the New York City Police, in a city of 7 million, killed an average of 27 people a year from 1982 to 1991. New York's police wounded about two civilians for every one killed -- an average of 56 a year. **********The Sao Paulo police over the last decade shot to death three civilians for every wounded civilian who was hospitalized. **********""What happened in the jail is part of the ethic of the military police: They think it is their job to kill bad buys,"" said Paul G. Chevigny, a criminal-law professor at New York University Law School, who worked here in September researching police violence for Americas Watch, the human-rights group. ""They kill people who are claimed to be criminals, and they get away with it because their superiors have no desire to discipline them. **********""The military police feel in a very clear-cut way that they have no other way of showing efficiency to the public than by the numbers of criminals that they eliminate,"" Mr. Chevigny said. **********The killing of criminal suspects, a national practice in Brazil, takes different forms in other cities: lynchings in Salvador, and death-squad activity in Rio de Janeiro. A report this month by the Sao Paulo chapter of Brazil's Bar Association said the military police and death squads paid by shantytown shopkeepers killed most of the nearly 1,000 street children slain here in 1990. **********A 1991 survey showed that 71 percent of the victims were poor men between the ages of 15 and 25. By successfully portraying their victims as ""marginals"" and ""bandits,"" the police win wide acceptance for the killings.  Colonel Justifies Killings **********""If they are not considered 'humans,' their death is more socially accepted,"" Mr. Pinheiro wrote in a recent essay. **********One Sao Paulo resident took exception to an assertion in the press that animals in Sao Paulo's zoo get better care than prisoners in San Paulo's jails. The resident, Renata Britto, wrote Veja magazine, ""We should not forget that the animals in the zoo are not criminals."" **********There was some indignation after the prison assault, and it is being channeled into at least half a dozen inquiries. After condemnation from Brazil's press and international human-rights groups, Sao Paulo State's Governor, Luis Antonio Fleury, suspended five military police commanders, describing their actions as ""criminal."" **********All crimes committed by the military police are tried in military courts. No Criminal Record Needed **********Although independent witnesses say the prisoners had no hostages and no firearms, a military colonel presiding over an internal inquiry has justified the mass killing as ""a reaction to the tumult provoked by the prisoners."" **********During the police assault, much of the killing took place after the troops' commander, Col. Ubiratan Guimaraes was stunned by an exploding television tube thrown by a prisoner. **********The prisoners, who had expelled guards from an overcrowded pavilion, skirmished with attacking police officers. Direction of the operation fell to two officers who started their careers in military counterguerrilla operations here in the 1970's. According to research by Claudio Barcellos, a Brazilian journalist, each of the officers is known to have killed 34 people -- before the prison operation. **********Mr. Barcellos studied the cases of 4,170 people killed by the Sao Paulo Police over the last 20 years. In""ROTA 66,"" a book he published recently about an elite police unit, he reported that 57 percent of the victims had no criminal record. Popular Support for Police **********""It's the second-largest tragedy in Brazilian history, only surpassed by Brazil's war with Paraguay in the 19th century,"" Mr. Barcellos said in a telephone interview from New York. He said he took refuge in New York after receiving death threats from the military police. **********Much of the autonomy -- and impunity -- of the military police comes from their popular support. **********""The people back the ROTA,"" demonstrators chanted recently in support of the elite squad, Rondas Ostensivas de Tobias Aguiar, which is responsible for most of the city's police killings. ""The military police are Sao Paulo's moral conscience."" **********After Sao Paulo's Roman Catholic Archbishop, Paulo Evaristo Cardinal Arns, held a memorial Mass for the dead prisoners, demonstrators shouted angrily at a priest walking by the state assembly,: ""A priest's place is in the church!"" **********There is no death penalty in Brazil. Support for killing criminal suspects, instead of arresting them, seems strongest in Sao Paulo's impoverished working-class periphery. **********""In the shantytowns, when someone steals your television it's a major blow, you want fast justice,"" said Mr. Lopes, the state congressman. Mr. Lopes, whose campaign photograph shows him with his .357 magnum Smith & Wesson revolver, boasts that he shot and killed a suspected car thief outside the state assembly in April, the latest of 100 suspects he is estimated to have killed since he first joined the ROTA in 1975. **********With Paulo Maluf, president of Mr. Lopes's right-wing party, expected to win the mayoral race here on Nov. 15, few people predict that police violence will diminish here soon. **********Indeed, in the uproar surrounding the prison massacre, Sao Paulo's new military police commander described the police operation as ""perfect."""

""We will not budge one inch."" **********""It's in their interest,"" he added, ""to see that no Arab country ever offered them autonomy."" **********Mr. Rabin asserted that Palestinian delegates in Washington dwelt on issues like Israeli prison conditions and reports of human-rights violations as a way to deflect the negotiations from what he called the central issue of how to reduce Israel's presence in the territories and transfer many responsibilities to Palestinian hands. **********""The Palestinian tendency,"" he said, ""is to deal with the symptoms of the disease, not the disease itself."" **********The Israelis envision a future self-government for Palestinians that is run by an administrative council with limited powers that Israel delegates. The Palestinians want a legislative body that would exercise full authority over the territories as a transition to eventual Palestinian independence. To them, accepting the Israeli offer would be giving legitimacy to Israel's claim, which they reject, to ultimate authority over Gaza and the West Bank. **********Mr. Rabin's unusually strong criticism reflected a growing frustration among Israeli leaders that the talks with the Palestinians in Washington, while still at an early stage, are not going as smoothly as either side had hoped. **********In the Israeli view, the problem lies with the Palestinian delegation, which they say is not strong enough to make the compromises needed and is hampered by tensions between Palestinian representatives from the territories and leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis. **********""The Palestinians in the territories are more pragmatic than those in Tunisia,"" Mr. Rabin said today. ""Some elements in Tunisia are still an obstacle to some of the Palestinians in the territories to reach an agreement."" **********Speaking at the same forum Wednesday night, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said that when the Palestinians veered from the autonomy question to raise issues like Jerusalem's future status, they were ""really endangering the very foundation of the negotiations."" **********That is not how Palestinians see it, however, many of them saying the problem is that the Israeli offer falls short of what they need. They accuse the Rabin Government of being no more interested in real peace than its Likud-led predecessor. **********""It wants to end the conflict the Israeli way -- the way that guarantees Israeli benefits without regard for Palestinian considerations,"" said Al Quds, a Palestinian newspaper in East Jerusalem. ""Basically, it wants to solve the Palestinian issue by continuing occupation."""

""The cable people have the best of all worlds. They're not regulated, and they are a monopoly."" Cox's Reply **********John R. Dillon, senior vice president of Cox Enterprises, responded that the law did not affect the purchase because Teleport does not dominate local markets in the way that traditional telephone companies do. **********""The cross-ownership provisions were adopted because the local-exchange carriers have bottleneck control over facilities,"" Mr. Dillon said, referring to the telephone companies.  ""Teleport certainly doesn't have bottleneck control."""

Isis said it would begin trials immediately, which would make its drug the first such compound ever administered to humans. **********The drugs, known as anti-sense compounds, mark the next frontier in biotechnology. They work by binding with RNA molecules containing the genetic code that prompts cells to produce disease-causing proteins. In contrast, a traditional drug inhibits the action of a single disease-causing protein that has already been formed. **********The go-ahead from the F.D.A. is an important milestone for anti-sense technology, said Viren Mehta, a partner in Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research in New York. ""For the leaders in this technology,"" he said, ""now the progress should be much faster and they should be able to move forward with greater confidence."" **********Shares in Isis closed today at $12.75, up 37.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading.

In women, papilloma virus is associated with cervical cancer and with viral infections in the newborns of infected mothers. **********Current treatments for the disease do not cure it and recurrences are frequent. The most common treatment, surgical removal of the warts, sometimes spreads the virus. **********In initial trials, Isis's drug will be injected directly into the warts. Applying the drug directly to the lesions avoids the difficulties of delivering drugs through the bloodstream and is less likely to cause unforeseen side effects. But future applications of anti-sense compounds, for viral diseases like AIDS or hepatitis, will require intravenous injection of the drugs. **********The work of the body, and of all diseases, is done by proteins. The information necessary to produce each protein is spelled out by the sequence of DNA that makes up a gene. **********The DNA, stored in the nucleus of a cell in a two-stranded form known as a double helix, sends the information out to the body of the cell to produce a protein via a single-stranded messenger, RNA, known as the ""sense"" strand. Anti-sense drugs are a mirror image of that strand that block the protein production by binding to the RNA. **********One potential advantage of antisense technology is that because the DNA sequences of most major viruses are known, if anti-sense drugs prove effective against one viral disease, scientists should be readily able to craft therapies for other viruses by altering the sequence of the anti-sense materials."

Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to found the Microsoft Corporation, which grew into the nation's largest software company, could conceivably have a little difficulty if he wanted to program computers for a living in Mexico after a North American free-trade agreement was signed. **********The agreement would ease temporary-visa rules for Canadian, American and Mexican computer operators who cross borders to find a job. But it requires the operators to have university degrees to qualify for special consideration, so as to prevent hundreds of thousands of Mexicans from flooding north after a few days of vocational training. **********This is just one of thousands of compromises that trade negotiators from the three countries have struck in the last year. These deals, typically made with little or no public debate, will affect scores of industries the length and breadth of the continent. Curtailing Debate **********The result of the secrecy has been a remarkably successful smothering of debate during an election year on an issue that prompted two months of impassioned debate in Congress last year. **********And the Bush Administration has begun to investigate leaks that have occurred. In one recent breakthrough agreement, not previously disclosed, the three countries agreed to treat each other's advertising companies as they treat their own. Asked Saturday morning about this and other recent agreements, aides to Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, not only declined to comment -- on the ground that classified information was involved -- but also immediately began investigating possible sources of the leaks. **********By Saturday afternoon, they had already checked the attendance records of senior advertising executives at meetings of Mrs. Hills's private-sector advisory groups and determined that not one of them had shown up for classified briefings at which the issue was discussed, an American trade official said. Under Wraps **********During most of the negotiations, these deals stayed secret because all three countries classified thousands of pages of negotiating documents and conducted their talks with the secrecy and security once reserved for wartime military operations. **********Now, with the trade talks entering their final weeks, the broad outlines of the secret arrangements -- and the remaining squabbles -- are beginning to spill out. **********In the advertising deal, the principle of ""national treatment,"" already applied in the international trade of manufactured goods, would give American advertising companies the same legal and economic rights in competing for contracts from Mexican enterprises as domestic companies there. **********The deal would also exempt American and Canadian companies from the Mexican Government's longstanding requirement that foreign advertising companies open offices and hire staff in Mexico before they may run ad campaigns. **********In a separate deal on immigration, rules on temporary work visas will be eased for professionals and executives transferred by their corporations. As chairman of Microsoft, Mr. Gates could presumably arrange his transfer to Mexico if he ever wanted to do so, and thereby qualify under the new rules, a person familiar with the negotiations said. **********In another agreement, Mexico has agreed not to pursue a broad exemption from the pact for cultural industries, like films. Had Mexico received such an exemption, Hollywood's ability to compete with Mexican film companies would have been impaired. Canada received such an exemption in its 1988 free-trade agreement with the United States. **********In yet another deal, negotiators have come up with a new definition of what constitutes a North American car that can be sold across the nation's northern and southern borders without duties and with fewer customs formalities. The new definition is more detailed than the one in the 1988 free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada and is a little more generous to foreign companies because it allows the inclusion of some administrative costs, like sales offices in the United States, in determining the percentage of a car's value that has been produced in North America. **********But this generosity in definitions will be more than offset when the three nations set a higher percentage as the basis for special customs treatment. While the exact percentage will be one of the last decisions made, either at the ministerial or presidential level, people involved in the talks said it would likely be 60 percent or a little higher, compared with 50 percent under the old definition in the 1988 free-trade pact between the United States and Canada. **********Detroit auto makers have sought a 70 percent standard, while Canada has sought to maintain the old percentage as a way to encourage further construction of auto assembly plants by Japanese and other foreign car companies. **********Remaining issues, like trade in oil services and farm goods, will be addressed in Mexico on Saturday by Mrs. Hills and her Mexican and Canadian counterparts. **********People involved in the negotiations said there was a slightly less than even chance of an overall deal being struck on Saturday. Many technical issues still have to be worked out, and American and Canadian negotiators are haunted by the memory that a similar deal by their trade ministers in 1987 had to be renegotiated two months later because niggling technical details proved too controversial for their staffs to resolve after the first meeting. Fear of Publicity **********Mrs. Hills and her office's North American affairs section have imposed strict secrecy on the free-trade talks for fear that public debate would limit the ability of each country to compromise and strike the best possible deal. **********Only a handful of copies of the incomplete agreement have been given to Congress, and those are being kept in special, high-security reading rooms and in the safes of several Congressional aides with the necessary security clearances. **********Even other Government departments involved in the negotiations have been given information only about their sections of the free-trade accord and not about the overall agreement. **********The Administration has maintained secrecy even at the cost of endangering President Bush's effort to maintain China's favorable trade access to the United States market. Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade, and who has repeatedly led a group of farm-state Democrats across party lines in the last year to support the Administration's China policy, now says he will no longer back the President actively on China because his subcommittee has been cut off from needed information on the free-trade talks."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/21/business/credit-markets-municipal-bond-issuers-are-learning-to-detach.html,Jonathan Fuerbringer,1992-12-21,,1136,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Municipal Bond Issuers Are Learning to 'Detach',CREDIT MARKETS; Municipal Bond Issuers Are Learning to 'Detach'," **********Peter Coffin, the municipal-bond portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston, has the ""detachable calls"" from millions of dollars of bonds in his portfolios. And he would like to have millions more. **********But the immediate future of this new financial product -- it is not a mobile phone -- seems to depend less on demand from him and other portfolio managers and more on the state, city and local government issuers of tax-exempt municipal bonds nationwide. **********If these borrowers are willing to give up the call -- the protection against getting stuck with high-interest-rate bonds after interest rates fall -- then the brisk business that the State of New Jersey did in these detachable calls last week ought to become a regular part of the bond business. **********""The big question is how receptive issuers will be to this,"" Mr. Coffin said. Parts Exceed the Whole **********What is a call? It is an option to buy a bond in the future at a set price, such as in 10 years at a price of $102, $2 over the bond's face value. Issuers generally put such an option, or call, in their bonds so they can cut their borrowing costs if interest rates decline. **********Much of the invention in financial markets involves taking a piece of a security and figuring how the security can be bought or sold if the piece is stripped off. Inherent in this is the sense that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. **********In the case of the detachable call, which has been around for only nine months, the innovation is just selling the option to someone else, leaving the issuer with a bond without a call. **********Based on the results of the sale last week of the detachable calls on $86 million of New Jersey bonds due in 2013, the two parts -- the bond and the detachable call -- got a better price than just a bond without any call in it originally. **********As part of the $1.8 billion bond sale, New Jersey also sold bonds due in 2011 that did not have a call. They were priced to yield 6.07 percent. The bond due in 2013 with the detachable call was priced to yield 6.15. Then the detachable calls were sold for 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. So the net cost to the state was 6.04 percent, 3 basis points less than the bond that was sold originally without any call. **********But the inventor of the detachable call, Jeff Holt, first vice president and head of new products for the municipal department at Paine Webber, warned that this advantage in selling a detachable call versus a bond without a call was likely to disappear as investors learned more. **********""It might work for the next year or six months, but that yield will have to go away,"" he said. Advance Refunding **********He said he did not initially intend that the detachable call be sold at the time of issue of the bonds, leaving the issuers with a noncallable bond. The idea, he said, was to give the issuer long-term flexibility and allow it, when interest rates declined, to be able to gain the same savings using the detachable call that an issuer can now get with what is called an advance refunding. **********In an advance refunding, an issuer borrows money at lower interest rates to pay off existing higher-interest-rate bonds. The existing bonds are paid off by setting up an escrow account and buying Treasury securities that are used to redeem the old bonds at the date they are callable. **********Mr. Holt argues that selling the detachable calls in the future will achieve the same kind of savings for issuers, without going through the process or costs of an advance refunding. In addition, he said, issuers, like airports and ports, which are now prohibited from doing advance refundings, would be able to sell the detachable calls and achieve similar savings. **********A lot of what actually will happen is still unclear, however. It is Mr. Holt's computer models that show the savings from selling the detachable calls. Only one other sale of detachable calls besides New Jersey's has been held; that was by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia last month. And both of these sales have been at the time of issue. **********None of the more than $3 billion of bonds that Paine Webber and other firms have underwritten with the language needed for the issuer to sell the calls has been around long enough for an issuer to be in a position to decide if it is worth trying to sell them. The first detachable call was appended by Paine Webber to a $67.3 million Las Vegas, Nev., bond issue in April. **********In addition, many legal issues are still unclear. In some states, including Nevada, legislation must be approved to allow the sale of detachable calls. More important, the Treasury is still pondering how it wants to approach this new financial product. The Treasury could open the door or it could limit it, depending on how it decides to treat the sale of a detachable call. **********One main issue is the impact on the tax-exempt municipal bond market, where the Treasury has sought for years to limit issuance because of the revenue the Government loses. **********Still, Mr. Coffin of Massachusetts Financial Services loves detachable calls. He bought close to half the detachable calls on the $70 million of bonds issued by the Georgia utility and about a third of the calls on the $86 million in bonds sold by New Jersey on Thursday. **********The detachable calls help him even out the volatility in his portfolio, which comes from the fact that so many of the municipal bonds he owns give the issuer the option to redeem them, generally after 10 years. **********What the presence of the detachable calls do for his portfolio is this: The movement in the prices of his bonds is varied because some include traditional calls held by the issuer and a few do not. Because of the risk of the call, when interest rates decline, the price of a bond without a call will rise, for example, 10 percent, while the price of a bond with a call will rise 7 percent. But if interest rates rise -- which means a bond is less likely to be called -- the price of both callable and noncallable bonds drops about 10 percent. **********The addition of the detachable calls, which have their own value that moves with interest rates, help him gain back the three percentage points he loses on callable bonds when interest rates rise."

Ramos of the Philippines said today that he was willing to accept the stationing of American troops in the Philippines even after the United States withdraws from its last major military base here. **********The President's remarks, made in an interview, mean that the American military presence in the Philippines will not necessarily end next month, when the Navy is scheduled to lower the flag for a final time over the huge American naval base at Subic Bay. But it was unclear what kind of military presence was contemplated, or whether the United States would be interested in any proposal that could also satisfy the Philippine Senate, which voted last year to force the United States out. **********""What would be good for the Philippines is a continuation of the friendship -- and of the mutual security arrangement -- with the United States,"" Mr. Ramos said in his most detailed comments to date on the future of military ties with the United States. ""We'd like to find a way to make that mutually agreeable to both governments, if that is part of what the U.S. wants."" **********The Bush Administration has said it would like to retain a military presence in the Philippines, and Mr. Ramos, a former general, is a longtime supporter of such a presence here. But his remarks are bound to anger political opponents who want the armed forces of the United States, which colonized the Philippines 94 years ago, to leave here once and for all. Legislative Approval Uncertain **********American officials said they were not at all sure that Mr. Ramos could win approval from the Philippine Congress for a continued American military presence. But he appeared confident that a new military accord with the United States would not face the wave of nationalist sentiment that caused the Philippine Senate to reject a 1991 treaty renewing the American leases on Subic Bay Naval Station, Clark Air Base and several small installations in the Philippines. **********""The issue is fading away as among the top issues of our people,"" he said. ""I'm not too worried about the political flak."" **********Mr. Ramos said the Philippines was willing to accept an arrangement like that worked out last year between the Bush Administration and Singapore. Although the United States does not have a base in Singapore, it does maintain military offices there, and American battleships and military planes routinely visit Singapore for maintenance and refueling. **********""I think the United States would like something like what they've got in Singapore, which is an arrangement so that U.S. aircraft and U.S. vessels with U.S. personnel can be serviced by a host government,"" Mr. Ramos said. **********Asked how many American troops might be stationed in the Philippines, he replied, ""At this point, it's premature to be talking about numbers."" **********American troops in Singapore number in the hundreds. In 1990, 16,000 American military personnel were stationed in the Philippines. Pullout on Nov. 24 **********Mr. Ramos also did not say where American troops might be based in the Philippines, although he suggested that American military ""consultants"" might be useful at Subic Bay after it is returned to the Philippine authorities. **********Since the United States decided to withdraw its forces from the Philippines, American officials have expressed interest in negotiating commercial access to Philippine ports and ship repair facilities for Navy ships. **********The Pentagon has not actively considered stationing troops here, fearing that it could resurrect the strong domestic opposition to American bases. **********Last month, the Navy returned much of the Subic Bay base to the Philippine Government. It is scheduled to lower the American flag and withdraw the last of its sailors on Nov. 24. Clark Air Base was abandoned in 1991 after the devastating eruption of a nearby volcano, Mount Pinatubo. **********Mr. Ramos, a former Defense Minister, took office in June after winning elections in May. In his first 100 days in office, he seems to have made a generally favorable impression, with 70 percent of Filipinos surveyed in a recent poll saying they were satisfied with the performance of his administration. **********His popularity is explained in part by economic reforms, including a lifting of foreign exchange controls that had hindered investment, and by his efforts to make peace with Communist insurgents and rebellious rightist soldiers. **********At the same time, his administration is grappling with criticism that it has failed to deal with a wave of kidnappings and other crime, and that he is moving too slowly in dealing with the nation's monstrous poverty. U.S. Seen Turning Inward **********Mr. Ramos said he was concerned that the United States seemed to be turning inward and giving up some of its influence in foreign affairs, especially as measured in its willingness to assist developing nations. **********""There are great indications of the U.S. reduction of its global concerns as far as aid and development are concerned,"" he said, noting the recent sharp cuts in American aid to Manila, which fell from about $500 million last year to $200 million this year. **********As a result, he said, the Philippines may draw closer to its Asian neighbors. **********""If that is where most of our economic partners, where most of our markets are going to be, I guess we'll just have to turn in that direction,"" he said. ""That's why we're saying to the U.S., please don't let this so-called special relationship between our two countries die."""

Plewes, an Associate Commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said after a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. First Drop Since July **********The jobless rate is widely considered the most politically sensitive economic statistic for an incumbent in an election year, and the drop from 7.3 percent was the first decline in the figure since July. The increase in company payrolls was the largest of three straight gains. **********But political reaction in general was restrained as the White House continued to focus on the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots, and Democrats found less reason in the report to attack the Administration for its handling of the economy. **********In addition to the gain in payrolls as evidence of improvement, Mr. Plewes and others cited stepped-up demand for temporary and full-time workers in business services, a six-point jump to 55.2 percent in the proportion of companies adding workers, another dip in the jobless rate for adult men and a rise in the number of people voluntarily leaving jobs, which is taken as a sign of confidence that another job could be readily obtained. **********And while the one-tenth of a point decline in the unemployment rate is not viewed by the Labor Department as statistically significant, the fact that the rate declined at all was taken as another favorable sign. Rate Cut Possible **********Yet the dominant view remained that the recovery, though almost certain to be sustained, would be subdued by historical standards and that another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve could not be ruled out. Average hourly earnings, in fact, eased slightly last month and a Federal Reserve report on Thursday showed two of its money supply measures were growing at rates below their target range. **********""The figures suggest an economy that's growing -- but at a very sluggish pace,"" said Darwin L. Beck, an economist for the First Boston Corporation. **********Speaking for the Bush Administration, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin termed the report evidence that recovery was ""beginning to be reflected"" in the hitherto languishing job market. But she said her encouragement was ""tempered by the fact that too many people are still unemployed."" **********The department's survey of households showed that 327,000 people found jobs last month, exceeding the gain of 240,000 in the labor force. This reduced the ranks of the jobless by 87,000, to a total of 9.5 million. That compared with 6.7 million people unemployed when President Bush took office in January 1989 and 6.8 million when the recession began in July 1990. **********For the Democrats, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland complained today at the outset of the monthly Joint Economic Committee hearing on the labor market report that while April's job growth ""is welcome, it confirms that this recovery is far weaker than any we have experienced"" since World War II. Moving With the Economy **********In general, employment is considered a coincident indicator, which means it moves up and down at about the same time as the economy at large. The jobless rate, however, is regarded as a lagging indicator, one that at the end of recessions tends to keep rising for some months as people who had given up looking for a job are encouraged to think they might find one. **********In rejoining the ranks of job seekers, these people once again become part of the jobless-rate calculation. **********Among the 11 large states whose labor data were reported today, New York registered a four-tenths of a point decline, to 7.6 percent, while the unemployment rates in New Jersey and Pennsylvania both rose seven-tenths of a point, to 7.8 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively. **********Because of smaller samples for the state figures, New York's change was not considered significant while the others were marginally so. **********Nationally, the rise of 126,000 in payroll jobs caps three straight advances totaling 270,000. March growth was revised upward to show a gain of 39,000 instead of the 19,000 first reported. **********All the increase, however, was in service-producing industries. Construction did not add as many jobs as its seasonal adjustment factor -- resulting in an 11,000 loss -- and manufacturing added just 8,000 jobs. Where the Gains Were **********The gain in services, the biggest in almost two years, included an additional 30,000 jobs in health, 21,000 in business services, 46,000 in retail trade, 12,000 in local government and 7,000 in finance. **********William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, called business services, which has climbed for two straight months, a bellwether of job growth, since employers tend to be reluctant to hire permanent employees until they become confident about the durability of a business rebound. **********Instead, they turn initially to expanding the hours of their existing work force, to contracting work out and to temporary help, which has been particularly strong of late. **********Factory overtime rose sharply in April as average weekly hours for the whole private sector edged down six minutes, to 34.4 hours. **********But Lacy H. Hunt of the Hongkong Bank Group said he was disappointed in a second straight shorter workweek and in a related index of aggregate weekly hours, which fell in April to 121.6, a bit below its first-quarter average. **********""I don't like this pattern,"" said Mr. Hunt, who for some time has been one of the more pessimistic analysts, adding that the gains in retail trade were probably overstated, in part because the April survey week included the days just before Easter. **********Elsewhere in today's report, the number of people unemployed for 15 weeks or more fell by 167,000 last month, to three million, but this was still about twice the number of long-term jobless as when the recession began in mid-1990. **********The jobless rate for teen-agers eased 1.4 points in April to 19.2 percent, after two months above 20 percent, but the rate for black teen-agers jumped 3.4 points to 39.9 percent. The Hispanic unemployment rate eased 1.3 points, to 10.3 percent."

This year's convention was held here at the Waldorf-Astoria. **********A similar tension within the news business was demonstrated at the hotel when some photographers trying to take pictures of Ross Perot, who appeared at the convention yesterday, questioned the association's journalistic principles after they were forced to stop taking pictures during his speech. Role-Playing Exercise **********In a roundtable discussion, Jeff Greenfield, who reports on the media for ABC News, led the participants in a role-playing exercise in which an automobile dealer demanded only positive news in an automotive section in which he advertised heavily. **********Such situations have become more common as newspapers have created more special sections in recent years to help attract advertisers, who have increasingly demanded such elements as a ""positive environment"" for their ads. **********For years, airlines have routinely left instructions that their ads not appear on days when a plane crash is prominently in the news. **********More problematic is the tendency of some local advertisers to cancel ads in response to an article that they view as negative or damaging, such as one that details which car dealers make the best deals in a town or have the cheapest and most reliable service departments. **********Ronald K. L. Collins, a professor at Catholic University in Washington who has studied the effect of commercial concerns on news content, said newspapers, television and magazines were disturbingly willing to censor themselves to accommodate advertisers. About Consumer Reporting **********""We're talking about consumer reporting, basically; if the subject was race, religion or the environment, you would never stand for it,"" Mr. Collins said. **********""Advertorials,"" in which an advertiser buys several pages that are labeled advertising but look similar to news pages, have become an increasingly popular vehicle for newspapers to create the sought-for positive environment without involving the news operation. **********Indeed, immediately after the discussion on the ethical problem that advertorials and such things can present, the publishers adjourned to a workshop entitled ""How to Do Advertorials."" **********Jeremy L. Halbreich, president of The Dallas Morning News, said publishers should consider adopting a written set of standards, setting out for advertisers, readers and their staff members precise guidelines for creating advertorials. **********The American Society of Magazine Editors adopted a set of standards in 1982, which require that advertorials be clearly marked as advertising and use a different typeface to help avoid confusion with the editorial material produced by the magazine's staff. And the guidelines forbid the editornial staff to produce advertorial copy also. Readers Not Confused **********Mr. Halbreich said that in its research, the paper had found its readers were not confused into thinking advertorials were news, rather than advertising. Indeed, the research shows that readers valued ads in a legitimate news environment over ads in a calculatedly positive one. **********But he said certain subjects lent themselves to advertorials, such as a section sponsored by local hospitals trying to attract people to nursing, which would include descriptions of the benefits of the profession and the joys of life as a nurse. He said the paper's news department was unlikely to assign such articles on its own, but that the material could appear in an advertorial ""without damaging the tender franchise with our readers."" **********Some photographers taking pictures of Mr. Perot during his speech in the hotel's ballroom said the publishers had seemed to violate that understanding with readers when they forced photographers, who were in a cluster standing in front of Mr. Perot, to sit down and stop taking pictures during the speech. **********""This was just the last place in the world I would expect to have problems taking pictures of a candidate speaking,"" said Timothy A. Clary, a photographer for Agence France-Presse. **********Mr. Perot, obviously annoyed at the continually flashing strobes, stopped his remarks and said, ""I know I'm a monkey in a cage, but if you'd get what you need and quit, I'd appreciate it."" **********The remark drew laughter and applause from the publishers, which shocked and then angered the photographers. **********But Michael Genick, the association's vice president for meetings, said the cluster of photographers was in front of Mr. Perot only because, as an unannounced candidate, he did not have Secret Service protection"

H. Macy & Company once again crossed a tightrope that many financial and retailing experts see suspended above bankruptcy court. **********The venerable New York retail company certainly satisfied its lenders by not tapping its credit lines to send on-time payments to those who make its dresses, suits and housewares. But the move also shed a new, unfavorable light on just how much of a financial bind Macy appears to be in as the year unfolds. If nothing else, the two-week payment delay brought into sharper focus Macy's need to borrow for some routine operations. **********Given Macy's good payment record, and because they have little choice anyway, most suppliers say they are not greatly worried about getting their checks on Jan. 25 as promised. **********But once that is done, Macy faces a $27.5 million interest payment due April 15 on its 14.5 percent bonds that mature in 1998, the first of a series of small, but important financial hurdles it must clear. **********While such individual payments alone are not overwhelming, some of Wall Street's leading financial analysts question whether Macy will have the money to make the bank and loan payments at the same time that it finances its normal continuing operations and the upkeep of its stores. **********Macy does have alternatives to defaulting on its obligations, though not all of them offer a long-term solution. It could raise cash from its investors or sell one of its chains, like I. Magnin or Bullock's, to meet its short-term needs. It might also try to negotiate lower interest rates on its debt. It is paying rates ranging from 9 percent on the balance of a six-year bank loan to the equivalent of 16.5 percent that has accrued on zero-coupon bonds that start coming due next year. **********Then there is bankruptcy. But that is an option Macy executives refuse to consider. Debt Overhaul Seen as Key **********Whether or not Macy falls into the net of bankruptcy protection, following the likes of Federated and Carter Hawley Hale, many analysts say that nothing short of a complete overhaul of its $3.76 billion debt will really do the trick. **********To be sure, a few people closely following Macy express strong confidence in the retail company and say a short-term solution will be enough. They note that it operates some of the country's best-known department stores and rang up an impressive $6.7 billion in sales for the year that ended Nov. 3. Some think the poor economy, which has eroded growth in the retail business for two years, is likely to take a turn for the better. **********""We believe Macy is a different company than other retailers that have gone bankrupt,"" said Michael N. Cha, an analyst of high-yield investments for J. P. Morgan & Company who recently issued a report recommending buying the company's bonds. ""It has strong sponsorship from its banks and from the trade and strong franchise value."" **********Which strategy Macy ultimately chooses will depend largely on the opinion of Edward S. Finkelstein, the company's dynamic chairman who has guided it safely around rough shoals before. Big Changes in the Works **********And the company is apparently designing that strategy now. In a recent interview, Macy's vice chairman, Myron E. Ullman 3d, said Macy was hard at work on a plan to make big changes in its financial structure. He hinted that the plan would seek to bring the company's interest burden more into line with today's lower interest rates. **********But whether the company can pull off the feat without filing for some sort of legal intervention is less clear. In fact, some analysts say a bankruptcy negotiated in advance might be just the lift Macy needs to propel it over its hurdles. **********A recent report by Jack Hersch, Raz Kafri and David Teolis of Lehman Brothers suggests that a debt-for-equity swap under such a prepackaged bankruptcy would be Macy's best option for a major restructuring. Under a prepackaged bankruptcy, Macy would need approval for a debt-for-equity swap from only a majority of its bondholders, but those holders would have to account for two-thirds of the bonds' value. **********By contrast, major financial changes attempted outside court would need approval of 90 percent to 95 percent of the bondholders. Risk Seen in 'Best Option' **********But the Lehman Brothers analysts give a such restructuring only a small chance of happening. **********""We think that there's a better than 50 percent chance that it will degenerate into a 'hostile' bankruptcy,"" said Mr. Hersch, a specialist in bankrupt and distressed companies. **********Macy executives insist that bankruptcy is not under consideration because it is not in the company's interest. And numerous past predictions and rumors of bankruptcy have failed to become reality. **********""We are focusing all of our energy on developing a comprehensive game plan aimed at significantly reducing Macy's debt and placing the company on a sound financial base,"" a Macy spokesman said yesterday. ""To speculate about anything else would not be a fruitful exercise."" **********But in interviews during the disappointing holiday selling season, Macy executives acknowledged that the $3.5 billion buyout that took Macy private in 1986 and the $1.1 billion purchase price of I. Magnin and Bullock's department stores in 1988 might have saddled the company with more debt at high interest rates than it can handle. First-Quarter Loss **********In an interview after the company released its financial statements on Dec. 17 for the first quarter, ended Nov. 2, showing a $155 million loss, Mr. Ullman, who joined the company after the buyout and later purchases, said plainly, ""The disease we have is debt."" Although Macy has not released the results of its Christmas season, Mr. Ullman then said that it had overestimated sales. **********Based on the company's first-quarter results, analysts estimate that Macy's 1992 cash flow will be $350 million to $400 million -- not enough to cover the retailer's normal capital expenditures, interest expenses and term-loan requirements. **********""We believe that R. H. Macy & Co., Inc. should initiate a restructuring of its balance sheet within the next four months, a process that will probably entail an eventual Chapter 11 filing,"" the Lehman Brothers analysts wrote. **********And in a report that sent Macy's bonds tumbling after its release Jan. 8, Meredith Adler, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said, ""We see a restructuring of Macy's debt taking place in 1992, most likely in the context of a Chapter 11 filing, though an out-or-court restructuring is possible."" The bonds have since recovered because of speculation that Macy would sell an asset or would announce a major restructuring. Suppliers' Concerns **********Suppliers also want Macy to make a move to amend its balance sheet soon. They have received payment for the substantial holiday shipments they made in October and November and are only owed money for small reorders made in December. **********But they want the company to announce its plans before they ship large quantities of spring merchandise, which would increase their vulnerability. Thanks to the much-touted diplomacy of Diane Baker, the company's chief financial officer and primary liaison between it and its suppliers and their financiers, Macy has cultivated a large reserve of good will. **********""They have been much more upfront and fair with their suppliers than many of their counterparts,"" said Robert L. Brady, president of Parfums Givenchy U.S.A., which is making regular shipments of its cosmetics and perfumes to Macy. **********But Macy may have miscalculated in choosing to risk the support of its suppliers in favor of its banks. The banks are the least likely to push Macy into bankruptcy, analysts say, because they lose nothing by supporting the company and will do almost anything to avoid sullying their already weak loan portfolios. **********Suppliers may be less likely to risk their necks. Many smaller suppliers have already limited their exposure by making partial shipments to Macy. A Big Retailer's Leverage **********But Macy can also count on its leverage as one of the largest department store companies in the country to keep its shelves stocked. With fewer stores to sell to these days, manufacturers will not rush to offend Macy by refusing its orders altogether. All are aware that even if Macy is forced into bankruptcy, its store will continue to be major players in the retail industry. **********Though Macy's has three distinct options for financial overhaul, analysts said the solution would probably be cobbled from all three. **********Negotiating lower interest rates and easier payment terms would reduce payments for debt service but would not reduce the total debt. **********The company's banks, led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Bankers Trust New York, have already allowed Macy to renegotiate the requirements of its revolving credit line 23 times. Its bondholders and the insurance companies that are its other creditors might not be so accommodating. **********The second option, to raise cash, either from its investors or by selling something, to buy back debt, also has potential drawbacks. Purchases of Preferred Stock **********Last year investors, many of whom are close friends and business associates of Mr. Finkelstein, bought roughly $200 million of Macy preferred stock. Those purchases allowed the company to buy back some of its bonds at a discount. Investors stand to lose much of their investment if the company is forced into bankruptcy, and some have hinted they might be willing to raise their stake in the company to give it the cash it needs to prevent that move. **********But are they willing to contribute enough to repurchase the $1 billion in debt that analysts estimate the company must buy back if it wants to reduce its burdens? Analysts doubt it. Macy might also sell some of its assets to raise cash. It has seven stores it could mortgage and two office buildings and a shopping center it could sell. And several analysts have suggested that the first to go might be the I. Magnin chain of stores concentrated on the West Coast. **********But given the oversupply of retail store space, Macy is not likely to get top dollar for its real estate. And selling off one division would make sense only if Macy garnered enough money to buy back the portion of debt that it now covers with its cash flow. **********""I don't think that the sale of Magnin alone, even coupled with sales of some of its smaller assets, would come close to being enough,"" said Evan I. Mann, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Company."

""If we pull back, the agricultural sector has no other means of obtaining credit."" **********Pulling back on credit in Russia means, in effect, that the Central Bank must print fewer rubles. Fewer rubles makes the currency more valuable and thus would help make it more easily converted into hard currencies, including the dollar. A strong, easily convertible ruble, in turn, attracts foreign investment, encourages exports and makes imports easier to purchase. All are goals sought by Western governments and the fund, which represents their views. **********Sharing that view, President Boris N. Yeltsin's top economic advisers, led by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, have been pressing the Central Bank to curtail printing money, which is then lent to commercial banks and, through the banks, to the public. Mr. Domonov's explanation of the Central Bank's resistance was an unusually detailed attempt by a high Central Bank official to publicly explain its differences with Mr. Yeltsin's advisers and the fund. **********The Central Bank's reluctance to cut back lending does not reflect a disagreement with Mr. Gaidar over goals, Mr. Domonov said in an interview this week. In several small ways, he argued, the Central Bank is trying to reduce the number of rubles in circulation. The problem is that the commercial banks that loan to industry, particularly to agriculture, have no other source of funds beyond borrowing from the Central Bank. **********""We must refinance now and put off until after the fall harvest reductions in credit,"" Mr. Domonov said -- in effect, asserting that the fund's efforts to make the ruble convertible into hard currency this month or in March might have to be delayed. **********The Central Bank's difficulties reflect the evolution of banking in Russia. Until a year or so ago, state-owned banks essentially distributed money allocated by the Government. Now most of those banks have been turned into companies. Although the Russian Government still holds a majority of their shares, they operate as if they were independent, raising money to make loans to state and private enterprises. **********Most of the banks that loan primarily to farmers and to agriculture equipment companies do not take deposits, depending instead on loans from the Central Bank. The money is reloaned at interest rates higher than those charged by the Central Bank. **********The Central Bank currently has 135 billion rubles outstanding in loans, much of it to banks that relend to farmers and state-owned farm equipment companies, Mr. Domonov said. The money-losing farm sector has not repaid the commercial banks and they in turn have not repaid the Central Bank, leaving the latter with three choices as spring planting approaches. **********The most drastic would be for the Central Bank to call in its loans and take the money out of circulation. That would force the commercial banks to collect from the agriculture sector, an attempt that could result in numerous defaults, Mr. Domonov said. **********As a second alternative, the Central Bank could refrain from issuing additional credit, leaving the agricultural sector without enough money to pay for new equipment and spring planting. That makes the third choice the only acceptable one: to finance the farm sector so that the nation can renew its food supply, Mr. Domonov said. **********""Normally, we should not refinance the banks that lend to agriculture,"" Mr. Domonov said. **********But the Government can't do the job through subsidies, because of a huge budget deficit. ""That leaves us no choice but to refinance,"" he said."

That is the term the Bank of Japan has used to describe an economy where prices of many assets including stocks and real estate rose to unreasonably high levels. **********The Nikkei index of 225 stocks plunged 7.5 percent in the first three days of this week. It lost another 3.4 percent today, closing below the 17,000 level for the first time in more than five years.  [ Page D8. ] **********But that 7.5 percent drop is less than half the damage inflicted on the average large bank stock, which has dropped 18.8 percent. Since the end of 1991, the Nikkei has shed a quarter of its value, while bank stocks are down more than 50 percent. **********""There is a grave capital shortage in Japan,"" said Charles R. Elliott, the chief Japanese market strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. ""I am worried that the problems in the Japanese banking sector may lead to a slow withdrawal from international lending. That is not good news for the rest of the world."" **********Japan's problems this week have led to selling in many markets around the world. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.20 points, to 3,181.35, for a two-day drop of 94.14 points, or 2.9 percent.  [ Page D8. ] **********While the decline in Japanese bank stocks in part reflects rising concerns with credit quality and the banks' financial standing, it also seems to have fed upon itself, as some shares were sold simply because they had dropped in value. **********Notwithstanding the rapidly falling stock prices, American bankers said yesterday that there had been no clear signs of distress in the interbank markets, with Japanese banks continuing to borrow without paying significant premiums relative to other banks, and no indications the Japanese banks are trying to sell off their portions of loan syndications to raise cash. **********Nonetheless, the fall of prices in Tokyo has reinforced the feeling that radical changes are taking place in the world's financial structure. During the booming 1980's, when credit was readily available, Japanese companies were able to borrow at very low costs, and Japan became a large supplier of credit to much of the rest of the world. Its banks took large positions in many big loan packages, and even provided credit support to enable many American municipalities to issue bonds to American investors. **********Now, with Japan perhaps entering a recession, and with its credit system clearly strained by multiple effects of falling values for both stocks and real estate, it appears to be clear that Japan will no longer be able to play that role, despite large trade surpluses. **********""You turn off the liquidity pump for the world completely, and that could be very bad,"" said Barton M. Biggs, the chief international strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Japanese industrial production in March was down 4.6 percent from a year earlier, and the country's leading economic indicators seem to be forecasting that business conditions will continue to worsen. If that happens, said Steven H. Nagourney, the chief international strategist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, ""Our exports to Japan will decline. The exports of our other trading partners to Japan will decline. World trade will be lower, and that will hurt the global economy."" **********Japan's banks are troubled by problems around the world, as well as at home. Some of them are among the large lenders to Olympia & York, the Canadian real estate developer. ""There are lots of problem real estate borrowers,"" said David Andrews, a director of IBCA Ltd., a London-based company that specializes in evaluating bank credit. **********IBCA reduced the ratings of nine Japanese banks earlier this week. ""It is likely we will go on lowering ratings,"" Mr. Andrews said. But he added that most Japanese banks were likely to remain investment-grade credits. **********When Japanese share prices were soaring in the 1980's, much was made of the banks' ""hidden assets"" -- unrealized profits on shares they held in other companies. At the end of March 1991, those hidden reserves came to $248 billion for 20 large banks, Mr. Andrews said. His estimate is that that figure was down to $141 billion by the end of March of this year, when the Japanese fiscal year ended. With the Nikkei 225 down about 14 percent since then, it seems clear that the figure is lower now. **********Under Japan's bank credit rules, a part of such unrealized gains were counted as capital. Mr. Andrews said it appeared that some leading banks would not be in compliance with bank capital rules at current share prices. **********One unusual aspect of Japanese banking is that many bank loans have been secured by stock in the bank making the loan. ""The decline in the bank shares is destroying the value of a lot of bank loans,"" Mr. Elliott said. He said many banks seemed to have sold shares held as collateral. **********In addition, many smaller Japanese banks have historically held shares of larger banks. Now, needing additional capital and worried by falling prices, some analysts say those banks may have been sellers, further helping to depress prices. **********Japan's stock market peaked at the end of 1989, not long after the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, set out to puncture the ""bubble economy"" without damaging the country's real economy. While share prices dropped in 1990, the move seemed to have little impact on the rest of the world, and led to a widespread feeling that Japan's financial fall might not be an important international event. **********""That was a deflating stock market,"" said Mr. Nagourney of 1990's drop. ""This is different. Now you are dealing with the prospect of a financial crisis."" **********Or, as Masahiko Goto, the New York representative of Taiyo Investment Trust, a Japanese mutual fund group, put it: ""All the economies are intertwined. If Japan gets sick, the U.S. cannot stay well all the time."" **********The rapid drop in bank stocks may have been overdone, some analysts suggested. Mr. Elliott of Goldman, Sachs said that if Tokyo stock prices did recover, the banks might recover the fastest. **********But James Levy, the manager of Fidelity Investment's Overseas Fund, said that he thought Japanese banks might still be too expensive. They are trading at higher multiples of book value than many international banks, he said, and it is likely the book value figures have been overstated because the banks have taken little in the way of reserves for bad loans, despite the falls in Japanese asset prices."

But the diplomats' longer-term concern is for an Algerian fundamentalist government's influence in nearby countries of North Africa, including the West's biggest Arab ally, Egypt. 'A Catalytic Effect' Is Feared **********""When Iran became an Islamic state it shook the Arab world, even though Iran is Persian and its rulers are Shiite rather than mainstream Sunni Muslims,"" a senior Western diplomat said. ""If Algeria is handed over to the fundamentalists it could have a catalytic effect in the region, much as we saw with the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe."" **********Most Western governments, including the United States, are said to hope that by refusing to lend significant backing to the tottering Algerian junta they can moderate the severity of the Islamic government that may follow. Some diplomats said they hoped for the emergence of some kind of coalition between the army, Algeria's traditional arbiter of power, and the militants. **********""We must begin to have a dialogue with the fundamentalist movements throughout the region, as unpleasant as many of us find the task, because it is they who seem set to inherit power,"" a European diplomat said.  Possible Role for Christopher **********One of those who may join such a dialogue is Warren M. Christopher, President-elect Bill Clinton's designate for Secretary of State, who worked closely with the Algerian authorities in 1980 and 1981 in the Algiers-mediated negotiations for the release of American hostages taken at the American Embassy in Teheran. **********But Egyptian, Syrian, Moroccan and Tunisian officials, fearful that their own fundamentalist movements will receive a significant boost from the creation of an Islamic state in Algeria, are doing their best to shore up the junta. The Egyptian authorities, who work closely with the Algerian security forces, are shipping in Muslim clerics to try to challenge the militants on theological grounds. **********It would appear, however, that Algerians' widespread dissatisfaction with their Government is rooted in economics, and that the fundamentalists' appeal among Algeria's urban, secularized majority lies more in their reputation for incorruptibility than in their religious conviction. **********Government officials in Algeria believe that if they can crush the Islamic movement and ram through economic austerity measures, they can regain control of the country. The Government has promised presidential elections by the end of 1993. **********""The crux of the problem is economic,"" said Abdel Hamid Chebchoub, a Foreign Ministry official. ""Once we help the young people find work and bring down the cost of living the situation will be different."" **********But opposition leaders say that few Algerians are in the mood to make further sacrifices, especially as the Government has moved to reverse some of the market-oriented policies introduced by its predecessor and has failed to tackle what many Algerians believe is widespread corruption within the Government. **********""No one recognizes the legitimacy of this regime and no one is going to endure an economic austerity program imposed by these officials,"" said Mohammed Cherifi, a former Minister of Trade. ""If we do not get some kind of representative government very soon we will face chaos."" **********Salaries are ravaged by a 40 percent inflation rate and unemployment is well above 20 percent, with about half of the labor force underemployed. Lacking spare parts and foreign exchange to import raw materials, the state enterprises that formed the backbone of the centralized economy operate at 50 percent capacity. Many companies are unable to pay workers on time and there have been numerous strikes. **********The lifting of food subsidies this summer has doubled the cost of many basic commodities, and the housing shortage is so pronounced that dozens of people often share a single apartment. 22 People in 3 Rooms **********Fatma Bouallaga stood on a small balcony perched over the crumbling houses that pack the slopes of the Casbah in central Algiers. Along with her husband and nine children, she shares three tiny rooms with her brother-in-law's family. The 22 occupants have no place for bathing and barely enough room to lie down and sleep. **********""We have written many letters and asked for our own apartment,"" she said, ""but all we hear are empty promises."" **********The junta, backed by the military, seized power in a coup in January that forced out President Chadli Benjedid. Mr. Benjedid promoted democratic policies that led to the country's first free elections a year ago. **********The elections appeared set to give the militant Islamic Salvation Front an overwhelming majority in the Algerian Parliament. The Islamic Front won 188 of the 231 seats decided in the first round of the voting in December 1991. But the second and decisive round of the elections, scheduled for January, was canceled after the coup, and the the first-round results were thrown out. **********The Islamic Front, known by its French acronym, F.I.S., calls for an Islamic state that would reject the political and cultural values of the West. It was outlawed in March and driven underground by the five-man junta known as the High State Council that has ruled the country since the coup. The junta declared a state of emergency in February. **********The Government of Prime Minister Belaid Abdessalam has overseen the dismantling of virtually every public, charity, business or private entity with connections to the Islamic Front, including as many as 200 municipal councils controlled by the fundamentalists. **********The Islamic movement, denied power through the ballot box, has mounted an armed revolt against the Government with, Western diplomats contend, significant help from some supporters inside the armed forces. The Government plans to try 90 army officials on charges of handing over arms and intelligence to the fundamentalists. More Militancy Is Seen **********The suppression of the political wing of the movement has altered the leadership within the Islamic Front, political analysts said. **********""The refusal to allow the F.I.S. to achieve power through legitimate means has driven the more moderate Islamic leaders to the sidelines and radicalized the movement,"" one former Government minister said. **********One militant leader, interviewed in an idling car in a back street in the Kouba neighborhood, said: ""We operate in tiny cells now. I only deal directly with two other people, so if I am caught and tortured they can't get much from me. I have no idea where our leaders are.

Six policemen were killed in an ambush in Algiers the other day. **********In response, the authorities are increasingly turning to raw force to maintain control. Curfew in the Capital **********The Government imposed a 10:30-P.M.-to-5-A.M. curfew on Algiers and six nearby districts two weeks ago. It has instituted secret courts to try those suspected of being involved in terrorist attacks and amended laws to sentence minors to death if they are convicted of belonging to an armed underground group. The junta has shipped at least 9,000 suspected militants to remote camps in the Sahara. Some half-dozen newspapers have been shut down, and all political activity has been banned. **********New restrictions, including the recent decision ago to close Muslim prayer rooms in schools, offices and factories, are issued each week. The state-controlled television has stopped broadcasting sounds from crowds at soccer matches because of the frequent anti-Government chanting. **********On Wednesday, the Prime Minister promised security forces more equipment and dismissed the possibility of any compromise with what he called ""subversive forces working for the destruction of Algeria."" **********The Government makes little attempt to hide the severity of the conflict. Bands of riot police officers, their faces covered by balaclava hoods to avoid identification, race through the streets in caravans, the black snouts of their shotguns and Kalashnikov assault rifles protruding from the windows. Gunfire echoes across the capital each evening and shoot-outs are common even in the center of the city. **********The Government says about 200 police and army officials have been killed this year, but Western diplomats say the number is at least twice that."

President Boris N. Yeltsin is to attend as the leader of Russia, which has just taken over the former Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat. **********The British Prime Minister, John Major, is to preside over the summit meeting, since Britain has the Council's rotating presidency in January. And President Francois Mitterrand of France is also expected to attend, since he first proposed such a Security Council summit meeting last year. **********With the attendance of those leaders assured, diplomats predict that all other Council members will agree to be represented by their heads of state or government as well. The other countries currently serving on the Security Council are China, Belgium, Austria, India, Zimbabwe, Ecuador, Cape Verde, Japan, Morocco, Venezuela and Hungary. **********White House officials traveling with President Bush in Tokyo said Mr. Bush is considering asking President Yelstin to meet with him in Washington on Jan. 31.. **********The declaration the summit meeting plans to adopt will affirm the central role of the United Nations in preserving peace and security in the world as cold-war tensions disappear. **********Then the heads of state and government are expected to invite the United Nation's new Secretary General, Boutros Ghali of Egypt, to report back to the Council in two or three months with his recommendations for strengthening the organization's peacemaking and peacekeeping roles based on the provisions of its existing Charter. **********They foresee a more active role for the Secretary General in what is now known as ""preventative diplomacy,"" which means identifying potential trouble spots in advance and intervening before they get out of hand. **********They also think the new Secretary General might want to make more use his right under Article 99 of the Charter to notify the Security Council in advance of any development he thinks ""may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security."" **********The Secretary General will be encouraged to look again at the provisions of the Charter that allow member nations to put their armed forces at the Security Council's disposal ""for the purpose of maintaining international, peace and security."" **********He might also examine the potential role of the moribund Military Staff Committee, a group of senior officers charged with ""the strategic direction of any armed forces placed at the disposal of the Security Council."" **********""If the Secretary General thinks we should revive the Military Staff Committee, then we are prepared to look at that,"" a senior diplomat involved in the summit preparations said today. ""The idea is to move discussion of a new security system out of academic seminars and into the area of governmental negotiation."" **********Finally, the heads of state and government will try to give fresh impetus through their declaration to the disarmament process and particularly to current efforts to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction. **********But the summit conference will also serve various other ends, many diplomats say. The new Russian Government insists it has already taken over the old Soviet position in the United Nations and that the summit conference has no role to play in confirming that decision. **********Nevertheless, the fact that President Yeltsin is seen sitting down with other leaders at this first Security Council summit conference can only reinforce his claim to be the legitimate continuation of the Soviet Union. **********Equally, the presence of Prime Minister Major and President Mitterrand will reinforce the position of Britain and France as permanent Security Council memberswith a veto on decisions at a time when many countries see those privileges as anachronistic."

Yeltsin's reformist Government is in retreat and its radical economic plan is faltering. **********There is a growing sense that the administration of Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who designed Russia's economic reform plan, miscalculated its plans and has lost its authority and bearings. Indications are that the radical reformers are rapidly losing ground to tough directors and managers of state-owned industries who demand a far slower pace of change. **********The shift, however, goes beyond politics or competing power groups, to a spreading sense that the promise of a new era after the fall of the Communist state has been lost, that Russia has lost direction, that authority and even statehood are rapidly eroding.  'Democratic Idea Devalued' **********""The problem is not only the high prices or a shortage of goods,"" said Pavel Voshchanov, who quit in February as Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman. ""The problem is a sense that there is no political or social course. There seemed to be a start toward a civilized market, but now it's faltered -- taxes, corruption, instability, wavering authority, a new decree every day. The democratic idea has been devalued, wars rage along the periphery, the army is disorganized, statehood is collapsing."" **********An official who has advised both former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin, but who asked that he not be identified, recently delivered a personal letter to Mr. Yeltsin in which he warned: ""No doubt remains that the economic-political course of the current Government is at a dead end. The fall of production in conditions of inflation, combined with various political factors, is leading to the uncontrolled regionalization of Russia, to her disintegration."" Yeltsin Losing Popularity **********Mr. Yeltsin himself is feeling the pressure. A new public opinion poll found that Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, an open critic of the Government, had for the first time nudged past Mr. Yeltsin in public trust. **********Mr. Yeltsin's decrees seem increasingly ineffective, and the center seems ever more powerless to halt regional separatism. Production is falling, unpaid bills among enterprises have soared, privatization has been haphazard at best, and many people have not been paid in months. New entrepreneurs feel stymied by taxes, instability, official wavering and rampant corruption. Crime is up, and old power structures are showing new signs of life. **********Among a growing number of intellectuals, economists and politicians, the Government is accused of failing to anticipate the consequences of Mr. Gaidar's radical monetarist policies and of holding too strongly to Western models that some say are inherently unsuitable for Russia. The criticism is in sharp contrast to the favorable comments Mr. Gaidar has received from Western officials, who have been impressed with his bold reforms and detailed knowledge of economic issues. **********Parallel with the spreading disenchantment with Mr. Gaidar has been a rise in the influence of the ""industrial nomenklatura,"" chiefs of the huge state-owned civilian and military industries who proclaim allegiance to the goal of a market economy, but at a slower pace and with renewed government support for their enterprises. **********""If Gaidar controlled 90 percent of government power before, now he has at best 50 or 45 percent,"" said Mikhail L. Berger, a respected political analyst for Izvestia. **********The political shift in course has raised some alarm among radical reformers, who see the managers as products of the old command-economy with a vision of reform that differs fundamentally from Mr. Gaidar's. They also fear that Western donors and investors could be put off if reforms were slowed. **********But the shift has also met with considerable approval from across the political spectrum from people who see in the industrial managers a sorely needed source of competence and experience. **********The poll that found Mr. Rutskoi leading Mr. Yeltsin, published in the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, found that half of those questioned were prepared to back ""experienced managers,"" compared with only 14 percent who were for ""democrats,"" 5 percent for Communists and 3 percent for nationalists. Hard-Liners Attack Yeltsin Team **********Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, one of the original members of Mr. Yeltsin's team, is also under attack from hard-liners who accuse him of giving in too easily to the West, ignoring the interests of ethnic Russians living outside Russia's borders and of sacrificing Russia's traditional allies, like Serbia. There have been reports in Moscow that he is on his way out. **********Mr. Yeltsin has formally continued to support Mr. Gaidar as the acting head of his Government. But in June he named three prominent industrial managers as Deputy Prime Ministers, in effect curtailing Mr. Gaidar's authority and confirming the industrial chiefs as an ascendant force. **********More recently, the President appears to have drawn closer to Arkady I. Volsky, the powerful head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who recently joined in a new political bloc with Vice President Rutskoi and the liberal Democratic Party. Named the Civic Union, the movement has declared itself as a counter both to ""reformist utopians"" and ""neo-Bolsheviks."" **********The influence of the industrialists has been evident in several developments. One was the appointment of the former chairman of the Soviet state bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, as head of the Russian central bank. Another was the grant of two separate credits of 500 billion rubles for industry, despite Mr. Gaidar's longstanding efforts to curtail such credits. **********There is even talk that Mr. Volsky himself, a 60-year-old former department head in the Communist Party Central Committee, could be named the next prime minister, though he has denied such ambitions and has insisted he is prepared to cooperate with the Government. **********The basic platform of the Civic Union is for a strong, democratic government and gradual economic reforms. It shares Mr. Gaidar's commitment to land reforms and privatization, but it calls for a strong interventionist role for the Government in halting the decline of industrial production, including continued subsidies for money-losing factories and enterprises. And it insists that Russia must depend on its own resources, not on Western aid. **********Sergei B Stankevich, formally an adviser to Mr. Yeltsin but increasingly a critic of the Government, said recently that the President was giving ""serious consideration"" to the Volsky program. ""Only an emphasis on our own strength and resources, and gradual and productive reforms carried out by a strong government, can save Russia,"" he said. New Postponement Might Spell Trouble **********The shift of direction could spell further postponement of substantive restructuring, and to large increases in both the budget deficit and rate of inflation. That, in turn, might well set back even further any prospect of a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund -- for which the industrialists have expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm. **********The shift has also raised considerable speculation about a change in government. But in the volatile politics of Russia, nobody is prepared to make a concrete prediction about what might happen next. Mr. Yeltsin might be reluctant to release Mr. Gaidar and risk an open rift with Western creditors, who view the young economist as a dedicated champion of Russia's economic transformation. **********Mr. Gaidar, a former academic and journalist who has shown himself capable of political infighting, has fought back. His spokesman, Aleksei V Ulyukayev, recently rejected charges in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty that the reforms were stalled. **********He said Mr. Gaidar's opponents were often people seeking power, not objective critics. He argued further that the reforms were showing distinct signs of success -- that the economy was being loosened and market relations were forming, that much of what was in trouble had to go in any case, that goods were reappearing, that people were adapting, that the West was increasingly sympathetic. **********Mr. Ulyukayev also acknowledged that Mr. Gaidar was no longer solely in charge. ""The country has a potent force, capable of sweeping away any government,"" he said. ""These are the leaders of enterprises. In part we have to cooperate with them, for their benefit, for us and for the whole Russian economy."" **********A man by all accounts keenly sensitive to his popularity, Mr. Yeltsin has publicly declared he will not let the International Monetary Fund ""dictate"" to Russia. He has also apparently edged away from Mr. Gaidar's premier patron, Gennadi Burbulis, who in the first months after the coup was the President's closest and most influential adviser. **********Beyond politics, the gloomy assessments of the state of the nation are supported by numerous signs of disorder and disarray at all levels of Russian life. Soaring Prices And Unpaid Bills **********On the economic front, a drastic cut in government credits and subsidies resulted not in a desired restructuring, but in a huge accumulation of unpaid bills among enterprises that now total a staggering 500 billion rubles. Production declined by 13 percent in the first six months of the year. **********At the same time, soaring prices have resulted in a dire shortage of paper money, causing salaries simply to go unpaid. The city of Nizhny Novgorod, among others, has decided to compensate by printing its own chits, in one example of the trend toward regionalization of the economy. **********Privatization, whether of land or enterprises, has been marginal, disorganized and riddled with corruption. In Moscow, businessmen looking for office space must first figure out whom to bribe and with how much. **********Starting entrepreneurs complain they are choked by taxes, bribes and usurious interest rates, and any new kiosk or cafe is certain of a visit by racketeers demanding protection money. **********Those who have done well have usually done so through dubious appropriation of state properties, uncontrolled exports of raw materials or imports of basic Western goods. In May, one official said, there were $80 billion in exports, but nobody can say where the money went. **********Many successful businesses have learned to stash their earnings in the West, and some have left altogether. Many Western concerns in Moscow pay for basic services such as rent or news services through transfers to Western bank accounts. **********On the political front, the new authorities have often proved as greedy as their predecessors, grabbing up the black sedans, offices, summer houses and privileges of the Communist elite they replaced. Instead of being disbanded, as Mr. Yeltsin promised, the Ninth Directorate of the K.G.B., which used to supply food and services for the elite, has survived under a new name and is said to be even larger than before. Defeated Forces Are Re-Emerging **********Many other old structures forced into temporary retreat by the collapse of Communism have actively begun to regroup. **********The Rev. Gleb Yakunin, a member of Parliament and former dissident who sits on a parliamentary committee charged with overseeing the Ministry of State Security, said at a recent news conference that his access was being curtailed and he was being accused of ""divulging state secrets."" **********The military has become increasingly assertive, and talk of reductions or a transition to an all-volunteer army have faded. **********The extreme nationalist right and Communist hard-liners have coalesced into a ""brown-red"" bloc that presses its demands with growing impunity. **********The ""democrats"" and intellectuals who flocked to Mr. Yeltsin's banner during the coup have splintered and have abandoned the President in droves, and are all but absent from his entourage. **********The Russian Parliament has evolved under its ambitious Speaker, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, into an unwieldy and often hostile forum that citizens find increasingly irritating. **********Crime has soared. Law enforcement officials reported that 1.3 million crimes were committed in the first six months of the year, compared with 1 million in the first six months of 1991. The biggest increase was in burglaries and property thefts. **********""People do not believe they will be punished any more for committing crimes,"" said Maj. Gen. Vyacheslav Ogorodnikov, head of the Interior Ministry's department for maintaining social order. ""They know the system has broken down, and they are less afraid of this system then they used to be."" **********On a broader front, the Commonwealth of Independent States has remained an amorphous creature. With the possible exception of the three Baltic states, the former republics have become neither really independent nor united, incapable of sorting out their relations and helpless against the ethnic conflicts along their periphery. **********At the same time, the disintegration of the Soviet empire has continued, with smaller regions like Chechenya or Tataria proclaiming autonomy from Russia and disposing of their resources as they see fit. Failure to Foresee Problems Charged **********Nobody denies that much of the chaos was inevitable with the collapse of the all-pervasive Communist order, just as it was inevitable that institutions and interest groups dispersed by the coup would eventually begin to regroup. **********But Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economist whose own earlier plans for reforms were rejected by Mr. Gorbachev, is among those who say Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gaidar failed to foresee many of the current problems. **********""They created a huge potential for opposition,"" he said. ""They had nine months without any opposition, and ended up in a dead end, allowing a dirty opposition to consolidate. There may not be a social explosion, but the consequences are profound. Russia is like a dirty blanket -- shake it and it will fall apart."" **********There are also those who argue that it is too early to dismiss Mr. Gaidar, that the upheavals and policy detours are inevitable aspects of his economic ""shock therapy"" through which Russia has to pass. **********In any case, nobody is prepared yet to charge that Mr. Yeltsin is repeating Mr. Gorbachev's fatal vacillation between reformers and hard-liners. **********There is no suggestion that the industrial managers threaten any return to the old system of centralized economic control. Mr. Volsky and the managers Mr. Yeltsin brought into the Government -- Vladimir Shumeiko, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Georgi Khizha -- all have solid credentials as advocates of a free market system, even if they believe in a slower transition. **********""Gorbachev surrendered reforms; Yeltsin has not yet,"" said Mr. Berger of Izvestia."

They call Mr. Peevey an anomaly in a conservative industry where most executives have engineering or financial backgrounds. **********Mr. Peevey got his start as a government economist. He later worked for organized labor, at a university and for an environmental advocacy group. This year, he helped organize a group of California executives who contributed to Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign. **********Last month, after being passed over for the chairmanship of SCE, Mr. Peevey resigned as president, effective March 1. He has been with the nation's second-largest utility since 1984 and has held the No. 2 post for two years. **********""It's time to go in a new direction,"" Mr. Peevey said last week in an interview from Rome, where he was participating in a trade mission. ""Much after 55, my own drive and anyone else's interest in me would wane."" **********Mr. Peevey declined to be specific about his future, saying only that ""I've always had a strong interest in public service"" and that things should be clearer ""after January."" **********That last statement, and his circumspection, may stem from talk that Mr. Peevey is being considered for Energy Secretary in the Clinton Administration. Warren M. Christopher, the Clinton transition director, is an SCE board member. **********""If I was asked -- and I haven't been -- I'd be flattered,"" Mr. Peevey said. In his tenure at Edison, Mr. Peevey has urged California utilities to rely more on renewable energy and conservation. **********He also was a principal catalyst behind Calstart, an unusual year-old, public-private consortium that hopes to spawn an electric vehicle industry using aerospace technology. Mr. Peevey is its chairman. **********Calstart's prototype vehicle will be displayed at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January. **********""He was the first major executive to embrace and embellish the idea,"" said Lon Bell, Calstart's founding president. Mr. Bell wrote to 411 aerospace firms that had technologies with automotive potential. He received 411 rejections. ""I finally found a receptive audience with Mike Peevey,"" he said."

Now, two years after the collapse of Communism and the resulting wave of disarmament, the Slovak workers who once turned out many of the heavy weapons for Warsaw Pact armies are still awaiting their peace dividend. **********""We once sent 75 percent of our production to the old Soviet Union,,"" said Ivan Juttner, personnel director at the huge Heavy Machinery Works. ""Now it is about 8 percent. This is our reality, and it is having a tremendous effect on employment."" **********The problems at the factory, which employs 80 percent of the work force in this town of 25,000 people, are typical. As Americans experience dismay over military spending cuts that are costing jobs in the midst of a recession, the cutbacks here are threatening to undermine industrialization itself and push this town back into a pattern of farming, a bit of tourism and waves of emigration.  Bitterness Breeds Sarcasm **********The bitterness here over the arms industry is only reinforced when the news reaches the valley that the United States has shipped billions of dollars worth of arms to the Persian Gulf region, while the Government of President Vaclav Havel in distant Prague has ordered Dubnica's arms industry closed down. **********""My compliments to America's arms industry,"" said Stanislav Hajas, an adviser to the management of the Heavy Machinery Works, adding that roughly 5,500 of 16,400 workers have been laid off since 1988. At Dubnica's steel mill, whose 98,000 tons of annual capacity once barely met the needs of assembly lines that turned out heavy armored personnel carriers, workers may soon go on four-day weeks as furnaces shut down. **********Juraj Cervinka, the 52-year old mayor, said some people opened small businesses after 90 percent of Dubnica's stores were privatized. ""Others are leaving, seeking work in Germany,"" he said, ""and an arrangement with the Dutch enables 300 workers to go to Holland."" **********Until now, most of those laid off were women whose husbands remain the family breadwinners, he said. Consequently, the impact has not yet been severe on social services like nursery schools and vacation homes, where budgets have been cut by a quarter in two years. Deja Vu **********Fifty miles to the northeast, at the big arms factories in Martin, management spurned the warnings of Prague policy makers and the objections of Washington and Israel and agreed last September to sell 250 big Soviet-designed T-72 tanks to Syria. In Dubnica, there is no feeling of censure for Martin's rebelliousness, but rather of regret that Dubnica's arms makers lack Middle East contacts from former communist days. **********""When the order came to stop arms production, we had 2 billion crowns in inventory tied up,"" Mr. Hajas noted, adding that all the aid provided this year by cash-strapped Prague totaled only 1.2 billion crowns (about $40 million). **********This is not Dubnica's first conversion. Under the Soviet Government of Nikita S. Khrushchev in the 1950's, assembly lines that were built under Stalin after World War II to make heavy artillery were converted to make construction equipment. But the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 reintroduced arms manufacturing, and brought a prosperity that was intended to wean Czechs and Slovaks from a yearning for freedom. Problems of Scale **********Mr. Hajas says potential investors are often frightened away by Dubnica's sheer size. ""To be frank, our factory is a colossus,"" he says, ""It is fair to say that since the revolution, we've had 2,000 representatives of firms worldwide come through here. But when they see how huge the plants are, and hear that for the conversion of our former products about $500 million would be needed in a short time, nearly everyone has a short discussion and leaves."" **********One that did not is the Reda Corporation, an Oklahoma-based maker of petroleum pumps. In what at first sight appears to be an ideal triangular deal involving Western technology, skilled Slovak labor and customers in the oil fields of western Siberia, Reda has agreed to transfer technology to Dubnica to employ about 1,200 people making drilling pumps that will go to Russia in barter for crude oil."

Indeed, there is also no evidence to suggest that the Iraqis knew of the plot, according to David S. Hattem, Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney's Office in Brooklyn. **********The arms ring is accused of making what Mr. Hattem called a ""sample"" shipment of 100 AK-47 rifles. The rest of the shipment was to be sent at a later date, the Government charges. **********In recent Congressional testimony and interviews, American officials, including the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, have warned that unrest in Eastern Europe and the breakup of the former Soviet Union have left billions of dollars in weapons unaccounted for, creating a vast new supply for arms traffickers. **********Their market includes Iran and Iraq, with Iran alone buying $2 billion in weapons each year, mostly from Russia, China and North Korea, Mr. Gates told Congress last week. **********The arms traders are accused of plotting to skirt United States licensing requirements by falsely labeling shipments as equipment and technology that had nothing to do with weaponry. The plan, say investigators, was to ship the weapons to the United States, then on to Iraq. It was not clear why this route was selected. **********By Mr. Hattem's account, the Government had heard that Ronald Hendron, a businessman from El Toro, Calif., portrayed as the scheme's architect, was involved in high-volume illegal arms sales. Mr. Hattem would not say whether Mr. Hendron had in the past sold weapons to Iraq. **********According to affidavits from the United States Customs Service, sometime in 1991 agents made contact with Mr. Hendron. They pretended to be arms brokers for Iraq, and said they had millions of dollars to spend on everything from missiles and assault rifles, to uranium and bomb triggers. **********Eventually, Mr. Hendron brought in the former Polish Government officials, according to the Government, as well as some former Russian officials who were not charged in the case. **********After months of haggling over price, shipping routes and other details, the agents ultimately agreed to buy 4,000 grenade launchers, 1,000 portable anti-aircraft missiles, and 73,000 assault rifles, according to the affidavits. **********Mr. Hendron was arrested in New York and released after making bail. Attempts to contact him in California yesterday were unsuccessful. However, The Los Angeles Times quoted him as saying he was duped by overzealous Government investigators. **********The former Polish officials were arrested on March 10, shortly after the details of the sales were completed, prosecutors said. Government officials and affidavits described those arrested as Jan Gorecki, United States as a former Polish diplomat in Washington; Wojciech Baranski, former deputy chief of staff in the Polish army; Jerzy Napiorkowski, former deputy minister of finance; Jerzy Brzostek, former deputy minister of the Polish Housing Authority; and Rajmund Szwonder, manager of an arms factory in Poland."

Because of the way local telephone prices are regulated, the rate at which a telephone company writes off its old investment can effectively translate into higher prices for interstate calls. **********Long-distance companies would pay higher access charges to the local telephone companies, and pass them along to customers if the market permitted. Big Addition to Revenue **********The changes could give the local companies hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue in what is now about a $23 billion business. **********Local telephone companies argue that the changes merely give them the freedom they need to keep pace with a host of aspiring rivals, including television companies. And some Federal regulators argue that the incentives are essential in building a 21st-century information ""superhighway"" that can link high-speed computers and deliver hundreds of channels of television. **********But some consumer groups -- and some regulators -- say the changes could end up forcing ordinary customers to foot the bill for risky investments in technology they will never use. **********Though the arguments are highly technical, they affect huge sums of money and could have a crucial impact on the speed with which the country constructs an advanced information infrastructure. **********The nation's large telephone companies currently have about $240 billion of plant and equipment in service. Last year, they wrote off about $18 billion of that investment and spent roughly the same amount in modernizing their networks. For example, the Nynex Corporation, parent of New York Telephone, is spending about $2 billion a year on new equipment. **********The issue of depreciation affects this spending, because of the way rates are regulated. The F.C.C. currently regulates interstate access charges through a system known as price caps. Put simply, prices are kept below a mandated ceiling, and telephone companies are allowed to earn profits up to about 13 percent. Effect of Depreciation **********But if a company's rate of return climbs above that level, it must lower its rates the next year to return half of the additional profit to customers. Big new depreciation expenses prevent this, because they reduce a company's reported profit. For some companies, each additional dollar of depreciation expense can translate into 50 cents of additional revenue that they can keep. **********In its action on Thursday, the commission is expected to ask for comment on a range of options for streamlining and simplifying depreciation rates. Under the most aggressive option, telephone companies would simply be allowed to adopt whatever depreciation schedule they want, but the commission would retain the right to insist on slower schedules. **********Other proposals would greatly reduce the amount of analysis that companies have to provide in justifying their proposed depreciation schedules. At present, telephone companies often submit documents totaling hundreds of pages. **********Several options would give telephone companies broad freedom to select depreciation rates based on ranges established by the Government for different categories of equipment. But the most conservative option would have the Government specify rates."

Council Seats," **********By allowing Russia to take over the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat last week, the three Western powers believe that they have postponed action for several years on demands by Germany, Japan and several large third world countries for permanent membership on the Council. **********Diplomats now say a consensus is forming that the United Nations should not give serious consideration to reviewing the privileged position of the five World War II victors, who hold permanent Security Council seats and a veto over its decisions, before the middle of this decade. **********Britain, which was given the permanent seat in 1945 along with the United States, France, China and the Soviet Union, now wants the Security Council to confirm Russia's enhanced position by holding its first-ever summit meeting this month at the level of heads of state or government. **********Britain has told other permanent members that such a Council summit, coming just as Boutros Ghali takes up his duties as the new Secretary General, would underscore Russia's commitment to working through the United Nations for peace, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, officials say. **********The Bush Administration appears to be supporting the call for a summit meeting, which would be presided over by Prime Minister John Major since Britain holds the Council's rotating presidency in January, American officials said today. But the attitude of France and China is unclear.  Opportunity for Review **********The collapse of the Soviet Union was a logical moment to reopen the United Nations founding charter and review the Security Council's composition, many nations contend. **********But as the Soviet Union disintegrated the United States, with the support of Britain, France and China, moved swiftly, without public debate or any attempt to reopen the Charter, to insure that the former Soviet seat went to Russia as the largest and strongest of the former union's republics. The United States and its allies were able to get their way because their vetoes control all decisions of the Security Council, which must approve its own membership as well as any changes in the United Nations Charter. **********""Frankly, we were lucky the General Assembly wasn't in session,"" a diplomat said. ""Otherwise we might have had howls of fury to contend with."" **********The move, many diplomats say, showed that the five permanent members were determined to resist demands for any far-reaching changes in membership of the Council now that it is starting to act like the guardian of world order it is supposed to be.  Pressure for Change Grows **********The pressure for such changes is growing steadily, with many countries arguing that the privileges still held by the five World War II victors seem anachronistic 50 years later. **********When this year's General Assembly debated the Council's role for the first time in a decade, industrial and developing countries were almost unanimous in saying the Council should be refashioned to represent the realities of today's world, not the world of 1945. **********The countries defeated in the war are also pressing for the Charter to be changed to eliminate discriminatory clauses left over from the war, and this would unleash demands for reforms of the Security Council, too. **********Germany and Japan both say they deserve a permanent Council seat as economic superpowers that are paying a rising share of United Nations bills. **********Since most strife occurs in the developing world, leading third world nations argue that the Council would be a more effective peacemaker if they had permanent representation on it.  Confident of Holding Line **********Nevertheless, the present permanent members appear confident that they can hold the line against change until the middle of the decade, largely because Germany and Japan, the two strongest candidates for new seats, have softened their demands recently. **********Japan's appetite for a permanent seat was appeased somewhat by its election to the Council this year for a two-year term as a rotating member. **********Bonn softened its campaign for a permanent seat when the two Germanys reunited because it feared that such a demand, coming immediately after reunification, might alarm its neighbors. **********One much-discussed change might merge the British and French permanent seats into a single seat for the 12 European Community members, taking care of Germany's aspirations. **********Permanent seats without a veto might then go to Japan and such big developing countries as India, Egypt, Nigeria and Brazil."

That followed a smaller, $465 million decline at an eight-tenths of 1 percent rate in February. **********Installment credit is any type of loan from borrowing for a new car to a personal loan that requires a consumer to pay it back in regular installments. **********In Chicago today, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a banking conference that the drag on the economy from over-indebted consumers was waning. **********Consumers fuel about two-thirds of national economic activity by purchasing goods and services, but consumption was restrained last year as a trend toward cutting debt loads became apparent. **********The restraint continued in March, with consumers paying off $263 million more in outstanding auto loans than they took out in new ones. That followed a $489 million reduction in auto credit in February. **********Similarly, in a category the Fed calls other loans, which includes all sorts of personal bank loans but not home mortgages, a huge $1.45 billion was paid off in March. In February, consumers reduced these loan balances by $721 million. **********There was a slight expansion in outstanding credit-card debt, which grew by $55 million in March after a $1.14 billion increase in February, the Fed said. **********Outstanding credit for buying mobile homes was up by $53 million in March.

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/07/business/bush-seeks-rules-to-lift-sales-of-gas.html,Matthew Wald,1992-03-07,,742,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bush Seeks Rules to Lift Sales of Gas,Bush Seeks Rules to Lift Sales of Gas," **********President Bush announced his support yesterday for four regulatory changes that he said would raise demand for natural gas and help an industry that has been badly hurt by low prices. **********The gas industry applauded the announcement, which came shortly before the primary election in Texas, a leading gas-producing state. But environmentalists and consumer advocates said it was not clear whether the changes, all of them under discussion in Washington for months or years, would mean that more gas would be sold, at least in the near future. They also said that one proposed change could cut gas sales and increase pollution. **********The changes are intended to lower costs or remove regulatory barriers. They could result in greater use of natural gas in cars and power plants. 2 Problems Not Addressed **********Edwin Rothschild, an energy expert at Citizen Action, a consumer organization, said some of the proposed changes were desirable because they would promote use of natural-gas vehicles, lowering pollution and reliance on imported oil. But the natural-gas industry's real problems, he said, are two phenomena beyond White House control: warm weather and recession. **********""I don't see this as stimulating a lot of demand quickly,"" he said. **********But the president of the American Gas Association, Michael Baly 3d, said his industry was ""deeply grateful."" **********Possibly the least controversial proposal was the President's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency would soon issue an emissions standard for natural-gas vehicles that would help them compete. Federal standards for gasoline vehicles set a limit on hydrocarbon emissions as a way to control smog, but proponents of natural-gas vehicles complain that natural gas itself, while a hydrocarbon, is not an ingredient of smog. So the E.P.A. will issue a standard for emissions of hydrocarbons other than natural gas. **********There are now no standards for the vehicles. Mr. Baly of the gas association said yesterday, ""If you want to start mass-producing these, major equipment manufacturers want a standard."" A Greenhouse Gas **********But even if emissions of unburned natural gas do not contribute to smog, they are still a pollutant, environmentalists say, because natural gas is a greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. **********David G. Hawkins, an air-pollution expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that allowing natural-gas emissions because they did not cause smog was ""an example of tunnel vision,"" adding, ""You could say the same thing about CFC's,"" which destroy the earth's protective layer of ozone. **********The White House also said that the environmental agency would change the rules on when changes to a power plant become so extensive that the plant is considered new, and therefore subject to stricter pollution standards. Named after a case involving the Wisconsin Electric Power Company, the ""Wepco fix"" -- as it is known on Capitol Hill -- would allow utilities to make major changes to dirty old plants without becoming subject to the strict regulations governing new ones. But the fix was rejected by Congress in the debate over the Clean Air Act. **********If utilities were not subject to rules on new sources of pollution, according to the gas industry, they might take inexpensive steps that would significantly reduce pollution, like ""co-firing"" coal with natural gas. In co-firing -- when the two fuels are burned together in the boiler -- chemical reactions reduce the total pollution, although the plant is still dirtier than a new one. The Opposite Case **********But environmentalists say the Wepco fix might not help gas sales at all. Without it, they say, many utilities would be forced to scrap dirty coal-fired plants and build new ones that run entirely on gas; with the fix, they can continue to rely heavily on coal. **********A third change would give gas-pipeline companies the option to be regulated under an incentive system, rather than the cost-based system that now prevails, but the details have not been established. **********A fourth would remove a regulatory wrinkle that some people have said could hurt natural-gas vehicles: the issue of interstate regulation. In theory, according to some natural-gas executives, if a car were fueled with natural gas in one state and driven to another, the sale would be interstate and thus subject to Federal regulation, although in practice the issue has not arisen, experts said. **********The proposed change would make it clear that sales of natural gas for vehicles were not subject to Federal regulation."

Oliver, executive vice president of worldwide customer operations. **********Mr. Oliver is no stranger to setbacks at Federal Express, which has had a string of failed experiments in recent years as it tried to expand beyond its bread-and-butter domestic delivery business. In 1986, for example, he was responsible for deciding to pull the plug on the company's Zapmail electronic mail service. **********""He's their resident troubleshooter,"" said Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. **********This time around, Mr. Oliver said, the company's problems included trying to compete with larger operators in Europe -- DHL International, TNT Ltd. and the United Parcel Service -- in a doomed effort that only drove down prices in a market noted for the high cost of doing business. ""Everything is just very expensive over there,"" Mr. Oliver said. **********The company is not bowing out of Europe altogether, however. It will continue to fly overnight between major European cities and its Memphis base, enabling it to offer next-day delivery between the continents. And it will subcontract local deliveries in areas outside the 16 European cities where it will retain offices, down from 125 now. **********Federal Express currently has no grand new plans, said the 51-year-old Mr. Oliver, who joined the company in 1978 as vice president of marketing and was appointed to his current post last October. **********That sits just fine with some analysts, who said they hoped the company would focus more on its core operations, like the profitable United States market where it owns roughly half the overnight-delivery business. **********But the stock gyrated last week after the announcement -- up $1.75 on Tuesday, down $6 Wednesday, up $2.25 Thursday and down 25 cents Friday, closing the week at $51.25. **********Mr. Murphy attributed the swings in part to the company's unwillingness to predict how much the restructuring will save.

And few people are likely ever to read it. **********The intended audience is computers. The nine-year Electronic Dictionary Project, on which Japan's Government and industry are expected to spend more than $100 million, is developing a dictionary to help machines understand English and Japanese. The main purpose is to help computers translate documents from one language to another. **********""I don't think you can find a dictionary as thorough as ours,"" boasted Toshio Yokoi, the general manager of the Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute, the organization carrying out the project. Mr. Yokoi's institute has adopted a Lincolnesque slogan: ""Dictionaries of computers, by computers and for computers.""  Although researchers in Europe and the United States are watching the project with interest and are already starting similar efforts, the work is seen as a strategic technology by the Japanese, for whom business must frequently be conducted in a foreign language. **********A little-known outgrowth of Japan's more famous Fifth Generation Computer Project, which is now winding down, the electronic dictionary effort could give computerized translation a big boost. Or instead, like the decade-long Fifth Generation campaign, it might come to be regarded as a futile attempt to make computers do more than they are capable of doing. Until March, when a prototype of the dictionary is ready, it will be hard to tell. **********Because the electronic lexicon is meant to be read by computers, it must contain more, and more fundamental, information than normal dictionaries. A person reading a dictionary, for example, can understand the definition of ""bird"" as a winged animal that can usually fly. But for a computer to understand the same definition, it must also be told what an animal is, what a wing is, and what it means to fly. Frames of Reference **********Therefore, in addition to 300,000 words and their meanings in both English and Japanese, the electronic dictionary will contain more than 400,000 concepts, like those of ""animal"" and ""flying,"" in an attempt to give the computer frames of reference that people take for granted.  In Japan, computers are already used to translate documents from one language to another. Most computer companies sell such translation systems, using less detailed dictionaries they developed themselves. Computers can perform rough translations of foreign technical papers or patents into Japanese, allowing researchers to determine whether a fuller translation is desirable. **********The translations can be no more than rough because the computer systems have trouble choosing the correct definition when a word has more than one meaning. Researchers all have their favorite stories, such as how a computer translated the expression ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" into the foreign-language equivalent of ""invisible, insane."" Better Translations **********In theory, at least, having a more complete and sophisticated dictionary should allow for better translations. Such electronic dictionaries could also prove essential for other tasks that would involve computers' understanding of human or ""natural"" language. In the future, experts predict, computers will be able to understand speech, to read an article and prepare a summary, to retrieve articles on a given topic from a data base more accurately than can be done today, and to write original compositions on an assigned topic. **********The closest equivalent to the dictionary project in the United States is the Cyc research effort led by Douglas Lenat at the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium in Austin, Tex. That project, whose name is short for encyclopedia, involves trying to give a computer common sense by feeding it millions of rules and assertions that people don't think twice about -- such as that a child is never older than its parents, or that people usually cannot see through walls. **********This past spring, a new Linguistic Data Consortium was formed at the University of Pennsylvania with a $5 million grant from the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa. The consortium, which is recruiting corporate and university members, plans to develop shared data bases of words and sounds that could be used for speech recognition and machine translation. American and Japanese researchers also plan to hold their first joint workshops on electronic dictionaries, tentatively scheduled for January in Washington. Combining Several Dictionaries **********The Electronic Dictionary Project in Japan, which will last until 1994, is funded 70 percent by the Japan Key Technology Center, a Government agency that invests some of the proceeds from the privatization of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, which was once a Government-owned phone monopoly. The other 30 percent is financed by eight Japanese computer companies. **********The project actually consists of several types of dictionaries that are to be used in combination to provide the best translations. Most basic are the word dictionaries, one for English and one for Japanese, that contain the basic words, grammatical information and the words' basic concepts. **********The concept is then better defined in the concept dictionary, which is designed to give the computer a better grasp of the word's meaning.  Concepts are described in two ways. One is as part of a hierarchy. A sparrow, for instance, is a type of bird, which is a type of animal. The computer can then deduce that if birds can fly, then sparrows can fly. **********The second way is to describe the relationships of various concepts to one another. For instance, a bird is a thing that flies, a wing is an implement for flying, and the sky is a place for flying. Same in Both Languages **********The concept dictionary is the same for both English and Japanese, since the concept of bird is the same whether it is labeled ""bird"" or ""tori."" **********A third type of dictionary in the project contains information on words that often appear together in sentences. This dictionary contains the information that chicken is roasted and bread is toasted, for example. **********The fourth dictionary is bilingual, English to Japanese and Japanese to English, each containing 300,000 words. **********Eventually, the entire compilation, containing 600 megabytes of information -- the equivalent of 75 million words -- will be published on one or two CD-ROM's, a type of compact disk used to store computer data. Will Effort Pay Off? **********The big question is whether the huge effort will be worth it. **********""In the past they were in a trial-and-error period,"" said Makoto Nagao, a professor of electrical engineering at Kyoto University who is considered Japan's foremost expert on natural-language processing. The project, he said, is now trying to move ahead more quickly. ""They are in a very important period this year."" **********No small part of the challenge is to get eight competing companies to cooperate while each is simultaneously pursuing its own translation projects in hopes of developing products that can be marketed. **********""We are working together,"" said Dr. Michiyuki Uenohara, executive adviser to the NEC Corporation, one of the participating companies. ""But behind the scenes fighting each other."""

'We Have All Suffered' **********""In this country, we have all suffered and changed, including them, the rich,"" Mr. Melendez said. **********It is common today to see Mr. Melendez, Ms. Martinez and other former commanders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in the halls of power and at polite social events. **********At one big gathering, Shafick Handal, the Marti Front leader who is most pained at the collapse of the Soviet bloc, exchanged hugs and had a long chat with Vice President Francisco Merino, who comes from the far-right wing of the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance. **********The Marti Front became a political party on Dec. 14, just hours before the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, declared the Salvadoran war to be officially over. But the group's leaders have been behaving like politicians since they came home from Mexico almost a year ago, when the cease-fire began. Guerrilla Radio in Mainstream **********Radio Venceremos and Radio Farabundo Marti, the two guerrilla stations that used to broadcast from the hills on short wave, now have studios in the city and a spot on the FM dial. They broadcast commercials purchased by the Government and send their reporters to ask the tough questions at President Alfredo Cristiani's news conferences. **********In the town of Villa Victoria, in the hard-scrabble Cabanas province, Mayor Carlos Leon Garcia, another member of the governing party, moves freely, and on friendly terms, into the ex-guerrilla compound at Santa Marta, whose residents are part of his district. **********Mayor Garcia, whose background as a schoolteacher puts him far beneath the economic level that many associate with his party, fled to Los Angeles for five years at the height of the war because of death threats and was grateful to find a job as a truck driver there after two years of looking. **********He now administers the municipality of about 25,000 people out of a city hall that is still not fully restored from the three times the guerrillas set it afire. But in his new, civilized relationship with the followers of the Marti Front, he says, ""I haven't considered it prudent to remind them of those actions."" Big Public Works Program **********He also runs a half-million-dollar public works program that hires area residents -- including, he says, former guerrillas -- to build dirt roads and is helping bring electricity and other services to Santa Marta and other parts of the municipality. **********It is this program, financed largely with American and other international aid, that contributes to the sense of progress and hope in Villa Victoria and in most of the country, where vast amounts of public and private construction are under way. **********Although most of the images of the Salvadoran conflict remembered abroad are linked to killings and other abuses of civilians, particularly by the armed forces, the former guerrillas today are more concerned with integrating themselves economically than trying to collect a bill for the past. **********Mr. Melendez showed little concern, for instance, that the Government's promised purge of the armed forces' upper ranks on human rights grounds is not moving forward at full speed.  Instead, he gave the armed forces backhanded praise for what he saw as the significant transformation they have undergone under United States tutelage. Some Praise for U.S. **********""Even if they don't want to change, the rest of society has changed and the military can't be used as it was before,"" he said. ""The United States is not a saint, but it made an effort to give the armed forces a more modern view and worked to inculcate respect for human rights."" **********""They have not changed so much as to be able to declare that the change is permanent,"" he said. ""That will be the case only when other conditions in the country make it clear to the military that there is no alternative."" **********Most leaders of the Marti Front have embraced private property rights and the idea of business development and growth with the kind of zeal and confidence they once showed toward Marxist analysis of social and economic issues. **********""Our conclusion is that the market is a natural force,"" Mr. Melendez said. ""The market is not the enemy. It has modernized and internationalized. To deny the phenomenon of the market is to deny part of social development."" **********""The problem is not in the market,"" he said, ""but in the fact that some have property and others do not. We need many more property owners, which would democratize the economy."" Level Field Sought **********Mr. Palomo, the industrialist, does not challenge that assertion. But he shows concern about how quickly, and by what means, the former guerrillas want to leapfrog to positions of economic power. In essence, he is willing to work toward creation of a level playing field, but the former guerrillas want affirmative action. **********The dispute over guerrilla land claims around the country is not fully worked out, even though the Government is committed to providing land and homesites for those who want to farm and is engaged now in making such transfers. **********But some guerrilla leaders want much more than land for subsistence farming. They want a stretch of coastline to develop for tourism, and they talk of property transfers being made to the front or its organizations in some collective way that would enable them to control a significant chunk of property from the start. **********Mr. Palomo's ideas about how economic success is achieved are linked to more conventional concepts: education, training, inspiration and years of hard work. Employs 10,000 People **********Although born into a landed family, he set out on his own at 25, starting a shoe factory with 60 workers. Today, at 66, he employs some 10,000 people throughout Central America, and his company, Adoc, exports around the world. **********In the mid-1980's, concerned that most skilled tradesmen and many white-collar workers had fled to the United States because of the war, Mr. Palomo and 13 other businessmen created the Business Foundation for Educational Development to train new people. **********""We also knew that the war would end eventually, and we were concerned about the fact that the only training many of the youth in the country were getting during their formative years was in assault tactics,"" he said. **********Starting out with contributions of about $25,000 from each of the 14 founders, the foundation later received $14 million in help from the United States Agency for International Development and has since provided training by experts for nearly 40,000 laborers and tradesmen and more than 10,000 managers. Special Programs Nationwide **********With the end of the war, it created special programs in every province to reach out to former combatants from both sides as well as the so-called ""masses"" from the guerrilla side -- people of all ages who followed the guerrilla camps and provided logistical support. **********The courses, lasting up to five months, offer management training and instruction in market economics, small business organization, auto mechanics, sewing and carpentry. The last is especially popular because many of the former guerrillas expect to have to build their own houses on land they are receiving under the peace accords. **********The objective, Mr. Palomo says, is to ""take away the tricks they learned during the war and teach them to work."" **********Mr. Melendez, who recently spent three weeks at a management seminar in Costa Rica affiliated with Harvard University, says the goal is ""to do a lot of small things to gain experience, and when we have experience, we can come together to do bigger things."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/14/business/commercial-test-of-gene-therapy.html,Andrew Pollack,1992-02-14,,1532,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Commercial Test of Gene Therapy,Commercial Test of Gene Therapy," **********A Federal review panel has cleared the way for the first commercial test of gene therapy, a potentially revolutionary technique that could cure hereditary diseases and might also help in fighting diseases like AIDS and cancer. **********The Recombinant Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health, which oversees gene therapy experiments, on Tuesday gave permission to researchers associated with the Targeted Genetics Corporation of Seattle to implant genetically modified cells into patients with AIDS in hopes of helping them fight the disease. The test had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  Marking a Milestone **********Targeted Genetics, which is a subsidiary of the Immunex Corporation, a biotechnology company, said it would be the first clinical trial of gene therapy to be run by a company. The test would mark a milestone on the way to commercialization, which could come in the second half of this decade. **********There have been several previous tests of gene therapy, but they have been run by individual physicians, such as those associated with the National Institutes of Health. Another company, Genetic Therapy Inc., while not having organized its own clinical trials, has been collaborating with and supplying materials to most of these researchers, such as Dr. W. French Anderson at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. **********Gene therapy involves implanting genes, which provide the hereditary instructions that control the body's features and functions, into patients. A hemophiliac, for instance lacks the ability to produce factors that cause the blood to clot. With gene therapy, such a patient could be given genes to allow him to produce the clotting factor, thereby doing away with the need for periodic injections. **********""If you're really doing the right kind of job, one kind of gene therapy application would cure a patient for a lifetime,"" said K. Michael Forrest, president of Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., a gene therapy company in Cambridge, Mass. **********Sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis are other hereditary diseases that gene therapy could potentially cure. Even for nonhereditary diseases, genes could be implanted to allow the body to make chemicals that would otherwise have to be given as drugs. **********""This is a whole new way of delivering medicine,"" said John Archer, executive vice president of the Somatix Therapy Corporation, a gene therapy company in Alameda, Calif. **********Gene therapy has attracted a host of start-up companies of which two -- Somatix and Genetic Therapy, of Gaithersburg, Md., -- have already issued stock publicly. And some big drug companies, led by Sandoz Ltd. are also getting involved, in part by alliances with smaller companies.  Others Plan Trials **********Others will enter clinical trials this year as well. Viagene Inc., based in San Diego, plans to apply for permission to begin clinical trials on AIDS patients in March and Somatix hopes to begin testing the technique in cancer patients later this year. Vical Inc., of San Diego, also plans to begin a trial on AIDS patients before the end of the year. **********But despite its promise, gene therapy faces an inordinate number of safety, technical and marketing issues before it can become a successful treatment. **********""It's one thing to treat individual patients,"" said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, editor of Bioventure View, a newsletter that follows biotechnology. ""It's quite another to come up with a commercially successful product."" **********Ideally, for example, pharmaceutical companies would like to sell genes in a jar or a syringe, like any other drug, that could be injected into a patient. **********But gene therapy as currently practiced is far more cumbersome. It involves removing skin cells, blood cells or other types of cells from a patient, growing those cells in a culture, putting genes into them and then putting the cells back into the body. **********Such a complex procedure is not likely to be used except for serious diseases. Moreover, such a procedure makes gene therapy more of a service business than a traditional pharmaceutical business, perhaps requiring gene therapy companies to set up their own clinics. **********Another looming business issue is the ownership of genes. Many of the companies working on gene therapy do not have patent rights to genetic sequences that could be useful in treatment, forcing them to license them from companies that do. **********But perhaps a bigger obstacle is safety. As now generally practiced, viruses, which have the ability of inserting their own genetic material into target cells, are used as genetic delivery vehicles. The virus's own genetic material is removed and replaced by the therapeutic gene, like the gene to produce the blood clotting factor needed by hemophiliacs. The virus is also rendered incapable of reproducing and causing an infection. **********There are two main risks with this. One stems from the fact that the virus inserts the new genetic material at random into the chromosomes of the target cell. There is a chance that the viral genes could land on top of a cancer-suppressing gene and inactivate it, or land on top of a cancer-causing gene and turn it on. **********A second risk is that the viral delivery van could somehow become active again, or become contaminated with active viruses. Researchers say that both risks are extremely small. **********Concerns were stirred in December when Dr. Arthur Nienhuis, chief of the clinical hematology branch at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, reported that three of eight monkeys involved in a gene therapy experiment developed fast-growing cancers, apparently because of the virus used. **********Dr. Nienhuis and other experts said that the disabled viruses were known in advance to be contaminated with viruses capable of replication. In human trials, testing is done to make sure the viruses cannot replicate themselves. Still, the results were disquieting because it had always been believed that the viruses used, while capable of infecting mice, would not cause disease in humans and other primates. **********""The Achilles' heel of this gene therapy thing is the safety issue,"" said Richard Bock of Sutro & Company in Los Angeles, who thinks it will be hard for companies using the virus approach to win approval for their therapies. These companies are Genetic Therapy, Somatix, Viagene and Targeted Genetics, which will be spun out into a separate company in which Immunex will retain a minority stake. **********These companies point out that all medical treatments carry some risks and that they are confident safety problems can be overcome. **********In the trial approved Tuesday for Targeted Genetics, doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle will remove white blood cells from patients with AIDS who have undergone bone marrow transplants. The cells, known as killer T cells, will be genetically altered, multiplied and put back in the body to attack the AIDS virus. **********But the genetic alteration of the T cells will not make them better at fighting AIDS, although that is the ultimate goal. In the first trial the cells will be given a marker gene to allow them to be traced in the body. The implanted gene will also serve as a ""suicide gene"" that will make those cells susceptible to being killed by a common antibiotic. That way, if the implanted cells cause harm, they can be destroyed, said Dr. Philip Greenberg, who is the lead investigator. **********Viagene also hopes to use genetic therapy to fight AIDS. If plans to genetically alter skin cells so that they produce a protein found on the outer coat of the AIDS virus. The skin cells, once introduced back in the body, would produce the AIDS virus protein and stimulate an immune response. **********Somatix plans to begin clinical trials this year of a treatment for cancer. Cells from a patient's tumor would be genetically altered to produce certain immune-stimulating chemicals in hopes of stimulating a stronger immune attack on the cancer. **********Other companies are working on gene therapies that do not involve viruses. But these are in an earlier stage of development. **********Transkaryotic Therapies and Cell Genesys of Foster City, Calif. are developing nonviral ways of implanting genes into cells taken from the body. , **********Vical has found that genetic material can be injected directly into muscle cells, doing away both with viruses and with the need to remove cells and reimplant them. **********Targetech Inc., based in Meriden, Conn., is developing a technique to allow genes to be injected and to find their way to a proper organ. The company hopes, for instance, to implant genes to make the liver more effective in cleaning cholesterol out of the bloodstream. **********But injecting genes directly into the body could also pose risks because it might not be easy to control what the genes do. When cells are removed from the body to be genetically altered it is possible to study what happens to the cells first before putting them back."

Union Carbide blamed employee sabotage for the explosion while the Government has charged the company with negligent design, construction and operation of the plant. The Bhopal plant was part of an agricultural chemicals business that Union Carbide sold to Rhone Poulenc of France in 1986. **********Yesterday's announcement involved Union Carbide's 50.9 percent stake in Union Carbide India Ltd., India's largest producer of consumer batteries. The Indian Government currently owns about 25 percent of Union Carbide India and the rest is publicly held, according to Robert Berzok, a Union Carbide spokesman. The Indian company has 9,000 employees and is a remnant of Union Carbide's Eveready/Energizer battery subsidiary, the rest of which was sold to the Ralston Purina Company in 1986. **********Robert D. Kennedy, Union Carbide's chairman and chief executive, said that the company was looking for a buyer for Union Carbide India to provide new battery technology and additional jobs. . **********The decision to sell the unit followed last October's ruling by India's Supreme Court affirming a 1989 agreement that fixed Union Carbide's total civil liability for the Bhopal explosion at $470 million. The court called on the company to live up to its previously announced plan to spend the equivalent of about $17 million on the hospital. **********The company said that a charitable trust based in London was set up March 20 to receive the $17 million and finance the hospital for eight years. Union Carbide will retain any sum from the stock sale in excess of $17 million. **********The decision to leave India comes as many other multinationals are moving into the huge but poor nation. The Indian Government has begun to relax its restrictions on foreign investment and move toward freer markets. **********The courts have by no means closed their books on the Bhopal tragedy. The same Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the civil settlement cleared the way for prosecutors to proceed with criminal charges of negligent homicide against Warren Anderson, Union Carbide's chairman and chief executive in 1984, and local company executives. An Indian court issued a warrant for Mr. Anderson's arrest and authorized prosecutors to seek an extradition order on March 27.  Action Called Outrage **********Union Carbide called the action an outrage, but it is not expected that Mr. Anderson, who is now retired, will ever end up in an Indian court. Union Carbide is more worried about possible charges faced by Indian executives in this highly politicized case. **********The company has also complained that Indian courts have been too slow to start compensating victims from the funds it supplied in 1989. Tens of thousands of victims began receiving payments of $12 a month two years ago, but huge numbers of the 500,000 Bhopal residents classified as eligible have not been paid."

But creating a broadcast-quality video with a personal computer is complicated and costly. The problem is that computer monitors and televisions involve different technologies, and expensive conversion equipment may be required. Next month, however, a device will appear in stores that will allow almost anyone with an Apple Macintosh to create high-quality video productions using nothing more than a pair of standard VCR's. **********The product, Videovision, from Radius Inc. of San Jose, Calif., is the most powerful device of its kind. At $2,400, it offers better performance for the price than previous solutions. It can produce flicker-free video output in true color at up to 30 frames a second, the speed of television broadcasts. Videovision consists of an add-in digital video interface card with 24-bit graphic display capabilities, slots for video input and output and an external connector panel for video and audio devices. **********According to Radius's president and chief executive, Barry James Folsom, Videovision will be sold with Action, a multimedia presentation graphics program from Macromedia Inc., and Videoshop, video production software from the Diva Corporation. **********According to Tom Thompson, senior technical editor at large for Byte magazine, Videovision is unique in being able to convert computer-based 24-bit video output to 16-bit TV video on the fly, saving users a step that can take many tries to get right. He said that while other products competed with Videovision on some levels, none could match it feature for feature."

He said the committee was taking legal action to stop such marketing. **********But it was unclear if he was referring to the Olympic-flavored advertising campaign that American Express introduced Sunday.

The campaign was created by Chiat/Day/ Mojo Inc. and Ogilvy & Mather New York. **********Frank Vaccaro, an American Express spokesman in New York, said his company knew of no legal action against the campaign.

The board's members are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England, Britain's central bank. **********Mr. Large would not disclose details about the regulatory organization's failure to detect that the investment-management firms owned by Robert Maxwell had apparently been used to siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars in assets from the pension funds of Maxwell companies. To do so might prejudice criminal trials, he said. **********The board said the self-examination by the regulatory organization concluded that its monitoring system was inadequate and that it was ""unduly ready to rely on the good faith and professionalism"" of people at the investment firms. Inadequate Response **********The regulatory organization also concluded that its systems for analyzing the information that it did receive and for assessing potential risks at the firms had failed. ""There was information available that wasn't acted on,"" Mr. Large said. **********Finally, the regulatory organization said it had responded inadequately when the dimensions of the scandal became apparent after Mr. Maxwell's death on Nov. 5. **********The Securities and Investments Board said it was more critical of the regulatory organization's performance than the organization was itself and considered disbanding it. Instead, the board decided that the regulatory organization should be strengthened. **********Citing the criticism of the regulatory organization's supervision of the Maxwell investment-management firms, the organization's chairman resigned last month. The Securities and Investments Board said the regulatory organization's chief executive would also step down soon. Increased Pressure **********Regulators' admission that they inadequately oversaw the Maxwell firms has increased the pressure on the Conservative Government to make up the large deficits in the pension funds. Michael Meacher, an official of the opposition Labor Party, said, ""The Government must now accept that it has a responsibility to make up the Maxwell pensions' losses in full and without delay."" **********The Securities and Investments Board plans to review the mechanisms by which auditors may pass information to regulators.

Now they are practically being crowded off the beach by a lengthening list of mainstream marketers that find frolicking college students a receptive audience for pitches about cars, movies, fragrances, even shampoo. **********The trend, which began about a decade ago, has been accelerating, as a glance at the names involved in spring break 1992 would attest. Among them: Chanel and Jovan, for fragrances; Chevrolet, for its Geo line; Procter & Gamble, for Pringles snack chips and Prell shampoo, and Columbia Pictures, for various films due later this year. **********It is estimated that two million college students, about 40 percent of the nationwide total, will make the annual pilgrimage to places like Daytona Beach and Panama City Beach, Fla.; South Padre Island, Tex., and Palm Springs, Calif. **********This year, spring break will continue through Easter, April 19. But even now it is reaching full swing; MTV's annual spring break coverage begins Friday, sponsored by seven companies, like Procter & Gamble, Chrysler's Dodge division and Coca-Cola. **********. . . **********The advertising, marketing and promotional events being sponsored at spring break's warm-weather beach and resort sites have become an important component of marketers' continuing efforts to reach consumers in the 18-to-24 age bracket. Motivating companies to aim messages at that prime market are data showing these consumers to be affluent and free-spending, enthusiastic to try new things and still forming brand preferences. **********""It's a huge mistake to assume they always know about your products and their heritage,"" said Arie Kopelman, president and chief operating officer of Chanel Inc. in New York. ""We're so familiar with Coco Chanel, we often forget a lot of people think 'Chanel' is just a company name."" **********So, for the first time, Chanel is participating in spring break events on behalf of its Egoiste men's fragrance. Students can try to win prizes by playing a game that features a 20-foot-by-20-foot replica of the hotel from which women bombastically shout ""Egoiste!"" in a familiar Chanel television commercial.                    . . . **********Geo, the small, inexpensive cars sold by Chevrolet dealers primarily to younger, first-time buyers, has joined Chanel at Spring Break Fest, a promotional event held annually at Daytona Beach by the Market Source Corporation of Cranbury, N.J. Students can visit ""Club Geo"" tents at which they can get massages or manicures, try their voices at karaoke contests and take test drives in Geo models like the Metro, Storm or Tracker. **********Reaching a college-age consumer at spring break is the equivalent of reaching older consumers at a baseball park, or families at an amusement park, said Mike Valerio, Chevrolet's manager of passenger car sales promotion in Warren, Mich. **********""It's a relaxed environment that lends itself to a positive frame of mind,"" he explained, as compared with seeking a test drive at a dealership from ""people who have a vested interest in selling you a product relatively soon."" (To insure that all test drivers are fit to take the wheel, students 18 and older must pass a motor-skills test, produce a valid driver's license -- and wear shoes, as required by Florida law.)                    . . . **********Michael Hogan, president of Hogan Communications in Burbank, Calif., a company specializing in college and youth marketing, said spring break offered a concentrated audience: ""Companies that try to reach college students throughout the year have got to go to the campuses. The ability at spring break to reach students from all over the country in one place makes it an ideal situation."" **********Mr. Hogan is promoting four of Columbia's coming youth-oriented movies, including ""A League of Their Own,"" a story of World War II-era female baseball teams, starring Tom Hanks and Madonna.

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/22/business/market-place-bulls-vs-bears-the-super-bowl.html,Floyd Norris,1992-01-22,,827,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; Bulls vs. Bears: The Super Bowl,Market Place; Bulls vs. Bears: The Super Bowl," **********CAN the Super Bowl forecast the stock market? Can the stock market forecast the Super Bowl? **********Anyone who seriously thinks the answer to either question might be yes should probably find someone else to make investment decisions. Nonetheless, the Super Bowl has become one of Wall Street's best known, if least respected, market indicators. **********The indicator is finishing another brilliant year of forecasting. Last year's Super Bowl, in which a last-minute field goal attempt went wide and deprived the Buffalo Bills of victory, forecast a bullish stock market for the following year. And sure enough, from the Super Bowl until now, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 21.2 percent. **********If the Washington Redskins win this Sunday's game against the Bills, that would be interpreted as a bullish indicator, forecasting another year of rising share prices. Bulls may take heart, although they probably should not, from a less well-known indicator that uses the stock market to forecast the Super Bowl. That indicator, based on what stock prices do from the end of November until the game, is forecasting a Redskins victory. **********The theory behind the better-known Super Bowl indicator is that a victory by a team from the old National Football League forecasts rising prices, while one from the old American Football League foretells falling prices. The winner last year was the New York Giants, an old N.F.L. team, and that forecast a winning year for stocks. **********The indicator has worked in 22 of 25 years so far, with the losers being in 1970, when a Kansas City Chiefs (A.F.L.) victory was nonetheless followed by a winning year on Wall Street; 1987, when a victory by the Giants failed to foresee the October crash; and 1990, when stock prices ended down marginally despite the victory by the San Francisco 49ers. **********That record, showing correct forecasts 88 percent of the time, is as much an indication of the ability of numbers to be manipulated as it is of anything else. There was, of course, no Super Bowl theory early in the game's existence. But it was soon noted that prices had risen after the first two games, won by the Green Bay Packers of the old N.F.L., and fallen after the third, won by the New York Jets of the old A.F.L. **********When the two leagues were combined, some N.F.L. teams were moved to the American Football Conference. By some accounts, the first theory lumped those teams together with the former A.F.L. ball clubs, but that was quickly revised after prices rose in 1971, 1975 and 1976, following victories by old N.F.L. transplants. **********That reclassification is somewhat typical of what compilers of more conventional stock market indicators have been known to do, in seeking a good record for an indicator. **********Some compilers of the Super Bowl theory dispute that 1987 was a failure. By using full-year numbers, they say that the Giants victory forecast a rising year for the Dow, and it was indeed up for the year. The trouble with this interpretation is that all of the year's gain came in January before the game was played. The minimum rule for any indicator is that it should forecast the future, not the past, which is why this column looks at market performance between Super Bowl games. **********Any market forecaster not satisfied with an 88 percent success rate, however, can do better by making the indicator more complicated. Here is a rule with a 100 percent success rate: If the indicator is bullish, check prices at the end of June, and if they are up, sell out. If they are not, wait for the entire year. That rule would have produced profits in every year, since prices moved in the appropriate direction through June in each of the three years that the more general indicator failed. **********It was in the spirit of making the numbers work that this column unveiled, three years ago, a way to forecast the Super Bowl using stock prices. The idea is that if stock prices are up from the end of November through Super Bowl Sunday, the team representing the later city, listed alphabetically, will win. On the other hand, lower stock prices mean that the team from the earlier city, alphabetically speaking, will win. **********When this indicator was unveiled, it had worked in 12 of the previous 14 years. Since then, it has a record of two of three, having correctly forecast victories by the San Francisco 49ers in 1989 and the New York Giants last year, but having wrongly thought the Denver Broncos could beat San Francisco in 1990. That brings its record to 14 of 17, for a success rate of 82 percent. **********This year, the Dow is up 11.4 percent since the end of November, so it seems clear by this indicator that Washington will beat Buffalo on Sunday."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/07/world/japan-admits-it-set-up-army-brothels.html,David Sanger,1992-07-07,,1101,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Japan Admits It Set Up Army Brothels,Japan Admits It Set Up Army Brothels," **********Bowing to pressure from neighboring countries to acknowledge a brutal chapter of its wartime history, Japan reversed itself today and admitted that its military had recruited and organized tens of thousands of women in a vast network of Government-run brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. **********As recently as six months ago, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other senior officials denied that the wartime Government had organized and run the brothels, in which thousands of women died, insisting that they were set up by entrepreneurs. Thus, the officials said, Japan was not in a position to pay compensation. **********The admission today illustrates the continuing emotional power of the legacy of World War II in East Asia, where Tokyo's actions remain suspect and many people feel that Japan has not sufficiently atoned for its actions. **********In recent months, Japan and South Korea have engaged in an increasingly angry diplomatic dispute in which Seoul supported the demands for compensation by women who survived the brothels. Protests spread to China and other countries. **********Along with the admission of Government complicity, Japan released a host of documents disclosing details about how the elaborate system was run. Some documents provided the Japanese high command's justification for the brothels, arguing that they would discourage troops from raping local women, acts that would have intensified civilian resistance to the Japanese Army as it swept through Asia. **********Japanese officials said they were searching for a way to provide financial aid for the Korean women, but they declined to use the term compensation. Details were vague, and it was unclear what the Government would do about women in the Philippines, Indonesia, China and other nations who were also forced into brothels. **********Japanese officials had offered apologies to the victims of the brothels, but the refusal to accept Government responsibility had been widely condemned in Asia as an example of Tokyo's reluctance to face war atrocities. Taboos and Denial **********Taboos against discussing such subjects are still strong in Japan, where schoolchildren learn little of the reasons or details of the invasion of Asia and Japan's ultimate defeat. By releasing the report today, Japan tried to show that its handling of such issues is changing. **********Koichi Kato, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, announced the step at a news conference. ""I would like to express the sincere apology and remorse of the Government of Japan to all those, irrespective of nationality or place of origin, who underwent indescribable pain and suffering as comfort women,"" he said, using the common term for the women. ""My heart really aches when I listen to those who speak of this matter."" **********Mr. Kato was one of several officials who, six months ago, repeated the contention that the Government had had nothing to do with the brothels. Prime Minister Miyazawa told Parliament in December that compensation payments might raise taxes and that the issue of compensation had been settled after the war, when Japan provided assistance to South Korea, China and other victims of aggression. **********Although many Japanese today remember the brothels, their existence did not become a major public issue until last year, when a group of elderly South Korean women said they had decided to set aside their embarrassment and end their decades of silence. **********Japan denied that the Government had been involved, but in January a history professor, Yoshiaki Yoshimi, asserted that there had been a cover-up and made public documents he said he had stumbled upon in the library of the Japan Self-Defense Agency. **********Professor Yoshimi's discovery forced Mr. Miyazawa, during a visit to South Korea earlier this year, to promise President Roh Tae Woo that Japan would conduct a full-scale study. Mr. Kato said today that the study, based on 127 documents in Government archives, ""confirmed that there was Government involvement"" in the most minute details of running the brothels. **********The documents showed that military officials had not merely arranged for troops to visit women, a common practice in wartime, but had kept meticulous records about venereal disease, revenue generated and prices. **********One detail that created a stir at the news conference today was that fees had been based on nationality: one yen for a Chinese woman, one and a half for a Korean woman and two yen for a Japanese woman. **********Mr. Kato said none of the documents confirmed the testimony of several Japanese veterans that many young girls were kidnapped from their families in Korea and shipped to China. **********He said the Government had ruled out hearings where some women could testify. Such hearings, he contended, might violate the privacy of other victims. Weary of Apologizing **********Tokyo says formal compensation would be inappropriate because the issue of damages was settled long ago. But Mr. Miyazawa has made it clear that he believes some help should be extended to the survivors. **********Asked today why it took 47 years for the Government to confront the truth, Mr. Kato said: ""We did our best. Such problems, unthinkable in a time of peace, occurred in the midst of a war in which behavior often defied common sense. But I have to admit that it took a certain amount of time for us to recognize this problem correctly."" **********Apologizing for the war is a source of controversy in Japan, with rightists arguing that it has become humiliating for leaders, including the Emperor, to be asked again and again to apologize when they travel abroad. Many other Japanese say their country has already shown remorse and the time has come to put the war behind them. **********In Asia, this question has been revived by Tokyo's plans to dispatch troops abroad for the first time since World War II -- as members of United Nations peacekeeping forces. Their tasks are to be limited to humanitarian and logistical functions, but the mere prospect has provoked debate and warnings from South Korea and China. **********In Seoul, Japan's action today did little to quiet criticism. The South Korean Foreign Ministry said, ""Our tentative examination of the announcement by the Japanese authorities indicates that their investigations have not brought the whole truth to light."" **********In its report, Japan placed no exact figures on the number of women forced to work, though estimates by historians range from 100,000 to 200,000. No one knows how many survived, in part because most of the Korean women have refused to talk about it, out of fear of becoming objects of derision and shame."

Two years of civil conflict has destroyed any semblance of government and brought about the famine that is believed to have already killed several hundred thousand people. **********The leader of one of the principal factions of fighting in Somalia said on Friday that he would back the deployment of American troops. The comments by the leader, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, were matched today by his rival militia leader, Ali Mahdi Mohamed. The United Nations is to consider the American proposal this week. Firing Power at Port **********One of the most important targets of an American operation would be the Mogadishu port, the main entry point for large quantities of grain. The port was shelled earlier this week as a ship laden with grain tried to enter and the troops would presumably have the firepower to deter such shelling. **********About 30,000 tons of grain have been waiting to get out of the port for the last several weeks. The 30,000 tons, stacked on the wharves under tarpaulin or sitting on ships waiting for clearance to be unloaded, is enough to keep one million alive on one meal a day for four months, the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates. **********By ridding the port of armed fighters and giving it protection, any force would make it possible for three ships to efficiently unload simultaneously, relief workers said. **********How to remove the fighters now strangling the port is not clear, but it is obvious that American troops would have more negotiating strength -- and fire power if it was needed -- than the 500 under-armed United Nations troops who have not managed to move into the port in the last two months, aid officials said. At Famine Centers **********A second function for such troops is to deploy outside the capital in centers where the famine has hit hardest and violence has curtailed assistance. Ideally, they could also accompany road convoys to the interior, unload them and remain with the food until after it was distributed or eaten by the needy. **********Some of the distances are not so great: for instance, Baidoa, one of the towns in the heart of the famine region, is 150 miles northwest of here over a flat, tarmac road. A troop presence would be effective in Baidoa; Bardera, to the southwest; Kismayu, on the southern coast and Belet Uen, to the west. **********CARE, the American relief organization, which transports United Nations food, said it had canceled all convoys after a shootout near Baidoa over 400 tons of food earlier this month. **********For the American operation to be effective, troops would also have to be stationed at warehouses in inland towns and at distribution points not only to protect food but also to give aid workers the ability to negotiate with local clansmen about food distribution from a position of strength, said Michael McDonagh, the director of Irish Concern, an agency with 41 workers in the field. Last week, he had to withdraw his two workers from the town of Wajid, after a gunman invaded the workers residence and attempted to shoot a worker in an argument over food. **********In Bardera, the warehouse, supplied by an extensive airlift has been continuously looted in the last week, depriving villagers in the countryside of food. **********And as food is actually distributed, troops should stand by, said Stephen Tomlin, director of the International Medical Corps. ""It's no good to protect a ship and take the food to a destination and then leave,"" he said. ""You have to stay with the food as it's being eaten or distributed."" **********A third broad goal for the troops is to protect the Mogadishu International Airport so that food could be unloaded without being looted and so that transport planes could park overnight. This would improve the efficiency of the airlift now under way.  To Set Up Fuel Depots **********A fourth function for the troops would be to establish fuel storage depots at Mogadishu to replace those blown up in the conflict. At present, much of the diesel fuel used by humanitarian organizations for hospital generators and truck convoys is flown in from neighboring Kenya. Thus fuel is chronically short. **********In the last two days, since the American plan was announced, an air of uncertainty in the capital of Mogadishu among both Somalis and many expatriate aid workers about how the troop deployment will work has dissipated a little. **********""The troops are needed, the only thing these people understand is strength,"" Mr. McDonagh said. 'We're in danger of of losing the gains we've made."" **********Deaths from hunger have gone down in the past month, but a continuation of the recent surge in violence and political obstruction by various warlords is putting the relief effort in serious jeopardy, he said. **********Initially, many of the approximately 400 relief workers in nongovernmental organizations were opposed to the idea of the troops, despite their inability to do their jobs because of the violence. They feared, they said, that they, and vulnerable Somalis, would become targets of armed opposition to the American troops. **********But it has become clearer in the last days that while many Somalis are angered at the United Nations for what they view as a failure to deliver adequate help in the past few months, they view Americans more favorably. General Aidid's approval of the American plan cooled much of the skepticism among Somalis. **********""They are neutral,"" one clan leader said of the Americans. He explained that the United Nations was viewed especially negatively because the Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is from Egypt, a country that the Somalis generally regard with suspicion. **********The United States was a cold war ally of Somalia from the late 1970's until the fall of the dictator of 21 years, Mohamed Siad Barre, in January 1991. During most of those years, Washington provided Somalia, then considered to be a strategic piece of real estate adjacent to the Middle East, with military equipment and training. In return, Washington got access to a huge airfield at Berbera in northern Somalia.  U.S. Embassy Abandoned **********Thus, Somalia is not a new country to the United States. The American Embassy, now thoroughly looted, even down to the copper wiring, was the biggest such center in sub-Saharan Africa. The embassy was abandoned in January 1991, just before the fall of Mr. Barre, and Washington, like virtually every other nation, has had no official representation here since 1991. **********Despite the growing acceptance here of the American involvement, there was still caution. **********To meet with widespread approval in Somalia, United Nations and other officials said an intervention must be couched as assistance to the people, and not presented as a force from abroad to rule the independently minded Somalis. **********Thus, the presence of the troops should be accompanied by such longer-term goals as helping establish regional police forces and striving for political dialogue amid the clan chaos. **********The senior United Nations official, Ismat Kittani, told visitors here Friday that the military action would not preclude him from working at political negotiations between the factions. **********A United Nations official with long experience in the country said: ""Suppose we succeed on enhancing the humanitarian assistance, then what? You still have a broken country."""

The vast crowd, which the police estimated at 350,000, heard only the second half of his speech, through a shrill chorus of whistles and catcalls. Kohl Is Attacked **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl was also been pelted with eggs as he joined the demonstration, marching up Unter den Linden through the Brandenburg Gate to the Lustgarten, part of a vast square where anti-Nazi crowds once rallied against Hitler. **********Looking grim, Mr. Kohl did not speak or try to join President von Weizsacker as he struggled to speak. Afterward the Chancellor stalked angrily away. **********Most of the recent violence against foreigners in Germany has been blamed on neo-Nazis. But it was leftist anarchists opposed to all political parties who tried to spoil the rally today, according to city officials and some of the rioters themselves. Many Germans Alarmed **********Their success in disrupting the demonstration, the largest in Berlin since the country's unification two years ago, added to the growing crisis of confidence in German democratic institutions. **********Many citizens view their politicians, the Government bureaucracy and their legal system as overwhelmed by the challenge of absorbing 16.5 million East Germans and a flood of foreign refugees and political asylum-seekers -- almost 500,000 this year alone. Nor has the Government found a consistent way of dealing with a surge in racist and anti-Semitic violence, though polls indicate that many Germans are alarmed by the attacks. **********The Berlin police, who had predicted that left-wing radicals had no plans to disrupt the demonstration, said they arrested 14 people today, and at least one person in the crowd was injured. **********The people in the square included entire families who brought their small children and many handicapped people who fear they could be the next targets of right-wing violence. Most applauded when Ignatz Bubis, the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, seized the microphone after the demonstration had been declared over. 'To the Abyss' **********""I am ashamed of what has happened here,"" he said. Then, alluding to the Nazi rampage against Jews on Nov. 9, 1938, he said: ""We are not in 1938 -- we are in 1992. Violence can only take us to the abyss."" **********But Germans have not been so divided since the days of the Weimar Republic. **********All the major political parties, church leaders, and labor unions agreed in calling on people to come to Berlin to show that violence is not the answer to dealing with the influx of foreigners and to support democratic solutions. But on what those solutions should be, the German body politic has shown no unanimity. **********Many of the peaceful demonstrators made clear that they had come partly to protest the Government's failure to deal firmly with neo-Nazi attacks against some of the hundreds of thousands of foreign asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country. **********""I came because I think ordinary citizens should be able to exert pressure on their Government on the streets,"" said Ulrike Koelle, 39, of Stuttgart. **********Violence against foreigners began spreading across Germany in August, when rightist gangs in the Baltic port of Rostock terrorized asylum-seekers in attacks that lasted nearly a week. **********But it was not until last month that Mr. Kohl and other leading politicians sharply condemned the violence and called for today's rally. Meanwhile, all four major parties represented in Parliament are enmeshed in theoretical discussions about how or whether to change a constitutional article, the most liberal in Europe, guaranteeing anyone fleeing political persecution the right to claim asylum in Germany. Protest 'Against Themselves' **********""Politicians whose duty it is to finally do something are calling instead for a demonstration against themselves,"" Max Streibl, the governor of Bavaria, said on Friday, explaining his widely criticized decision to boycott the demonstration today. **********Mr. Streibl's conservative Christian Social Union party wants to eliminate the individual right to asylum guaranteed in the 1949 Constitution and Mr. Kohl's Government has proposed making it harder for economic migrants from Eastern Europe to claim they are fleeing political persecution. **********The opposition Social Democrats are holding a special convention in Bonn later this month to decide their position, and a nationwide demonstration against changes in the Constitution is to be held there on Saturday. **********""We in the overwhelming majority will prevail against troublemakers and loudmouths,"" Mr. von Weizsacker said, to applause, when a backup public address system was switched on midway through his speech. **********""We politicians have the urgent duty to create a system that channels and limits immigration and at the same time protects the true right of asylum,"" he said. **********In the part of his speech that could not be heard, Mr. von Weizsacker said: ""We should never forget what caused the failure of the first republic in Germany,"" the Weimar Republic. ""Not because there were too many Nazis too soon, but because for too long there were too few democrats."" **********Yet the rioters remained after the rally ended, blowing shrill whistles to prevent television microphones from picking up the comments of the politicians deploring the violence. **********""They are all hypocrites, and that's why we are here,"" said one young woman, one of a group of about 50 who stayed after the demonstration ended. She said the group came from the leftist radical milieu in Berlin."

Revamping," **********An agreement to restructure the ownership of struggling Trans World Airlines cleared another hurdle today when it was approved by leaders of the pilots' union. **********Under the proposed agreement, the 2,800-member Air Line Pilots Association will exchange about $40 million a year in wage and benfit concessions over three years for partial ownership of the airline. **********The pilots; two other T.W.A. unions, the International Association of Machinists and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants, and some nonunion employees would share 45 percent; creditors of the bankrupt airline would own 55 percent. **********In all, the employees expect their concessions to total about $540 million, said William F. Compton, chairman of the T.W.A. Master Executive Council of the pilots' union. He said the concessions would amount to a 15 percent reduction in wages and benefits. **********The council, the governing body of the union, approved the agreement this afternoon at union headquarters in suburban St. Louis and agreed to take it to the membership. **********Ratification by the unions and the airline's directors must be completed by Oct. 5. The agreement must also be submitted to the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware for approval. A Sept. 3 hearing has been scheduled. **********""Other steps have to happen now,"" Mr. Compton said, ""but this $180 million a year is available to T.W.A. in the very near term, a matter of weeks. So that's a very important step, and it opens the way for Icahn's contribution to the company."" Carl C. Icahn, T.W.A.'s chairman, has said he will make a $200 million cash infusion and will cancel more than $170 million in debt. **********The employee contributions will be paid into an escrow account beginning in early September. If the agreement is not ratified, the money will be returned with interest. **********Mr. Icahn and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation must also agree on the amount Mr. Icahn owes the employee pension funds."

ON SARAJEVO FORCE,EUROPE BACKS U.N. ON SARAJEVO FORCE," **********Leaders of the European Community agreed today to support the use of force by the United Nations if necessary to get humanitarian aid through to Sarajevo, which is under daily bombardment from Serbian forces. **********Shortly after the leaders issued their statement, officials announced in Paris that President Francois Mitterrand had left for an unexpected visit to the former Yugoslavia. Mr. Mitterrand's destination was reported to be Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, whose airport is under siege; he stopped for the night in the Croatian city of Split. **********Issuing a statement a day after the United Nations Security Council gave Serbian forces until Monday to stop the siege of Sarajevo, the European leaders said they would support whatever steps the Council deemed necessary to reopen the Sarajevo airport. But they said that not all of them would be able to take part and that they preferred peaceful means. **********Stung by criticism that Europe had been ineffective in dealing with the Yugoslav civil warfare, European leaders vowed to make transportation, food and medicine available and strongly condemned the Serbians for ""an appalling loss of life and a desperate humanitarian situation."" U.N. Chief Issues Ultimatum **********The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a statement backed by the Security Council, told the Serbs on Friday they had until Monday morning to stop bombarding Sarajevo and to put their heavy weapons under the control of the international peacekeeping force. United Nations officials in the past have insisted that a durable cease-fire had to be in place before any humanitarian action could proceed, but Friday's ultimatum suggested that the Council was prepared to move more assertively. **********The Italian Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, pressed his colleagues to take strong action. **********President Mitterrand said after the meeting, ""Italy, backed by France, believes in the use of force, at least sufficient to guarantee the security of deliveries of humanitarian aid."" **********Britain has been more cautious. ""We are aware of the very grave difficulties there are in proceeding without a cease-fire,"" Prime Minister John Major said today. But he added that his country would participate in an international airlift if one went ahead. France and Britain are permanent members of the Security Council, which is to meet Monday to decide its next steps. As Last Resort **********The European leaders, who also said they would demand the suspension from all international organizations of the truncated Yugoslav state dominated by Serbia, stressed that they thought outsiders should use force only as a last resort. **********They also called for sending military observers to the predominantly ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia, before fighting spread there. **********Despite anxiety fed by rumors of American troop alerts that swept the two-day conference here, the Europeans' discussions dragged on long past the planned closing time of early this afternoon, revealing differences. **********The British are afraid of getting stuck in endless fighting, like the conflicts in Cyprus or Northern Ireland. Germany is inhibited by its past, the history of Nazi aggression in the Balkans in World War II. **********Greece, which has close ties to Serbia, agreed to join in condemning it only after others granted its demand not to recognize the independence of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia unless it picked another name. Greece regards Macedonia as historically its name. **********Mr. Mitterrand rejected criticism that the Europeans had been impotent in the Balkan crisis. It could not do more, he said, until the treaty on European union was ratified by all members."

The agency said that while its ratings outlook for the city remained negative because of the recession, the city's budget was reasonably balanced. Despite this, yields have climbed above 7 percent on the city's tax-exempt bonds due in 15 years or more. **********Traders and investors had been skeptical about how much the $759.2 million bond issue would save on interest costs, considering the weakness of the bond market and the size of the deal. Sweetening the Deal> **********Although many investors want New York City bonds, which are exempt from Federal, state and city taxes for city residents, some traders quietly say investors may be unwilling to pay premium prices for them, since the city already has about $19 billion in publicly traded bonds outstanding. Indeed, to make the city's bonds more attractive, underwriters repriced and raised yields 5 basis points, or five-hundredths of a percentage point, on the long end. **********Lehman Brothers is offering the general obligation bonds to yield a maximum 7.15 percent for bonds maturing in 2011 through 2018. For shorter maturities, the city is offering serial bonds at prices to yield from 3.9 percent in 1994 to 5.5 percent in 1997, 6.5 percent in 2002, 6.3 percent in 2007 and 7.1 percent in 2009 and 2010. **********All the bonds are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by S.& P., except for the issues due in 2007 and 2008, which are insured by Financial Security Assurance and therefore rated triple-A by both rating companies. **********The city's offering of $85.12 million in tax-exempt and taxable bonds represents the second sale of ""NYC Bonds"" aimed at smaller investors.  These bonds can be purchased for as little as $1,400, with investors receiving $5,000 when the bonds mature in 15 years or more. **********Of the total financing, $75.05 million is of tax-exempt zero-coupon bonds that if held to maturity will yield a maximum 7.25 percent for an issue due in 2011 and 2012, with the remaining bonds yielding from 5.6 percent in 1997 to 7.2 percent in 2009 and 2010."

But the key speech at the gathering made clear that the party wants free markets only for goods and services, not for ideas. **********Nearly 2,000 delegates gathered for the congress, held in the Great Hall of the People. Under a 150-foot red banner reading ""Long live the great, glorious and correct Chinese Communist Party,"" they listened as the party's general secretary, Jiang Zemin, delivered a two-hour speech that is supposed to establish the party line until 1997. **********Party congresses are held at five-year intervals, and today's gathering is widely regarded as Deng Xiaoping's last opportunity to give staying power to the course now being steered by China. Mr. Deng, who is 88 and feeble, holds no formal post but remains the nation's paramount leader. **********Mr. Jiang's speech, which was vetted in advance by the entire national leadership, formalized the Government's embrace of economic restructuring along free-market lines and underscored the sinking fortunes of the hard-liners and the rise of those who wish to extend China's experiments with capitalism. **********""Reform is also a revolution, a revolution whose goal is to liberate the productive forces,"" said Mr. Jiang, a portly 66-year-old. ""It is the only way to modernize China. If we cling to outmoded ideas and remain content with the status quo, we shall accomplish nothing."" **********""Poverty,"" he said, ""is not socialism."" Strengthening Dictatorship **********But Mr. Jiang also called on the Government to ""strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship"" and ""crack down on the activities of hostile forces."" He also said that China must ""resolutely eliminate all factors that might lead to unrest or turmoil."" **********The result was a speech that seemed contradictory, as if the liberal faction had written the economic sections and hard-liners had contributed the rest. The apparent aim of Mr. Deng has been to create a sort of free-market totalitarianism. **********Mr. Jiang emphasized that China would continue to subscribe to Marxist and Maoist thought, and he warned against ""decadent capitalist and feudal ideologies"" in carrying out the economic revolution. **********""This revolution is not intended to change the nature of our socialist system but to improve and develop it,"" said Mr. Jiang, who dressed in a Western suit for the occasion. In the next sentence, he added: ""It is no minor patching up of the economic structure but a fundamental restructuring of the economy."" **********The party congress, the first since 1987 -- and thus the first since the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement and the first since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe -- will choose a new Central Committee and establish the policies that China is supposed to take until the next congress. The delegates were carefully picked for their loyalty and obedience, and so the party congress is less an exercise in democracy than a theatrical performance. **********Most of the delegates sat stony-faced in their chairs throughout the speech, following the texts in front of them. On the stage behind Mr. Jiang, the 200 members of the congress presidium sat in places of honor -- a stark reminder of the party's reputation as a gerontocracy, for most were elderly and some had to be helped to their seats. **********In the crowd of balding or graying heads, overwhelmingly male, one member of the presidium stood out: 22 year-old Gao Min, winner of a gold medal in the women's diving championships at the Barcelona Olympics. Ms. Gao is not known for her party activities. **********The People's Daily today listed Mr. Deng and several other top party elders as members of the presidium, but they were not present today. In an attempt to quiet rumors that Mr. Deng is seriously ill, the official New China News Agency carried a brief item today quoting his daughter, Deng Nan, as saying: ""My father is hale and hearty."" 'Socialist Market Economy' **********Today's address was more supportive of change than most official statements since 1989, but it was not nearly so ardently liberal as the main speech at the 13th party congress in 1987. That speech, by General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was purged after the Tiananmen crackdown, was a vigorous call for renewal and a major breakthrough for those favoring far-reaching changes. **********A central theme of Mr. Jiang's speech was the call to build a ""socialist market economy,"" which apparently means a free market economy with a large public sector. But instead of mentioning specific changes the party will make, Mr. Jiang simply emphasized the need for bolder restructuring. **********""To accelerate economic growth we must further emancipate our minds, speed up the reform and opening to the rest of the world, and not get bogged down in an abstract debate over what is socialist and what is capitalist,"" Mr. Jiang said. **********But Mr. Jiang also said that socialism is bound to replace capitalism and he referred to the 1989 pro-democracy movement as ""counter-revolutionary rioting"" -- a phrase that was added at the last minute. **********A confidential draft of the speech that circulated earlier described the movement as only a ""disturbance."" The change was one of the few that was made in the final speech, according to a Chinese journalist. **********Mr. Jiang also used hard-liner language in calling for vigilance against ""peaceful evolution,"" supposedly a plot by Western countries to subvert China bit by bit until it wakes up capitalist. He delivered a lengthy tirade against ""any big, strong or rich country"" -- by which he clearly meant the United States -- that uses human rights issues to coerce or humiliate other nations. **********Mr. Jiang added, still obviously referring to the United States: ""Any country that overreaches itself or rides roughshod over others will be denounced by the peoples of the world."""

But the overwhelmingly negative sentiment that has dominated the market for the last two weeks then took hold. A lack of positive news about the market or the economy was interpreted as bad news, analysts said. **********The Nikkei index of 225 issues tumbled throughout the afternoon to close down 614.01 points, or 3.4 percent, to 17,236.65. The Nikkei lost 3.8 percent last week, in spite of Friday's rally, the index's fourth-largest in percentage terms. **********Trading volume remained light, about 280 million shares, a sign that most investors are watching the carnage in the market from the sidelines. **********""We're all pretty baffled,"" said Bill Brown, the president of Scudder Stevens and Clark Japan Inc., a unit of the big American asset-management company. ""With this kind of volume, anything can happen."" **********The weak Japanese economy and prospects of falling corporate profits have taken a toll on the market for most of this year, but the decline turned into a rout two weeks ago, as investor confidence was shattered by what was regarded as a weak Government response to the situation. The Government pushed forward spending on public works projects, and the Bank of Japan reduced a critical interest rate."

The text of the document has not been released, and not one of the negotiators has described the Syrian position in terms as specific as Mr. Rabin's. **********Even in exchange for the return of the Golan Heights, a 500-square-mile plateau that Israel captured in 1967, Syria has indicated that it would accept a peace agreement but ""not open boundaries, not embassies, not commercial and cultural relationships,"" Mr. Rabin said. **********The Syrian Embassy was closed today and Syrian officials could not be reached for comment. Reassured Delegates on Quarrel **********Mr. Rabin also sought to reassure delegates at the convention that his recent quarrel with the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential lobbying group, did not extend to all American Jewish organizations. Mr. Rabin castigated the group's leaders in a private meeting here on Aug. 13 for antagonizing the Bush Administration in their aggressive but unsuccessful effort last autumn and winter to win American loan guarantees for the resettlement of Soviet Jews in Israel. **********In a clear reference to the public affairs committee, Mr. Rabin said, ""My remarks were made in a very close circle and in relation to one organization."" **********He added that during his career, which included serving as Ambassador to the United States from 1968 to 1973, he had ""learned to appreciate, to admire the devotion of the Jewish community in the United States."" **********President Bush agreed last month to provide $10 billion in loan guarantees sought by Israel after Mr. Rabin and his Labor Party won elections in June, replacing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud Party. Mr. Rabin has moved quickly to scale back the construction of Jewish settlements in occupied territories, as Mr. Bush advocated. Urged Return to Usual Role **********As relations between the Administration and the Israeli Government chilled during Mr. Shamir's tenure, the American Jewish organization expanded its long-time lobbying of Congress and low-level Federal bureaucrats to include senior State Department and White House officials. Mr. Rabin urged the group last month to return to its traditional role, while leaving high-level diplomacy to the Israeli Embassy in Washington. **********Mr. Rabin encouraged American Jews today to continue expressing their views to members of Congress, but he avoided any mention of lobbying the Administration. Yet Mr. Rabin has been quietly mending fences with the American Jewish group too, sending a letter to the organization two weeks ago in which he applauded its efforts at the recent Democratic and Republican conventions and emphasized that the meeting on Aug. 13 had been ""friendly and constructive."" **********An official of the organization declined to comment on the Prime Minister's remarks today. Mr. Rabin also spelled out his opposition to the formal annexation of territory by Israel, which would mean more Palestinians living in Israel. Such a move, he said, would sow the seeds for civil strife comparable to the recent warfare that has wracked some former Yugoslav and Soviet republics. **********The recent violence in these states shows ""what happens when you bring about by force a binational state,"" Mr. Rabin said."

Sales were 56.488 trillion lire, or about $48 billion, compared with sales of 57.209 trillion lire in 1990. **********Company executives attributed the drop in part to high production costs in Italy and to the global economic slowdown. They also cited losses from Fiat's 1990 takeover of Ford New Holland, a Ford Motor Company unit that made agricultural machinery and tractors, which is now merged with Fiat's Geotech. **********Fiat executives said the new company, called N. H. Geotech, lost $300 million last year and $120 million in the first six months of this year. Moreover, Fiat plans to spend up to $500 million more to recapitalize the new company this year. **********But Fiat's chief executive, Cesare Romiti, said at a news conference today that Fiat also planned to close plants and cut jobs at the new company. It was not clear whether this would affect operations in the United States. **********Fiat's acquisition of the tractor concern reflected a policy to consolidate strategic divisions to seek market dominance while shedding nonstrategic units to help finance the company's plans through 1996. **********Under that policy, Fiat last year acquired both Ford New Holland and Spain's biggest truck producer, Enasa Pegaso. It has also shed its controlling interest in the past two years in the Telettra Telecommunications Company, which it sold to Alcatel Alsthom of France. **********Umberto Quadrino, Fiat's planning director, said the sale this year of Fiat's remaining 25 percent stake in Telettra had yielded the equivalent of $700 million with a further $200 million to be paid in installments over four years. **********That money, he told reporters, with expected income from the group's many divisions, would produce a profit for 1992, although on a smaller scale than last year. **********The company's 1991 results also showed that Fiat took on debt last year for the first time in almost a decade -- the equivalent of roughly $225 million. Executives said borrowing was needed because of the capital investment plan at a time of depressed markets. **********Fiat's concern about its future in the European car market reflects worries that other European producers, notably Ford and Volkswagen, are encroaching on its Italian stronghold. Fiat's share of the Italian market still stands at 46 percent, but in the late 1980's it commanded 60 percent."

But some aides say that holding the talks in the midst of a Presidential campaign suggests that little of real concern to them will be accomplished. **********""I think the main objective for Mr. Bush here is going to be domestic,"" said a South American diplomat. **********General pledges of cooperation were agreed upon at Mr. Bush's first such meeting in February 1990 in Cartagena, Colombia, with the presidents of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. The expanded group is expected to draw up specific goals and timetables for reducing drug production, trafficking and consumption, said Bob Martinez, the director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and some Latin American diplomats. **********The leaders are also expected to establish a hemispheric council that would include at least the seven countries represented here and would meet several times a year. Marking Some Successes **********In analyzing the battle against drugs in Latin America, the Bush Administration claims some modest success. But drug experts and critics in Congress say that, over all, the picture has grown bleaker as drug trafficking has expanded throughout the region. **********Not only is cocaine flowing into the United States as freely as ever, they say, but the traffickers have opened up brisk markets in Europe and are begining to find customers in Japan and other Asian countries. Furthermore, Colombia's traffickers are now producing heroin and exporting it to the United States. **********""By every objective standard, the President's Andean strategy has failed,"" said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, which oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration. **********As evidence of progress, Mr. Martinez cited increased seizures of cocaine by several countries in 1991 and the crippling of one of the main trafficking organizations in Colombia. **********The Administration has been trumpeting a sharp drop in casual drug use. But any sense of exhuberance has been tempered by an increase in cocaine and heroin consumption in the slums and by an unrelenting rise in murders and robberies connected with drugs. **********Though drug experts say any goals and time tables established at the summit may prove meaningless, both the Bush Administration and the Latin American leaders see them as potential levers for applying political pressure. **********""It's a way to increase accountability,"" said one South American official. **********The South Americans say that an agreement on clear goals will be evidence that the United States accepts the argument that its consumption has been an important factor in the growth of the drug industries. Likewise, the Bush Administration believes that a public pledge from its neighbors will make it more difficult for them to let the issue slide."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/15/business/ex-prosecutor-asserts-us-frustrated-bcci-inquiry.html,Steve Lohr,1992-05-15,,902,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Ex-Prosecutor Asserts U.S. Frustrated B.C.C.I. Inquiry,Ex-Prosecutor Asserts U.S. Frustrated B.C.C.I. Inquiry," **********A former Federal prosecutor testified today that his efforts to pursue an investigation against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International were delayed and frustrated by his superiors at the Justice Department, raising further questions about the Government's handling of the case. **********Dexter Lehtinen, the United States Attorney in Miami until January, said that in 1991 when his office was building a tax case against B.C.C.I., it needed a judge's order to obtain B.C.C.I. documents in about 10 foreign countries. To take that step, attorneys in the field must receive approval from the Justice Department in Washington. ""But we never got permission and it was never explained,"" Mr. Lehtinen said. **********The Justice Department said any delays in the case were the result of its shortcomings. James A. Bruton, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the tax division, said that when his staff examined the case they found ""serious legal and factual questions."" Mr. Lehtinen, according to Justice officials, was an outspoken and controversial investigator, who was never nominated for Senate confirmation so that he remained an Acting United States Attorney during his tenure from 1988 to January, when he resigned. **********Mr. Lehtinen was just one of several witnesses who appeared in a marathon session before the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations. Other witnesses included a representative from Abu Dhabi, the London-based liquidator of the bank, the chief counsel of the Federal Reserve, the chief of enforcement for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and executives of the big Washington bank that B.C.C.I. had secretly owned, First American Bankshares. **********During the daylong hearing, the witnesses disclosed several new details about the B.C.C.I. scandal. For example, John Stone, the chief of enforcement for the F.D.I.C., estimated that the losses from the failure of the Independence Bank of Encino, Calif., another American institution that had been secretly owned by B.C.C.I., would be $130 million to $140 million. Since all the bank's deposits are federally insured, the Independence failure could be costly to taxpayers. **********Citing the loss estimate, Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate subcommittee, said, ""That puts a lie to the often-quoted statement that B.C.C.I. has not cost taxpayers any money."" **********However, Mr. Stone of the F.D.I.C. said the Government hoped to be able to dip into the more than $500 million that B.C.C.I. forfeited in December as part of a plea agreement with the United States, to cover most or all of the cost of the failure of Independence. Big Price Difference **********J. Virgil Mattingly Jr., the Fed's general counsel, said that one of the main items his investigators were pursuing was an explanation for the huge difference between the $225 million that First American Bankshares paid to acquire the National Bank of Georgia, when the deal was announced in 1985, and the roughly $90 million First American got from its recent sale of the Georgia bank. **********The deal is suspect, Mr. Mattingly said, and the huge price gap cannot be explained by declining real estate values or other market changes over those years. ""The information available to us indicates that B.C.C.I. was behind the transaction, and that B.C.C.I. substantially benefited from the transaction, he said. **********The extent to which two former American executives, the Washington lawyer Clark M. Clifford and his protege, Robert A. Altman, were involved in the talks on buying the Georgia bank could well figure in the continuing investigation of the two men. Both Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. **********The role of Abu Dhabi, the main B.C.C.I. shareholder, was examined during the hearing. Mr. Mattingly said that the Abu Dhabi authorities had provided access to some documents and individuals to American investigators. But about 30 former bank officials remain under house arrest in Abu Dhabi and key documents there remain off-limits. To truly uncover the dimensions of the fraud and its motivations, Mr. Mattingly said that investigators at the Fed, the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the Justice Department must have ""access to the people in Abu Dhabi and all the documents in Abu Dhabi."" Portrayed as Victim **********For his part, Ahmed al-Sayegh, a director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and a member of the emirate's working group on B.C.C.I., said he hoped that agreement would be reached soon to give American investigators broader access to people and documents in Abu Dhabi. Mr. Sayegh portrayed Abu Dhabi as the biggest victim in the B.C.C.I., having lost some $3 billion, and he pointed out that the huge fraud had been going on long before the emirate became the majority shareholder. **********The former United States Attorney in Miami, Mr. Lehtinen, did not directly accuse his superiors in the Justice Department of misconduct. But he did tell a story of inexplicable foot-dragging, viewed from his perspective, during 1991 when his office was pursuing a tax case against B.C.C.I. He also said that in late August 1991 he received a call from a senior Justice Department official in Washington, who said he was calling on behalf of William Barr, then Acting Attorney General, and asked him not to seek an indictment in the case. **********Mr. Lehtinen termed the call ""very peculiar and very odd."" **********The Miami United States Attorney's office eventually proceeded with a scaled-down case, and got an indictment in November."

About 75 percent of the shortfall with Japan was in trade in cars and automobile parts. **********""No one should underestimate the seriousness of the tensions in U.S.-Japanese relations,"" Mr. Kuriyama said. ""We do not accept that the Japanese market is closed not only to automobiles or in other areas as well."" **********The Ambassador said Japan's market for United States goods is almost as large as the British, German and Italian markets combined and Japan is by far the largest market for American farm goods. Japanese-owned factories in the United States account for 500,000 American jobs, he said. **********Dan Rostenskowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, plans to introduce legislation, perhaps on Thursday, to require the Administration to monitor more closely the compliance of trade agreements and take punitive action against violators."

Clutching a bunch of red tulips gathered from the fields nearby, the soft-spoken farmer wanted only to see the graves of his wife, his three daughters and his three sons, all killed in eight years of war. 'Everyone Bombed Us' **********""It was once so beautiful and now it is all gone,"" Mr. Fatullah said in a whisper as he stopped to look through a gaping doorway at a mound of rocks, a slender pole and a green flag marking his sons' graves. ""First the Government came and bombed us, then the militia bombed us, the mujahedeen bombed us, then the Government -- everyone bombed us."" **********Blanketing a gentle hillside, Paghman was one of the most sought-after prizes of the 14-year guerrilla war against the Soviet-backed Government. Almost every year, the town of 40,000 people changed hands between guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, and the Government, thus becoming an arena for constant rocketing, bombing and mines. **********Gradually everyone fled, and now there is nothing left of what was once a weekend and summer resort, built with a European flair at the beginning of the century by King Amanullah Khan. It was meant to be Afghanistan's most beautiful city. **********Wide avenues were lined by fir, poplar and nut trees along a torrent, which flowed past an arch of triumph, wide lawns, impressive brick buildings and a golf course. The King imported Italian tiles for his villa, and the Prime Minister's residence had three kitchens to satisfy the guests. **********Now only ghosts remain and flowers grow wild. Not one building remains intact, and the rutted dirt roads carved by streams are eerily empty. The pastel pink walls of the Bahar Hotel gape at passers-by. Across the street, four Doric columns mark the entrance of a roofless mosque that is nothing but a pile of rubble inside. **********The white arch of triumph has had its top blasted away and teeters on its brick body, also heavily damaged. The elegant arched lamp posts rust on the ground. Flowers grow wild on lawns, mined by so many different factions that no one dares to walk them. 'Nothing Is Left **********The only residents are about 30 guerrillas perched on a hill in a round bunker. For more than a week now their chief, Commander Shah Mohammed, has been sitting by an empty swimming pool with a dozen grizzled men, watching the plumes of rocket smoke in the Kabul valley through sophisticated German Army binoculars. **********In the fighting and at the victory celebrations of Kabul, Shah Mohammed's men are forgotten: They belong to the fundamentalist group led by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf that controls the western road out of Kabul. **********At midmorning, they sit crosslegged on a dust-clogged brown blanket, plunging hands into a heap of brown rice. Anti-aircraft shells litter the cement patio near two wireless radios, and two mujahedeen have set up a self-reliant if sooty kitchen under some arches. Food comes from a 50-gallon drum of clarified butter, sacks of rice and two ammunition crates filled with tea. **********Shah Mohammed still has frostbite on his hands from his trek over the snow-capped passes last week and his clothes are grease- and dirt-caked. Like Mr. Fatullah, the returnee from Kabul, all he can speak of is the destruction. **********""Nothing is left,"" he said as he offered tea. ""Everywhere you go is destruction and mines."" **********Shah Mohammed took a visitor through the bunker. The walls were lined with crates of anti-personnel mines, grenades and rockets, left by the Government. Outside the gate, the guerrillas had parked their prize possession: an army truck with an anti-aircraft gun on the back. Only one of the barrels worked. A Bouquet for Kabul **********After his return to his home, Mr. Fatullah shared a cup of tea with Shah Mohammed and his men and then began his descent. In his dignity, with his long white beard and neatly wrapped green turban, Mr. Fatullah stopped at the roadside to pick a bouquet for his relatives in Kabul, a memory of Paghman. **********All his life had been spent tending his fields and the apple orchards of Paghman. Now only one son remains alive. **********But there was no anger in his voice, only pain. **********""I don't know how we can rebuild this all,"" he said. ""I have nothing. One by one the rockets took my family, took my land. It was so beautiful, so beautiful."" Map of Afghanistan showing location of Paghman. (pg. A3)"

Greece, which had already been cool to the republic, began to insist that nobody but Greeks could use the name Macedonia, which they say is part of their heritage from classical antiquity. They call the state north of their border ""the Republic of Skopje,"" a reference to the Macedonian capital. **********The Greek Prime Minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, has a two-vote majority in Parliament, and members from northern Greece have threatened to abandon him if he gives any ground on the Macedonia question. Bush Spoke With Mitsotakis **********Administration officials said President Bush had told Mr. Mitsotakis last week that the United States would not recognize Macedonia in early April as previously planned. On April 6, the European Community, which has already recognized Slovenia and Croatia, is to meet to discuss recognition of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. But American officials said today that it was increasingly unlikely that recognition would be extended to those republics at that time. **********Although the United States in principle is ready to recognize the sovereignty of all the former Yugoslav republics, it will probably wait until the European Community moves before it will go ahead with recognition of any of them. **********Last weekend, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd sent a letter to the 12 members of the European Community, including Greece, saying the United States still intended to follow the community's lead on recognition. **********At the same time, Mr. Baker said it was United States policy to give equal treatment to all of the pieces of the former Yugoslavia that have emerged from the six-month war of 1991 as independent republics. That means diplomatic recognition for four successor republics, Administration officials said. 40 Countries Followed Europe **********The European Community members extended recognition in mid-January to Slovenia and Croatia, which had seceded from Yugoslavia six months earlier. About 40 other countries followed suit. **********At a meeting in Brussels this month, community members agreed to try to grant recognition to the troubled multi-ethnic republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and perhaps to Macedonia at their next session, on April 6. **********But a community consensus on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the scene of sporadic fighting in recent weeks between Serbs and an alliance of Croats and Muslim Slavs, has not yet been reached, European diplomats said. Now as before, Greece stiffly refuses to approve joint European recognition of an entity called Macedonia. **********European diplomats said the community -- and now the United States -- had agreed to pause on the Macedonia issue to give ""diplomacy time to work."" Portugal, which now holds the community presidency, is trying to mediate a compromise on the name of Macedonia -- perhaps something like ""Slav-Macedonia."" U.S. Won't Delay for Long **********But Administration officials said the United States would not delay recognition for long. ""The way I understand it, we will recognize Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina soon after the European Community acts on Bosnia-Herzegovina,"" one official said. ""Then, after a short pause, we will recognize Macedonia, too, regardless of what the others do."" **********For the 12 members of the community, the Macedonia issue has become a new test of its intention to maintain a common foreign policy. The question of recognizing Slovenia and Croatia was already very contentious. This time, several countries, notably Denmark and the Netherlands, have indicated that if the community could not reach an adequate consensus, they would feel free to recognize Macedonia. **********For the 10 million Greeks and the 2.5 million Macedonians, the issue has become much more than a matter of what's in a name. **********In the judgment of Bush Administration officials, the Macedonia dispute has stirred Greek emotions more than any issue since Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974. They noted that on Feb. 14, more than a million Greeks demonstrated against the Macedonian Republic in Salonika, the capital of northern Greece. Greeks See Slavic Threat **********Northern Greece, a region the Greeks call Macedonia, was inhabited mainly by Slavs before World War I. They were largely supplanted in the 1920's by Greek refugees from Asia Minor after the Greek-Turkish war, although thousands of ethnic Slavs remain in Greece. **********An Administration official specializing in Greek affairs said that despite the collapse of the Communist system in Europe and the collapse of Yugoslavia, many Greeks seem to fear a revived Slavic threat, even though the new Macedonian republic has no army. As a result, he said, Washington now acknowledges that a hasty move could topple Mr. Mitsotakis. **********There is tension north of the border too. In Skopje, President Kiro Gligorov has come under increasing pressure to promote Macedonian nationalist causes from radical members of the large political formation called the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity. **********The radicals' cause has been strengthened by severe deterioration of Macedonia's economy resulting from the Yugoslav civil war and from sporadic Greek measures blocking commercial traffic."

Plugging 'Insider' Leaks"," **********The most recent front-page accusations of insider trading involve some well connected friends who are said to have discussed confidential information as they socialized in Southampton. One major figure has pleaded guilty to related charges; several others say they are innocent. A broker involved said he executed trades but did not know they were based on inside information. **********Other insider trading cases have involved the spouses of corporate officers, a secretary and limousine drivers who overheard conversations. These ""remote tippee"" cases illustrate a lesson we emphasize to clients: to avoid trouble, keep confidential information confidential. **********There is a fine line between deliberate illegality and idle talk. The calculating actions of high-profile Wall Streeters in the 1980's have created the impression that insider trading always involves an Ivan Boesky or a Dennis Levine seeking huge profits. Thousands of corporate employees do not understand that the law obligates them to guard against passing any information that might affect the price of a security. **********Even if you innocently mention something confidential and someone completely removed from the discussion trades on it, you are technically breaking the law. Prosecutors haven't yet pursued careless leakers who expected no gains. But when leaks are traced back to their employees, the reputations of law firms, investment banks and major corporations take a beating. **********To avoid these situations, you and your company should adopt strict guidelines: *********** Do not share confidential information with anyone not entitled to know: spouses, friends, brokers. Having this information creates an implicit contract based on trust. *********** Avoid discussions in open places -- airplanes, elevators, restaurants -- or on cellular phones. *********** Copy or type sensitive memos yourself and leave no confidential papers on your desk. *********** Shred drafts of sensitive documents. *********** Do not trade in your own company's stock without clearing it through an authorized superior or the company's legal counsel. **********A company that follows these rules will protect its most valuable asset: its good name."

The Congressional Office of Technological Assessment has just completed a five-year study of drug labeling in third world countries by 18 large American companies. The findings will be reported to Congress later this year. **********In a separate study, three California investigators examined the products of dozens of American and foreign drug makers. They compared the warnings required on labels in the United States and Britain with those used on the same products in third world countries. They found labels in the third world were often sketchy and sometimes missing references to harmful side effects. **********The three researchers, Milton Silverman, Mia Lydecker and Dr. Philip R. Lee, looked at 39 drugs sold in dozens of countries, citing trade names and makers. ""We found that the multinationals, by and large, have cleaned up their act,"" said Mr. Silverman, a pharmacologist who has been writing about the issue since the 1970's. ""There are unfortunately some ghastly exceptions."" **********Dr. Sidney Wolfe, health research director of Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer group, was even more critical. ""The multinational companies are still engaging in very dangerous, misleading labeling of drugs, not only in the third world but also in developed countries."" he said. ""And things are worse in the third world. The regulations are weak, and people can often just walk into a drugstore without ever seeing a physician and buy the most potent, toxic medicines without a prescription,"" Dr. Wolfe said. **********The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association insists that the criticism is overblown. Jeffrey Warren, a spokesman for the trade group, said the international industry operated under ""an effective self-regulating code."" He added that labels approved by the Food and Drug Administration should not be ""the benchmark"" for assessing the adequacy of drug labels abroad, because many countries differed in their ""laws, regulations, policies and philosophies of medical practice."" **********The World Health Organization, a United Nations affiliate, does not agree, said Enrique Fefer, an adviser on drugs to the Pan American Health Organization, which is part of W.H.O. He said the international organizations were urging national health officials to require importers to supply local regulators with the same labeling information required in each drug's country of origin. Argentina recently enacted such a law, he said. **********Robert Neimeth, an executive vice president of Pfizer Inc., which had about 10 percent of its 1991 pharmaceutical sales in third world countries, said the company had ""tightened"" its policies in these areas. ""They are much more rigorous than they were,"" he said, adding that the changes were made ""not in response to complaints and moans"" from consumer activists. **********""Things that were considered to be good medicine 15 years ago are no longer recommended,"" Mr. Neimeth added. Some companies may make unintentional ""errors of omission"" in drug labeling, Mr. Neimeth conceded, ""but never an error of commission."" **********In their report, ""Bad Medicine"" (Stanford University Press), Mr. Silverman and his colleagues, Ms. Lydecker, a researcher, and Dr. Lee, a former Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare who is director of the Institute of Health Policy Studies of the University of California, San Francisco, said that locally owned drug companies in many third world countries were the worst labeling offenders. Mr. Silverman said the multinationals often had to compete against local companies ""owned by politicians like the minister of health or his brother-in-law."" **********Viren Mehta, a pharmacologist and analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Healthcare Investment Advisers, agreed that corruption was common in many third world countries. The stakes are large and growing. Mr. Mehta estimated that prescription drug sales in Latin America, Africa and Asia (excluding Japan) were about $25 billion in 1991, or about 13 percent of $195 billion in worldwide sales. **********Mr. Fefer, Mr. Neimeth and Dr. Wolfe are members of an advisory panel that is reviewing the Government drug-labeling study for the Office of Technology Assessment. The review group also includes professors of medicine and pharmacology and experts on tropical disease and public health. The panel members have promised not to discuss the report before its release, but they did not hide their views on the issues. **********One panel member, Sister Regina Rowan of the Roman Catholic Medical Mission Sisters, who is chairwoman of the International Health Issues Group of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, said the drug companies had public health responsibilities that could not be shirked. ""If they can't control the marketing of a drug, they should withdraw it from the market,"" she said. ""Taking a drug is not the same as choosing a washing machine."""

""It is just not clear where the balance comes out and it is not clear-cut what the market should do or what the implications are for our markets."" Figuring Out the Impact **********All eyes are now on Europe as analysts and investors try to figure out the probable impact of Britain's surprise decision to suspend its participation in the European Monetary System, which links the currencies of 11 European countries in fixed trading bands. The system was designed to bring, and had brought, stability to European foreign-exchange trading. **********But the system came under severe strain this summer as the German mark rallied because of concern over the outlook for the economic union of Europe. **********With polls showing that a French referendum on Sunday might turn down the next steps to an economic union, the pound and the Italian lira plummeted. And even a hasty lira devaluation and small German interest-rate cuts on Monday could not relieve the pressure. **********And when the British pound slipped below the bottom of its allowed trading floor despite a five-percentage-point increase in Bank of England interest rates yesterday, the Government of Prime Minister John Major apparently had no choice but to devalue the pound by withdrawing from the monetary system. System's Future Uncertain **********The British decision calls into question the future of the monetary system, and until it is clear what happens next, investors may be leery of taking positions, which means thin trading and volatile moves like those in New York trading yesterday. **********In late trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the price of the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was off 7/32 to yield 7.32 percent, up from 7.30 percent Tuesday. **********The bond had been off sharply in the morning and then rallied up to a few seconds before the British announcement. Barbara L. Kenworthy, portfolio manager of fixed-income funds at the Dreyfus Corporation, said the morning decline had been caused in part by central-bank selling of Treasury securities to raise the cash needed for the futile effort to support the British pound and Italian lira. **********But the price of the two-year 4.25 percent note was up 3/32 to yield 3.79 percent, compared with 3.84 percent the day before. And the price of the 4.625 percent three-year note was up 4/32 to yield 4.31 percent, down from 4.35 percent. The spread between the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond rose to 353 basis points or hundredths of a percentage point, eclipsing the mark of 349 basis points set Monday. A Possible Positive Side **********When there is uncertainity in the market, investors tend to get out of longer maturities because they are more volatile and subject to greater losses if some unexpected event occurs. **********The discount rates on three-month, six-month and one-year Treasury bills also fell yesterday. The move, and the fall in yields on the two-year and three-year notes, also reflect one of the positive beneifts of the turmoil in Europe -- the possibilty that the Federal Reserve will gain the freedom it needs to lower short-term interests here further. **********Already the dollar had risen since the German rate cut Monday and it rallied again yesterday. An eventual agreement among European members on a broad devalualtion of currencies against the German mark could also mean a further rate cut by the Germans, helping the dollar more. And the uncertainity in Europe is likely to bring some foreign investors to the United States, where the basic economic fundamentals are good for the bond market. **********""When the dust settles, we will find that this is a net plus for the United States,"" said Stephen Slifer, financial market economist at Lehman Brothers. Foreign Bonds **********Foreign bonds markets were in turmoil but closed before the final British decison to devalue the pound. Ms. Kenworthy of Dreyfus said it was hard to get prices in the cash bond markets, which means that traders were unwilling to take a position in the face of such uncertainity. **********In London, in a sign of the turmoil, the futures contract on the 10-year bond ended higher despite the interest-rate increases while the price of the active active 10-year bond closed down. **********But in Germany and France, in heavy trading, bond prices rose on the expectation that the Germans would eventually have to lower interest rates to calm financial markets."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/28/business/big-drop-in-orders-for-tools.html,Jonathan Hicks,1992-09-28,,543,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Big Drop In Orders For Tools,Big Drop In Orders For Tools," **********Orders for American-made machine tools plunged 23.3 percent in August from the previous month's level, according to a monthly survey by the industry's trade association. **********The level of machine tools orders gyrates wildly from one month to the next, analysts said, but they added that the August numbers indicated signs of sluggishness remaining in the nation's manufacturing industries, which appear reluctant to spend money to upgrade their plants and equipment. **********Machine tool orders were 33.1 percent lower than they were in August of last year. But for the first eight months of the year, orders rose 1.9 percent, compared with the similar period last year. Issue of Confidence in Economy **********""The year-ago comparison is cause for concern, because it suggests that the overall economic trends are not strong,"" said John Jacobson, president of Jacobson & Associates, a Philadelphia consulting firm. ""The issue is one of confidence in the economy. Businesses are questioning whether they have enough confidence in the economy to invest in new machinery and in upgrading their plants."" **********Albert W. Moore, the president of the trade association, said the decline in August was the result of summer sluggishness. ""It is common for August business activity to be off,"" he said, ""since many plants, both machine tool and manufacturing, close for vacations."" **********He added that many buyers might have postponed purchases until after the industry's international technology exhibition, held earlier this month. ""Many machinery buyers hold off on placing orders so they can see the new products and make quality and price comparisons,"" Mr. Moore said. **********But Mr. Jacobson contended that the month's steep drop from last year's level was significant, because businesses ""were closed for vacation last year, too."" **********The trade group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said the level of machine tool orders had fallen to $157.70 million, from $205.35 in July. The August figure was the lowest for the year, dropping below the $159.1 million in May that had been the 1992 low.  Tools' Importance as Indicator **********Machine tools are used to cut and form metal parts for a huge number of goods, from household appliances to supersonic jetliners. Because the auto industry accounts for about a third of the machine tool makers' output, Detroit's slump has hurt those companies. Orders of machine tools are considered an important economic indicator because they reflect the level of companies' investment in new machinery and in upgrading their plants. **********The decline in new orders from July came primarily from domestic businesses, whose orders dropped to $132.6 million, from $180 million in July. Orders from foreign businesses dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent in August from the previous month's level. **********Shipments of machine tools were down 9.6 percent from July. For the first eight months of the year, shipments were down 6 percent from the comparable period of 1991. Comparing August with August of last year, shipments of machine tools were down 9.3 percent. **********Orders for metal-cutting tools, which account for nearly three-fourths of the machine tool industry, were down 38.9 percent compared with July, and down 25.3 percent compared with August of last year. Orders for metal-forming tools were up 24.6 percent compared with the previous month and down 42.2 compared with the year-earlier level."

""We are groping,"" he acknowledged last week, adding that ""blaming the American worker for getting us into an economic mess makes no more sense than blaming government for not getting us out of it."" **********Very much on his mind was the vocal criticism of some Japanese leaders, who contend that American workers lack working skills, blaming them in essence for the loss of American leadership in such product areas as autos, radio and television, steel, some computers and computer peripherals. **********He agreed that this country ""has fallen behind in international competition"" and said that managers had blamed schools and others instead of first ""examining their firms' human resource policies and practices."" **********To top and middle managers he has this to say: Stop blaming the worker. Manage your enterprise as a portfolio of employee skills that can be adapted and trained for particular jobs, and treat schools and colleges as suppliers, picking the best among them. **********""The fairest thing to say to top managers is that your world is changing, and productivity is a function of the skills of their staffs and the skills their lower-level employees have,"" he said. ""We think the best way to start is to bring small groups of managers together with their own live program."" **********The basics involve understanding the customer and letting him define the quality of the products, and the second is that people work better in teams. ""You don't have to employ a Deming to understand this,"" he said, referring to W. Edwards Deming, the quality expert. **********""We want to get the top people involved, "" he continued. He said that this summer, in a major Midwestern city that he refused to identify, a small group of managers from a bank, telephone company, insurance company, public uitlity and hospital would meet over a three-month period to discuss their skills needs and training needs, with Mr. Zemsky and some of his staff assisting. Faculty members from the leading graduate school of business in the city are also to be involved. **********""They would learn from each other."" he said. Once the problems have been identified, the school of business could offer the training. **********Among the group of about 20 there will be an exchange of information face-to-face, as well as teleconferencing. After three months, another ""working party"" will be organized, Mr. Zemsky said. He said that the five companies were subscribing a total of $125,000 for the initial program. Future ones will cost less. **********""We have argued you cannot lead horses to water and make them drink,"" he said. ""You have to create a demand for training."" He added that it must be a matter of willingness and understanding of the need of how to make better use of skills and training. **********""Too often training is not considered an integral part of an American manager's job, unlike in Japan. "" he explained. In Japan a manager owns and conceptualizes the training programs, even though they might not come out of his budget. **********There is one notable American exception, he continued, the military.  An Army captain, for example, conceptualizes and understands that training is part of his job, he said. ""It is a real, perceived demand for training, under the aegis of the captain."" he added. **********Although he has planned a team approach for large Midwestern companies, he said a different approach might be needed for smaller ones. **********Mr. Zemsky cited the Illinois Manufacturers Association, which works with Northern Illinois University in De Kalb, Ill., to fulfill the needs of its members, mainly small companies. **********Another approach to training, he predicted, would be the more widespread use of apprenticeships, and his organization plans a research report on them. This, Mr. Zemsky said, would involve a cultural change for many managers by forcing them to deal directly with apprentices and their on-the-job training, adding that ""managers do not like like first-time workers."" ""They want them seasoned,"" he said."

Since then, tens of thousands of attempted calls have overwhelmed the limited number of long-distance lines into Cuba. Cuban-Americans have also been broadcasting personal messages on special radio programs on American stations, whose signals are routinely jammed by Cuba. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the major provider of the limited international service to Cuba, said yesterday that the hurricane had damaged or destroyed equipment in south Florida that relayed calls by radio the short distance to Cuba. **********A.T.& T. had been rerouting calls through approximately 30 circuits to Britain, 20 circuits to Canada and 50 circuits each to Spain and Italy. The calls were then conveyed by satellite to Cuba. **********A.T.& T. said that it was told on Monday by Cuba that only calls routed through Italy would be accepted, effectively reducing by two-thirds or more the number of calls received in Cuba; Italy is negotiating with Cuba to provide satellite links for telephones. Telex communications and other printed communications over electronic lines were banned entirely. **********The decision reduces Cuba's telephone links worldwide, but the greatest effect is on the United States, which is by far the largest source of calls to Cuba. On a typical day, close to 1,400 calls are completed from the United States to Cuba, but more than 164,000 calls are tried. With the new restrictions, it is likely that fewer than 500 calls daily will get through. **********Cuba has for more than 30 years been subject to economic sanctions by the United States, and Cuban officials may be using the hurricane situation as a bargaining chip to help ease the sanctions, the State Department and Cubans opposed to the Castro Government say. **********Some $75 million in disputed telephone fees may also be at issue. The money, known as settlement fees, has accumulated since 1966; it ordinarily would have been paid to Cuba as payment for calls that used the Cuban telephone network. In addition, only collect calls can be made by Cubans to residents of the United States, adding to the fees. **********Because of the embargo, the $75 million is in American banks instead of Cuba. The Cuban Government is insisting on release of the money before a new undersea cable, installed by A.T.& T. three years ago as a replacement for a damaged cable, can start operating, A.T.& T. said. **********""We haven't received official word on why Cuba is restricting calls,"" a State Department spokesman said yesterday. He added, ""But we believe it is a way of getting Cubans in Miami agitated over the lack of communications and pressuring the American Government to help restore communications on Cuban terms."" **********Jose Cardenas, a spokesman for the Cuban-American National Foundation in Miami, which supports strengthening the embargo against Cuba, said the telephone cutback is ""a typically cynical move by Castro."" **********The Cuban interest section in Washington, Cuba's only formal diplomatic presence in the United States, had no immediate comment yesterday. **********Alicia M. Torres, executive director of the Cuban American Committee Research and Education Fund in Washington, which supports lifting the embargo, said, ""Knowing the Cubans, this is not to rile up Cuban-Americans but to send a message to the United States: Let's normalize relations."""

It is this area that is to be administered by the Eskimos. They call the territory Nunavut, meaning Our Land. **********For the Ottawa Government the next steps will be to draft legislation creating the new land and work with community leaders on plans for the transition, including a crash program of training Eskimos for administrative jobs in the Nunavut government. 'Speak With One Voice' **********""This is a very positive development for Canada,"" said Stephen Kakfwi, minister of intergovernmental and aboriginal affairs for the government of the Northwest Territories. ""It shows that Canadians have the potential and capacity to support very strong change in favor of aboriginal people."" **********Rosemarie Kuptana, president of the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, the national political voice of the Eskimos, said the results ""demonstrate that Inuit speak with one voice on Nunavut."" Tapirisat is brotherhood. **********Canada now consists of 10 provinces and two territories, the Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Provinces represent somewhat more evolved political units than the territories. The main practical difference is that provinces own their own land and mineral resources; land in the territories is owned by the federal Government. **********Under the new arrangement, which is expected to come into effect after a seven-year transition, there will be three territories instead of two: the existing Yukon, Nunavut, and what's left of the Northwest Territories, populated by Indians of the Dene Nation in the Mackenzie Valley, Eskimos known as Inuvialuit around the Beaufort Sea, and whites, mainly around Yellowknife, the territorial capital. **********The creation of Nunavut is tied to an agreement signed last December in which the Eskimos will get outright title to nearly 20 percent of the land in the new territory and are guaranteed $1.4 billion over 14 years as an economic jump-start for the new homeland. **********One final formal obstacle to Nunavut is a vote scheduled for next November to ratify the land agreement. But the high turnout of Eskimos voting on Monday suggested that the November poll will be overwhelmingly affirmative. **********Of 55,000 inhabitants of the Northwest Territories and 27,000 who were eligible to vote, those who actually took part in Monday's plebiscite numbered 15,484, a turnout of 56.5 percent. **********In the eastern Arctic, where most of the Eskimos live, 72 percent voted and 87 percent said yes to the proposed boundary. In the western part of the Northwest Territories, where most of the local opponents of the split-up of the territory resides, 74 percent voted no. Opposed by Dene Indians **********Many of the nonnatives in the west saw the division as a needless expense and a threat to jobs. The territorial government in Yellowknife is the town's biggest employer, but its functions would be cut once the new Nunavut comes into being with its own governing structures. **********Some of the fears were expressed by Shirley M. McGrath, past president of the Chamber of Commerce of Yellowknife, who noted in an interview that businesses are closing at a rapid rate and ""if we look at losing a lot of government jobs as well, then what do we have left?"" **********The Dene Indians opposed the boundary as well because it cuts through some of their traditional hunting and burial grounds."

Mario Cesar Flores, met again today with Mr. Collor to urge him to negotiate his resignation. In a show of force, army squads briefly occupied parts of downtown Rio Thursday on the pretext of ""testing field radios."" Two weeks ago, Army units conducted similar ""radio tests"" in downtown Sao Paulo. **********Although the military ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, a coup is considered highly unlikely. **********""The military are not interested in a coup, but they do not want to be forced into performing riot duty,"" Jarbas Passarinho, a former army colonel who is now a senator, said of the military rumblings. The army blamed a lack of equipment and riot-control training for the killing of three workers four years ago by soldiers who had been ordered to repress a steel strike. No Military Interference **********""Political appeals do not seem to be sufficient to induce the President to wake up to reality,"" Carlos CastelloBranco, a political columnist, wrote in today's Jornal do Brasil. ""It is understood that the military ministers, anxious for an institutional solution, could take upon themselves the task of bringing the matter to Collor, appealing for his understanding."" **********In response, the Presidency issued a statement signed by the ministers of the army, navy and air force, asserting, ""The military ministers have repeatedly affirmed that they do not interfere in political affairs."" **********The President's spokesman, Etevaldo Dias, said today that Mr. Collor ""will not renounce one day of his term."" But such denials did not seem to carry much weight today as Brazil's Vice President, Itamar Franco, continued to interview candidates discreetly for a ""transition Cabinet."" Sao Paulo's stock market rose 27 percent this week, largely on the assumption that Mr. Collor will be forced to resign. **********Mr. Collor has maintained a public silence since Monday, when the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress, released a damaging report detailing the diversion of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to the President's inner circle. He reportedly still believes that he can block an impeachment through legal appeals to the Supreme Court or by buying support in the Chamber of Deputies, which could initiate an impeachment trial in the Senate if two-thirds of the Chamber's 502 members vote in favor of such a trial. **********But Brazil's Supreme Court dealt a setback to the President today. By refusing to rule that the impeachment vote must be secret, the Court appeared to favor allowing impeachment to proceed. **********To win the 168 votes he will need to stay in office, the President's strategy is to distribute as much as $28 billion in public-works projects, according to a pro-Government congressman interviewed in today's O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper. Economy Ministry officials have warned that there are no funds in the treasury for such a huge patronage campaign. Negotiated End Urged **********Today, a score card maintained by Sao Paulo's Folha newspaper showed that 324 deputies plan to vote for impeachment, only 12 short of the necessary 335. Only 35 deputies have publicly come out against impeachment. **********The last major politician to back Mr. Collor, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of the pro-Government Liberal Front party, was reported today to have abandoned the anti-impeachment drive and to have started discussing a negotiated resignation. **********Raising the stakes, opposition leaders vowed in a joint communique on Thursday not to allow the President to negotiate a Nixon-style pardon. **********""The President is losing the timing for a negotiated resignation, which would be his safe-conduct pass,"" Tasso Jereissati, president of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, told O Globo newspaper. **********A regional prosecutor announced that Rosane Collor, the President's wife, will be indicted presently on charges of embezzling $500,000 from a state charity over which she presided until a year ago. Brazil's first lady allegedly channeled most of the money to nonexistent projects run by family members in her rural hometown. **********And the police announced today that the President's former personal secretary, Ana Acioli, has been indicted on charges of fraud and criminal association in connection with a multimillion-dollar influence-trafficking ring. **********Brazil's most powerful politicians are pushing hard for Mr. Collor's quick removal, reasoning that the longer he remains in power, the more public pressure will build for tightening Brazil's lax campaign-financing laws."

DDB Needham New York has withdrawn a radio commercial for the New York State Lottery after lottery officials received complaints from the organizations about the spot, which promoted an instant lottery game called Crazy 8's with language chockablock with phraseology they disliked. In the commercial, when an announcer asks a man why he plays Crazy 8's, he says he is ""crazy,"" ""nuts,"" ""cuckoo,"" ""wacky"" and ""riding off the rails like a runaway train."" **********But another agency insists there will be no changes made in its award-winning advertisements, which the organizations are protesting, for Daffy's, a chain of discount clothing stores based in Secaucus, N.J.. **********""If you're paying over $100 for a dress shirt,"" says the ad, which appears as a television commercial and a transit poster, ""may we suggest a jacket to go with it?"" Next to those words is a picture of a straitjacket. **********""The advertising agencies do not realize that serious mental illness is a real illness,"" Jean Arnold, chairwoman of the public awareness committee of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New York State, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ""They consider it fair game."" **********""People who suffer these illnesses are really damaged by having society treat them in a flippant way,"" she added. ""That stigma is the burden they find hardest to deal with."" **********Katina Zachmanoglou, a member of the board of the Friends and Advocates of the Mentally Ill, agreed. ""I feel very strongly that stigma is at the core of why this illness is ignored,"" she said. ""We feel ads like this shape public thinking, and public thinking shapes public policy."" **********After Daffy's and its agency, Follis DeVito Verdi Inc. in New York, refused the organizations' requests to withdraw the ads, members demonstrated last week in front of Daffy's stores in Manhattan. And, Ms. Zachmanoglou said, many of the ad posters around Manhattan have been defaced with stickers that read: ""Straitjackets are not funny. Stop this ad!"" **********Those criticisms point up the growing pressures that agencies find themselves facing these days in creating attention-getting campaigns for clients. Well-organized groups representing minorities, pressure groups and causes are more than eager, if offended, to take issue with such campaigns, confronting the agencies -- sometimes in public, often in the media -- and the sponsors. **********Organizations representing women, gay men and lesbians, blacks, Hispanic-Americans, Native Americans, the disabled and the blind are only some of those that in recent years have publicized their quarrels with campaigns. In some cases, even disinterested observers agree with advocacy groups' complaints, like those of many Native Americans about the advertising for Crazy Horse, a new malt liquor. **********Other times, though, it may be hard to understand why ads were being disputed. For example, in 1989, the maker of Black Flag insecticide pulled a spot that drew complaints for playing taps to connote the death of insects. **********""You have to be careful not to get extreme,"" said Ellis J. Verdi, president of Follis DeVito Verdi. ""But in this case, I don't see the point."" **********""These organizations should be spending more time lobbying in Washington to get health-care dollars,"" he added, ""than to worry about a straitjacket ad that everybody loves."" **********Ruth Ayres, manager of creative services at DDB Needham New York, said that her agency, like others, ""certainly wants to be sensitive to our public watching our advertising, and to our clients' image in the marketplace."" She added, ""That's our job."" **********""Every now and then,"" she continued, ""within a context of creative enthusiasm, something can happen and a group can be offended."" While ""the word 'crazy' is part of the idiom,"" she said, ""and has come to mean something not nearly as extreme as mentally disabled,"" the agency agreed to stop running its lottery radio spot once the organizations voiced their objections. **********""All of us in the industry could, from time to time, step back and raise our sensitivities,"" Ms. Ayres said. ""It's a balancing act."""

The expansion would run from Bakersfield, Calif., where the Mojave pipeline system now terminates, north to Sacramento and the east San Francisco Bay area. The proposed pipeline would transport 400 million cubic feet of gas a day, primarily from the Permian Basin in Texas and the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. Mojave says it could move natural gas to Northern California industries for about 40 cents per million British thermal units, compared with about $1, which Mojave says they currently pay.

Minutes of previous meetings showed that the 12 members of the committee, while concerned about the economy's sluggishness, were divided on whether to ease monetary policy. **********Traditionally, a unanimous decision has empowered the chairman to cut rates by up to one-half of 1 percent without consulting the committee. But Fed officials say Mr. Greenspan is generally loath to adjust rates by even one-quarter of 1 percent without consulting committee members. **********Economists who follow the Fed say the central bank has not lowered rates since the Feb. 4-5 meeting because the economy has shown some signs of recovery since then. The last time the Fed lowered rates was Dec. 20, when it cut the discount rate to 3 1/2 percent from 4 1/2 percent. **********The report noted that during discussions at the meeting many members expressed fears that the effects of earlier moves to ease ""could prove to be less stimulative than anticipated."" It added that ""the persistence of a weak economy might well have especially severe consequences, and, in the view of some members, signs of such an outcome would call for prompt action."" **********The Open Market Committee met again on Tuesday, but the minutes of that meeting will not be released until May 22. Many experts speculate that the Fed again adopted a bias toward easing that would empower Mr. Greenspan to lower rates if the signs of recovery sputtered. **********The February minutes say the members were in favor of ""some bias"" toward easing, while the minutes of the December meeting, shortly before rates were lowered, spoke of a ""marked bias"" toward easing. Mixed Signals **********Fed officials have been encouraged by recent increases in retail sales and housing construction. But some economists said reports released today, showing the jobless rate unchanged at 7.3 percent and employment up only slightly, could be signs that the incipient recovery was faltering. **********The Open Market Committee comprises the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board and five presidents of Federal Reserve districts. **********According to the February minutes, ""The members generally agreed that enough monetary stimulus probably had been implemented to foster the desired upturn in economic activity without further policy moves."" But the report added that the outlook was so uncertain that the committee ""needed to remain alert to the possibility of developments that might require additional easing."" **********In appearances before Congressional committees, Mr. Greenspan often reiterated these views, saying he thought that enough monetary easing was in the pipeline to bring about a recovery, but adding that additional insurance, in the form of lower rates, might be warranted if the economy trailed off. Careful Wording **********The report said that many of those leaning toward easing stated that ""there should not be an unusually strong presumption that any easing would in fact be implemented"" between the February meeting and the meeting on Tuesday. **********""The committee should ease only in response to cumulating evidence that economic activity was not picking up or that monetary growth was falling appreciably short of expectations,"" the report said. **********In the discussions, a few members argued against a bias toward easing, saying more emphasis needed to be put on the inflationary risks of overreacting to economic weakness. But when the vote came, these members joined the unanimous decision, apparently because their views were not so strong that they thought it was worth dissenting."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/business/the-how-in-home-improvement.html,Isadore Barmash,1992-06-14,,1887,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,The 'How' in Home Improvement,The 'How' in Home Improvement," **********Depot Don, meet Martha Stewart. **********At Home Depot, the nation's largest chain of warehouse-sized do-it-yourself stores, socket wrenches and lawn mowers are now available through a bridal registry. And homeowners can get interior design advice along with their paint and wallpaper, and then have their preferences put on file for better service the next time they shop. **********Customers can also find greenhouses in an expanded gardening section and get special guidance on energy-saving products. **********These are among the newest services and test programs being introduced by the home-improvement chain whose dedication to service, epitomized by ""Depot Don"" how-to displays throughout its stores, has helped it shine in an otherwise troubled industry. Featuring customer training, low prices and more than 34,000 items, Home Depot has leapfrogged over all its rivals over the last five years and is currently more than twice the size of its nearest competitor, a feat considering that the Atlanta-based retailer is only 13 years old. Now it hopes that the latest innovations plus an ambitious expansion plan will help that growth continue. **********Not that its growth appears in jeopardy. Home Depot has been setting performance records in the $115 billion home-improvement industry, with sales increasing more than 35 percent each year over the past 10 years. In the last quarter alone, sales rose 38 percent and earnings jumped 55 percent. And since the beginning of last year, the company's stock price has soared 160 percent. **********Others in the industry, meanwhile, are scrambling to get back into the game after falling behind amid intense competition and price wars. Some, like No. 2 Lowe's, Channel Home Centers and Hechinger, are adapting Home Depot's warehouse strategy, while others are setting up smaller stores to target merchandise niches the leader doesn't have, like furniture. The Rickel's chain, for instance, has decided to open a specialized store in New Jersey. **********Among other stores, Mr. Goodbuy's was forced to close its chain in Philadelphia last year because of a competitive squeeze. And Pergament Home Centers is now rethinking its strategy after opening and closing several small home-improvement specialty stores. **********""Home Depot is creating both a consolidation and a fragmentation in the home-center business,"" said Ken Schept, editor of National Home Center News. **********Home Depot's two guiding lights, Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank, who founded the company in Atlanta with one store in 1979, preached that in a do-it-yourself time, it was as important to teach people    how    to do it themselves as it was to provide the materials. And so to a greater extent than any other home-improvement retailer, Mr. Marcus, as chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Blank, president and chief operating officer, have trained their salespeople to train the customers in home repair and refurbishing. **********Over the last 10 years, their efforts have driven sales up a hundredfold, from just $52 million to more than $5 billion. For the latest fiscal year, net income rose 52 percent, to $249.2 million, and sales climbed 35 percent, to $5.13 billion. **********Following an already aggressive expansion plan that has put the chain in 15 states, the company now aims to triple its number of stores from 184 now to about 525 by late in the decade. As part of the chain's strategy, it clusters its stores around a big city, with 14 Home Depots, for instance, in the Atlanta area. The clusters are heaviest in Florida, with 42 stores, and in California, with 56. **********The current expansion is mainly in the Northeast, where the company plans to add 15 stores this year to the 25 it now has. While New England has been nothing less than a disaster area for many retailers during the recession, it has been one of Home Depot's strongest markets. **********The chain's new-store thrust plus its compound sales growth are causing many to liken it to Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. In about 25 years, Wal-Mart sprung from its Arkansas base to jostle Sears, Roebuck from its No. 1 perch by building the country's largest chains of discount stores and warehouse clubs. But some analysts see Home Depot as even stronger in its field than Wal-Mart is in its. **********""If we could own just one retail stock for the next three years, our choice would continue to be Home Depot,"" said Dan R. Wewer Jr., retailing analyst for the Robinson-Humphrey Company, an Atlanta brokerage firm. ""No other billion-dollar retailer has the potential to grow 30 to 35 percent annually with such a low level of business risk."" **********Mr. Wewer cites the chain's high average annual sales per store -- about $31 million, or one-third higher than its competitors; its skill in teaching do-it-yourselfers, and its rising market share. He predicts Home Depot's market share will jump from about 6 percent this year to about 14 percent by 1996. **********Yet bright as most analysts see Home Depot's prospects, some doubt it can sustain its growth rate through the decade. **********""Statistically, if Home Depot continues to rack up its current growth rate and the market keeps up its 4.6 percent annual rate, Home Depot could virtually own the home-improvement business by the year 2000,"" says Walter Johnson, senior editor of Do-It-Yourself Retailing, a publication of the National Retail Hardware Association, based in Indianapolis. But he quickly adds that he does not believe it will happen because the company won't be able to open enough stores in enough markets to support that growth. **********""A lot of Home Depot's growth is coming from the mid-sized D-I-Y chains, and once a consolidation of these retailers ends, the industry's sales trend must slow,"" he said. **********And Christopher Vroom, of Alex Brown & Sons in Baltimore, observed that the company recently suffered some first-quarter erosion in its gross margin, which is the difference between the total cost of the goods and the final selling price, after enjoying an increase in the previous six quarters. He attributed the decline to ""a more aggressive pricing stance in several markets, including the important San Diego trade area, and to increased sales contribution from lower-gross margin lumber products."" But Mr. Vroom said Home Depot's expense-cutting program helped to lift operating profit in the quarter. **********In separate interviews, both Mr. Marcus, 62, and Mr. Blank, 49, stressed the importance of strong employee motivation to the company's past and future success. New salespeople are not hired for their product knowledge, Mr. Blank said, but for their ability to raise the customer's enthusiasm about a product or project. The sales people ""bleed orange,"" Mr. Marcus said, referring to the orange aprons that all store employees, including executives, wear. **********As incentives, salespeople are paid 20 percent to 25 percent more than those at rival companies, Mr. Blank said. And the company contributes to an ESOP that is available to all employees, as is a standard employee stock purchase plan. The company's stock price gains have enriched many of its employees, although, like many growth stocks, the shares have slowed their climb this year; at $68.375 on Friday, the stock is up $1 this year. **********But both executives cited three other important reasons for the company's high sales growth and strong profits. **********Since the company's founding, Home Depot has avoided the middleman or wholesaler, buying directly from the producer to keep prices lower than those of the competition. **********In addition, Mr. Black said, the company has continually stressed cutting expenses.  Since 1985, expenses as a percent of sales have fallen from 19.2 to 18.1 percent last year, one of the industry's lowest ratios. **********Finally, the company has tried to keep its merchandise assortment current through continuous customer testing. Says Mr. Marcus, ""One of the biggest lessons we learned was that we had to listen to our customers, whether they had requests on specific kinds of merchandise, needed help or counsel or just wanted to complain. Now it's like a religion in our company."" **********On the merchandising aspect, Mr. Wewer, the Atlanta analyst, observed: ""Home Depot is continually testing new merchandise ideas. Some of the ideas, such as the addition of greenhouses to the lawn and garden department, could have a major impact, while the test of a bridal registry probably will not prompt us to change any earnings estimate but looks like a great idea."" **********Analyst Bo Cheadle, managing director of Montgomery Securities, the San Francisco stock brokerage firm, likes Home Depot for its hard-nosed internal discipline. He cites the fact that the company's ""S.P.I."" -- store productivity improvement -- test program is now being extended to all new stores. The program involves using night hours for internal store cleaning, restocking and packaging. **********With the industry growing about 5 percent to 7 percent a year, Mr. Marcus believes the field can reach $200 billion by the year 2000 through higher sales marked by company consolidations and new entrants. Shooting for sales next year of about $6 billion, Home Depot should be able to lift its 6 percent market share to about 25 percent by the turn of the century, meaning sales of about $50 billion, Mr. Marcus insists, adding: ""We think there's room for 1,000 Home Depots in the United States."" MAKING A SPLASH IN ELMONT, L.I. **********It took only a little more than a year for the Home Depot in Elmont, L.I., to rack up a weekly sales total that was not only a record for itself but for all stores in the chain. **********Home Depot's top management saw the achievement as the occasion for a celebration and rewarded the store's 360 employees and guests with a party on May 17. **********""It was an expensive proposition,"" admitted Harry Alfred, the regional manager, ""but it was worth it. It was like a happy family get-together."" **********The Elmont store, which opened in February 1991 and is one of seven on Long Island, quickly became the biggest volume producer in the entire chain. Home Depot isn't saying how much the store did in sales in that record week, nor which week it was. But it was clearly a good chunk of business for the company to show such appreciation. **********Like other Home Depot stores, the one in Elmont upholds the importance of teaching the customer. Much is made of ""Depot Don"" displays throughout the 140,000-square-foot store. Named for a ""Don Someone"" in a Texas Home Depot who came up with the idea, the displays demonstrate how to install various products. **********But clinics, as many as four a day, are the store's main customer aid. Trained staff or supplier representatives teach customers how to install dry wall, put up a fence or plan a new kitchen, among other projects. A year ago, the store hired three interior decorators to assist the customers in color matching and other design considerations, reflecting a new trend in the do-it-yourself field. **********""We keep a file on customers, so that we know what they like in wallpaper, paint and lighting and can help them over the telephone,"" said Marina Lopez, one of the interior decorators who is a graduate of New York Institute of Technology. Asked if home-improvement stores were invading the previously sacrosanct province of furniture specialty stores by staffing decorators, she shrugged and replied: ""Why not? It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?"""

Tokyo is expected to announce a $375 million package on Friday, and that may be followed by loans from its Export-Import Bank. **********Some government officials and business executives familiar with the internal debate over the issue said the Government of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa had postponed its announcement until after the American elections. It feared that acting earlier would open Japan to criticism during the Presidential campaign that it was catering to the Japanese business interests while questions remain unresolved about the fate of American soldiers missing since the Vietnam War. **********With the recent announcement by Hanoi that it would open its records on American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, Washington is expected to move fairly quickly to lift the American embargo on trade with Vietnam and to begin to normalize relations. **********Japanese officials said they had informed the United States of their actions, but they declined to characterize the American response. They also said Japan had urged the Vietnamese to provide more information about the missing Americans. **********Unlike the United States, Japan never broke relations with Hanoi after the American pullout from Vietnam. But in 1979, after Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia, it halted virtually all aid to the Communist Government. Vietnam, in return, refused to pay back Japanese loans amounting to nearly $200 million, and since then economic relations have been stalled. **********A senior Japanese official involved in the decision over Vietnam said recently that ""we are looking at this as a symbol,"" and that Japan has told the United States that ""we want U.S. relations with Vietnam normalized."" **********American officials have said little publicly about Japan's impending action, though the Bush Administration was apparently informed of it several months ago. Last week Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the acting Secretary of State, said during a visit to Tokyo that ""whatever the Japanese Government decides to do, we have our own view of how to proceed."" **********""We will not be affected by what the Japanese Government decides,"" he added. **********For Japan, the decision appears to edge away from foreign policy positions that were largely defined by the United States. In recent months Japan has been stepping up its warming of relations with China, capped by a tour of the country last month by Emperor Akihito. Tokyo has also kept up a dialogue with the repressive Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, where Japanese diplomats insist that quiet persuasion -- and continued relief aid -- has begun to soften the regime. **********For the Vietnamese, courting Japan has been a major priority. Not only is Tokyo the largest contributor of aid, it is also the likeliest source of capital to rebuild the country's decrepit infrastructure. Some here say the expanded relationship with Japan may place subtle pressure on the United States to restore diplomatic relations and end its trade embargo, though Japanese officials deny that this is their goal. **********Among Japanese companies, Vietnam is considered one of Asia's last frontiers: a cheap and well-educated work force, in a country with enough population density to become a prime market, over time, for the lowest-tech Japanese goods. **********Already Ho Chi Minh City's hotels are brimming over with Japanese businessmen, looking for everything from oil contracts to good sites for low-technology factories. Japanese-made products, especially electronics, are already widely sold. Executives say they want to lay the groundwork for the day when Thailand and Malaysia, two other countries that have received enormous Japanese capital investment in recent years, become too expensive for further expansion. Business Dealings Grow **********Over the last two years, several of Japan's giant trading houses have opened small offices for representatives in Vietnam. Recently five Japanese companies joined to open a shipping and distribution company that could send manufacturing plants and equipment to Vietnam. Mitsubishi Oil Company recently signed a contract for rights to conduct test borings for oil off Vietnam's southern coast. **********Before they expanded further, however, the Japanese companies wanted to see Japanese aid pouring into the country, partly as insurance that their bills would be paid. ""We knew that we had to get past the burden of the unpaid old loans,"" said an official of Mitsui, one of the trading houses with a growing presence in Vietnam. ""But they have oil and cheap labor, and because the infrastructure is so limited, we can expect some business to build it."" **********Japanese officials, in announcing the package this morning, said that they had received ""support"" from the United States for the resumption of aid. Under the package announced today, the $375 million loan must be repaid within 30 years, but Japan will charge no interest for the first 10 years and only 1 percent interest thereafter. **********Vietnam will pay off its outstanding loans with cash received under the new program. That is expected to leave more than $200 million for projects to rebuild the country's shattered roads, and to build new factories and housing.                    --------------------       U.S. Re-examining Policy **********WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- Buoyed by a Vietnamese decision to turn over archival material on missing Americans, the Bush Administration is re-examining its policy on recognition of Vietnam and the lifting of a trade and aid embargo, officials say. **********American companies have been pressing President Bush to allow trade and investment in Vietnam, where, in addition to the Japanese, businesses from Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand have been very active. **********Under a road map to recognition given to the Vietnamese a year ago, ""substantial"" progress on explaining the fate of missing Americans could lead to the lifting of the embargo and the opening of an American liaison office in Hanoi and a Vietnamese office in Washington. **********Full diplomatic recognition, according to the Bush Administration's plan, would await a democratic election in Cambodia, tentatively scheduled for next spring. President-elect Bill Clinton has given no indication that this timetable would change."

Turkish Planning Troops **********""There is difficulty sustaining the language of the resolution,"" a Western diplomat said. ""Everyone is for the resolution, but then what do we do?"" **********And a senior Bush Administration official said this week: ""There is no appetite anywhere to send ground troops over to do this. Where are the ground troops to open up the land corridor? That is a real problem."" **********The only member of NATO's military alliance that has indicated a willingness to send troops is Turkey, a Muslim country that is committed to helping the Bosnian Muslims. A Turkish official said in Ankara today that his Government had developed plans for a mechanized battalion that would be part of a possible United Nations force in Bosnia, The Associated Press reported. **********France, which had already contributed 2,700 troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force in the Balkans, has indicated that it is ready to send forces to protect the aid shipments. But it is not clear how many troops the French are prepared to send, and it seems that the French are not interested in acting alone. If French forces are sent, they would likely be under the authority of the Western European Union, a regional military organization comprising 9 of the 12 European Community members, which Paris has promoted as a way to diminish the influence of the American-dominated NATO. **********In general, the Bush Administration does not like to see the Western European Union overshadow NATO. But the Pentagon remains as reluctant as ever to deploy ground troops, even if only to enforce the Security Council resolution that Mr. Bush called for. **********The recommendation by the NATO military authorities for a deployment of about 100,000 troops to protect aid shipments overland from the Adriatic to Sarajevo and to provide security to the Sarajevo airport was presented today to the organization's Military Committee, which comprises representatives from members of the alliance. **********According to a Western official, the committee said the recommendation ""was too heavily tilted to one heavy option"" and made clear that additional planning should be done to develop more options. **********While the recommendation by NATO's military authorities for a large troop deployment may run counter to the political will and judgment of its members, the military logic is clear."

DEMAND ON BOMB SUSPECTS,LIBYA IS EXPECTED TO GET U.N. DEMAND ON BOMB SUSPECTS," **********The United Nations Security Council is expected to serve Libya on Tuesday with a virtual demand that it hand over agents accused of blowing up Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988 or face the threat of economic sanctions. **********The resolution also calls on Libya to cooperate with an investigation into the destruction of a French airliner over West Africa in 1989. **********If the Libyans decline to meet the Council's demands, they are likely to be faced with a follow-up resolution in a week to 10 days setting forth the sanctions, diplomats from Council nations said today. **********The Security Council is now certain to approve such a resolution, diplomats said tonight, adding that Tuesday's vote could well turn out a unanimous one after the six third-world members said they would recommend the text to their capitals. But some cautioned that Morocco might still abstain out of solidarity with Libya, a fellow North African nation. 'Full and Effective Response' **********The carefully worded draft avoids specifically accusing Libya of responsibility for blowing up the two planes but merely ""urges"" it to provide ""a full and effective response"" to the demands of the United States, Britain and France ""so as to contribute to the elimination of international terrorism."" **********In practice, this means Libya would have to hand over for trial the two Libyan agents the United States and Britain have accused of helping blow up the Pan Am airliner with the loss of 270 lives, and pay compensation as these two Governments have demanded. **********The French Government has not formally asked for extradition of any of those it thinks helped blow up Union de Transports Aeriens Flight 772 over the West African nation of Niger in September 1989 with the loss of 177 lives. But a French investigating magistrate has accused several Libyans of doing so and issued warrants for their arrest. 'Remain Seized of This Matter' **********The new draft resolution also avoids threatening Libya openly with sanctions if, as expected, it fails to comply, saying only that the Council decides ""to remain seized of this matter."" **********But spokesmen for the American, British and French Governments have all made clear in recent days that they will ask the Council to impose mandatory economic sanctions on Libya under Article 7 of the United Nations Charter if it refuses to cooperate. **********Such sanctions would probably take the form of a worldwide ban on civil aviation links as well as on sales of aircraft and spare parts. **********The United States, Britain, France, Russia and China have permanent Security Council membership and can veto any decision. Other members, serving two-year terms, are Hungary, Austria, Belgium, Japan, India, Zimbabwe, Cape Verde, Morocco, Ecuador and Venezuela. **********Libya has sent a high-level delegation to attend Tuesday's meeting, headed by a former Foreign Minister, Jadulah Azuz Talhi, who is currently Minister of Strategic Industries. **********Mr. Talhi, who is expected to address the Council, made no statement today. But Libya's Arab League representative, Ali Treiki, who is a former United Nations representative, said Libya is ready to cooperate with an investigation into the bombing of the planes but appeared to exclude handing over the accused Libyans. ""There is no law which requires us to hand over our citizens,"" he said. ""This is something we can't do."" **********The resolution hammered out today after weeks of negotiation ""strongly deplores"" the fact that Libya has not ""responded effectively"" to the three countries' ""request to cooperate fully in establishing responsibility for the terrorist acts referred to above against Pan Am Flight 103 and U.T.A. Flight 772."" **********It ""urges the Libyan Government immediately to provide a full and effective response to those requests so as to contribute to the elimination of international terrorism."" And it also ""urges all states individually and collectively to encourage the Libyan Government to respond fully and effectively to those requests."" First Demand for Extradition **********Today's draft marks the first time the Security Council has effectively demanded the extradition of the citizens of one country to stand trial in another. It is also the first time the Council has implicitly accused another United Nations member of involvement in government-sponsored terrorism. **********The resolution's adoption on Tuesday, diplomats say, would thus continue an emerging trend in which the United Nations is becoming increasingly involved in countries' domestic affairs to promote such goals as justice, human rights, democracy, humanitarian assistance and disarmament. **********Libya has reacted with growing alarm to the prospect of a new confrontation with the United States and its allies. It says the accused agents are under arrest and is offering to try them itself or send them before some specially convened international tribunal. **********The United States and its supporters argue that the Libyan Government cannot try people it sent to destroy the airliners. They also say that no international court is competent to hear such a case. **********Libya has also proposed a list of eccentric measures that it wants the United Nations to take to eliminate what it calls the causes of terrorism. These include a ban on hunting, boxing and wrestling, as well as promoting agricultural development by reversing the flow of rivers so their waters can be used for irrigation instead of running to waste in the sea. **********Last week the Arab League adopted a resolution praising Libya for offering to release all facts about the loss of the two airliners and calling on the Secretary General ""to solve this dispute through negotiations, mediation and judicial settlement."" **********The final text asks the Secretary General ""to seek the cooperation of the Libyan Government"" in complying with the new resolution. But the United States, France and Britain prevented the Council from specifically asking the Secretary General to become involved in resolving their dispute, fearing that this could be used as a pretext to delay a decision on sanctions. **********Families of victims of the Lockerbie bombing today criticized the draft text of the United Nations resolution as weak and inadequate. **********Speaking at a news conference shortly before the scheduled vote of the Security Council, they said that though the United Nations resolution is a first step, it is not enough.  'Better Than Nothing' **********""The current resolution contains no deadlines, no provisions for sanctions and the word extradition is not even mentioned,"" said Susan Cohen, who's 20-year-old daughter, Theodora, died in the crash. ""However, it is better than nothing."" **********Members of the families felt that although there is evidence pointing to Libya's involvement, it should not be the sole accused. ""There is ample evidence that both Syria and Iran were involved,"" Daniel Cohen said. ""But, because of political reasons the United States and Great Britain have drawn the Pan Am 103 case very narrowly, accusing only two Libyans."" **********After the news conference, the families held a brief vigil across from the United Nations headquarters at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza on 47th Street and First Avenue, where they read aloud the names of the 270 people who were killed in the crash of Pan Am Flight 103."

""No,"" he said. ""I don't know Bharat."" **********Gently, Kailash Satyarthi placed his hand on the young man's shoulder and said: ""Bharat is this country, where you live. Bharat is India."" **********Around Mr. Satyarthi and the 15-year-old, Bushan Lal, hovered a dozen other young men, some nodding in understanding, others wrestling with a new idea, the idea of India. **********Mr. Satyarthi explained: ""These men have never seen a white person. They have never seen a newspaper. They have never heard of America. They don't know what money is. Some don't even know the name of their country. They were bonded laborers, people who have been in complete servitude."" **********Throughout India, bonded laborers toil, unpaid and ill treated, in what amounts to slavery in stone quarries, in brick kilns and yards, and in the rice paddies of central and southern India.  40,000 Are Liberated **********Bonded labor -- the practice of engaging laborers without wages to pay off real or imagined debts -- is against the law. But it persists despite court rulings, occasional police intervention and the work of people like Mr. Satyarthi, who works here at his center for bonded laborers 20 miles northeast of New Delhi. **********""We estimate,"" he said, ""a very conservative estimate, that there are 5 million adults and 10 million children in bonded labor in India,"" which has a population of 844 million. **********For more than a decade, Mr. Satyarthi, a former engineer, has devoted his energies to freeing India's bonded laborers from servitude. **********""Since 1980 we have liberated more than 40,000 bonded laborers from around the country,"" Mr. Satyarthi said. ""I have lost two friends while trying to liberate laborers, both in 1985. One was beaten to death with iron rods. One was shot dead. Both were in the quarries. Some people were arrested, but all were released later on."" **********Virtually all of India's bonded laborers are untouchables, who are at the bottom of the caste hierarchy. Some were born into their condition because their parents or grandparents were sold long before they were born. Others were lured into servitude by agents for quarry owners or brick kiln managers with promises of higher paying jobs than those they had. Still others fell into their position from the need to repay loans that were readily given, but that can never be fully repaid. Once indentured, it is almost impossible to escape. **********Only through repeated court orders from the Indian Supreme Court has Mr. Satyarthi been able to free any bonded laborers. And even then, he said, local police and government officials often ignored the court's ruling. ""There is so much corruption,"" he said. **********Hari Krishna Kandoi said: ""I'm a harijan. My family has been bonded labor for generations. My father was bonded labor and also my grandfather. I worked on a rice field in Chaunaurdiha Village,"" in Madhya Pradesh in central India. ""I was never paid any wages. I was just given some food. I was released three months ago by the Supreme Court."" **********But freedom alone, Mr. Satyarthi said, is not enough for men like Mr. Kandoi. ""We realized that here was a problem of looking after these people, otherwise they would go back to being bonded laborers,"" Mr. Satyarthi said. **********So last year he formed what he calls Mukti Ashram, or Liberation Retreat, where he works with former bonded laborers.  'Afraid of Everyone' **********""People who are bonded laborers are mental slaves,"" he said. ""It is hard for them to mix in society. They feel themselves very inferior. They feel the burden of being casteless. They have no way of earning a living. They have no idea what to do with money. And they are afraid of everyone."" **********With money from private donors, he bought an acre of land on the outskirts of this village. He hired a tailor, carpenter, weaver, iron worker and mason to teach trades to the bonded laborers, a counselor to help with their adjustment problems and a cook to feed them. **********From his decade of work with bonded labor, he has 100 people around India working full time to free laborers from servitude, mostly by trying to get court orders enforced. And every three months, his colleagues send 50 to 60 bonded laborers to Mukti Ashram for training. **********""Caste, religion, the political system, the economic system -- all are helping the bonded labor owners,"" Mr. Satyarthi said. ""I believe in Gandhi's philosophy of the last man, that is, the bonded laborer is the last man in Indian society, that we are here to liberate the last man."" Ranks Still Grow **********Despite the efforts of his ashram, and the injunctions of the law, the ranks of bonded laborers continue to grow, Mr. Satyarthi said. ""We have liberated about 5,000 children in the last 10 years. But in the last 10 years, about 100,000 children have come into the industry."" **********Mr. Satyarthi walked across the ashram compound toward the communal hall where a new group of bonded laborers were gathering. They sat cross-legged in precise rows on coir mats, expectant, unsure of what the next three months would hold. Then Mr. Satyarthi turned to Bushan Lal, the 15-year-old, and said quietly, ""Show us a dance."" **********And the young man, to the beat of a drum from another laborer, began a slow folk dance and song from his native village. Bushan Lal, Mr. Satyarthi said later, was beginning to learn to be himself."

But he added that his warnings had been delivered to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d a month before the Administration authorized an additional $1 billion in loan guarantees. **********A Congressional chairman joined a Federal judge in accusing the Justice Department of silencing Christopher P. Drogoul, a former official of the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which gave Iraq $5 billion in illegal loans, much of it backed by United States Government loan guarantees. Pleads Guilty to 60 Counts **********Mr. Drogoul, who had planned to plead guilty to a 347-count indictment and make a public statement implicating others involved in the scheme, was persuaded by Justice Department officials to plead guilty to 60 counts and to discuss the case only with them for two months before making a public statement. **********""They didn't want him to talk about something,"" said Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, which held the hearing to determine whether to seek an independent counsel to investigate American policy toward Iraq and assertions of a subsequent coverup. **********""It's pretty inherently sinister,"" Mr. Brooks said. ""They made the deal for him not to sing like a bird."" **********Mr. Brooks released a letter from Federal District Judge Marvin H. Shoob, concerning his displeasure with the Justice Department's handling of Mr. Drogoul's plea bargain. Bank Case Called Complicated **********""In vew of the substantial public and media interest in this case, I felt that it was important and necessary that a full disclosure, under oath, be made by Mr Drogoul, as was promised, at the time of the plea,"" the judge wrote. **********But Robert S. Mueller 3d, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division, told the committee that there was no desire to muzzle Mr. Drogoul, but rather that the bank scheme was so complicated that it would take weeks to describe. **********Much of the hearing dealt with the circumstances surrounding the Commerce Department's alteration of 68 license records given to the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs. The Commerce Department's inspector general, Frank DeGeorge, testified that changes to five truck license records that concealed their military use were ""unjustified and misleading,"" but that almost all the other changes were ""inconsequential."" **********He acknowledged, however, that the value of the licensed trucks was more than $1 billion, or two thirds of the total value of the approved licenses to Iraq. **********Mr. DeGeorge said the alterations were ordered by Dennis Kloske, a former Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. But Mr. Kloske was interviewed by two Commerce Department officials, who wrote in their report: ""We asked him if there are standing orders from the Office of the Secretary, including the General Counsel's Office, to silently 'take the heat' for export license controversies. He would only answer, 'Orders are orders.' "" **********Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, who interviewed Mr. Kloske last night, said that Mr. Kloske had told him that he had spoken with Nicholas Rostow of the National Security Council about the records, and also remembered meeting with Stephen Rademaker, another N.S.C. aide. Mr. Schumer said Mr. Kloske told him he was under the daily supervision of former Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher ""about what information was being provided"" to Congress."

Distribution, in 1986; Adidas U.S.A., in 1988, and Hitachi Electronics Devices in 1989. **********""By the 1980's, everybody was in the game of global smokestack chasing,"" said Doug Woodward, a research economist with the University of South Carolina's College of Business Administration. But he said north-central South Carolina, well positioned between Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta, had taken the lead.  South Carolina has the highest per-capita foreign investment in the nation, according to the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce. And the largest chunk of that investment comes from Germany. **********""South Carolina has this great location,"" Mr. Woodward said, citing its three ports and extensive interstate highway system. ""They say Atlanta is the capital of the South. It should be Charleston."" **********Officials involved in recruiting BMW, which is expected to announce its decision on Tuesday to build a plant here, say South Carolina's successes have been based on creating a favorable business climate. **********S. Hunter Howard Jr., executive vice president of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, said of foreign companies, ""They see incentives, they see the tone of the legislature being pro-business, and those things combined with the quality of life and labor issues -- I just think it's a composite decision.""  Incentives for new and expanding businesses approved by the state include tax credits for companies that locate their headquarters here or that create new jobs, as well as sharp reductions in property taxes. **********""We've reduced the corporate income tax rate from 6 to 5 percent, the lowest rate in the Southeast and one of the lowest in the country,"" Mr. Howard said. **********While South Carolina is known primarily for its textile-related industries, officials say the development of auto-related businesses had laid the groundwork for BMW's arrival. That industry, largely developed over the last 10 to 20 years, now includes more than 600 companies with more than 67,000 workers, according to figures provided by the South Carolina Development Board. **********One of the first important auto suppliers to move to the state was Michelin, a French company, in the 1970's. Michelin now has four plants in South Carolina, including two in Spartanburg and Greenville that employ a total of 5,400 workers. **********Michelin's arrival was followed by a wave of other foreign companies, led by the German and Japanese, that have moved into the state and established auto-related manufacturing plants. **********But many in South Carolina considered BMW the crown jewel of foreign investments and went to great lengths to bring it here. BMW, which will build the plant on a 1,200-acre site near the Greenville-Spartanburg airport, is expected to invest $645 million eventually and employ up to 4,000 workers. **********State officials were withholding comments today on specifics of the agreement with BMW until Tuesday's announcement, but incentives known to have been offered the German auto maker total $145 million. These include $30 million to buy and prepare land for the factory; $10 million for road projects near the site; temporary office space offered at reduced rates in Greenville or Spartanburg; 35 free apartments in Greenville and 20 in Spartanburg, and expansion of the Greenville-Spartanburg airport runway to accommodate 747 jetliners. **********In addition, tax law changes would allow BMW to save as much as $50 million over 20 years in water and sewer costs. And a state income tax credit of $1,500 per employee would create savings of $2.7 million a year."

""We had cartoons, old movies and our audience was -- let's face it -- very, very young,"" said John F. Cooke, the president of the pay channel. How young? Twelve years old? ""That's too old,"" Mr. Cooke said with a gentle laugh. ""I would say 7 or 8."" **********Today, the Disney Channel has emerged as the fastest-growing pay service on television, an outlet that has sought successfully to retain its young audience while expanding significantly into the teen-age and adult market. From 1984 until last year, the number of subscribers to the channel grew from 1.7 million to 6.2 million. **********By contrast, Home Box Office, the largest pay-television service, had a much smaller gain in subscribers in the same period, from 14.5 million to 17.2 million, as audiences on pay television generally leveled off. Blessed and Burdened **********The process of luring adults to Disney, while successful, is a delicate one. Unlike such outlets as Home Box Office, which prides itself on its sometimes provocative feature films and series, Disney remains family oriented and both blessed and burdened by the Disney name. **********It is blessed because the Disney name is a virtual metaphor on television for young people's entertainment and has a built-in audience. It is burdened because the symbolism of Disney, as white-bread entertainment, places distinct limits on the kinds of programming on the channel. **********""I took this job in 1985 in spite of the fact that a lot of people told me I shouldn't because they thought this channel couldn't go anywhere,"" said Mr. Cooke, a buttoned-down, bespectacled executive who was formerly executive vice president of Times Mirror Cable Television. ""When I talked to Michael Eisner about the position, he said, 'We really don't know what to do about the channel.' I said, 'After you've thought about it, Michael, talk to me.' And he said: 'No. You decide."" **********The gamble by Mr. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, paid off. ""The company was, quite frankly, late in the market,"" Mr. Eisner said. He added that initially the channel was dominated by old material from the Disney library. **********He continued: ""So we started off with a very good executive, John, who reduced the library way down, who began doing mini-series of some importance, who raised the quality of the programs to make it an all-family channel. It is the place where the baton of Disney culture is passed from one generation to the other."" **********Mr. Cooke and Mr. Eisner acknowledge that they had nowhere to go but up, because the channel's programming was almost charmingly awful in the early 1980's. **********Late afternoon and evening programs, for the teen-age and adult Disney crowd, were dominated by a series of lectures by the psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, a Steve Allen comedy show, the black-and-white 1950's series ""Mickey Mouse Club"" and ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin,"" silent Charlie Chaplin movies, and big-band concerts at Disneyland by Les Brown, Tommy Dorsey and Buddy Rich. Changes in Programming **********Mr. Cooke moved carefully and quickly to extend the appeal of the channel, while seeking to keep it family oriented. Now, films appear at night like ""Tender Mercies,"" with Robert Duvall and Tess Harper, and Kenneth Branagh's version of ""Henry V."" More significant, an up-to-date and fairly hip version of ""Mickey Mouse Club,"" intended to appeal to teen-agers, at 5:30 P.M. during the week, is the channel's highest-rated daytime program. **********There are concert shows intended to appeal to an older crowd, with performers including Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, Gloria Estefan and James Taylor. **********More ambitious -- and expensive -- programming includes a weekday educational series, ""Adventures in Wonderland,"" which is in the vein of ""Sesame Street""; some original dramas dealing with racial and religious bias; several mini-series, and a dramatic series, ""Avonlea,"" about the adventures of a small-town family.  Disney officials say the channel has remained profitable since 1985, but decline to release specific figures. They say revenues for the channel currently are more than $225 million a year. **********The channel's biggest competitor on cable is, in many ways, Nickelodeon, which also offers numerous programs for children. But Nickelodeon, which reaches nearly 56 million households, is a basic cable channel and is supported by advertising. The Disney Channel, with its pay status, is free of commercials. Criticisms of Competitors **********Rival cable and television executives acknowledge Disney's growth but say, essentially, that the channel remains so family oriented that it must limit its programs to children's shows, ""safe"" historical programs and family dramas. Moreover, rivals say, Disney prices its pay channel relatively flexibly, with Disney serving as an ""add-on"" to other pay choices. **********They also say that, unlike Disney's movie companies -- Touchstone and Hollywood -- which can offer films with Bette Midler, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams or Tom Cruise that may not be traditionally family oriented, the channel bearing the Disney name is burdened by it. **********But Mr. Cooke disagrees. ""When I came here the Disney name was a giant problem, and actors wouldn't even answer our phone calls,"" he said. ""They didn't care; it wasn't a place to be. They said, ' Why should we be on the Disney Channel when we can be on HBO or ABC or CBS or NBC?"" Disney was not fashionable. Now, I'm pleased to say we are fashionable. Or fashionable enough."""

Nevertheless, this is the first time Mr. Panic has lost the confidence of the lower house since it voted overwhelmingly to appoint him Prime Minister in July. The appointment came at the urging of Mr. Milosevic, who hoped that Mr. Panic would be able to persuade the United Nations Security Council to lift the trade embargo it imposed on Yugoslavia because of its support for the Serbian cause in the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********President Cosic has called new elections for Dec. 20, and Mr. Panic's supporters hope that the opposition parties can defeat the Socialists in the federal and Serbian Parliaments and pave the way for sanctions to be lifted. **********But most opposition parties have still not decided whether they will take part in that contest. **********Mr. Panic has won the praise and support of Cyrus R. Vance of the United Nations and Lord Owen of the European Community, the two international mediators trying to settle the Balkan crisis, for his efforts to promote an end to the fighting. Serbs Dissatisifed **********But in recent weeks Serbian nationalists have appeared increasingly unhappy with the kind of solutions that the negotiators are proposing and which seem to have Mr. Panic's support. **********Today, the Bosnian Serbs were reported to have walked out of the peace talks organized by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen in Geneva because the mediators refused to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into ""ethnically pure"" areas reserved for Serbs, Croats and Muslims. **********Mr. Vance, a former United States Secretary of State, and Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, fear that such a division would merely invite further ethnic expulsions and discriminate unfairly against the Muslim majority, which has suffered a string of military defeats in recent weeks at the hands of the Serbs and the Croats. **********The leader of Bosnia's Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, who has had Mr. Milosevic's support so far, wants to divide Bosnia and Herzegovina into five separate and largely autonomous areas, with the two largest reserved for Serbs and Croats respectively and three smaller pockets going to Muslims around the towns of Tuzla, Zenica and Bihac. The capital, Sarajevo, would be split between the three groups.  Mediators' Plan for Division **********The Muslims object to any settlement along such lines. And Mr. Vance and Lord Owen have proposed dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into 7 or 10 highly autonomous but ethnically mixed areas defined by economic rather than ethnic criteria, with a weak central government. **********Meanwhile, Bosnia's Serbian forces are seeking to enlarge the gains they made on the ground last week when they captured the strategically important town of Jajce from the Muslims. They are pressing on toward Travnik and stepping up their artillery attacks on encircled Sarajevo. **********These fresh attacks appear to violate the promises their leaders gave the United Nations for a ""week of tranquillity"" this week when fighting would stop so aid workers could deliver winter clothes and medicine to needy children throughout the region. **********Most diplomats here believe that Bosnia's Serbs, with the support of Mr. Milosevic's Government, are determined to capture on the battlefield the separate Serbian state they are being denied in the conference room."

Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the oversight committee, asked the S.E.C. to advise his panel by the end of next month on what it has done, or intends to do, to insure that mutual funds and other investment companies have installed adequate barriers to prevent the misuse of sensitive information. **********In his letter to Richard C. Breeden, the S.E.C. chairman, Mr. Dingell noted that Congress had already enacted legislation, the Insider Trading Act of 1988, that requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to establish policies and procedures, known as ""Chinese walls,"" to prevent the misuse of inside information. **********In response to that law, the S.E.C. undertook a comprehensive review of Chinese walls in the broker-dealer industry and reported its findings to Congress in March 1990. ""We have received no similar report with respect to investment companies and investment advisers,"" Mr. Dingell said. Fund Manager Transactions **********He specifically asked Mr. Breeden to respond to an April 19 article in The New York Times, which examined the issues and problems raised by the increasing access to inside information by the mutual fund industry. His questions included an inquiry about transactions in which fund managers at Fidelity Investments in Boston both invested in the securities of Trump Plaza and Bally's Grand casino-hotel and negotiated directly with the two casino-hotel companies as part of private debt restructurings. **********Mr. Dingell also asked the S.E.C. to include in its report information about so-called prime-rate funds, which invest in bank loans, asking for information about the special Chinese-wall problems those funds raise and the adequacy of their efforts to cope with them. **********""The S.E.C., of course, takes Chairman Dingell's concern seriously,"" said Peter M. Robinson, an S.E.C. spokesman, last night. ""We are preparing a response."" **********A spokesman for Mr. Dingell's office said the chairman had not yet decided whether formal hearings would be conducted on the issue.

But it is still several years away from profitability, according to an annual survey released yesterday by the accounting firm Ernst & Young. **********G. Steven Burrill and Kenneth B. Lee Jr., the San Francisco-based authors of the survey, said the total number of biotech companies grew 11 percent, to 1,231, in the year ending June 30. Industry employment expanded to 79,000, an increase of 13 percent. **********Total revenues, including royalties and contract research payments, increased 28 percent, to $8.1 billion, while product sales grew 35 percent, to $5.9 billion. Net losses were also up, climbing 32 percent, to $3.4 billion, a reflection of the continual heavy investment required for building new businesses. **********Mr. Burrill and Mr. Lee, employing a benchmark popular among biotech analysts, included a comparison of the entire fledgling industry with Merck & Company, the prototype of the successful, multinational pharmaceutical enterprise that many of the biotech companies dream of becoming. **********Merck's 1991 sales of $8.6 billion were slightly higher than the biotech industry's, and the $2.1 billion in profits was an obvious contrast. But in terms of the market value of stock shares, Merck's $60 billion (based on prices this summer) was reasonably close to the $50 billion combined market value of the 225 publicly traded biotech companies. **********By this measure, many analysts feel that it is the money-losing biotech companies, not Merck, that are undervalued.  They ask which is likely to produce higher earnings growth in the future -- a biotech industry that last year spent $4.9 billion on research and development and has hundreds of products in the pipeline, or Merck, which spent $988 million and has a more modest new-product portfolio under development? **********Of course, Merck has a few valuable weapons in its arsenal, like experience and marketing muscle -- not to mention the financial clout to acquire plenty of products that it does not invent itself."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/15/world/serbs-letting-gas-flow-to-sarajevo.html,John Burns,1992-10-15,,790,,The New York Times,World,News,article,SERBS LETTING GAS FLOW TO SARAJEVO,SERBS LETTING GAS FLOW TO SARAJEVO," **********Serbian nationalist forces reopened a natural gas pipeline to Sarajevo today, bringing central heating to at least some parts of the city just as autumn chills were driving thousands of people to the city's parks and graveyards and river banks in a desperate rush to cut trees for winter fuel. **********The pipeline that feeds Siberian natural gas to Sarajevo was cut off eight days ago, somewhere in the arc of Serb-held Bosnia that lies between this besieged city and the border of Serbia, about 100 miles east. The cutoff followed Serbian attacks three weeks ago that cut the last of the electricity and running water reaching the 400,000 people estimated to be living inside the Serbian siege lines. **********The electricity and water remained cut off today, but United Nations officials said they hoped that electricity would begin flowing again on Thursday after utility crews working under United Nations military escort complete repairs on transmission lines outside the city. **********With electricity restored, the United Nations officials said, the pumping station that supplies 80 percent of Sarajevo's water, also under Serbian control, should also come on stream again. **********But United Nations officials struck a skeptical note born of repeated frustrations in efforts to restore electricity to the city. Gen. Philippe Morillon, the United Nations military commander for Bosnia, predicted on Monday that electricity would soon be restored, but within hours power lines that had just been repaired were wrecked again by mortar fire. **********The Serbian move to restore at least some of the city's means of winter heating came as something approaching panic began to sweep through the city. Despite orders from the Government, which has sought to save trees in public areas, there has been a stampede in recent days to chop down the oak, chestnut and poplar trees that have made this one of the leafiest cities in the Balkans. **********The city's streets have been busy with people pushing freshly cut logs on handcarts, or dragging branches miles to their homes, and some districts have already been effectively deforested. **********On one occasion this week, a policeman fired over the heads of people chopping trees in a park, but Oslobodjenje, the city's principal newspaper, reported that they ignored the warning shots. They evidently judged that the greater danger was the impending Bosnian winter, with temperatures that sink below freezing by late October and move toward zero as the winter deepens. Cemetery Trees Felled **********At 7 A.M. today, a dozen men in blue overalls were ignoring mortar and sniper fire from Serb-held hillsides above them as they used a chain saw to fell the last of the chestnut trees that have shaded the Lion Cemetery, where nearly 3,000 victims of the Serbian attacks on the city have been buried. **********The men, from a neighborhood miles away, appeared there for the first time on Tuesday, flourishing a permit given to them by the Bosnian Army, which has taken control of many aspects of Sarajevo life. Although the permit was for Tuesday only, the men returned at dawn today, maneuvering amid the muddy graves to fell trees and make firewood that they said they could sell for 50 German marks, about $35, for a cubic yard. This is about five times the current monthly salary of a Sarajevo surgeon. **********Watching the men from a tree stump was Lejla Kocukalic, a 20-year-old who was a member of Yugoslavia's swimming team in the 1991 world championships in Australia. She, too, had been in the graveyard since dawn, gathering smaller branches and carrying them 300 yards to the apartment she shares with her widowed mother. **********""I haven't got a saw, and I'm not so strong anyway, so I wait for the little pieces they don't want,"" she said. A Rare Serbian Concession **********The restoration of natural gas was a rare concession by the Serbian leaders, and it will be short-lived if it follows the pattern of previous Serbian moves to ease the siege. **********The heavy weapons with which the Serbian forces have surrounded Sarajevo been been restrained for periods of a week or more, then unleashed again, and this has been the case, too, with the severing of electricity, water and telephone links. General Morillon has announced three times in two months that the Serbian leaders have promised to restore these links, only to have the pledges broken. **********Repair teams escorted by United Nations troops have been fired on repeatedly. This week a work crew approaching the siege lines north of Sarajevo with safe-passage documents from Serbian leaders was turned back by a Serbian commander who warned that his men would open fire on any other crew approaching his area."

He was accused of buying $110,000 of the bonds and then reselling them to the authority at a profit of $6,482. **********In normal insider-trading cases, involving stocks, courts have emphasized the fiduciary relationship between corporate officers and the shareholders who bought the stock that the insider was selling.

He expressed hope that a Senate measure would be more to his liking, although any Senate bill is also likely to have an increase in taxes for high-income people that he has called unacceptable.  Dole Predicts a Veto **********Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, predicted that result today and said no serious legislation would come up until after Mr. Bush vetoed a Democratic bill with tax increases. But while Mr. Dole criticized the Democrats for supporting tax increases, he did not offer much praise for Mr. Bush's alternative either. **********""There's not much in either package to really jump-start the economy or blow it out of the water and make it really jump,"" he said. Mr. Dole, who has introduced the President's complete tax package in the Senate, has said before that he opposed some of its provisions. **********That package includes an increase of $500 in the personal exemption for children, to $2,800 from $2,300 now, but the increase is not on the list on which he has demanded action by March 20. Not only Democrats but also his opponent in the Republican Presidential primaries, the television commentator Pat Buchanan, have made much of the omission. **********Whatever legislation the Senate may pass, it will start taking shape on Tuesday when Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas presents a proposal to the Finance Commitee, which he heads. New details of that proposal emerged today after another caucus of Senate Democrats on the subject. **********Mr. Bentsen means to propose credits that would not be available to families with incomes of $70,000 or more, and to save money by allowing the credits only for children under the age of 16. **********When he first proposed the program last fall, the credits would have been available to high-income families, too, and paid for children under the age of 19. But that program would have cost $60 billion over five years, and this one will cost about half as much. **********Cost is the main reason for the changes, but politics is involved, too, for leaving out top-income taxpayers helps make the Democrats' election-year argument that while the Republicans favor the rich, their party cares about the people who need help more. **********The term ""middle class"" has become a political catchword here. Polls have shown that more than four-fifths of Americans regard themselves as middle class. The House Democrats' tax cut would provide maximum benefits once a working couple's income reached $26,000. But at one point this month the Democrats boasted that their program would actually mean lower taxes for all but the top 1 percent of the public. A 'Double Hit' **********Mr. Bentsen has defended his bill by arguing that ""middle-income families with children took a double hit in the 1980's."" **********""Their incomes went down, their taxes went up,"" he said. ""The 1980's, in fact, were the most anti-family decade since the Great Depression."" **********In an interview today, he contended that his plan would help what he called typical middle-income families. A family of four with an income of $35,000, he said today, would see its income taxes cut by 25 percent under his plan. **********He acknowledged that he expected little help from Republicans in the Finance Committee when he brings up the proposal. ""If I lose one Democrat, I'm blocked,"" he said. The committee has 10 Democrats and 9 Republicans. **********But he also faces opposition from some Democrats, like Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, because the plan is not intended to provide a ""refundable"" credit, or one that would go in cash to poor families whose taxes were less than the credit. **********Recently Mr. Bentsen has said that is not necessary, because in 1990 Congress passed ""$18 billion worth of earned-income tax credits, and that's for the working poor."" He maintains that his new tax credit is aimed specifically at middle-income taxpayers, who ""did not receive proper attention in the last tax bill."" Would Increase Cost **********Another critical reason for the omission is that making the credit refundable would increase the cost of the five-year program by close to $20 billion. **********This will stimulate some opposition from Senate liberals, like Mr. Bradley, but the savings are important. Without them the program is still expected to cost about $30 billion. **********Last year, Mr. Bentsen wanted to pay for his program of credits out of savings at the Pentagon. He concedes now that he will have to find the money by increasing taxes on high-income people, and he does not want an increase as large as the one in the House bill, which would raise the maximum personal income tax rate from 31 to 35 percent on individuals with taxable income over $85,000 and couples over $145,000. **********Mr. Bentsen's proposal, which will also include reductions in taxes on capital gains and incentives for the real estate industry, is to come before the Finance Committee Tuesday. While he has offered no estimates on how long it will take the committee to vote on its provisions, Mr. Dole foresaw quick action. **********The Kansan predicted that the commitee would finish quickly enough so that the Democratic bill would ""probably pass the Senate sometime late next week or the following week."""

Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, offer further evidence of how gaps in the Administration's export-control system, combined with a policy of offering incentives to Baghdad, allowed President Saddam Hussein to purchase United States equipment for his nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programs. Baker on a Different Tack **********The export policy was so haphazard that seven months after the computer export was approved, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d informed 11 United States embassies of suspicions that Mr. Bull's company, the Space Research Corporation, was involved in Iraq's ballistic-missile and space programs through its Brussels headquarters and its many subsidiaries. **********Mr. Baker ordered the embassies to ask their host governments to ""take appropriate action"" to block such support to the Iraqi missile program. **********Apparently the State Department was unaware that the computers were shipped because in February 1991, in the final days of the Persian Gulf war, the State Department prepared a statement saying it had never approved ""any exports of equipment or technology by Bull or companies associated with Bull to Iraq."" **********Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said today that the statement referred to exports of artillery shells, not to any other equipment or technology.  The Value: $161,000 **********The September 1989 approval by the Commerce Department applied to two computers, made by Silicon Graphics of Mountain View, Calif., and valued at $161,000, to be sent to the State Enterprise for Automotive Industries in Iraq. The Commerce Department also approved the export of crucial software to Space Research, the Bull company; the software, made by Swanson Analysis Systems of Houston, Pa., would allow the computers to analyze designs of satellites, missiles and military vehicles. **********There are no documents showing that the software was sent. **********Mr. Bull, a naturalized American citizen, was found dead in his apartment outside Brussels on March 22, 1990, shot in the back of the neck with a 7.65-millimeter pistol equipped with a silencer. The police said the killer left behind $20,000 in American currency in Mr. Bull's pockets."

Votes to Send Force to Yugoslavia," **********The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously tonight to start dispatching a 14,000-member peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia to monitor the cease-fire there and protect minority Serbs in Croatia until their future is settled. **********The operation in Yugoslavia, which is already one of the biggest the United Nations has ever organized, will be followed by an even bigger and more complex one next week when the Council is expected to send military and civilian contingents to oversee the end of Cambodia's long civil war, disarm its rival factions, return refugees and organize nationwide free elections. **********Initial estimates put the cost of those two missions at more than $3 billion, or more than four times the $700 million United Nations members were asked to pay for peacekeeping costs last year at a time when the organization is already owed nearly $1 billion by its membership in unpaid dues.  Deployment in Stages **********Agreement to send the force to Yugoslavia came after compromises were struck within the 15-member Council in disputes over its peacekeeping powers as well as over the operation's $634 million annual cost, which the United States and other Western members say is excessive. **********As a result only part of the force will be deployed at first, while the United Nations Secretary General asks the parties to the fighting to contribute more toward the cost of the operation. **********Under the United Nations peace plan, the 14,000 peacekeepers will be charged with insuring the security of about 14 Serbian minority enclaves in the breakaway republic of Croatia for at least a year until an overall political agreement is reached on the future of the Yugoslav federation. **********But the United States, with support from other Western members, wanted to insure that the Croatian government of Franjo Tudjman, which has criticized aspects of the peace plan, had no possible legal basis for seeking the force's withdrawal before such an agreement is reached. Fear Among Serbs **********As a result, it proposed deploying the force under the provisions of chapter seven of the United Nations Charter, which allows the Council to issue mandatory orders and enforce them by economic blockades or even military force. **********As other countries recognize Croatia and the Tudjman government grows more self-confident, the Serbian minority fears Zagreb may try to remove the United Nations soldiers, leaving its members at the mercy of the Croatian majority and in danger of being driven over the border into Serbia. **********But the Security Council's third-world members, lead by India, objected to invoking chapter seven, saying that would set a precedent by imposing a peacekeeping force on Croatia without its consent, thus expanding the Council's authority. **********The third-world countries are fighting any move that enlarges the powers of the Security Council, which they increasingly see as an instrument of American foreign policy. **********The final compromise drops all mention of chapter seven from the resolution's text. Instead the United States Representative, as this month's president, sought to add a statement to the resolution saying that Article 25 of the Charter ""will apply to the decisions the Council will be taking in this resolution."" Under Article 25, all United Nations members agree ""to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council."" **********The United States, France, Britain, Russia and China, which as permanent Council members pay more than half the cost of peacekeeping operations, have also agreed to ask Yugoslavia to contribute more toward the costs of the peacekeeping force to reduce the bill they will face. **********In particular, many countries want Yugoslavia to provide local barracks for the soldiers, thus saving the $110 million that the United Nations Secretariat has proposed for buying prefabrictaed housing for the peacekeeping force."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/02/business/market-place-a-squeeze-hurts-a-health-niche.html,Milt Freudenheim,1992-09-02,,810,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; A Squeeze Hurts A Health Niche,Market Place; A Squeeze Hurts A Health Niche," **********PROFITING from pressures to get patients out of expensive hospital beds quickly, companies that provide intravenous nutrition and drugs in the home have been on a roll. Sales of these so-called home-infusion companies tripled in three years to $3.2 billion in 1991 and may reach $4 billion this year, analysts said. **********But when health-care stocks began slipping early this year, some high-flying home-infusion stocks were hit even harder. Many investors who thought the economy would pick up this year switched from health care to cyclical stocks like autos and chemicals. **********Companies like Baxter International's Caremark division, Critical Care America and T   Medical Inc. can provide hundreds of intravenous therapies, notably to treat cancer and AIDS patients. About 100 new home therapies are approved each year. The pace should quicken as more products of biotechnology move out of the laboratories. **********Baxter, a diversified hospital supply company, plans to spin off Caremark later this year as a separate entity that will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Caremark, with about $775 million in 1991 home-infusion and related sales, dominates a market served by 10 medium-sized companies and dozens of small mom-and-doc partnerships. Baxter, which has been selling at 18 times 1991 earnings, hopes to push Caremark into the home-infusion league, where Critical Care America shares soared to 30 times earnings. **********Critical Care, which has about 8 percent of the infusion market, plunged to $33.875 from a high of $63.75 in January. It closed yesterday at $35.625, off 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, based in Westboro, Mass., took extra lumps when Massachusetts Blue Cross and Blue Shield chose lower-bidding competitors (including Caremark) to serve patients with traditional insurance. Critical Care shares dipped again on the news that it planned to merge with Medical Care International, a chain of surgery centers, although many analysts praised the deal. **********The home-infusion companies have already had to make price concessions to stay on the preferred list of large health maintenance organizations and other managed-care networks, just as hospitals and doctors do. But Critical Care and three other infusion companies spurned by Massachusetts Blue Cross are suing to block the practice for traditional insurance. Massachusetts tightly regulates such matters, and the outcome of the lawsuit is uncertain. The companies got the Legislature to take their side, but Gov. William F. Weld vetoed the bill in July. **********T  Medical, based in Alpharetta, Ga., and largely owned by physicians, is one of the larger infusion companies, with about 5 percent of the market. T  shares dropped sharply to $17.75 from a 12-month high of $67.75 after state and Federal authorities announced they were cracking down on doctors who refer patients to their own companies. T   shares declined 37.5 cents yesterday, to $25, on the Big Board. **********Todd Richter, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said the growing squeeze on home-infusion prices had not yet affected profits, but ""people fear that this trend will hurt the earnings growth that has been expected."" For the longer term, he likes Healthinfusion, based in Miami, which closed at $11.75 yesterday, up 62.5 cents, about 19 times earnings, in over-the-counter trading. **********Karen Reilly at Fred Alger Management, which is holding Critical Care shares but sold some in the first quarter, said pricing pressures would eventually hurt the company's profits. But she likes the stock because, she said, ""They seem to stay on the leading edge with new products and technologies."" **********Kenneth S. Abramowitz at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said cost containment was an ""evolutionary negative"" for most health-care companies. ""What matters"" he added, ""is whether it has enough exciting new products to offset that negative. Critical Care and Baxter do."" **********Randall S. Huyser at Furman Selz noted that managed health care already accounts for 20 percent of Critical Care's sales, and he estimated that this would grow by several percentage points a year. Looking at the bright side, he said that managed-care payers provide steady business, reducing marketing and billing costs. **********Among infusion companies, Mr. Huyser likes Critical Care as well as several companies that trade over the counter: Total Pharmaceutical Services, a smaller, Los Angeles-based company, which has been growing through acquisitions ($19 yesterday, up 50 cents); Curaflex Health Services in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., which went public in March at $13 ($10.25 yesterday, up 25 cents), and the Homedco Group, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., which also supplies oxygen for mainly elderly home-care patients ($25.25, unchanged). **********Dorothy E. Ryan at Robertson Stephens also likes Homedco and two infusion companies that provide a package of related services: Tokos Medical Corporation, based in Santa Ana, Calif., which specializes in high-risk pregnancies ($23.125, up 87.5 cents), and U.S. Homecare, based in Hartsdale, N.Y., which offers services for children and AIDS and cancer patients ($10, up 50 cents)."

The gun was a wireless computer and scanner that helps Mr. Carach, a Kmart merchandise manager, perform routine stock-keeping tasks while he roams the store, giving him more time to talk with customers. **********The display screen on the gun told Mr. Carach that a new supply of Centrum multi-vitamins was on order to arrive two days later. And because he was on the sales floor, rather than in the back room peering into a computer screen, he was available when a customer told him the store should put a full-length mirror in the handbag department. **********Wireless technology, which uses radio frequencies to transmit information between remote computers, is the newest tool retailers are using to maintain lean inventories, full shelves and happy customers.  Although computerized scanners for inventory tracking have been around since the 1970's, older systems were cumbersome and required the user at some point to repair to a back room or office to transmit data to a central computer. With the new wireless technology, which takes advantage of the greater precision and lower power requirements of today's radio and satellite communications, employees can check stock levels and prices and place orders without leaving the sales floor. Won Technology Award **********Kmart's system, called the Kmart Information Network II, recently won an award for its use of advanced technology at the annual Smithsonian Awards sponsored by Computerworld, a trade publication. **********""It has taken our inventory turnover from three to four times annually to seven or eight now,"" said Kevin Connor, manager of the Southbury store. ""The goods get sold instead of having them sitting around in the stockroom."" **********Wireless technology is also developing into a tool to enhance customer service. Sales associates in two Mervyn's stores in California are using handheld wireless sales terminals, which resemble a conventional clipboard. The device functions as a register for charge-card transactions, letting a clerk sell goods, produce receipts and transmit information to the back office without ever leaving the customer's side. **********Mervyn's, which uses lots of in-store promotions to build sales, also has full-blown wireless cash registers, or point-of-sale terminals, on stands that can be wheeled anywhere in a building. (True, they must be plugged into electrical outlets for power, but there are no computer cables in sight.) If the children's clothing department is having a sale and shoppers are queuing up to make purchases, the store can deploy one of the wireless units to the department to shorten the lines. **********""We started the pilot in the first quarter of this year, and we have gotten very specific comments from our customers that they appreciate not having to stand on line to buy what they want,"" said Vivian Stephenson, vice president for management information services at Mervyn's, a division of the Dayton Hudson Corporation. ""It substantially improves our ability to handle high volumes of shoppers anytime, anywhere."" **********Ms. Stephenson foresees a day when all point-of-sale terminals will be mobile, completely changing the architecture of stores, where the space under floors and above ceilings is now laced with miles of maddeningly elaborate wiring. **********Saul Berenthal, chief operating officer of Post Software International Inc., the Wake Forest, N.C., software company that designed the applications for Mervyn's wireless computers, envisions salespeople using mobile computers in much the way that many of the best salespeople use client registers: to keep detailed records of birthdays, favorite colors, sizes and other details that personalize customer service. **********""The last thing you want to have to do is run back and forth to the cash register to get information out of a notebook,"" he said. ""Wireless raises the competence of even mediocre salespeople by giving them information they can use at the precise time and place they need it."" Saving Time and Money **********Such immediacy saves time, and eventually money, although the retailers must initially spend more for the equipment than for conventional registers and inventory-tracking devices. They say the new systems enable them to serve customers better by having merchandise in stock and making purchases easier. **********Retailers have used wireless technology for several years in warehouses and to verify prices in stores. But the old technology was cumbersome and could not communicate with the central computers for up-to-the-minute information in real time. **********Somewhat more sophisticated than these early devices is the equipment that Federal Express has been using since the mid-1980's to track packages and letters through its overnight delivery system. When a Federal Express agent picks up deliveries, he scans the bar code on each package with a handheld information storage unit called a Supertracker, which is supplied by Handheld Products of Charlotte, N.C. **********Units like the Supertracker are called batch terminals, which must be hooked up to some sort of terminal to communicate with the main computer system. But in the systems currently used by Kmart and Mervyn's, the information is transmitted directly between the handheld units and the main computers.  Kmart is well versed in wireless batch terminals, having used them as early as 1976. A merchandise manager took a unit and used it to scan bar codes, verify prices and record orders. The unit was then hooked up to a computer for transmitting information that had been collected. **********""The problem is you don't know what's transpired between the time you collected the information and the time it gets put into the computer,"" said David M. Carlson, senior vice president for corporate information systems at Kmart. **********The next step in the evolution of wireless technology was to establish direct communication among the handheld unit, the back-office computer and the mainframe at headquarters. By 1983, Kmart began working with a model that was about the size and weight of a brick and was attached by a short telephone cord to a scanner that read bar codes. But the batteries ran out after only one or two hours and the two-line display screen restricted the amount of information that could be retrieved. **********The Kmart brick used radio waves to capture and send information about merchandise in real time. But each store had to be licensed by the Federal Communications Commission because it shared radio frequencies with things like limousine services, airports and mobile communications systems. **********But the handheld terminals going into Kmart stores today, Symbol Technologies Inc.'s LRT3800's, scan the spectrum of the radio range to find the best signal over which to transmit data. Because it is not linked to a single frequency and is designed not to interfere with other users, it does not require a license. One Lightweight Unit **********Gone is the separate laser scanner dangling from a cord. The laser is beamed out of the end of a lightweight unit that also incorporates a keyboard, an eight-line display, a personal computer processor, radio and antenna and a battery with a much longer life than its predecessor's. **********The new terminals enable a sales associate in San Diego to stand in front of, say, a coffee maker on a shelf and tap into Kmart's central computers in Troy, Mich., via satellite to determine how many coffee makers have been sold, when the next delivery is expected and whether a new order should be placed. **********All of that information -- available in seconds -- is vital to insuring that the store always has a coffeepot when someone wants to buy one."

In each issue, The American Lawyer will examine an example of what it calls ""trial lawyering."" Subscribers who pay an extra $19.50 a month will get an accompanying two-hour video with actual courtroom footage of the trial itself. 'Very Logical Tie-In' **********""This is frankly one of the greatest examples of synergy, that exclusive concept oft preached but rarely implemented,"" said Larry Gerbrandt, senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, which follows the cable industry. ""It's a very logical tie-in -- an exciting enhancement to print, which is a medium that has rarely seen much in the way of this kind of originality."" **********Mr. Brill puts it more simply: ""This is my pet project; I am in love with this thing."" **********He added, ""It comes out of the fact that I write a lot of articles myself about trials, and I always find myself saying, 'If I could only show that to them.' "" **********The March issue of The American Lawyer covers a double-murder trial in Dubuque, Iowa, in which the defendant -- ""a man who probably shotgunned his own parents to death,"" the article says -- was freed because of the defense work and cross-examination by a Des Moines public defender who was blinded by a shotgun blast when he was a teen-ager. Case Study for Lawyers **********The accompanying video provides highlights of the trial with commentary by experts. It is meant to be a case study for trial lawyers, but makes quite dramatic viewing for anyone else. **********""This is not the video version of The American Lawyer,"" said Mr. Brill, who is president and editor in chief of the magazine. ""It's a video supplement to an article that is in The American Lawyer. That is a crucial difference."" **********Because of the extensive coverage by Court TV, there is no dearth of material. In the April issue of the magazine, prominent lawyers will give their analyses of the examination and cross-examination of William Kennedy Smith, with excerpts of the trial on video. The May issue will center on a swimming pool accident. **********Timing is everything, and Mr. Brill's timing has been superb. In the last six months, the Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas and Anita F. Hill and the William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson rape trials have mesmerized much of the nation.  Church Discussion Group **********Court TV covers four trials a week, with commentary from legal journalists and scholars. Mr. Brill described the public's interest as phenomenal. **********""I got a letter last week from a woman in Georgia whose church has started a discussion group based on Court TV,"" he said. **********While declining to give details, Mr. Brill said the channel was still losing money and expected to do so until it was available in at least 20 million households. Most cable channels do not attract much advertising until they reach 15 million to 20 million subscribers. **********Court TV was available in 5.7 million homes at the end of 1991. Mr. Brill said the channel was expected to reach about 30 million homes in two years. **********Mr. Brill said that a half to two-thirds of Court TV's revenues came from advertising, with the rest paid by fees from cable operators. **********Court TV, formally known as the Courtroom Television Network, is a joint venture of American Lawyer Media, Time Warner, NBC, Cablevision Systems and Liberty Media. **********The start-up costs for Video Trial Report are comparatively low because it is using the programming from Court TV. A $30,000 to $50,000 investment will go into producing each tape and mailing it out. Letters are being sent to subscribers, law professors and trial lawyers, explaining what it is. Goal of the Videos **********Mr. Brill said he expected to get orders for a few thousand videos and to make a profit of ""a couple of hundred-thousand dollars."" **********""Our goal is not to make money off the tapes but to make a better editorial product,"" he said. **********Creating additional revenue streams from cable networks is evidently the wave of the future.

Volatility in the stock market is always good for the options business, and the surge in stock prices in recent weeks has been steep enough to make options traders smile broadly. **********The daily volume of options contracts traded on the nation's five options exchanges has begun to pierce the one million level regularly, and the daily average so far this month, 980,000, is the highest monthly rate in a year. It is also one of the highest monthly levels since the options market peaked -- and crashed -- in 1987. **********In contrast to last year's war-inspired spurt, traders say, the current options rush is based on speculation that the stock market is just beginning an extended move upward, and it is attracting investors who want to multiply their profits from rising stocks. Outside the exchanges, in over-the-counter trading that is hard to measure accurately, options business is also up sharply. Profitable More Quickly **********""The market has now stopped its daily leapfrogging, but we're still seeing a lot of orders coming in,"" said Michael T. Bickford, manager of the options department at Kidder, Peabody. **********""Very active, very active,""Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen & Company, said in the laconic voice of a busy Wall Street analyst. **********Trading volume is only one measure of activity, but exchange officials say the dollar value of options bought and sold and the number of contracts outstanding are up, too. The reason, for anyone with a calculator, is obvious: rising stock prices make options profitable more quickly while at the same time providing the opportunity to create new contracts. **********In a bull market, more options can turn to gold, and the odds are greater that an investor can pick ones that do. As any options trader knows, an investor need pay only a small amount of cash for a stock option, which is the right -- but not an obligation -- to buy or sell a stock by a particular time at a particular price, also known as the strike price. A call option rises in value if the underlying stock goes up; a put option gains if the stock declines. **********Mr. Roth cited a simple example: On Dec. 27, when U.S. Surgical was selling for $109.50 a share, a call option set to expire in late January cost only $2. By Jan. 9, when the stock had soared to $131.00, up 20 percent, the option was selling for $17, up 750 percent. A $2,000 investment on Dec. 27, if sold on Jan. 9, would have returned $17,000. The option, with a $115 strike price, dropped to $12.50 by Friday's close, as the stock drifted to $127. **********""This is what we call intelligent speculation,"" Mr. Roth said. **********Of course, if U.S. Surgical shares had failed to rise, the option would have fallen in value and have been worthless by the expiration date. **********But for the uninitiated, the real danger in this market lies with investors who dare to ""write"" an option, guaranteeing to buy or sell an underlying stock at a preset price, especially in cases in which they do not already own the stock. For them, a sharp, unexpected swing in the market can be disastrous. **********Take, for example, an investor who chose to write $2,000 worth of call options on U.S. Surgical on Dec. 27 -- expecting the stock to fall -- for an easy initial profit of $2,000. The investor would have to come up with 1,000 shares of the stock. If the investor did not previously own the shares, by Jan. 9 the cost would have been $131,000; after the investor sold the shares for $115,000, the net loss would be $14,000. **********Many investors use options in complex arrangements, typically to hedge against sudden swings in the market. But the current surge has been characterized by the buying of options on specific stocks, reversing, at least temporarily, a trend of recent years toward buying options on stock indexes, like the Standard & Poor's index of 100 stocks. **********""A lot more people are buying individual stock options,"" Mr. Bickford said. ""With the market going up, it's the easy, no-brainer thing to do."" **********Where stock options and index options have traded at about equal volume over the last year, options on individual stocks have outpaced index options by about 6 to 4 since the last week in December, according to figures compiled by the Options Clearing Corporation in Chicago. **********Many of those options are straightforward call orders on a specific stock, said Joseph Stefanelli, senior vice-president of the American Stock Exchange. **********""There are always more bullish investors than bearish,"" he declared.  ""It's not American to be bearish."" **********The options boom comes at a time of general expansion in the industry. The number of options issues traded on American exchanges has grown to 914 from 789 a year ago. Mr. Roth said most of the new issues had joined because the Securities and Exchange Commission eased the listing standards for options, effective Oct. 21. **********For an option on a stock to be listed on an exchange, the required minimum number of shareholders in the stock is now 2,000, instead of 6,000, and the minimum closing market price in the stock over the last three months is $7.50, instead of $10. **********At the same time, the S.E.C. has phased out rules over the last year that had limited particular stock options to a listing on a single exchange. Multiple listings, exchange officials said, spurred competition between the trading posts, making them more efficient. **********Mr. Bickford noted that trading volume in 1991 was well below the 1987 levels, in part because the market traded at a relatively narrow range for most of the year. In October 1987, when the stock market crashed, some investors who had been writing put options -- betting that prices would not fall -- were wiped out. Many others, who had been purchasing call options, lost all they had invested. The popularity of the options market declined markedly. **********The five exchanges that handle options are the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American, Pacific, Philadelphia and New York Stock Exchanges. But a large segment of the options business is not traded in the standardized setting of the exchanges, but over-the-counter, typically in larger quantities and dollar values. **********The new year is normally a busy time for traders who shape such large, customized options deals, because money managers are eager to lock in yearly gains and reposition their portfolios for the new year. Add to that a soaring market, and you get a recipe for a lot of business. **********""It's been crazy active,"" said Lisa Polsky, managing director of global markets at Bankers Trust. ""It was the busiest holiday period we've had in a long time."" **********Despite the spurt in activity, the options business is likely to remain hampered by what traders call misperceptions and lack of understanding. **********""Options are still largely misunderstood by just about everyone,"" Mr. Bickford said. ""Even our sales forces don't understand them as well as they ought to."""

But, he said, the intention of the plan is to enable Orion to continue as an operating entity that may produce films in the future. Money for Creditors **********Orion said 85 percent of its cash flow would go to its senior secured creditors. That group includes banks and Columbia Pictures, which together are owned $300 million. The remaining 15 percent would go to the unsecured creditors, which are owed an estimated $50 million to $100 million. That group includes trade creditors, unions, actors and directors. **********Orion's bondholders would get 49 percent of the equity in Orion, as well as nine-year zero-coupon subordinated debentures that increase in value at an annual rate of 10 percent. At the end of the nine-year term, the debentures would have a face value of $100 million, making them worth an estimated $30 million in present value. **********Metromedia would contribute an additional $15 million in cash. It would also take the $29 million note due to it from the movie ""Mermaids"" and assign the right to receive that sum to Orion. In exchange, Metromedia would get 50.1 percent of the new company. The remaining nine-tenths of a percent would be distributed to current shareholders. **********The plan must be filed by June 21 and confirmed no later than Sept. 30. **********If the plan is approved in Federal Bankruptcy Court by Judge Burton R. Lifland, Orion has several proposals for the distribution of its films. It may arrange to distribute its films individually, agree to distribute its films through one studio or include its film library in a later deal. **********At the moment, a executive close to Orion said, there are indications that several companies with the right to offer alternative reorganization plans were not yet planning to do so. **********The parties in the Orion bankruptcy worked through the night Wednesday to arrive at the reorganization plan, which comes after months of discussions among creditors and potential buyers. At one time, the New Line Cinema Corporation had made a proposal to take over the company, but those talks collapsed. **********In this plan, ""the guiding principle is that if Orion is going to get into new filming, no creditor money would be used,"" said Wilbur Ross, a partner at Rothschild Inc. who represents Orion's unsecured creditors."

Investors and analysts said Marvel appeared to be getting the better of the deal. **********""Marvel's buying it on the cheap,"" said Ronald Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney. ""The price is a little low for shareholders."" **********""We think it's worth more,"" said Walter Morris, head of research for the Strong Funds, a large mutual fund company in Milwaukee that is one of the largest holders of Fleer stock. **********Investors and analysts said Fleer was probably worth $30 to $35 a share. ""I think it's possible that somebody could come in with a higher bid,"" said Alexander Paris Jr., an analyst with Barrington Research Associates in Chicago. **********He added that even though the price was low, it would be hard to find a better match than Marvel and Fleer, both of which rely on boys aged 6 to 16 for the majority of their sales. Agrees to 'Breakup' Fee **********""The businesses fit together hand-in-glove,"" said Mr. Morris of the Strong Funds. ""We'll wind up supporting the deal."" **********Fleer has agreed to pay Marvel a $6.5 million ""breakup"" fee if the deal does not go through. Fleer executives did not return telephone calls. **********In a statement about the deal, Fleer's chairman and chief executive, Paul Mullan, said, ""It will create exciting new product and cross-promotional marketing opportunities, enhancing our growth prospects in both trading cards and comic books."" **********After the deal was announced, Fleer's shares rose $2.50 each, to $28, in over-the-counter trading. Marvel's shares closed at $33.375, up $1.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Fleer is hooking up with Marvel in an effort to do battle better against the industry leader, the Topps Company of Brooklyn. Analysts said the deal signaled that the days of explosive growth in the baseball card business had ended. The market has become thick with competitors and returns of unbought cards have been high. **********Marvel has been gradually expanding its presence in the trading card business since 1990, when it introduced its Marvel Universe trading cards. Marvel focuses on cards with entertainment figures; Fleer has specialized in sports. **********""The acquisition of Fleer enables us to rapidly increase our presence in the $1.2 billion market for sports and entertainment cards,"" said William Bevens Jr., chief executive of Marvel. ""The overlapping consumer demographics and distribution systems of the two companies uniquely position us to become a clear industry leader within the card marketplace."" Boards Have Approved **********The definitive purchase agreement, which will be carried out through a tender offer, has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. A majority of Fleer's shareholders must tender their shares before the deal can be completed. **********Terry Stewart, president and chief operating officer of Marvel, said trading cards could help sell comic books. He said that last year, Marvel's premier issue of a new series, ""The X Force,"" contained a card featuring a superhero. ""If you wanted all four, you had to buy four copies,"" he said. The issue sold 3.7 million copies, making it one of Marvel's best-selling comic books ever. **********Marvel's deal to buy Fleer follows a March announcement by Topps that it planned to enter the comic book business. ""This is not a response to that,"" Mr. Stewart said. **********The Topps switchboard was closed yesterday afternoon.  Both companies also announced second-quarter earnings yesterday. **********Marvel said its profits for the quarter increased nearly threefold, to $7.2 million, or 30 cents a share, from $2.5 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 63 percent, to $37.5 million, from $23 million for the 1991 period. **********Fleer's profits increased nearly 4 percent, to $8 million, or 85 cents a share, from $7.7 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 20 percent, to $48.4 million, compared with $40.1 million a year earlier."

He took him from his father and held him in his arms. Later, as Mr. Yeltsin's motorcade left the air base, Brendan's father, Troy, a 28-year-old financial analyst from Wichita, said, ""I'm very proud. We'll go get some ice cream and call mom.""  Thumbs-Up, a Lot **********Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Yeltsin had said something to him as he handed his son back, ""but they never interpreted it."" **********""All I could understand,"" Mr. Lindsey said, ""was the thumbs-up sign."" **********Later, Mr. Yeltsin toured Dold Meatpacking Plant, where he walked up to Marilyn Terto, 34, who was working on the hambone line. **********How much do you make? Mr. Yeltsin asked her, to which she answered, $9.43 an hour. **********""All right, all right,"" he said, flashing thumbs-up as slabs of pork whirled past on hooks. **********While her husband toured the meat-packing plant, Naina Yeltsin attended a reception in her honor, with Elizabeth Dole as host, at a local hotel. From there she took a wagon ride at the Cowtown Museum, a recreation of a Kansas prairie town 100 years ago. **********Another site Mr. Yeltsin visited was the farm of Greg and Sandra Rau, who spent the week sprucing up their 2,000-acre spread. Their farm, a few miles from the Air Force base, was selected to give Mr. Yeltsin a taste of Kansas farm life. **********But the visit came at a busy time for the Raus: Because of heavy rains lately, the farmers are behind in harvesting the spring wheat. **********""It has been exhausting,"" Mr. Rau said. ""But we're very proud."" **********The Raus turned their farm into a showcase, parking a fleet of shiny combines and tractors in a field for Mr. Yeltsin to inspect. **********Mr. Yeltsin, seeming to know his way around farm machinery, climbed into the cab of a green combine, waved people out of the way and jerked it forward. Clara Belden, a farmer and a high school English teacher, watched Mr. Yeltsin, helped by Mr. Rau, drive the combine around the field. **********""I thought that was the magic moment,"" Mrs. Belden said. ""As farmers we know being in that combine is a place we feel most deeply what the harvest is all about."""" **********Some of it may wind up in Russian bakeries. In 1991 the United States exported 3.9 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union, according to the Agriculture Department, this year just over 4 million tons have already gone to Russia and the other former Soviet republics. **********Before he left for the airport for a trip to Canada, Mr. Yeltsin was asked what he would most like to take back with him from Kansas. **********""Everything,"" he said."

The fact that Centel officers could not announce results indicated an especially close vote on the proposed merger, which needs a simple majority for approval. **********But John P. Frazee Jr., Centel's chairman and chief executive, said afterward that he was confident the final tally would clear the way for the $3 billion deal. The count is expected to be completed by Friday. Sprint Approved Deal **********At a similar special meeting in Kansas City, Mo., Sprint shareholders by a wide margin approved the deal, which provides Centel shareholders with 1.37 shares of Sprint stock for each share of Centel they own. **********Mr. Frazee predicted approval based on the number of proxies management had received after its six-month struggle to quiet shareholder complaints, though he declined to provide any figures. Critics said Centel was being sold too cheaply and that Sprint, the third-largest long distance carrier after A.T.& T. and MCI, was not a desirable partner. **********At today's meeting, Robert Einslein Jr. of Moran Asset Management, a Centel shareholder that has led the opposition to the deal, said the current value of the deal was roughly $31.25 a share but that his firm believed the company was worth $50 to $60 a share if properly valued. **********Less than a year ago, Mr. Frazee said he believed Centel was worth $65 a share. The company is one of the nation's largest cellular phone concerns, with control of franchises in 42 markets in 14 states and minority interests in 32 metropolitan areas. It also operates local phone companies in six states. Total revenues last year were $1.18 billion. Stock Plunged in May **********Mr. Frazee pushed for the merger after concluding that Centel was too small and too specialized to survive industry consolidation. The company put itself up for sale at the turn of the year and in May accepted the Sprint deal. The announcement of that decision sent Centel's stock plunging from $42.50 to $32. **********Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the investment bankers retained to study the company's options, put the company's value at $29 a share. **********Mr. Einslein argued that recent transactions valued local phone companies business at roughly 10.5 times cash flow, compared with the 5.5 times cash flow placed on Centel's businesses by the Sprint bid. The cellular business was worth at least 38 percent more than Sprint was paying, according to his calculations."

The factors said they had not decided whether to accept the proposal, which expires April 15. **********Shoppers tend to increase their spending before the Easter and Passover holidays, and stores need extra merchandise to take advantage of that surge. But many manufacturers have stopped shipping merchandise to Alexander's, which stopped paying its suppliers in March but has not filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. **********The company has been unsuccessful in trying to increase its revolving credit lines and renegotiate its bank agreements. Roanne Kulakoff, a spokeswoman for Alexander's, said the company was still negotiating and declined to comment about its proposal to the factors. **********The new proposal, which was described yesterday in Women's Wear Daily, the trade newspaper, requires the acceptance of trade creditors holding at least 80 percent of the claims against Alexander's. The factors hold only a fraction of Alexander's debt, but their opinions hold great sway in the manufacturing community. **********Industry analysts said suppliers were likely to continue to withhold shipments regardless of what the factors do. Several of Alexander's suppliers are large national companies, like Hanes, Fruit of the Loom and Philips-Van Heusen, which are less dependent on single retailers and therefore less lenient. **********""There's no good will for Alexander's, or any retailer for that matter, in the manufacturing community,"" said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report, which follows the garment industry. ""If they weren't willing to ship to Macy's in its final days, they certainly aren't going to fall out to support Alexander's."" **********Alexander's stock dropped $1.75 yesterday, closing at $9.875 on the New York Stock Exchange."

The policy pertains to all 1993 cars, beginning with the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer, which are already rolling out of the factory. The move prompted rental car companies like the Hertz Corporation to raise its rental rates. Hertz, which is 49 percent owned by Ford, said it would raise daily rental rates $4 to $5 a vehicle, or about 12 percent, in 17 locations Unlike last year, when the Big Three United States car makers used fleet sales to keep factories running, Detroit's auto makers have been trying this year to reduce the number of low-profit fleet sales and increase the retail side of its business. **********Ford will continue to offer to buy back all of the cars that it sells to rental companies this year and will allow rental agencies to return cars sooner than six months, provided they pay a cash penalty. **********If the rental firm returns the car after more than four months of service but less than five months, it must pay Ford $100 a car. If the car is kept more than five months but less than six months, the rental agent owes Ford $50 a car."

They condemned that as the ""unethical appropriation"" of previous transcriptions and translations, and said the authors' claims of having done independent and original work were ""laughable and manifestly dishonest."" **********The two authors of the book deny the accusations, saying they worked with photographs of the original texts and did not depend on any one else's work. One of them, Dr. Robert H. Eisenman of California State University at Long Beach, accused the critics of ""scholarly peevishness and jealousy."" **********Dr. Eisenman suggested that this was one more attempt by establishment scholars to control the analysis and publication of the scrolls, ancient documents discovered in caves near the Dead Sea, beginning in 1947, and believed to contain important insights into early Judaism and the origins of Christianity. Until a year ago, a team of a few editors exercised tight control over access to the hundreds of texts and were accused of refusing to let anyone other than their own students and favored colleagues work with the material. Accusations Circulated **********The book in question is ""The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered: The First Complete Translation and Interpretation of 50 Key Documents Withheld for Over 35 Years,"" published last month by Element Books. Dr. Eisenman's co-author is Dr. Michael Wise, an assistant professor of Near Eastern languages at the University of Chicago. **********In a talk last month at a meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in San Francisco, Dr. Lawrence H. Schiffman, a professor of Hebrew and Judaic studies at New York University, said: ""This volume represents the fulfillment of the worst predictions of those who opposed the opening of the scrolls to the general scholarly community. It does not, as it claims, publish 50 unpublished texts. One half of those texts published here were fully published before the volume came out."" **********Last week, Dr. Schiffman and 18 other scholars signed and distributed a statement elaborating those assertions. Among the signers are Dr. Emanuel Tov, editor in chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project in Israel; Dr. Eugene Ulrich and Dr. James VanderKam , both of the University of Notre Dame; Dr. Frank Moore Cross of Harvard University, and Dr. Elisha Qimron of the University of the Negev in Beersheba, Israel, who is currently a visiting scholar at the Annenberg Research Institute in Philadelphia. **********Although several of the signers had been members of the previous editorial team that exerted such firm control, others, including Dr. Schiffman, had supported opening the scrolls to other researchers. They emphasized that their complaints did not ""stem from a desire to maintain a monopoly or to forestall the publication of texts by others."" 'Utterly Unacceptable' Practice **********The accusations outlined in the statement are certain to be debated here tomorrow at the opening session of a three-day conference on scroll research, organized by the New York Academy of Sciences and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. A hastily arranged symposium on publication ethics has been added to the program for tomorrow afternoon. **********In their statement, the critics of the book asserted that in ""several easily identifiable cases,"" the authors depended on ""handouts and work in progress"" reported at previous conferences and failed to give proper credit. That practice, they said, is ""utterly unacceptable"" because ""all scholars have a right to see their work appear in print for the first time under their own names."" **********In all, the critics said, ""only about one-fourth of the material is entirely new."" **********Singled out for criticism was the book's handling of the text of what has become known as the MMT document, considered one of the most important manuscripts from the Dead Sea caves. It is a fragmentary work representing legal views of a separatist Jewish group. Many scholars think the document holds clues to the identity of the Jewish sect responsible for the scrolls. 'Straight and Honest' Research **********The critics noted the striking similarities in the reconstruction of the MMT text by the authors with the work of Dr. Qimron and John Strugnell, a Harvard scholar and former editor in chief of the project. Those two scholars have been working on those particular documents for a dozen years. Although the results have yet to be published officially, bootlegged photographs of the work have been passed among researchers for years. **********""It must be a miracle that their edition made all the same joins and transitions between fragmentary manuscripts that Strugnell and Qimron had made,"" the critics said in their statement, referring to Dr. Eisenman and Dr. Wise. **********Dr. Wise, who headed the research team responsible for most of the translations, said the text was reconstructed from photographs of the manuscript that Dr. Eisenman had obtained earlier, and not from any documents prepared by Dr. Qimron. He noted, moreover, that his research yielded an entirely new section of more than 160 lines that have not been included in any other translations. That would more than double the length of the MMT text. **********Dr. Norman Golb, professor of Near Eastern languages and civilization at the University of Chicago, said the accusations against the book's authors ""are fundamentally untrue."" He said he was especially familiar with Dr. Wise's research techniques, saying, ""He's an absolutely straight and honest person."" Lawsuit and Procrastination **********This is not the first controversy set off by the MMT text. In January, Dr. Qimron brought a lawsuit against the Biblical Archeology Society because its facsimile edition of scrolls photographs included in an appendix the Hebrew text of MMT as prepared by Dr. Qimron. The defendants in the case, scheduled for trial Feb. 1 in Jerusalem, include Hershel Shanks, editor of Biblical Archeology Review, and Dr. James M. Robinson of Claremont Graduate School and Dr. Eisenman, who were editors of the volume. **********""That lawsuit is the crux of all this fuss,"" Dr. Eisenman said. **********Several scholars said much of the controversy is also the consequence of earlier procrastination in making available the texts to the wider community of biblical scholars. Publication delays and excessive secrecy by the controlling editors embittered other scholars and even raised speculation, repeatedly denied, that the editors were suppressing documents that would upset Jews or Christians, or both. **********At a meeting in Kansas City a year ago, the Society of Biblical Literature recommended that ""those who own or control ancient written materials should allow all scholars to have access to them."" Microfilm Archives **********It was also recommended that they should not ""hinder other scholars from publishing their own studies, translations, or editions of the written materials."" **********Dr. Wise said that he and Dr. Eisenman considered that a professional endorsement of the kind of book they have produced. The society had enunciated those guidelines specifically to deal with the expected surge of scrolls publications following the opening of the scrolls a year ago to all scholars. **********The breakthrough came when the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., announced that it had microfilm archives of all the scrolls, over which the international team of editors had no control, and that it was opening the material to any qualified scholar."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-campbell-shapes-up-all-around.html,Stuart Elliott,1992-01-29,,716,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Campbell Shapes Up All Around,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Campbell Shapes Up All Around," **********THE Campbell Soup Company is ambitiously expanding its lines of pantry- and freezer-food products through one of the most comprehensive advertising programs being undertaken by a large American grocery marketer. The company, which spends more than $250 million annually on marketing, is lifting the budget by 8 percent, up from a 5 percent increase announced last year. **********The expansion involves everything from Campbell's traditional red-and-white cans of condensed soup, which are being dressed up in new labels featuring photographs of the ingredients inside, to new lines of lower-fat, lower-calorie foods under brand names like Mrs. Paul's Healthy Treasures and Healthy Request. **********All that product news is being conveyed to consumers in a barrage of television commercials, print advertisements and even miniature billboards attached to supermarket shopping carts. **********""We have made a conscious decision to spend more,"" Herbert M. Baum, the new president of the Campbell North and South America division, said in a recent telephone interview, to prevent ""our brand franchises from starting to slip away from us."" **********He added: ""We know we're good at, and can make lots of money at, dry groceries and frozen foods. Where we think we're getting results, we'll get much more aggressive. If we don't think we're getting all out of our advertising that we should be, we'll put the money somewhere else."" **********His remarks alluded to previous expansion efforts, like the failed Fresh Chef line of refrigerated salads, that took Campbell far afield of its core businesses and were discontinued. **********Campbell's decision to bolster marketing spending is significant beyond the fate of the company's new condensed broccoli cheese soup. Along with stepped-up spending by other packaged-goods giants, like the Procter & Gamble Company and Unilever P.L.C. of Britain, it could mean a rebirth for brand-name products, which have been hard-hit during the recession as consumers cut back or switch to store brands. **********For marketers like those, ""there is a need for growth,"" said Edward F. Ogiba, the president of Group EFO Ltd., a marketing consulting company in Weston, Conn. **********In a survey conducted last year by Group EFO, he added, 61 percent of the companies responding said 30 percent or more of their sales over the next five years must come from new products, compared with 48 percent in 1990. **********""Products like our condensed soups would do very well in an economy like this,"" Mr. Baum said. **********As a result, ad dollars are being spent for the first time in many years on an underpromoted line of condensed soups in family-sized 26-ounce cans. **********""When you reconstitute two of those, they will fill your bathtub,"" Mr. Baum said. Since August, sales of those larger cans are 64 percent higher than a year ago, he added. **********Part of Campbell's increased spending is being financed by money that had been spent on promotions aimed at consumers, like cents-off coupons, and at grocery retailers, like bonuses to entice them to stock Campbell products. **********Another aspect of Campbell's activities is changes in the company's roster of advertising agencies. Earlier this month, an estimated $25 million in frozen-food brands were moved to BBDO Worldwide from Ogilvy & Mather, which retains only Campbell's Pepperidge Farm line of baked goods. BBDO added brands like LeMenu frozen foods to a list that included products like Campbell's Chunky Soup and Mrs. Paul's frozen fish line. **********Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., employs six other agencies, including Backer Spielvogel Bates, W. B. Doner & Company, FCB/Leber Katz Partners and Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss. **********Campbell's panoply of marketing moves reflects the involvement of David W. Johnson, who became president and chief executive in 1990, determined to rejuvenate a marketer perceived to have fallen behind its grocery rivals. **********""This is a company that has gone through a major cleaning-up and restructuring,"" said Nomi Ghez, a food-industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, referring to steps Mr. Johnson took in the last two years. ""Now is the time to focus on rebuilding its core businesses. **********""That is especially true for a company that has such strong brands as Campbell,"" she added. ""You have to make sure they grow and expand."""

The bond's price rose 24/32 , to 10012/32 . In the last two trading days, the bond's yield has fallen 14 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. **********Yields of notes and bills also fell sharply. The two-year note fell to 3.78 percent, its lowest ever and down from 3.86 percent on Friday. And the yield on the 10-year note dropped 10 basis points, to 6.28 percent. **********In the weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the discount rate on the three-month bill fell to 2.91 percent, the lowest since May 1963, and the discount rate on the six-month bill dropped to 2.95 percent, the lowest since March 1963. **********Corporate and municipal issuers were also active yesterday, taking advantage of lower yields to borrow at lower cost, in some cases to refinance issues with higher rates sold years ago. **********Many traders and analysts think the 30-year bond's yield will move down to 7 percent, which would be the lowest since the early 1970's. **********""There is good potential for it to do better; to make at least one last move lower,"" said Mary Rooney, a financial economist at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. **********She said the next economic reports, like retail sales and industrial production, would continue to show that the economy was flat, providing an environment for still-lower rates. The unemployment report on Friday showed a surprising decline of 167,000 private-sector jobs in August. **********But while all yields continue to fall, the spread between yields of shorter maturities, like 2-year notes, and the yield of the 30-year bond continues at or near record proportions. That is not good news for the economy, since these long rates have a big impact on the housing industry. **********Yesterday, the spread between the yield on the 2-year note and the 30-year bond was 343 basis points, just off its record widest of 344 basis points on July 17. **********The 30-year bond is the riskiest of fixed-income investments, and analysts say that its relatively high yield compared with that of shorter maturities shows that some investors are worried about the outcome of the Presidential election and the costs of any economic stimulus program that might be proposed. Any such program would increase the Federal budget deficit, another concern of bond investors, because it could lead to more Federal borrowing. Also, analysts said, investors may not yet be convinced that inflation will remain low. **********""The weaker things get, the more stimulative economic package we could get,"" Ms. Rooney said. **********Like the rally in July, the price rise in the intermediate maturities, like the 5- and 10-year notes, came as retail investors chose to buy securities with longer maturities to get higher interest rates. In addition, some traders said there was more selling of longer-term mortgage-backed securities and buying of 5- and 10-year notes to fill the gap in institutional portfolios. **********The mortgage-backed securities are being sold because the drop in interest rates raises the threat that the underlying mortgages will be refinanced and paid off early, which can mean a loss for investors. Corporate Issues **********More than $1.5 billion in corporate bonds were issued yesterday, led by a $500 million issue of 10-year notes by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. In addition, the BankAmerica Corporation sold $250 million of 10-year notes and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. sold $250 million of 30-year debentures. **********""There is a very large shadow calendar out there,"" said one corporate bond trader, referring to the corporate issues waiting in the wings. ""There is a lot of cash out there and a very bullish sentiment."" **********The activity was less hectic in the municipal bond market but traders said that was just the post-Labor Day holiday calm ahead of an active week. According to Stephen Leslie, a senior vice president at M. R. Beal & Company, just the top 10 issues scheduled to be sold this week total more than $3 billion. **********Among the issues waiting to be priced are a $494 million issue by the New York State Medical Care Facility Authority; a $350 million issue by the New York Local Government Assistance Corporation and a $390 million issue by the city and county of Denver, for the airport. **********The municipal market has rallied about one to two full points in the last week, since it dropped sharply last month as the rush of issues overwhelmed the market. **********Because of the current rally in the Treasury market, some traders think investors will be able to absorb the new issues. But they do not expect anything like the rally in July. And if the pricing gets too aggressive and the yields too low, the market could retreat a little. **********""We have a heavy supply and do not have the same investment demand as in July,"" said Austin Tobin, the president of the Delphis Hanover Corporation. **********Following are the results from the Treasury auction of three- and six- month bills yesterday: (000 omitted in dollar figures)                    3-Mo.

Pre-arranged orders to buy orange juice futures increased as prices rose, extending the advance, they said. **********Florida, a leading producer of oranges, is at the greatest risk for a freeze from mid-November through January, though there are no signs of an impending freeze, said Bob Stefanski, a meteorologist with the Agriculture Department in Washington. ""I don't see any threat of cold weather at all to Florida.""  January Contract Up 7.30¦ **********March frozen concentrated orange juice closed at 101.40 cents a pound, up 5 cents, the most the contract is permitted to gain in one session. Every deferred-month contract, through March 1994, rose 5 cents, as well. Orange juice for delivery in January, which does not have a daily price limit, gained 7.30 cents. **********Orange juice futures, which hit bottom almost two weeks ago, have been tumbling for the last year as supplies have outstripped demand. **********In energy markets, oil futures closed mixed ahead of tomorrow's meeting in Vienna, where the 13 OPEC ministers will discuss first-quarter production. **********Crude oil for January delivery finished 2 cents higher at $20.22 a barrel. Among products, heating oil for January delivery closed 0.31 cent higher at 57.45 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline for January delivery closed 0.49 cent lower at 54.27 cents a gallon. **********Elsewhere, wheat for delivery in March recovered initial losses and settled higher in reaction to news that Russia made some of its payments on United States loans for grain. **********March wheat closed 1 3/4 cents higher at $3.74 1/2 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean and corn futures also rebounded from their daily lows. Soybeans for January delivery closed 2 1/2 cents higher at $5.68 a bushel.

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/business/vehicle-s-design-doomed-van-plant.html,Doron Levin,1992-02-26,,900,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Vehicle's Design Doomed Van Plant,Vehicle's Design Doomed Van Plant," **********Viewed in hindsight, the General Motors Corporation's assembly plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., was probably doomed the moment the company decided in 1987 to manufacture its plastic-bodied mini-vans there. **********Although mini-vans were an America original in the 1980's, G.M.'s adaptation, with its wide stance and sloping, futuristic nose, was far less popular than G.M. hoped. The auto maker expected to sell 150,000 to 200,000 mini-vans annually, which would have kept the North Tarrytown plant humming at capacity and might have assured that subsequent mini-van models would be built there. **********Instead, sales of Chevrolet Lumina APV's, Pontiac Trans Sports and Oldsmobile Silhouettes have totaled only about 100,000 a year, about half of the plant's capacity. ""The shape is too avant-garde for some people,"" said Mark R. Isaia, general sales manager for Brickell Pontiac Honda in Miami. **********Meanwhile, two years of losses at G.M., totaling $6.5 billion, have forced the auto maker to cut excess production capacity and wring efficiencies from remaining factories. The new mini-van model, due to appear in 1995, will be built elsewhere at one of the assembly lines for G.M.'s midsize car models. The idea is that midsize cars and mini-vans have similar wheelbases, allowing the vans to be built alongside midsize cars like the Buick Century and Chevrolet Lumina. **********Before the recession, G.M. and the rest of Detroit typically dedicated one assembly plant to a single car or truck model, meaning that it expected to sell about 200,000 units of that model in a good year. When demand for the model slackened, the plant simply slowed production and laid off workers. By current standards, G.M. executives agree privately, it was a sloppy, expensive way to do business.  Japanese auto makers, by contrast, sharpened their manufacturing skills so that many assembly plants could produce several different models on one assembly line. If one model was not selling well, others compensated. Higher use of plant capacity led to an inherently better return on invested capital. **********Robert C. Stempel, the chairman of G.M., has vowed to make maximum use of plant capacity by adding a third work shift to most United States assembly plants or by scheduling two 10-hour shifts a day, six days a week. Either way, the number of hours of production would rise sharply. Since G.M.'s capacity exceeds its sales, it is able to shut entire plants and still meet demand. Theoretically, utilization at the remaining plants will be very high, and each will be able to produce several different models. **********Tarrytown lacks the machinery to build midsize cars, and G.M. already has more plant capacity for midsize cars than it needs. So G.M. has chosen to put mini-van production into an existing midsize car plant. The result: Tarrytown is not needed. **********""When Tarrytown won, it lost,"" said Dan Luria, automotive analyst for the Industrial Technology Institute, a nonprofit research concern in Ann Arbor, Mich. ""The workers did all the right things to get the mini-van, but G.M. was just too optimistic about how many it could sell."" Memories of Concessions **********Tarrytown's workers have special reason to feel bitter about G.M.'s decision. In 1987, after feisty debate, they voted for innovative and cooperative work rules to replace restrictive and costly union job practices, so that G.M. would consider the plant for the new mini-van. Local and state politicians pitched in with tax breaks, training money and even the elevation of railroad bridges in an effort to win production of the vans. **********""It's been a very good work force and a very good local union,"" said Darwin E. Allen, a G.M. spokesman. He acknowledged that workers had been unusually receptive to managers' ideas about how to save time, space and money. **********Still, G.M. has taken pains to declare its decision to close Tarrytown ""final,"" despite vows by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and local politicians to fight for a reversal. Although Mr. Stempel wants all G.M. plants to find ways to raise output, he does not want to rile the United Automobile Workers union, which contends that he is ""whipsawing"" plants -- pitting them against one another to lower costs. **********Today, Stephen P. Yokich, vice president of the U.A.W., warned G.M. executives that they were ""playing with fire if they encourage plant-against-plant competition over work rules"" to lower costs. 'Looks Like a Dustbuster' **********The main reason for G.M.'s weak mini-van sales -- why the company has been selling 100,000 annually instead of twice that number -- is the vehicle's controversial exterior styling. ""It looks like a Dustbuster,"" said a G.M. manager who insisted on anonymity. **********G.M.'s design staff decided to endow the vehicle with a radically futuristic look and bodies skinned in plastic. The sharp slope of the nose initially gives a driver a feeling of being seated in the center of the vehicle rather than in the front. **********In any event, G.M.'s next mini-van model probably will not be such a big design risk. The plastic panels will probably be replaced by conventional steel panels so that G.M. can easily construct the vehicle with its midsize models. But by that time, Mr. Stempel promised on Monday, at least one of G.M.'s five midsize car-assembly plants will be shut down. The five are in Oklahoma City; Doraville, Ga.; Fairfax, Kan., and two in Oshawa, Ontario."

Almost half the victims were foreigners; most were photographers or television cameramen. **********The group's statistics were reported by Allison Jernow, a research associate for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog organization that monitors press freedoms worldwide. **********""By comparison, 30 journalists were killed in El Salvador between 1980 and August 1989,"" Ms. Jernow said. **********The death toll for journalists in Yugoslavia is high because, unlike the Persian Gulf war, for example, where reporters' movements were tightly restricted, the Yugoslav combat zones are readily accessible to the press."

He said the United States and its allies should do whatever it takes, apparently including air strikes, to enforce the flight ban. **********Mr. Clinton's comments, made during a news conference in Little Rock, Ark., to introduce new members of his Cabinet, came after an intensive review of the Balkan situation by his foreign policy advisers. They have argued privately for days that because of the inaction of the Bush Administration, which remains deeply divided over what to do in the former Yugoslavia, and because of the continued fighting, Mr. Clinton could not wait for Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, to make his position clear. No Ground Troops Seen **********""I have been in favor of enforcing the no-fly zone for some time,"" Mr. Clinton said, adding that enforcement ""can be done from the air without a commitment of ground troops."" He added, ""Anything we can do to turn up the heat a little there, to try to reduce the carnage, is worth trying."" **********Both Britain and France, whose forces are part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia, have been reluctant to allow American planes to enforce the flight ban over Bosnia, fearing that the Serbs would retaliate against United Nations forces on the ground. But Mr. Clinton said there might be some softening of British and French opposition. **********Mr. Clinton's statement today goes further than what he said at a news conference on Tuesday, when he expressed sympathy for Mr. Bush's unwillingness to commit American forces to a ground operation, but added, ""There may be other things which can be done."" Mr. Clinton declined to be more specific, saying only that he would review his options ""at the appropriate time"" and that he did not think he ""should say more about specifics at this time."" Position in Campaign **********During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton argued that the United States should take the lead in seeking United Nations authorization for air strikes to protect the effort to deliver food and medicine to victims of the fighting in Bosnia and should consider whether to push for lifting the United Nations arms embargo that some contend unfairly hurts the Bosnians. **********But until today, both external and internal factors had constrained him from outlining his solutions for any of the international problems he will inherit. **********Mr. Clinton has said since the election that he would not compete with Mr. Bush's foreign policy during the transition period. He has also been determined to remain focused on the economy, but has acknowledged -- with more than a hint of frustration -- that he will have to spend more time on foreign affairs than he wants to. No Policy Team Yet **********Finally, he has yet to put his foreign policy team in place, which has meant that there is no one in authority to help formulate policy and explain what he means when he does not want to do that himself. **********Mr. Clinton's remarks today could put pressure on the Bush Administration, which has concluded that Serbia is routinely violating the United Nations ban on flights over Bosnia, to decide whether or not to initiate a United Nations enforcement resolution. They also put President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia on notice that the new Administration may not permit his policies in Bosnia to go unpunished. **********Mr. Clinton may also be seeking to regain control of the debate over Bosnia from former Republican policymakers -- notably former President Ronald Reagan and former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz -- who have called for swift, selective military action against the Serbs. **********This week, Mr. Shultz, in a rare criticism of the Bush Administration, urged the United States to use force to stop the Serbian ""ethnic cleansing"" of Bosnia and punish Serbian war crimes. The normally cautious former Secretary of State even advised his hosts on the ""Macneil-Lehrer News Hour"" to run footage of World War II Nazi concentration camps the next time they broadcast a program on Bosnia. ""The message is the same,"" he said. **********Mr. Clinton already knows he will inherit an American military commitment in Somalia, which his advisers fear could raise expectations that he may respond with similar, decisive action in Bosnia. ""You can't move on Somalia without having pangs of conscience about Bosnia,"" a senior aide to Mr. Clinton said. **********Mr. Clinton's remarks are also consistent with his stated desire for a ""disciplined, aggressive,"" preventive approach to foreign policy to help head off global crises before they boil over and monopolize his time. **********The Bush Administration is divided over whether to press for a United Nations resolution authorizing force to stop the Serbian flights, senior Administration officials said today. **********The State Department, which favors quick action, had hoped to resolve the issue this week, so the Security Council could begin discussions before Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger meets with European and Arab foreign ministers in Geneva next week to discuss the Balkan situation.  Pentagon Is Opposed **********But the Pentagon has argued that until there is clear evidence that the Serbs are using their warplanes and helicopters in combat missions, there is no need for such strong action, officials said. **********The Administration debate is reflected in a classified paper that discusses the consequences of enforcing the ban, officials said. The paper argues at one point that the lack of enforcement has made the ban meaningless and may embolden the Serbs to spread the war to the Kosovo region, which has been stripped of its autonomy by Serbia. But it also says the imposition of the Security Council ban has sharply decreased the number of flights over Bosnia and apparently stopped the bombing and strafing of villages in the former Yugoslav republics. **********Aides to Mr. Clinton said in interviews that the United States had missed opportunities to curb fighting in the Balkans, and that American options were more limited than they would have been a year ago. But they added that his remarks today were not meant to be critical of the Administration or to push it to initiate an enforcement resolution in the Security Council. **********Rather, one senior aide said, Mr. Clinton ""is seriously concerned about the situation both with respect to continuing risk in Bosnia as winter approaches and the risk of a wider conflict if the Serbs act against Kosovo,"" the autonomous region with a largely Albanian population. ""He understands it is something he will have to deal with when he becomes President."" **********--------------------       NATO Willing to Intervene **********PARIS, Dec. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Secretary General of NATO, Manfred Worner, said today that the alliance was prepared to intervene in the former Yugoslavia if requested by the United Nations, adding that contingency plans for a military operation were under review. **********But the United States Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, speaking at the end of a meeting in Brussels of NATO Defense Ministers, said Washington remained opposed to committing ground troops unless the objectives were clearly defined. He also urged NATO to admit some East European countries as members to confront security problems in the former Communist bloc more effectively. **********Mr. Worner, while stressing that the United Nations should continue to have the leading role in responding to the Balkan crisis, said NATO was ready to act. ""I have no doubt that, if asked by the United Nations, the alliance would do what is necessary,"" he declared. **********Contingency plans have been drawn up, Mr. Worner said, declining to elaborate. Later, he told the BBC that he believed that the time had come for military intervention, although the consequences for United Nations relief forces already in the Balkans would have to be reviewed carefully. **********--------------------       U.N. Sending 700 to Macedonia **********UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously today to send some 700 peacekeepers to Macedonia in an attempt to prevent hostilities from spreading into that former Yugoslavian republic. **********The decision represents the first time the Security Council has deployed peacekeepers for preventive purposes, with the aim of stopping an eruption of violence before it has begun. **********Few countries recognize Macedonia, which has also not yet been admitted to the United Nations because of a quarrel with Greece, which wants it to change its name. **********But there are fears that the fighting in Bosnia could spread to Macedonia, which has a large Muslim minority of Albanian descent."

Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers Inc., a money management firm. He added that he believed the Fed would wait till after the Treasury's quarterly refunding next week before making any further move to lower interest rates. Declines on Other Indexes **********The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.73, to 411.09, as the American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.84, to 415.41. Over-the-counter trading was also active, but the declines were not as severe. The Nasdaq index fell by 2.72, to 634.95, while the Russell 2,000 slipped to 210.08, down 0.18. **********""The failure of the Fed to give a signal of further easing swung the market around yesterday,"" said Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, ""and that encouraged program selling, which exacerbated the downside."" **********According to Philip H. Smyth, an analyst with Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm that tracks program trading, it was one of the busiest days thus far this year for programs. The firm tracked 13 programs, 11 of which were sell, with a combined effect of pulling the Dow down 64.23. **********Mr. Smyth said the market had been anticipating a 34,000 gain in jobs. But after the report of a surprisingly sharp drop of 91,000 jobs, traders said, blue-chip issues moved higher in early trading and the broader market extended its gains in anticipation that the Fed would move to ease rates further. **********But the Fed failed to make the gesture at its normal time of intervention, causing bond prices to collapse. Stocks followed, with the decline magnified by program selling. **********Elsewhere in the market, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines traded lower in Big Board activity, as some dealers cited KLM's disappointing load factor of 65.3 percent for January, a shade lower than the period a year ago during the gulf war. The stock was down 5/8 at 21 1/2. Two Hotel Stocks Off **********On expectations that the hotel industry slump will continue through 1992, Margo Vignola, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, lowered her rating on both Hilton Hotels and Marriott to a hold from a buy. Traders said she noted that there were still too many hotel rooms in this country and that discounting was running rampant. Marriott fell 7/8, to 18, but Hilton was up 3/4, to 44 1/8. **********Grenada Sunburst Systems was sharply lower after the company said its previously announced merger talks with First Tennessee National had been terminated and were not expected to resume. Grenada fell 4 3/4, to 15 1/2, while First Tennessee gained 2 1/8, to 46 3/8. **********Amid concern that efforts by the Washington State Legislature to limit the market share of bank holding companies could delay or make changes in the proposed merger of Security Pacific and BankAmerica, the share prices of both companies declined. Security Pacific was down 1 1/2, to 33, while BankAmerica was off 1/4, to 40 3/8."

Tougher Fight in the Senate **********Advocates conceded today that they would face a more difficult fight there. Some former supporters are said to be wavering, in part because of heavy lobbying from the White House, the cable industry and Hollywood producers. **********The House vote increases the chances for the first override of a Bush veto. It also puts the President in what could be a no-win situation. Proponents of the legislation say it is the biggest consumer initiative in recent years and would both rein in prices for basic cable service and erode the monopoly franchises that cable companies enjoy in all but a handful of cities. **********Nationwide, prices for basic cable service have climbed by about 50 percent, or three times the rate of inflation, since 1987, when rates were deregulated by Congress in an effort to promote the fledgling industry. **********But critics of the bill, including some Democrats, argued that it would actually raise rates because it would entitle over-the-air broadcasters to demand a new stream of royalties from cable systems that retransmit their programs. **********Whatever the eventual impact, most consumers are not likely to notice any difference in monthly bills soon. Most customers subscribe to a broader array of services, from Cable News Network to Nickelodeon, than the basic tier of local stations and public access channels. The second, broader tier of service is subject to much lighter regulation. **********Indeed, the biggest effects and the biggest fights have been over provisions of the bill that would affect other industries: television broadcasters, satellite companies and manufacturers of television decoders. Fight by Affected Industries **********The bill passed today would require the Federal Communications Commission to set regulations for reasonable prices for basic service, based on prices charged in the few communities where cable franchises face direct competition. **********The bill also includes a controversial feature intended to encourage greater competition from satellite companies and ""wireless cable"" services that transmit television programming over microwave frequencies. Known as ""program access,"" the provision requires big cable companies that own local franchises as well as produce popular programming to license their programs to rivals. **********The big losers would be cable giants like Time Warner Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, which owns interests in the Discovery Channel, Black Entertainment Television, Turner Broadcasting System and other programmers. **********The most immediate winner may well be Hughes Network Systems, a unit of General Motors that is starting a satellite service that will beam multiple channels of television directly to small home antennas. The National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, an association of rural telephone companies, is investing $250 million in the venture and plans to market the service to rural households. **********""I know this is election time, and we are all hungry for votes, but this is not the way,"" declared Representative Norman Lent, Republican of Long Island, in the course of the debate. ""Consumers are smart enough to recognize that this bill is going to raise, not lower, rates."" **********The intense industry and Hollywood lobbying did erode support in the House. Twenty-eight Democrats and 19 Republicans who supported the House bill on July 23 did not today. The Senate version passed in January by 73 to 18. **********But the biggest threat to the bill may be the calendar. Congress is planning to adjourn in early October, and the President is allowed to consider a bill for 10 days before signing or vetoing it. Senate opponents of the bill are expected to try a filibuster."

The police said he had apparently committed suicide. **********The newspaper accusations against the prosecutor, Domenico Signorino, were based on the testimony of a Mafia turncoat and raised questions about the status of evidence provided by informers who have become the authorities' main source of information about the mob's doings. **********The newspaper reports also revived a debate over the Mafia's long-suspected efforts to penetrate state institutions, including the judiciary. **********A police spokesman said Mr. Signorino, 48 years old, had left a note to his wife saying he was innocent. He was found dead with a gun at his side. **********His death was the third reported suicide linked to the Mafia in Sicily since late November, when a man accused of being a Mafia boss and a man suspected of being a 'counselor' a notorious gangster jumped to their deaths after being arrested. **********The accusations against Mr. Signorino were made by Gaspare Mutolo, a Mafia informer who caused a stir in October when he identified a close aide of former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti as a liaison between the Government in Rome and the mob. **********Mr. Signorino was one of the main public prosecutors at the so-called maxi-trial in Palermo in 1987, when he demanded life sentences for 20 accused gangsters and sought a 17-year prison term for Mr. Mutolo, who has since turned state's evidence. **********According to newspaper leaks published on Monday, Mr. Mutolo told investigators that Mr. Signorino was ""close to certain circles I know."" **********Mr. Signorino had publicly rejected the accusation, and told reporters, ""If seeking 20 life sentences at the maxi-trial means I am a mafioso, then go ahead and call me that."" **********The informer's accusations against him, which have not been substantiated, recalled other occasions when senior figures in the Sicilian judiciary came under suspicion of complicity with the mob. Earlier this year, another senior prosecutor in Palermo resigned after investigators accused him of blocking their inquiries into Mafia crimes. **********The judge's death today also inspired debate over the disclosure of unsubstantiated accusations by Mafia informers. **********""Informers are very important instruments for the fight against organized crime,"" said one magistrate, Vladimiro de Nunzio. ""But sometimes disclosures that are made without verification cause untold damage."" **********The death of Mr. Signorino coincided with a fresh crackdown on mobsters in the Gela area of Sicily and with renewed efforts by investigators to move against both mafiosi but politicians connected with them. **********In Gela, investigators issued 96 new arrest warrants for Mafia-linked activities including extortion and murder. The small seaside town has become an emblem of the many small towns in Sicily where, the authorities say, the Mafia has woven itself deeply into public administration. **********The ties between Italy's various Mafia-linked organized crime gangs and politicians have come under increased scrutiny since the police in southern Italy this week arrested 11 people in connection with the 1989 slaying of Ludovico Ligato, the former head of the country's state railways. **********Four of the people arrested are local politicians accused of ordering the official's assassination -- the first time politicians have been publicly charged with such direct involvement in gangland murder. **********Mr. Ligato was forced to resign from the state railways in 1988 because of a corruption investigation. Investigators say he was killed a year later because he wanted a slice of the action from corrupt public works contracts in the southern city of Reggio Calabria. **********The politicians accused of complicity in Mr. Ligato's slaying include two former Mayors of Reggio Calabria, where the entire 23-member city council was arrested in September on corruption charges."

Mr. Ajello was expected here today, diplomats said. **********The President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, and the head of Renamo, Afonso Dhlakama, signed a peace treaty in Rome on Oct. 4. The agreement called for demobilization of troops and for the creation of a new army of 30,000. Both sides would contribute 15,000 men. **********The peace plan also states that Western donors will meet in two months to come up with financing for the demobilization and for the transportation home of millions of refugees. Multiparty elections are scheduled in 12 months. **********In the 10 days since the agreement, Mozambicans say there appears to have been a dramatic falloff in fighting. ""The war has stopped,"" said Carlos Cardoso, the editor of Media Fax, a daily newspaper distributed by fax. **********When first announced, the peace pact was accorded little interest. **********But Mr. Cardoso said reports from Nampula, a northern province, said Renamo rebels were opening the roads. Instead of hijacking relief convoys, in the last several days the rebels had politely asked for a couple of bags of grain from a truck and then waved it on, he said. ""People are really weary of war,"" he explained."

Baker 3d, riding in an armor-plated motorcade, made a surprise visit to Lebanon today to reaffirm Lebanon's sovereignty and to signal the Syrians that Washington expects them to withdraw their troops from Beirut by this fall. **********Mr. Baker, the first senior American official to visit Lebanon since Secretary of State George P. Shultz in 1983, drove from Damascus to Zahle to call on the Lebanese President, Elias Hrawi. His home village is 10 miles from the border, on the western edge of the Bekaa region, where many United States hostages were once held by renegade militias.  Short Notice **********Security was so tight that most of Mr. Baker's staff and the journalists covering the trip were told only two hours before Mr. Baker departed. On top of that, a 12-car dummy motorcade, complete with official limousines, flags, police cars and an ambulance, drove along the route from the border to Zahle five minutes before the real motorcade came by, in order to draw out any potential assassins or trigger any car bombs. **********""Mr. Secretary, I welcome you here in my home, in my country, Lebanon,"" President Hrawi said at his white stone house in Zahle, whose predominantly Christian residents seemed pleased but stunned by their visitor. **********""Your presence here personally is a new and clear assurance of your support for Lebanon's independence and sovereignty over all of its territory,"" the President said. ""Lebanon has led a painful 16 years, and by your presence here among us, you are bearing witness to Lebanon's way out from the misery of war. I hope I will see you soon in our capital, Beirut.""  From Beirut Motor Pool **********Mr. Baker's route from Damascus took him through the heart of the Lebanese territory dominated by the Party of God, a pro-Iranian, Shiite Muslim militia. Thus, his motorcade resembled a modern-day wagon train riding through the Wild West: Every car was plated bumper-to-bumper with armor so heavy it was difficult to pull the doors open. Most were drawn from the motor pool of the United States Embassy in Beirut. **********The motorcade drove at a breakneck speed, careering along the twisting road and leaving a trail of burnt rubber. Only after Mr. Baker arrived in Zahle did the state-run Beirut radio announce his presence. **********Bulletproof glass covered every window, and the Lebanese Army, Syrian intelligence agents and Mr. Baker's security detail cooperated in protecting the Secretary's limousine, with their M-16 rifles poking out of virtually every vehicle. **********Two Silverado vans, with machine-gun turrets planted on their roofs, sandwiched Mr. Baker's Cadillac. The guards swiveled the turrets from side to side the whole way to Zahle, pointing their weapons at every person they passed and ready to pounce on any suspicious movement. **********Mr. Baker regularly meets with the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Faris Bouez, on his Middle East shuttles, but always in some other Arab capital, usually Damascus or Cairo. On this visit, though, the Lebanese pleaded with the Secretary to come to Lebanon -- both to underscore that the country has become reasonably safe again and to remind the Syrians that Washington expects them to pull out of Beirut in accordance with the 1989 Taif peace agreement, which ended Lebanon's civil war.  The Terms of Taif Accord **********The Taif agreement was hammered out in the Saudi mountain resort by the United States and Lebanese, Syrian and other Arab diplomats. It stipulated that two years after the establishment of a national unity government in Lebanon, Syria and Lebanon were to arrange for Syrian troops to withdraw from Beirut into the Bekaa. This would be a first stage toward the total removal of the 30,000 troops, which have been stationed in Lebanon since 1976, shortly after the civil war began. **********In the view of both Lebanon and the United States, all of the reforms stipulated by the Taif agreement were in place by September 1990, when the new President was elected, and therefore by this September, Syria and Lebanon should have worked out the withdrawal from Beirut. **********But a Syrian Vice President, Abdel Halim Khaddam, said earlier this week that, in Syria's view, Lebanon had not yet enacted not all the political reforms, and thus there was no deadline in September. What the Syrians Want **********The Syrians argue that at a minimum, a new Lebanese Parliament must be elected; the current one was largely appointed or left over from the last election in 1972. And they want those elections held before they withdraw from Beirut, knowing that while they occupy Beirut, more pro-Syrian candidates are likely to win office. The Syrians say they are also reluctant to withdraw until they are sure the tiny Lebanese Army can maintain order. **********Hard-line Lebanese Christian groups, however, are demanding that the elections be postponed, at least until the Syrians redeploy. The matter could be decided by the Lebanese Government as early as Friday. **********Mr. Baker's message was that when Lebanon holds elections is Lebanon's business, but that Washington shares Lebanon's view that arrangements should be made for Syria's redeployment of troops into the Bekaa by September. **********After a 90-minute meeting with President Hrawi, Mr. Baker said: ""We are pleased to be able to have this meeting in Lebanon and we strongly support the political independence, the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Lebanon. **********""We hope that our presence here makes a statement in support of that independence and sovereignty. We support strongly both the letter and the spirit of the Taif agreement. We would like to see the implementation of that agreement and support that strongly."" **********Mr. Baker, who met Wednesday with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, was asked whether Mr. Assad was committed to redeployment by September. **********""I think that the Government of Syria wants to redeploy their forces, to use their terms, 'as soon as possible,' "" he answered. ""I think, though, that perhaps there is a difference of interpretation of the Taif agreement -- between an interpretation that we would put on it and the interpretation that they might put on it."" **********Mr. Baker said that in Washington's view, Lebanon and Syria should get together by September to decide how to begin the withdrawal."

The drop was bigger than expected and reinforced concerns among traders that February employment data scheduled to be released today by the Labor Department might provide further evidence that the economy is on the mend. **********""I think there is a growing sentiment that the economy has got a couple of quarters of growth in it, and the market is repricing itself to reflect that,"" a government bond trader said.  Negative Psychology **********Prices fell after the unemployment claims numbers were released, but some Wall Street analysts said the market was overreacting to the figures because the drop came during a holiday-shortened week. **********Still, the analysts acknowledged that current market psychology was so negative that traders were inclined to sell securities on any sign of economic strength, no matter how questionable that evidence might be. **********""The market is very, very intolerant of anything with a plus sign on it,"" said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. ""But I don't think the economy is robust enough to sustain a 3 percent recovery with interest rates on the rise. That is not the prevalent view right now, though."" **********Selling pressure intensified after the results of an auction of one-year Treasury bills were announced. Demand for the new bills was not terribly strong, and the securities were sold at an average discount rate of 4.37 percent, sharply above the 4.01 percent average rate at the last one-year bill sale on Feb. 6.  Clearly in a Bad Mood **********The market's bad mood became clearer as the afternoon wore on and as traders failed to react positively to comments from Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Rostenkowski said chances were slim that a fiscal package to revive the weak economy would be enacted before the November elections. **********Market participants have worried for months that such a package would prove overly stimulative and reignite inflation. **********A report from the Federal Reserve Board that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended Feb. 24 also failed to generate any reaction from credit market participants. **********By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10014/32 , down 19/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 7.90 percent late Wednesday. **********Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100, down 1/2 point, to yield 7.50 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9918/32 , down 7/32 , to yield 5.61 percent.  Higher Rates on Bills **********Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.04 percent late yesterday, up two basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.16 percent. **********In other developments, details were released of two high-yield junk-bond issues that were priced Wednesday night. **********Foodmaker Inc. offered a total of $300 million worth of securities through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley & Company. **********The largest part of the offering consisted of $175 million worth of noncallable seven-year senior notes. The 9.25 percent securities were priced at $100, or par. **********The remaining $125 million were sold as senior subordinated notes that mature June 1, 2002. These 9.75 percent securities, which are also noncallable, were priced at $100, or par. **********The Foodmaker issue is rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********And the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation offered $250 million worth of 10-year senior notes thorugh an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation. **********The 9 1/4 percent notes were priced at $100, 1.82 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated Ba-1 by Moody's and BBB-minus by Standard & Poor's.  New York City Offering **********In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Prudential Securities Inc. released the final prices on an offering of $106.2 million worth of zero-coupon securities offered as part of New York City's debt sale on Wednesday.  Because they could be purchased in increments as small as $5,000 face amount, the zero-coupon securities were marketed heavily to small investors. **********Prudential, which acted as lead manager on the New York City offering, said yields range from 6.75 percent on bonds maturing in 1997, 7.30 percent in 2002, 7.60 percent in 2007 and 7.65 percent in 2012. The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's. **********In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by about 1/4 point in light trading. **********In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, market participants reported that prices of most issues dipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point. **********Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of one-year bills:  Price . . . 95.581  Discounted Rate . . . 4.37%  Coupon Yield . . . 4.58%  High Price . . . 95.602  Discounted Rate . . . 4.35%  Coupon Yield . . . 4.56%  Low Price . . . 95.571  Discounted Rate . . . 4.38%  Coupon Yield . . . 4.59%  Accepted at low price . . . 100%  Total applied for . . . $31,077,415  Accepted . . . $13,785,165  N.Y. applied for . . . $28,769,930  N.Y. accepted . . . $12,879,930  Noncompetitive . . . $624,500  The one-year bills mature on March 11, 1993."

For some in the television industry, this constitutes a rather provocative juxtaposition of events. **********Some executives at the three competing networks, who have been burned by Fox's stunning success over the last five years, think the decision to dismiss Mr. Chao for doing something bold, attention-getting and borderline tasteless leaves Fox wide open to charges of hypocrisy. **********After all, Fox has loudly attributed its success in establishing itself as a viable fourth network to its willingness to take risks, to look for programs ""with an edge"" or ""an attitude."" This has led to many bold, attention-getting and borderline tasteless shows on Fox. Certainly, ""Studs"" fits that description. **********Even Jay Leno could not resist taking a shot at Fox last week. In his ""Tonight"" show monologue, he referred to Mr. Chao's dismissal for demonstrating poor taste. ""This is the Fox network,"" Mr. Leno said. ""Isn't that why he was hired in the first place?"" **********The impression of Fox as the network most likely to transcend the boundaries of good taste has been a byproduct of Fox's well-executed plan to become the network most likely to be watched by viewers under the age of 25. Irreverence plays well with a young audience. **********From the outrageously gay movie reviewers on ""In Living Color"" to the anti-establishment cracks of Bart Simpson, Fox has been strong on irreverence. But it has also had shows full of jokes about overweight women (""Babes""), about dead people (""Good Grief"") and, of course, about sex -- and the lack of it -- for the most dysfunctional family on television (""Married With Children""). **********In that atmosphere, Mr. Chao may have felt somewhat comfortable pulling the striptease stunt, even at a management conference on June 19 staged by Fox's parent, Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. The forum he chose was a panel discussion on ""the threat to democratic capitalism posed by modern culture."" **********The audience included Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; his wife, Lynne, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and other figures from conservative and Republican circles, as well as Mr. Murdoch and his wife, Anna. **********Mr. Murdoch later said that Mr. Chao, who was trying to make a point about censorship and free speech, had made ""a terrible misjudgment."" **********But Fox's critics felt it was a fair question to ask if Mr. Chao would have been similarly reprimanded if he appeared before the same group and showed a few minutes from ""Studs"" -- perhaps a shot of contestants answering questions like ""Which is the guy who has bounce in his butt?"" or ""Which one is more likely to find the G-spot?"" **********The prize for a winning contestant on this game show is a ""dream date."" **********To some, it seemed Fox was displaying a double standard: an outrageous and, to some, vulgar act is cause for dismissal in a private setting in front of distinguished guests; but outrageous and, to some, vulgar material is both acceptable and marketable in the public setting of broadcast television, where the guests are just the unwashed masses. **********Longtime critics of Mr. Murdoch, looking to make the same point about a double standard, also cited the fact that his British tabloids run photographs of naked women. **********A Fox spokesman, Dennis Petroskey, said Mr. Chao was dismissed not just because his actions were deemed ""inappropriate"" but also because they were ""unauthorized."" One of the oldest maxims of business, of course, is don't surprise the boss. **********""This is something we have always contended with,"" said Jon Nesvig, the senior vice president of sales for Fox. ""You want to keep an edge in what you do. You don't want to go over the edge. Sometimes, we have gone over the edge and we've pulled back. We've said we're going to take risks. But if you go too far, if you go over the edge, you fall off the end of the world. That's what happened here."" **********Fox executives said the loss of Mr. Chao would have no effect on their ambitious plans to expand in prime time next season. Nor, they said, will his dismissal for being too bold have a chilling effect on Fox's program executives, headed by Peter Chernin, who is credited with several of the boldest and biggest hits in recent years, including ""In Living Color"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210."" **********Fox is also going ahead with its plans to start a full-fledged news service, which had been Mr. Chao's main project. **********As for ""Studs,"" its ratings have grown each week in the last month. It will probably live on for some time as Mr. Chao's legacy."

Chairman Is Given Board's 'Full Support',G.M. Chairman Is Given Board's 'Full Support'," **********The director of the General Motors Corporation who led the board's move to more closely monitor management acted yesterday to play down widespread speculation that the G.M. board planned an expanded role in the daily operations of the company. **********In his first statement since the board announced a series of executive changes on Monday, John G. Smale, the former chairman of the Proctor & Gamble Company, said yesterday, ""Neither I nor any of the other outside members of the General Motors board of directors intend to involve ourselves in the day-to-day business of G.M."" **********His statement, which was issued by G.M., added: ""That job is the responsibility of Bob Stempel, and he has the board's full support and confidence in pursuing the goal to accelerate the return to profitability of G.M.'s North American operations."" Robert C. Stempel is G.M.'s chairman and was replaced as head of the board's executive committee by Mr. Smale. **********G.M. officials said the announcement was issued yesterday at Mr. Smale's request, in response to what he perceived as erroneous news reports about the meaning of the executive changes. The statement did not specify any news accounts. **********Since Monday's announcement, Mr. Smale and several other G.M. directors have not returned phone calls seeking comment on the G.M. action. Spokesmen for several of the directors have referred calls to General Motors. **********The company's stock slipped 25 cents yesterday, to $37.625 on the New York Stock Exchange, after gaining $1.25 on Tuesday, the first trading day after the announcement. **********Automotive analysts said yesterday that Mr. Smale's announcement might have been intended to signal that Mr. Stempel remained in charge, thereby squelching any uncertainties about leadership within G.M. **********The degree of that support and confidence was widely questioned both inside and outside G.M. after the board demoted Mr. Stempel's hand-picked president, Lloyd E. Reuss, on Monday and placed Mr. Smale at the head of the board's executive committee. **********Since the changes were announced, the company has sought to clarify the role of the executive committee that Mr. Smale now leads. As established in 1989, the committee comprised a core group of directors with the authority of the full board to act on pressing matters. But the committee's mission has changed to fulfill more of an advisory role between board meetings, the company said. **********""The purpose of the board's executive committee,"" Mr. Smale said in his statement, ""of which I am chairman and Bob Stempel is a member, is to assure timely and effective communication between the committee and the chairman (Bob Stempel) of the corporation's management committee regarding all phases of G.M.'s business activities."" **********Before Monday, Mr. Stempel headed both the board's executive committee and the board's management committee. After the changes, the executive committee consists of outside directors and Mr. Stempel. The management committee, which Mr. Stempel continues to lead, is composed solely of G.M. executives. **********Analysts said that while the board might not want to involve itself in day-to-day operations, it clearly wanted to monitor important decisions more closely. **********""The board replaced the president, the chief financial officer, and removed Stempel as chairman of the executive committee,"" said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter in San Francisco. ""There is no question that it wants to provide oversight and checks and balances to the decisions made."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/business/under-siege-liquor-s-inner-city-pipeline.html,Calvin Sims,1992-11-29,,2809,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Under Siege: Liquor's Inner-City Pipeline,Under Siege: Liquor's Inner-City Pipeline," **********T S LIQUOR does a brisk business on Jefferson Avenue in South Central Los Angeles, where the small, tidy store sells everything from diapers and panty hose to eggs and tortillas. And, of course, liquor -- a lot of it. **********From the time T S opens at 9 A.M. to its closing 12 hours later, a steady stream of customers calls. ""How ya feeling today, papa-san,"" yells a woman, buying a 40-ounce bottle of beer at 11:30 A.M., to the store's owner, Ui Man Chung, who smiles and pats her on the shoulder. **********A few minutes later, two young men take advantage of the store's weekly special: a 16-ounce bottle of Colt 45 malt liquor for 90 cents. They leave, grinning, with six bottles. **********By his own account, Mr. Chung, a 58-year-old Korean immigrant, invested his money wisely when he purchased the store five years ago. Like similar stores, T S Liquor makes a 20 percent profit on food and other merchandise and a 30 to 40 percent profit on alcohol, Mr. Chung said. There is perhaps no other inner-city business that has been as lucrative as liquor. **********In fact, liquor stores have done so well in urban centers that before the spring riots, South Central, with a population of 500,000, had nearly three times as many outlets -- 728 -- as Rhode Island, which has 1.3 million people and 280 liquor stores. **********For the liquor industry as a whole, the stores here -- and thousands of others like them around the country -- are the end point of what amounts to a multibillion-dollar pipeline into the nation's inner cities. It is a rich franchise for manufacturers and distributors, in large part because it is the biggest market for such powerful but inexpensive drinks as malt liquor and fortified wine. **********But it is a franchise that is increasingly under siege. Political, community and drug prevention groups have long been frustrated with the high concentration of liquor stores like Mr. Chung's in neighborhoods here -- and with liquor industry marketing and advertising campaigns that many say have fostered a permissive atmosphere toward drinking. Now, the groups have banded together to block, or at least slow down, the rebuilding of the 200 liquor stores that were damaged or destroyed in the riots. And they are making some headway. So far, only 10 of the stores have permission to rebuild. Other Pressure Points **********Under attack, however, is more than just the corner liquor store in South Central, where heightened racial tensions between blacks and the Koreans who own many of the stores made the outlets a particular target during the riots. (Mr. Chung's store escaped damage.) **********In cities like Oakland, Chicago and New York, clergy and community activists are also working to cut down the flow from the liquor pipeline in efforts that began long before the riots. These groups are putting pressure on local officials to deny permits for new stores. And they are prodding owners of existing stores to change some of the ways they do business, like limiting their hours of operation and no longer selling individual paper cups that encourage customers to drink in groups nearby. **********It is far too early to assess the impact of such efforts on the industry. Beer and wine manufacturers have been reluctant to involve themselves in the Los Angeles dispute. But some industry executives are now speaking out, an indication that the protest is threatening to become painful. **********""I will not comment on whether 100 percent of these stores should be rebuilt,"" said William Bitting, executive vice president and general counsel of the S&P Company, parent of the Pabst Brewing Company, which makes Olde English 800, the nation's top-selling malt liquor. ""But for this great democratic society to dictate to the black and Hispanic community what type of businesses they can and cannot have is sheer nonsense and smacks of paternalism."" **********What's more, said Patrick L. Beauchamp, president of the Beauchamp Distributing Company, limiting the number of liquor establishments will not solve the problem of alcohol abuse because people will still find a way to get what they want. Mr. Beauchamp's company distributes beer and malt liquor in South Central Los Angeles, Compton and West Hollywood and its sales have declined since the riots. **********""These corner liquor stores are legitimate businesses that are selling legitimate products,"" added Robert Sands, vice president of the Canandaigua Wine Company, maker of the most popular fortified wine, Richards Wild Irish Rose. ""It seems to be rather contradictory of the whole cause of trying to improve conditions in these areas if we limit a very viable segment of business that is providing jobs and revenues in an area that so desperately needs them."" 'Like a Miracle' **********But opponents argue that the wide availability of alcohol contributes to its use and that the stores are frequently the scene of criminal activity, public drunkenness and loitering. **********""The night before the uprising, a lot of us were in a meeting discussing how we might reduce the number of liquor stores in South Central, and a few days later, like a miracle, a large chunk of the stores we wanted to close were burned to the ground,"" said Karen Bass, director of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, which is leading the fight in Los Angeles. ""That's not the way we wanted it to happen, but the rioting accomplished in a few days what we have spent decades working to achieve."" **********The big unknown is whether the liquor opponents will succeed long-term with legal weapons and social persuasion. To be sure, it is not the first time that civic groups have tried to keep out products and businesses they have deemed harmful to their communities -- and the record has been mixed. **********For example, in 1990, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company planned to test market Uptown, a menthol cigarette specifically aimed at black smokers. The company canceled the product in the face of an uproar. **********But an effort three years ago against potent fortified wines didn't fare nearly as well. Under pressure from community groups, Canandaigua and the other big seller of the wines, the E.& J. Gallo Winery, pulled the products from the shelves of grocery stores, bars and other establishments in skid-row areas across the United States. But many retailers simply purchased the wines on the black market or from distributors outside the area and continued selling as usual. **********As for the current effort in Los Angeles, there is already one ominous sign for the community groups: while only 10 stores got official permission to reopen, about 100 others didn't wait and are back in business illegally. Size of the Market **********No one knows the exact size of the inner-city alcohol market, but everyone agrees that billions of dollars worth of beer, wine and other spirits are sold there each year. For many critics of the industry, the core of the problem is the big slice of that market occupied by malt liquors and fortified wines, which are sold predominantly in urban centers. Nationally, these products accounted for $2 billion in sales last year, three-quarters of which came from malt liquor. **********A powerful form of beer, malt liquor is extremely popular among young men in the inner city -- and on college campuses -- because of its cheap price and an alcohol content about 30 percent higher than standard beer, according to Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, a newsletter based in West Nyack, N.Y. A 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor, the container of choice, frequently sells for $1.25 to $1.50. **********Consumption of malt liquor is rising. Last year, Americans drank 6.22 million barrels worth, up from 6.09 million the year before. Besides Olde English 800, the top sellers are Schlitz Malt Liquor, made by the Stroh Brewery Company, and Colt 45, made by G. Heileman Brewing. **********The malt liquor industry has come under mounting attack from community and church groups for its marketing practices. Critics charge that brewers have aggressively targeted inner-city residents, especially young people, in their ad campaigns. **********For years, Heileman has used Billy Dee Williams, the actor, to promote Colt 45 in television spots, but the company recently added Fab Freddy, a young MTV host, to the commercials in hopes of appealing to a younger crowd. Drawing special ire was the decision last year by the McKenzie River Corporation to hire Ice Cube, the rap star, to market its St. Ides malt liquor to young blacks. One ad showed Ice Cube holding a 40-ounce bottle. **********""You don't see Luke Perry pushing malt liquor on TV and there's a reason for that,"" said Makani Thaemba, a public policy specialist for the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in San Rafael, Calif. ""These companies don't sell a lot of malt liquor to people who look like him."" **********Especially troubling in the advertising is the manner in which blacks are depicted using the products, Ms. Thaemba said. ""They show blacks drinking 40-ounce bottles of this stuff and hanging out in the neighborhoods. But look at Budweiser commercials: you see people at home or at barbecues and the ads are not screaming, 'Go buy six packs of Bud.' "" **********Makers of malt liquors say that they are being singled out unfairly and that they are simply marketing a legal product to a community that is likely to buy it, as any business would. The majority of people who consume their products do so responsibly, say company representatives, who blame a small number of abusers for giving malt liquor a bad name. **********Makers of fortified wines also say they are being unfairly targeted. **********There are two kinds of fortified wines -- traditional dessert wines, like sherries, ports and vermouths, and low-end products that provide the most alcohol for the least money, sometimes as little as $2 a bottle. Fortified wines typically have an alcohol content of 20 percent, compared with about 8.5 percent in table wine. A standard bottle of fortified wine contains 2.4 ounces of pure alcohol, or the equivalent of six mixed drinks of 80-proof vodka, according to the Marin Institute. **********The market for these products as a whole has been declining sharply, to 14.6 million cases last year, from 18.8 million in 1990, according to the Jobson Beverage Group, a market research firm in New York. Last year, sales were estimated at $400 million to $500 million. **********Analysts attribute the decline to a general shift among consumers from high-proof beverages to lower ones. But the industry does not provide separate numbers for the two types of fortified wines or for geographic markets. In any event, no one disputes that fortified wines remain big sellers in inner-city stores, although Mr. Sands of Canandaigua maintains that his company's products are consumed in the suburbs as well as the inner city, an assertion that could not be confirmed in a random check of stores in the more affluent West Side of Los Angeles. The Name Game **********Gallo, the nation's largest winery, makes two popular fortified wines, Thunderbird and Night Train, but few consumers know this because the Gallo name does not appear on the labels. While the privately held winery does not disclose its revenues, some analysts say that fortified wines represent from 10 to 20 percent of Gallo sales, or about $100 million to $200 million. **********Daniel Solomon, a Gallo spokesman, said the Gallo name does not appear on its fortified wines because the company has reserved the label for its table wines. **********""It's like the crazy aunt in the cellar,"" said Paul Gillette, a beverage industry consultant and editor of California Beverage Hotline, a newsletter based here. ""This is the part of the business that nobody wants to acknowledge. But it is big business."" **********The legal weapons that can be used to attack that business at the liquor-store level are limited. **********The City of Los Angeles, for example, cannot prevent liquor store owners from rebuilding simply because there are too many of them. But the city has made it difficult to reopen by requiring owners to go through a long, arduous hearing process and by imposing new rules to reduce undesirable activity around the stores. These include the posting of security guards and the removal of pay telephones often used for drug sales. **********Mayor Tom Bradley has appointed a liquor store task force that recently called for a moratorium on new liquor licenses in South Central and recommended steps for reducing the overall number of liquor outlets there, including encouraging owners to go into different lines of business. **********The 100 or so stores that have reopened illegally are subject to closure and fines. But because the task force is still so new, and because the legal process to shut the stores down is itself an arduous one, it is not clear how quickly those stores will be forced into line. **********Nonetheless, the opponents of the liquor stores say the momentum is on their side. **********Financing to open the stores -- which traditionally has been relatively easy to obtain -- appears to be shrinking, they note. Bank of America, California's largest bank, established a $25 million emergency loan fund for small businesses damaged in the riots, but it is not making those loans available to certain businesses that the community deems ""undesirable,"" including liquor stores. **********Even Mr. Chung of T S Liquor is having his doubts about the future. Mr. Chung attributes the success of his store to his ""good relations"" with the community. He has hired several black employees who ""maintain order in and around the store."" But, he conceded, ""the liquor business is becoming too difficult."" **********Indeed, there may well be fewer stores in the future, with or without new regulations, said Mr. Gillette, the beverage industry consultant. **********""It will come about through the natural evolution of things,"" he said. ""It will not be worth the pain and risk to open a new liquor store that could be burned or boycotted because the community does not want it."" PROTESTING IN NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE **********THE inner-city liquor business has come under attack not only in Los Angeles but in major cities across the country. **********In New York, black clergy and community activists say they are closely monitoring the situation in Los Angeles to see if they can apply the same pressures. **********One of the leaders is the Rev. Glen Missick, chairman of the Manhattan division of the New York African-American City-Wide Clergy Council. Mr. Missick said that he and other ministers whose churches sponsor redevelopment projects in Harlem have reached agreements with the developers that prohibit the leasing of commercial properties in the projects to liquor store owners. **********""If liquor comes in, we will revert to direct confrontation,"" Mr. Missick said. ""We will demonstrate and close them down."" **********An effort several years ago by the Rev. Calvin Butts, of New York's Abyssinian Baptist Church, targeted billboards that advertised alcohol and cigarettes in Harlem. In response, the Outdoor Advertising Association recommended that its members voluntarily limit the number of billboards in any market that carry ads for products that cannot be sold to minors. **********In California, new zoning ordinances approved by the Oakland City Council last year are shrinking the number of liquor outlets there. The rules require new outlets to be at least 1,000 feet from a church, school, public gathering area or other liquor store. If an existing store closes down for more than a year -- and then does not meet the new rules -- it will not be allowed to reopen at that spot. **********In Chicago, the Rev. Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina Church said that the city's South Side has so many liquor stores -- 519 in a 606-square-block area, according to a recent study -- that he is working with local politicians and the Nation of Islam to pass legislation that would force some parts of the area to go dry. **********In the meantime, Father Pfleger said that his group, Standing Up, Taking Back, has persuaded 65 liquor stores to comply with laws against selling alcohol to minors, remove beer and cigarette advertising and stop selling individual cigarettes and bottles of beer. **********The group had threatened to stage sit-ins and boycotts of the stores. ""We are sending out a warning that if the stores don't change their behavior, they are history,"" Father Pfleger said."

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted that Mr. Hussein would be removed ""in the not-too-distant future."" **********Administration officials have long said Mr. Hussein was crippled by the war and in danger of being overthrown, but there is no indication that the Administration is taking concrete steps to topple him, other than continuing economic sanctions. On Defensive Despite Victory **********The Administration's attempts to cast the war in the most favorable light underscored a political problem Mr. Bush faces as the 1992 campaign unfolds. Instead of celebrating the anniversary as an example of strong leadership, Mr. Bush has found himself increasingly on the defensive not only about Iraq, but also about a broad range of his foreign policies, including the Middle East peace talks, which Mr. Bush declared a central achievement of the military victory over Iraq. And despite an intensive effort to portray his trip to Japan as a success, Mr. Bush has not been able to shake the impression that he went seeking trade concessions and returned with political and personal embarrassment. **********Aware of polls showing that Americans are increasingly dubious about the extent of the American victory over Iraq and increasingly critical of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign as well as domestic policy, the White House hopes to keep such criticism from damaging the President's re-election campaign. **********Today Mr. Bush focused on an effort to underscore the accomplishments of the American-led coalition that drove Baghdad's army out of Kuwait. **********""Kuwait is liberated and the legitimate Government restored, the fires set by Saddam's retreating army are extinguished, the flow of oil from the gulf is secure from political and economic blackmail,"" the President said. 'Dividends' of the War **********Listing what he said were the ""dividends"" of the partnership he forged to fight Iraq, Mr. Bush said: ""A critical region of the world vital to its economic well-being is secure. Thanks in large part to our efforts, direct peace talks between Arabs and Israelis are under way for the first time, multilateral negotiations on regional arms control have begun, and America's hostages in Lebanon are home."" **********The President added, ""Much of Iraq's arsenal is destroyed and what remains is now under international supervision."" **********But his remarks contrasted with testimony a day earlier by Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, who warned Congress that Mr. Hussein could rebuild Iraq's nuclear, poison-gas, germ warfare and ballistic missile programs within a few years. **********In the months between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, and the onset of combat, critics of Mr. Bush, and some Administration officials, said the President erred by turning the showdown into a personal confrontation between himself and Mr. Hussein and by elevating the Iraqi leader into a larger-than-life figure whom Mr. Bush compared to Hitler. Bush Still Focuses on Hussein **********But since the war, Mr. Bush has kept up his personal focus on Mr. Hussein, as he did today. **********""The American people and I remain determined to keep the pressure on Saddam until a new leadership comes to power in Iraq,"" he said."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/26/business/company-s-profit-data-were-false.html,Adam Bryant,1992-11-26,,990,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Company's Profit Data Were False,Company's Profit Data Were False," **********Until yesterday, the report cards on the Comptronix Corporation, an electronics company in the small Alabama town of Guntersville, were glowing with the praise usually reserved for the best pupils. **********Prospects for the company, which makes products like electronic circuit boards, in its rapidly expanding high-technology niche were judged most promising. To those who made it their business to know the company, its top executives appeared focused and aware of the challenges they faced to maintain the company's heady growth. As recently as Tuesday, a Merrill Lynch analyst, Melinda Reach, rated the company above average. **********But Ms. Reach and countless others whose money and reputation were riding on Comptronix must have been dumbfounded yesterday to learn that the company had suspended its three highest-ranking executives after they admitted last week to inflating the company's earnings for as long as three years. **********""They seemed like pretty solid citizens to me,"" Ms. Reach said. **********The disclosure sent Comptronix's high-flying stock into a nose dive, plummeting to as low as $3.75 a share from $22 in over-the-counter trading yesterday. The stock closed at $6.125 a share. **********Comptronix is the latest addition to a growing list of companies, including Phar-Mor Inc. and Cascade International, that have been found within the last year to be purveying seriously inaccurate financial information. **********""We are seeing more flagrant violations by corporate officers,"" said James Newman, publisher of the Securities Class Action Alert service in Cresskill, N.J. Profits From Losses **********But someone who was either very lucky or in the know apparently profited from heavy trading this week in Comptronix put options, which are bets that a stock's price will fall. A series of trades on Tuesday and Wednesday, if made by the same buyer or buyers, resulted in profits of $368,750, less commissions, on an original investment of $21,250. **********The Pacific Stock Exchange, where the options are traded, said it had completed an investigation yesterday that it forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose officers could not be reached last night. **********Until yesterday, long-term investors in the company were profiting handsomely. Comptronix went public in 1989 and was trading at just $2.75 a share at the end of 1990. In 1991, it more than quadrupled, to $12.375. In 1992, it peaked earlier this month at $22.75. On Tuesday, the shares closed at $22, up 37.5 cents. **********Many institutional investors held large stakes in Comptronix, including Dean Witter and Fred Alger Management Inc. David Alger, an executive vice president at the company, echoed many people's disbelief over the news. He said he believed Comptronix was sound, and that Alger held more than 350,000 shares as of September. **********""We were talking to the company every other week,"" he said. ""But it's hard to defend yourself against the whole management of the company acting in concert."" **********Comptronix employs 1,800 people at plants in San Jose, Calif.; Colorado Springs, and Guntersville, about 65 miles northeast of Birmingham. It had a good reputation among its competitors, who apparently never questioned the impressive earnings. **********Demand for products like Comptronix's -- which include circuit boards used in everything from medical CAT scan machines to personal computers -- was rising at roughly 18 percent a year. And orders were growing from the many Fortune 1,000 customers that increasingly subcontract their manufacturing needs. **********In the first nine months of 1992, the company reported profits of $5.32 million, up 63 percent from the comparable period last year. Revenue was said to have surged 37 percent, to $101.2 million, from $74.1 million. **********But the integrity of those numbers crumbled when the top three executives -- William J. Hebding, chairman and chief executive; Allen L. Shifflett, president, and Paul Medlin, treasurer -- told the company's board last week that they had improperly valued assets and either overstated sales or understated costs on the company's income statement. Interim Leadership **********Such was the account offered yesterday by the company's interim chairman and chief executive, E. Townes Duncan, a director and venture capitalist based in Nashville who owns about 4 percent of Comptronix's stock. Mr. Duncan said the directors had no inkling of the executives' machinations before they came forward. ""I was shocked and dismayed,"" he said. ""Now I'm mad."" **********Mr. Duncan said he did not know the whereabouts of the suspended executives and he would not comment on their motives. Telephone calls to the homes of the suspended executives yesterday were unanswered. **********Mr. Hebding on Friday filed his intent to sell 100,000 shares, or 15 percent of his total holdings in the company. This summer, he and Mr. Shifflett each sold 50,000 shares of stock for $737,500. Talks With Banks **********Since the disclosure, Mr. Duncan has huddled frequently with the company's bankers. In Mr. Duncan's words, they too ""were shocked and dismayed, and now mad."" Mr. Duncan stressed that the reported improprieties had little effect on the company's cash flow. **********The company has appointed Arthur Andersen & Company to investigate its finances and accounting controls. **********A spokeswoman for Comptronix's most recent auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, said it did not know how the executives massaged the numbers. ""The very nature of fraud is to deceive everyone involved,"" she said. **********Mr. Newman of Class Action Alert and others said they expected class action lawsuits to be filed against the company and KPMG. It was not known late yesterday whether such suits had been filed. **********Perhaps the most spectacular examples of companies reporting inaccurate financial statements include Phar-Mor, the drugstore chain in Youngstown, Ohio, that filed for bankruptcy in mid-August amid accusations by the company that the co-founder had embezzled money. And a year ago, the founder and chairman of Cascade International, a retail chain based in Boca Raton, Fla., vanished after a few analysts questioned the accuracy of his company's financial statements."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/15/business/training-computers-to-note-images.html,John Markoff,1992-04-15,,1085,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Training Computers to Note Images,Training Computers to Note Images," **********Now that computer researchers have refined the art of searching through megabytes of data for a single phrase, their new challenge is developing tools to sort through huge electronic libraries of pictures. **********Teaching computers to recognize images is essential for putting consumer catalogues on video, and can lead to vastly improved video editing, satellite data-gathering and video teleconferencing. Instead of looking through files of photographs or scanning stacks of videocassettes, librarians, editors, producers and researchers could quickly call up pictures and video clips by computer. **********Ultimately, researchers at M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory say, such technology could cement the marriage of desktop computers and television. **********Already, Edward H. Adelson and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology laboratory are having some success in coaxing computers to recognize discrete objects -- chairs, faces and other images that the scientists are calling ""things."" **********But Mr. Adelson, one of the nation's leading researchers in computer vision, is having more trouble getting computers to recognize what the scientists call ""stuff"": images, like a blue sky, that have texture or color but are not sharply defined objects. A computer analyzing satellite imagery has difficulty recognizing, say, a burning rain forest. **********Mr. Adelson hopes to break such tasks down into simpler components. **********""Suppose that I want to find a video sequence of a beach scene with a few clouds in the sky,"" he said. ""I can tell the computer to look for textures and patterns that are characteristic of sand, sea, clouds and sky."" **********The challenge of teaching computers to see is taking on new importance with the development of technologies like video conferencing and multimedia computers, which can store digitally -- as streams of ones and zeros -- hundreds of thousands or even millions of still and moving images. **********New devices that blend the power of computers with conventional video and audio technologies are shackled by their limited abilities to sort and retrieve visual images the way personal computers now manipulate text and numbers. Today, searching large data bases of digital images requires typing in detailed descriptions of each picture. These descriptions might still miss much of the crucial information in an image. **********Despite three decades of research financing from the Pentagon and other sources, the best efforts of computers to see are still crude by human standards. The simplest problems for people, like recognizing that the person one met on a sunny day is the same person on a cloudy evening, now present insurmountable obstacles for the best computer systems. **********In the United States, most research on computer vision has taken place in the narrow area of factory machinery, where computers are trained for relatively simple, repetitive tasks. Much less domestic research goes on in the broader data base applications. **********""Unfortunately, most of the work in this area now comes from Japan and Europe,"" said Dragudin Petkovic, a research manager at I.B.M.'s Almaden Laboratory in San Jose, Calif. The laboratory's Qubic project (for Query by Image Content) has developed a way for users to draw a sketch and then have a computer retrieve still images that come closest to matching it. **********Researchers at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory, which is devoted to developing new multimedia technologies, expect other breakthroughs in image recognition.  One technique developed by researchers working with Mr. Adelson allows easier video searches. The program stacks a series of digital video images like a deck of cards. The patterns revealed by then viewing slices of the stack indicate motions. An ankle-high slice through a film clip showing children walking reveals an identifiable weaving pattern created by their feet as they walk. **********A similar technique, called extruded video, developed by another Media Laboratory researcher, Glorianna Davenport, measures the change of colors in the video signal. Distinctive spikes in the rates of color change are likely to indicate scene changes. Range of Applications **********New ways of searching image data bases and digital movies would have a wide range of applications. Consumers could search through video catalogues by asking to see specific items in certain colors or patterns. Intelligent video-editing systems could track characters and scenes. Satellites and computers could automatically perform complicated environmental monitoring, detecting oil slicks and air pollution. New data-compression techniques could send clear images over telephone lines. **********The new technologies promise to be useful even if computers remain far from perfect at recognizing images. New software could allow a computer user to choose one image and search a movie or collection of photographs for similar images. Media Laboratory researchers are working on systems that would allow a user to point to a video clip of an oil slick and then direct the machine to search a vast video data base for similar instances. **********Other uses might raise fears about computers invading people's privacy. Some corporations, including Secom, Japan's largest security company, are supporting Media Laboratory research to develop improved surveillance technology. Computers that can identify faces could be used to open locked doors for company employees and keep strangers out. Computers could even match the faces of department store shoppers against a data base of known shoplifters.  BT, the British telecommunications company, recently gave the laboratory a five-year, $2.5 million contract as part of a cooperative research program on computer vision. **********BT is especially interested in improved video conferencing. Because telephone wires can carry only a limited amount of data, they cannot transmit sharp pictures. Researchers say that current image-compression technology, which uses mathematical forumulas to eliminate repetitive information, is nearing its limits. **********By understanding more about images, researchers hope to transmit much more detailed live images. For example, the image of a motion, like the blinking of an eye, could be transmitted just once and stored in memory; each subsequent blink could be signaled by a short code. **********The BT researchers are also considering some blue-sky applications. **********""We've already begun looking at the synthesis of images,"" said Mark Shackleton, a BT researcher temporarily assigned to the Media Laboratory. In a video-teleconferencing system of the future, he explained, users might be able to subtly -- or radically -- alter their appearance or voices. **********It is conceivable, the researchers said, that some day shoppers will be able to go to department stores for computerized makeovers, walking out not with makeup kits but with new digital self-images on floppy disks."

The standard labels -- stagnation and recession -- fail to capture the hardship that many Americans say they are suffering. ""Silent depression,"" ""depressed recession,"" and ""cycle of cycles"" were among the other names suggested by readers. **********But for many, the real question is the source of the problems. ""I must say that a descriptive name for America's present economic difficulties seems far less important to me than a correct diagnosis of these difficulties,"" wrote Samuel M. Greenhouse of Boca Raton, Fla. And among the numerous diagnoses, a new one is appearing that goes a long way toward explaining the national hardship. It is the falling inflation rate. **********Not since the mid-1960's has the Consumer Price Index hovered for so long a period -- 18 months now -- at an annual rate of 3 percent or less. But while low inflation was a boon in the 1960's, suitable to the times, it is a heavy burden today, helping to explain why the economy fails to revive. **********""The downward trend causes the trouble,"" said Albert Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a business organization. Going from a 5 percent inflation rate in 1990 to 3 percent today, he said, ""is much more disruptive than having had low but steady inflation for a considerable period, as was the case in the 1960's."" **********The problem today is different for individuals than for companies. Average wages for individuals have virtually stagnated, the Labor Department reports, but some major household expenses have sharply risen: health care, college tuition, home repair, utilities and property taxes. That plus heavy consumer debt loads, a burden absent in the 1960's, squeezes Americans, making them reluctant to buy, a prerequisite for an economic revival. **********American corporations, on the other hand, suffer from almost no inflation at all in product prices. Unable to get price increases for a great variety of goods, they have preserved profits by cutting costs, especially labor costs. The results are wage and hiring freezes or outright layoffs, that have prolonged the hard times for workers. What's more, wholesalers and retailers decline to stockpile goods, depressing production. Why stockpile shoes at $50 a pair if the price three months from now won't change, or might even drop? **********The corrugated box industry illustrates the problem. Some 95 percent of all packaged goods are shipped or sold in these boxes. But the price of $624 a ton is still well below the $664 selling price in 1989. A recent 3.3 percent increase, to $624, was the first increase in three years. **********""We think the resistance has to do with the inability of our customers to pass price increases along to their customers,"" said Timothy McKenna, an executive at the Union Camp Corporation. **********Union Camp, as a result, has stopped hiring and has also installed labor-saving machinery. That did not happen in the 1960's when price increases were also hard to get. With much less foreign competition, American output and sales kept rising, and so did productivity, the amount produced by each worker. The rising productivity -- at a much greater rate than today -- generated revenue for healthy wage increases. But even then, a sluggish economy, in part a result of low inflation, prompted President John F. Kennedy to push through the nation's first investment tax credit. **********More important, the 1960's escaped deflation entirely. Prices might not have risen much, but they did not fall, as home prices have fallen in recent times, particularly in California and the Northeast. A home purchased for $500,000 in 1988 might sell for only $375,000 today, often less than the outstanding mortgage. **********A family that owns such a home, with a $400,000 mortgage, is forced down one of two paths. If income is sufficient, the family can stay put, maintaining payments on the mortgage. But if the family cannot keep up the payments, because of job loss or wage cuts, the forced sale of the home for $375,000 may mean defaulting on the mortgage. And mortgage defaults are rising. **********In either case, some inflation in the value of the home would relax the family. And in a more relaxed mood, family members might become more avid consumers. ""With asset values falling, people are stuck with their debts, and that spills over into consumption,"" said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. **********Some economists argue that allowing inflation to rise even a little might set off an inflationary spiral. But others offer a contrary view: Instead of rising, the inflation rate will continue to decline, hurting the economy.

Deserved or Not, Macy's Bankruptcy . . ."," **********Macy's bankruptcy -- except for the undeserved misery for staff and suppliers -- might be one of the better things to happen to the company. Perhaps more important, it could be the beginning of salvation for the department store industry, for which it has been a role model -- good and bad. Macy inspired countless ""intuitively skilled"" merchants to follow its lead. **********Macy, run by the quintessential ""merchant princes,"" is now a company that believes it knows everything and does not need to share information or consult with anyone, including its own customers. There is a fine line between self-confidence -- essential in a great merchant -- and arrogance. When Macy crossed the line several years ago, it began a series of costly strategic mistakes that caused its undoing. **********One hallmark of great merchandising operations is the willingness to let employees -- from merchants to systems analysts -- participate in industry forums where strategies and tactics get tested beyond the sometimes stultifying cauldron of the home office. Sometimes it is good for ""Macy's to tell Gimbel's"" because Gimbel's -- or more likely, Nordstrom's or Bloomingdale's -- might tell it something back. People involved in industry forums know that Macy never talks. Its executives are rarely in the audience or at the podium. Until recently, many in the news media were at the receiving end of the same arrogance. **********Perhaps history would have been written differently if Macy had let some fresh insights into its decision-making -- from its poorly conceived purchase of Bullock's/Magnin's to its mistargeted and costly television advertising push a few months ago. If its merchants had been part of a competitive merchandising cooperative -- their numbers compared weekly with like stores across the country, their selections challenged by peers -- perhaps Macy would not have made the mistake of moving so heavily into private-label goods and flip-flopping on pricing strategies. **********Macy, a historical leader in research, has turned away from an objective probing of its changing customer base. Instead, it adopted the facile attitude of the ""I listen to the cash register"" retailer. With the exception of real estate research, this national multi-billion dollar retail giant has not conducted serious consumer research into its markets, the products it carries, its advertising strategy or its store design. The sale of its credit card operation will likely take away another major marketing tool just when it needs it most. **********Macy's has not been in touch with people who shop elsewhere, and it has most likely not ""intensified"" the purchasing of its remaining customers by finding out their preferences. **********Macy's merchant princes have had remarkably good gut instincts for what customers have wanted. But they might have avoided costly mistakes if they had added empirical research and idea exchange to fortify that ""golden gut."" And there is widespread feeling in the industry that if Macy doesn't do research -- or idea or data sharing -- why should anyone else? **********I am glad the recent Macy mutation -- arrogant, inward-looking, closed to new ideas and, finally, greedy -- is bankrupt. A re-invented Macy, drawing on its historical strength of merchandising flair coupled with financial prudence, can re-emerge as the industry leader."

Denmark is the only one of the 12 members of the European Community that has formally rejected the accord, which was agreed to last December in the Dutch city of Maastricht. **********It requires approval by all nations of the community before it can go into effect. **********The announcement by the Prime Minister, Poul Schluter, came two days after French voters narrowly approved the Maastricht accord in their own referendum. But Danish treaty supporters say they face an uphill battle in winning approval here. If a referendum were held now, they said in interviews, the treaty would probably lose by more than the 1.5 percentage-point margin margin by which it was defeated in June. Changes Will Be Sought **********Mr. Schluter, who like most Danish politicians supports the accord, said he would seek changes to make it more palatable to the electorate. In particular, he said, Danes were not prepared to commit themselves to adopting a single European Community currency. **********Denmark, the Prime Minister said, ""doesn't want to renegotiate the treaty, but rediscuss it."" **********Mr. Schluter said he would discuss possible changes when he meets with Prime Minister John Major of Britain on Sept. 30. He said he hoped to present final proposals at the European Community summit meeting scheduled for December in Edinburgh. **********Uncertainty over Europe's future prompted the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, to fly to Paris today for talks with President Francois Mitterrand. Unusually, though, there was no joint news conference, statement or even a press briefing after their meeting at Elysee Palace, which lasted an hour and 50 minutes. **********The expectation had been that they would announce some initiative to breathe new life into the drive for European union, particularly since Mr. Kohl and Mr. Mitterrand have been the main forces behind the treaty, which in addition to a single currency, calls for a regional central bank and closer coordination of foreign and defense policies. Kohl Is Terse **********French and German newspapers had suggested that the two leaders would propose ways to assure ordinary Europeans that the union treaty would not represent an attack on their national identities and to limit the community's power to interfere in the internal affairs of member nations. **********But Mr. Kohl, on his return to Bonn, simply told reporters that the process of European union must not be halted. ""For me and for the President, this is clear,"" he said. ""We want the ratification of Maastricht."" **********A senior Danish Foreign Ministry official said the road to union would not be easy. **********""This is going to be a very long process,' the official said, ""and it has only just started. The French vote clearly says that there is a lot of opposition to aspects of the Maastricht treaty that probably went too far. Even the parties that oppose the treaty here say they favor closer European cooperation. They don't want to kill the idea. They want to vote yes on a treaty that is more favorable to Denmark."" **********Politicians on both sides of the issue said in the interviews that the people of this country want an accord that does not require them to participate in a common European defense force or to give up their currency. They also want changes in provisions that give all Europeans common citizenship and mandate closer cooperation among national police forces. Reins on the Eurocrats **********In addition, they indicated, Denmark will insist on guarantees of greater openness at European Community headquarters in Brussels, and would seek to open more meetings to the public and make more internal documents available. **********It remains unclear whether these changes can be made through a series of protocols attached to the existing treaty, or whether they would require negotiating a new one -- something that supporters of unification like Chancellor Kohl hope to avoid at all costs. **********Prime Minister Schluter, at his news conference today, said he was seeking ""additions"" rather than amendments. Other political leaders, however, are pressing for full renegotiation by the European Community. **********Gert Petersen, a member of Parliament who campaigned against the accord, declared: ""Some people, both within Denmark and abroad, want to keep the treaty completely unchanged and just add some notes at the bottom saying that Denmark will not have to accept certain parts of it. That is not enough for us, and I don't think it is enough for the majority. We will not support a treaty that can be used as a step on the ladder toward a federation or a union. **********""If we vote no in the next referendum,"" Mr. Petersen added, ""or even if we vote yes on a new treaty that includes what we want, it will mean that some sort of divisions or categories will emerge in the E.C. There will be an E.C. at several speeds, or an E.C. in two or more spheres. Some countries will buy the whole package, and others will proceed according to their own will."" Matter of National Identity **********Danish voters who opposed the treaty in June cited a variety of concerns, ranging from fear of tighter fishing quotas to concern over pensions. But many shared a general unease at the prospect of Denmark's losing part of its national identity. Although Danes pride themselves on a lack of nationalism, they do not want to lose the benefits that their highly successful society has brought them. **********Some Danes, however, are worried by the prospect of their country remaining on the sidelines while most of the rest of Europe proceeds toward unification. **********""We are in dangerous waters,"" said Peter Vesterdorf, a leader of the Danish Federation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, who campaigned for the accord. ""We may wind up with a community that has a core of 10 members, or 11 if the British finally decide to come aboard, and then a second group of members with limited rights and responsibilities. I have my doubts about whether this kind of 'Europe a la carte' can really work."" **********""Many Danes are afraid that their prosperity would be threatened by a large E.C. bureaucracy,"" he acknowledged. ""But the fact is that in many areas, staying on the outside will hurt us. The challenge is to make people understand that."" Danes Already Have Exceptions **********There are indications that Denmark's vote against the Maastricht treaty, coupled with uncertainties stemming from last week's European currency crisis, are adversely affecting the economy here. Lego, a Danish company that exports plastic bricks and other toys to much of the world, has announced that it will not proceed with a planned new factory until the country clarifies its role in Europe. **********The task of treaty advocates is complicated by the fact that the accord already addresses many of Denmark's complaints. It does not require the Danes to join the Western European Union, which is to be a core of a future European defense force, nor does it require them to accept a new currency if they vote not to do so. **********""This is one of the most difficult negotiating problems I can imagine,"" an economist said. ""The challenge is to produce a series of protocols that repeat, in different language, things that are already in the treaty, and then to convince people that they are voting on something different. I have my doubts on whether that is possible."" **********Erling Olsen, a member of Parliament who campaigned for the treaty, said politicians needed to give voters ""an alibi for changing their vote."" **********""We've had too little time to decide what this thing is all about,"" he declared. ""People are afraid. Before the next referendum, we really need time for a longer debate."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/07/business/market-place-less-flexibility-in-europe-s-rates.html,Floyd Norris,1992-05-07,,871,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; Less Flexibility In Europe's Rates,Market Place; Less Flexibility In Europe's Rates," **********A FUNNY thing happened in Europe when the British Government moved to cut interest rates this week. The British bond market rally came to an abrupt end. **********The market reaction points up the complicated relationships among European countries, as well as the continued focus in Germany on its own problems, to the exclusion of those of the rest of Europe. **********Moreover, if interest rates do not continue to drop in Europe, that could slow growth there, in turn reducing demand for American exports and dampening this country's recovery. **********The British bond market had been rallying strongly in the wake of the surprising Conservative victory in last month's elections. In April, an index of Government bond prices maintained by J. P. Morgan & Company showed a gain of 4.43 percent, including both coupon income and price appreciation, as measured in British pounds. With the pound also rallying, foreign investors enjoyed a double benefit, seeing a total return of 6.82 percent, measured in dollars. **********But on Tuesday, when the Bank of England moved to cut short-term rates, by half a percentage point, the rally in gilts, as the British Government's long-term bonds are known, was nowhere to be seen. Morgan says its index fell by 29-hundredths of a percent, not enough to wipe out the earlier gains but enough to shake up some holders. Trading yesterday was mixed, but a 25-year gilt slipped in price to yield 9.22 percent, compared with a low of 9.16 percent reached last week. Before the rally began, it was yielding 9.8 percent, according to Bloomberg Business News. **********""It's over for a while,"" said Norman Klath, a managing director and head of market research for Morgan in New York, speaking of the rally in gilts. He said it might resume later this year if Britain moved to tie the pound even more closely to other European currencies. **********Those currency ties have constrained the financial flexibility of most of Europe this year, and they have made it much more difficult for governments to use monetary stimulation in an attempt to promote economic growth. The easing of British monetary policy, The Financial Times groused in an editorial yesterday, ""has been modest compared with that in the U.S., Canada or Australia, which have had similar recessions."" The newspaper called for more easing, but the market consensus is that such action is unlikely unless and until German policy changes. **********Hopes for such a change were reduced yesterday when Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, called the country's current 4.5 percent annual inflation rate unacceptable, voiced concerns over monetary growth and said ""it would certainly be too early to sound the all-clear on monetary policy."" **********Germany's Government is now trying to slow inflation by taking a hard line on public-sector wages, a policy that has produced widespread strikes. **********The Bundesbank's council will meet today, and there has been speculation that it might move to raise short-term interest rates. Most analysts think this will not happen, but cuts appear to be out of the question. **********A decade ago, German interest rate policy would have been watched by the rest of Europe, but it would hardly have been considered dominant. Now, however, currencies in the European Monetary Union are linked to the mark, and there are severe limits on the flexibility of governments to lower domestic interest rates without risking a run on their currency. **********For that reason, it appears to many analysts that interest rates may have declined as far as they are likely to in Britain. The base rate, for loans to banks, was cut to 10 percent from 10.5 percent on Tuesday. That rate is roughly similar to the Lombard rate in Germany, at which banks may borrow from the central bank. It now stands at 9.75 percent. **********The idea that British short-term rates could be as low as German rates is still hard to believe, after years in which British rates were far higher, and there is worry about reaction in the currency markets if British rates go lower. **********The pound is now linked loosely to the mark, being allowed to trade in a 6 percent range in contrast to the 2.75 percent range of many currencies. There is talk that Britain, when it assumes the presidency of the European Community later this year, will move to the smaller range. Mr. Klath of Morgan says such a move might inspire confidence, allowing long-term rates to decline again, but there is concern among others that it would simply reduce Britain's freedom of movement even further. **********Short-term rates and longer-term ones often move in opposite directions, but the freedom of long-term rates in Britain to fall further is limited by the fact that the yield curve is inverted, with short rates higher than long ones. **********Eventually, it seems likely that Germany, too, will grow concerned enough about slow growth to begin to cut interest rates, perhaps renewing bond rallies throughout the Continent. But for now, it appears that Mr. Schlesinger's inflation concerns have cast a pall over bond markets far from Bonn."

MISSES AN INTEREST PAYMENT DEADLINE,COMPANY NEWS; AMDURA CORP. MISSES AN INTEREST PAYMENT DEADLINE," **********The Amdura Corporation failed to make its July 3 deadline for an interest payment on $50 million of 10-year term notes due over the next year. Doug Pimple, a company spokesman, said the company's recent default on loan agreements would not affect company earnings, although he added that the company's recent hiring of the New York investment firm Bear, Stearns & Company for help in its restructuring could have a significant impact on operating expenses resulting in a charge to earnings. He declined to comment on the amount of any charge. **********To reduce its debt to a more manageable level, the company recently began discussions with lenders about restructuring its term notes. Based in Denver, Amdura makes industrial coatings, fittings for wire rope and chain and equipment for waste management. Its shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $3.875, on the New York Stock Exchange."

But the Government elected in June has stirred anxieties among opposition politicians, who see in Mr. Meciar's first steps harbingers of an authoritarianism to come. **********A former Communist turned populist whose campaign touched Slovak national sentiment and fears over the deteriorating economic situation, Mr. Meciar dismisses these worries. His vision for Slovakia, he insists, embraces a free-market economy, political pluralism and tolerance for the 500,000 ethnic Hungarians who live in this republic of five million. **********Opposition politicians paint a darker picture, saying Mr. Meciar's election promises of economic recovery have raised hopes that cannot possibly be met. Mr. Meciar's detractors contend an independent Slovakia is likely to have a pliant press, Government-dominated economy and strained relations with both neighboring Hungary and the ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia. No Changes, Minister Says **********""Nothing changes,"" said Dusan Slobodnik, the Culture Minister in the new Government, in response to the charges. ""I would like to stress this fact. Nothing changes in the development of democracy in Slovakia. Those who say democracy would be cut or limited, they don't tell the truth. Nothing has happened that proves their insinuations."" **********Opposition politicians point to these developments: In its first weeks in office, the Meciar Government renationalized the company that prints all the newspapers in Bratislava, blocked a foreign joint venture that would guarantee the financial security of Smena, the leading independent daily, and told local bankers that the Government intended to raise its ownership share in the banks. **********As for the Hungarians, Mr. Meciar announced in Parliament that any ethnic politicians who roil national tensions would be treated as ""political criminals."" **********In a television interview, Mr. Meciar warned Hungary against interfering in Slovakia's internal affairs, and spoke ominously of purported military preparations on the southern border. **********""We know that the Hungarian Army, and particularly the air force, is, in spite of its lack of money, conducting exercises even at a higher level than NATO pilot training,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean that we think they will attack us, for heaven's sake. But this aggressiveness against other nations does not seem at all right to us."" **********Hungary angrily denied the charge. **********Shortly after winning the election that has propelled Czechoslovakia toward dissolution, Mr. Meciar informed Slovak television of his plans to deliver weekly broadcast speeches. **********Jan Fule, the news director, politely reminded Mr. Meciar that Slovak law allowed the Government such unrestricted access to the airwaves only in emergencies, and suggested instead a weekly program in which the Prime Minister could face questions from journalists. **********""He refused,"" Mr. Fule recalled. ""He said that if questioning was needed his press spokesman would be good enough to do it."" **********For the moment, the result is an impasse, but Mr. Meciar's allies are working on a reorganization of Slovak television that will most likely cost Mr. Fule his job. **********Among the dissidents who helped overthrow Communism in 1989, the fear of the new regime is palpable.  Maria Kanska, a member of the political party that initially led the fight against Communism in Slovakia, said one of the new Government's first acts was to dismiss at least 90 civil servants. Mrs. Kanska, a lawyer, found no takers when she offered free legal defense to anyone willing to file a suit challenging the removal. **********""My friends and I are in the group starting to fear,"" she said. ""I know people who have sold their weekend homes in Slovakia and bought in the Czech lands. My mother took all her savings out of the Slovak banks. 'They Are Panicking' **********""It is very dangerous what Mr. Meciar keeps saying that we must be united. This is not consistent with a democratic society, to have to be united. We know what it means to have to share one opinion."" **********Jan Carnogursky, the previous Prime Minister, whose Christian Democratic Party ran poorly in the recent elections, has little patience for such sentiments, or for the handful of intellectuals planning to leave Slovakia rather than live under Mr. Meciar's Government. **********Switching from English to Slovak in a recent interview, he said, ""They are cowards,"" and then, returning to English, amended that to, ""They are panicking."" **********Mr. Carnogursky, who was repeatedly jailed by the Communists, said ""Even if he would want to, Mr. Meciar will not be able to establish a dictatorial regime."" **********The questions of Slovakia's future, Mr. Carnogursky said, are more subtle. ""Mr. Meciar has a gift for appealing to ordinary people,"" he said. ""He speaks their language, thinks in their terms. It is terms of the last 40 years. It won't be the rehabilitation of Communism, but it will be a return to their way of thinking and speaking."" **********Roman Kovac, Deputy Prime Minister of Slovakia, said in an interview that the opposition complaints were unfounded. The Government reasserted control over the main printing company because a private monopoly in this instance posed more of a threat to democracy than a public one, he said."

Healy, who took over as director of N.I.H. last April. Under Dr. Healy, a 47-year-old cardiologist who served as deputy science adviser to President Reagan, N.I.H. has in recent months retained a small army of high-powered patent firms, challenged the patent claims of the Burroughs Wellcome Company to the AIDS drug AZT and applied for patents on thousands of genetic fragments before knowing what purpose they serve. **********Taken together, the moves have billion-dollar implications. Companies that want to exploit advances unearthed in N.I.H. labs will have to obtain a license from the Government and may have to pay royalties. Companies that get help from N.I.H., as Burroughs Wellcome did in the case of AZT, may find the Government insisting on a part of the rights. **********Dr. Healy makes no apologies. Her goal, she said last week, is not to extract royalties, but to spur commercialization of Federal discoveries by giving companies an assurance of rights to a particular technology. In general, she said, N.I.H. has been eager to award non-exclusive licenses. **********Nevertheless, many scientists and companies have been unnerved by N.I.H.'s move to patent gene fragments isolated through a relatively easy new procedure. The scientists fear that the patents, if issued, will award rights for mechanized work rather than true innovation. **********Notwithstanding an initial burst of controversy last fall after the N.I.H. applied for a patent on several hundred genes, Dr. Healy announced last week that N.I.H. would seek a second patent covering 2,375 additional genes. ""We've had a diversity of opinion about this,"" Dr. Healy acknowledged, adding that the Government is merely trying to keep its options open while it decides long-term policy. **********But don't expect N.I.H. to back down much. ""I think the patent system is the underpinning of commercializing new products,"" Dr. Healy said. ""Seeking patents is a social good."""

Nor do they protect free speech, assembly or association, all of which are restricted in the kingdom. **********The centerpiece of the program was the creation of a Consultative Council that is to confer with and advise the Cabinet and to propose and review laws. The 60 council members, who are to be appointed by the King and serve for a four-year term at his pleasure, are to be named by September. The reforms also established a bill of rights for the first time and revised the way the King is chosen.  Reforms Called 'Empty' **********The study, entitled ""Empty Reforms, Saudi Arabia's New Basic Laws,"" was written by Aziz Abu-Hamad, a Saudi analyst who is a senior researcher at Middle East Watch. It is the first in-depth independent analysis of the reforms announced by Saudi Arabia in March. The changes were prompted by longstanding demands from middle-class businessmen and technocrats who have pressed for modernization of the 60-year-old country, liberalization of its political system and laws, and more political participation in decision-making. **********At the time of the reforms, President Bush applauded them in a letter to King Fahd. Senior American officials, as well as foreign diplomats in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, described the new laws as important steps toward participatory government and recognition of citizens' rights. **********But the reforms, the report says, provide neither for democracy nor elections. Quoting extensively from King Fahd's recent speeches, the monitoring group said the reforms strengthen the King's already near-absolute power and fail to provide for meaningful popular participation in government or for public scrutiny of government decisions. **********A spokesman for the privately financed Middle East Watch said that a copy of the report had been sent for comment to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States, at least two weeks ago, but that no response had been received.  Prince Bandar has been out of the country for several weeks. The Saudi Embassy had no comment.  Law on Home Search Cited **********The study asserts that sections of the new Basic Law of Government, which appear to be liberalizations of previous Saudi policy, are actually restatements of past policy, or so vague as to be meaningless. For instance, Article 37 says: ""Private homes have sanctity. They cannot be entered without permission of the owners or searched except according to law."" **********The report says that for this provision to be meaningful, there must be a law requiring safeguards against arbitrary searches. But it adds, ""There is no requirement under the Imprisonment and Detention Law of 1978, or any other law, that searches are conducted after securing a warrant from a responsible authority."" **********The report also criticizes the lack of a prohibition against torture or the mistreatment of prisoners. ""Despite royal orders instructing detention authorities not to torture prisoners,"" it says, ""there were numerous reports in 1991 of torture in Saudi detention facilities, especially those run by the secret and religious police."" **********It cites a State Department report on human rights for 1991, which says the department has received ""credible reports of injuries and the deaths of at least two, and possibly more, persons caused by beatings or the use of excessive force while being held in official custody."""

Investment earnings nearly doubled, to $48.9 million. Lingering Concern **********But investors appeared to harbor lingering concern about the depth and breadth of Equitable's real estate troubles.

It was the second consecutive day that the stock closed below its initial offering price of $9 a share. **********At the end of June, problem commercial mortgages represented 7.5 percent of Equitable's commercial portfolio, compared with 4.4 percent six months earlier.

Even so, Mr. Hogue said, the company's overall financial performance was ""coming around a little quicker than we thought."" **********The company reported after-tax investment losses in insurance operations, which includes real estate, of $23.6 million, an 86 percent drop from $169.7 million a year earlier. Insurance segments lost $43.7 million in the period, compared with $218.5 million last year.  Total Revenues Rise **********Equitable's total revenues rose 24 percent, to $1.65 billion, from $1.33 billion in the same quarter last year. The second-quarter net loss of $43.5 million represents a 90 percent improvement from last year's second quarter, when the net loss totaled $416.5 million. **********Because the $450 million public offering did not occur until after the close of the second quarter, ""people will be paying more attention to the third quarter,"" said James Ramenda, an analyst at Northington Partners of Avon, Conn., an equity research and investment banking firm specializing in insurance. **********For Equitable, the third quarter should reflect interest earned on the money it raised in the offering. The offering also converted from debt to equity a $1 billion investment made last year by Groupe Axa S.A., the French insurance company."

India, with a population of about 882 million that is growing 2.1 percent a year, is likely to overtake China as the most populous country by 2035, the committee says; India's population may reach 2 billion before leveling off. **********China, with about 1.165 billion people, is likely to stabilize at about 1.5 billion, the group says. **********The world's population is estimated at 5.4 billion. Burdens on the Environment **********The continued growth in India and China contributes to an intensifying crisis in ecological and human resources in large areas of Asia, where land is being rapidly degraded by overuse, water supplies are under strain and agriculture must struggle to stay ahead of soil and water depletion. **********Throughout Asia, there is no longer time to let economic development lead to smaller family size, as happened in industrial nations. Some Asian nations, led by South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, have made significant reductions in population growth through effective family planning. **********""For people who are concerned about problems like global warming, ozone-layer depletion or world poverty, we just have to be vitally interested in the success or failure of the Chinese and Indian programs,"" said Sharon L. Camp, senior vice president of the Population Crisis Committee. **********Copies of the reports are available for $5 each, including postage, from the Population Crisis Committee, 1120 19th Street, Washington, D.C. 20036. India 'Most Critical' **********The studies of China and India conclude that the success of China's much-publicized population-control efforts have been ""exaggerated,"" and that most couples have not one, but two or three children. **********The situation in India is more dire. **********""From a demographic perspective, India may be the world's most critical country,"" the Population Crisis Committee says. Nearly half the illiterate people in the world live in India, where a third of the people suffer from malnutrition. **********The studies -- ""India's Family Planning Challenge: From Rhetoric to Action"" and ""China's Family Planning Program: Challenging the Myths"" -- call for more international assistance to the two countries, and more receptivity in Beijing and New Delhi to outside advice and help.  U.S. Angry With China **********Under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, however, Washington has denied family-planning aid to China because of coercive population-control programs, including forced abortions. **********Under the influence of Republican conservatives, Washington also halted its contributions in 1985 to the United Nations Population Fund, citing its involvement in programs like China's. Washington supplied 20 percent of the fund's resources, and its withdrawal has hobbled the fund's work in both Asia and Africa. **********The United States policy took shape in 1984, just before an international population conference in Mexico City, where Washington took a strong stand against abortion and population control in general. Abortions are used frequently in poor nations to regulate child-bearing. **********Although Congress has been generous in appropriating money for programs in many other countries, and the United States Agency for International Development is a major contributor to family-planning programs worldwide, the policies on China and contributions to international organizations continue. **********The reports on China and India, written by Ms. Camp and Shanti R. Conly, the committee's director of population policy analysis, fault both countries on the limited options available to women seeking contraception. Flawed Technology **********In India, sterilization (mostly of women) accounts for 70 percent of contraception. Because of the near finality of the method and the risks to health from unsterile operations, many women wait until they have had four or more children, Indian experts say. **********In China, an outdated and often risky steel-ring intrauterine device is used by 60 million women, the study says. About 36 percent of women rely on tubal ligation. **********The roots of the problems are different. In India the Government has pledged a renewed effort to slow population growth, but many earlier efforts have been undercut by cultural resistance and a lack of political will. Conversely, in China, the determination of the Government to cut growth drastically led to Draconian measures that also aroused opposition. **********But the Population Crisis Committee study found similarities in the shortcomings of the two nations' programs. **********""Local programs in China and India are typically characterized by poorly trained personnel who lack both the interpersonal skills and technical knowledge necessary to adequately counsel clients on the risks and benefits of contraceptive measures,"" the committee said."

Six people have been killed in the violence this year, and last month a memorial to Jews killed in a Nazi concentration camp at Sachsenhausen was apparently set on fire and destroyed.  'A Challenge for All' **********""Fighting extremist violence is a challenge for political parties, security officials, justice, and all the social groups of our country,"" Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters said. **********Raising the question of whether parties encouraging violence or prejudice against foreigners should be banned, Mr. Seiters called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and said he supported stronger ones to make it easier to arrest those who instigate violence at public demonstrations. **********In an afternoon of debate dominated by anguished self-examination as they wrestled with the problem of growing right-wing violence, many members of Parliament warned of the parallels between the neo-Nazi mobs of today and the Brown Shirts who brought Hitler to power in the 1930's. **********""The fact that violence does not even stop before Jewish institutions and holy places can only be described as a shame against our country -- no, a disgrace,"" Hans-Jochen Vogel of the opposition Social Democratic Party said to general applause. **********""But the need for new laws and instruments seems to me to be less urgent than making effective use of the existing ones,"" he said. ""The Weimar Republic didn't fail because it didn't have laws to preserve itself. It went down because there weren't enough people who would stand up and fight for democracy."" **********Mr. Seiters said a conference of ministers from the German states would meet in Bonn on Friday to discuss legal and other measures, and he promised that the Government would concentrate as much effort on fighting right-wing violence as it had against left-wing terrorism in the 1970's. **********The parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition have also begun moving toward support for a change in the country's unlimited constitutional guarantee of the right of political asylum. Asylum has been claimed by hundreds of thousands of foreigners whose presence in nearly every German city has provided the pretext for the right-wing violence. **********Mr. Seiters has also announced that 1,300 retired civil servants and 200 non-commissioned military officers would be drafted to help the overwhelmed asylum authorities work through the backlog of nearly a quarter of a million asylum applications. Nearly 320,000 asylum-seekers arrived in the first nine months of this year, most of them from Romania and the violence-torn former Yugoslav republics. **********The Social Democrats had called for today's debate, less than a week after commemorations of the day of German unity that had taken place in the shadow of continuing rampages against foreigners. **********The violence reached a peak with a mob attack on a government home for asylum-seekers in the eastern German city of Rostock at the end of August.  The apparent helplessness of the Government to do anything has contributed to an erosion of Mr. Kohl's political authority, and helped radical right-wing parties to make gains in local elections. **********Until recently, there has been more support for doing something to keep more foreigners from flooding into the country than for taking effective measures to stop Germans from attacking them. **********The German Constitution places no limitations on the right of political asylum. In practice, any foreigner arriving on German soil and claiming political asylum is presumed to deserve it and is provided housing and food until an investigation proves otherwise. **********More than 250,000 asylum-seekers arrived last year, overwhelming the investigators who have to decide whether they qualify. It routinely takes two years or longer to complete these investigations, and though only a fraction of those who apply for asylum finally get it, up to now Germans have been inhibited about expelling them. Most Come From Romania **********Last month, Interior Minister Seiters signed an agreement with Romania to make it easier to send back Gypsies, or Roma and Sinti people, as they prefer to be called, who had fled that country.  In September alone, 17,000 asylum-seekers arrived here from Romania, more than from any other country. **********"" 'Human dignity is inviolable,' our Constitution says,"" Dr. Heribert Blens, a member of Mr. Kohl's party, said today. ""That doesn't mean 'German dignity is inviolable.' A Sinti or a Roma from Romania has the same dignity as a German from Rostock."" **********But with refugees from all over Eastern Europe now overflowing the temporary shelters, trailers and even modified shipping containers that have been set up all over the country to house them, many Germans are fed up.  A conservative budget expert, Dietrich Austermann, estimated today that so far it has cost the taxpayers 8 billion marks, or about $5.5 billion, to take care of them. **********With housing at a premium and unemployment at 5.8 percent, some Germans have been willing to look the other way when gangs set out after foreigners with clubs and torches. **********Parliament ended its debate today by unanimously passing a condemnation of ""violence against foreign co-citizens and asylum-seekers, as well as racist and anti-Semitic attacks."""

They do not lose their contents when a computer's power is shut off, unlike dynamic random access memories, the main type of chips now used to store computer data and programs. Could Replace Disk Drives **********Such chips could eventually take the place of disk drives, which are now used for permanent information storage in computers. Flash memories are already catching on in battery-powered hand-held computers because they are smaller and use less power than disk drives. **********Sales for flash memory chips are expected to grow from $200 million this year to $2 billion in 1997, according to Dataquest, a Silicon Valley market research firm. American companies lead in flash memory chips, but most manufacturing is done in Japan. **********Under the terms of a 10-year agreement, National will gain immediate access to the market for flash chips by designing, manufacturing and marketing devices using Toshiba's technology. **********The agreement represents a extension of existing relationships between the two companies, including a technology alliance on logic chips and a cross-licensing agreement. **********""This alliance signals National Semiconductor's thrust toward global partnerships and upscaling technologies,"" Kirk Pond, co-president of National's standard products group, said. The company's stock closed up 25 cents a share yesterday, to $11, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Rajiv Chaudri, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, termed the agreement positive for both National and Toshiba. ""One of the things I have been concerned about for National is the lack of a memory product line,"" he said. ""By making this deal they have definitely filled one of the gaps."" **********Toshiba also benefits, he said, by gaining a major United States chip maker's endorsement of its flash technology, which does not conform to the industry standard. **********The partnership follows a number of flash-memory deals in which American chip makers have linked with Japanese companies. The Sharp Corporation has agreed to make flash chips for the Intel Corporation, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the Fujitsu Corporation announced a $700 million joint development and manufacturing program in July. **********In June, Toshiba agreed to supply flash technology to the International Business Machines Corporation, with I.B.M. providing the technology for a type of controller chip."

The deficit, it seems, has been demoted from impending crisis to nagging worry, one ranking somewhere between the population explosion and failure to floss. **********Were the economists, in fact, just a bunch of Chicken Littles? Can Washington indefinitely spend $5 for every $4 it collects? **********Most analysts now agree that the much-feared ""hard landing"" -- in which the dollar collapsed and Washington was forced to auction off Yellowstone Park -- was never a remotely probable consequence of big deficits. Most would agree, moreover, that one dollar of deficit is not equal to every other. **********The composition of spending matters -- borrowing a dollar to build a new road is far less problematic than borrowing a dollar to finance a pension. So does the timing: deficit finance exacts little or no cost when the economy is in recession and there is plenty of unused productive capacity. **********But mainstream economists would still argue that chronic deficit financing has enormous impact: the failure to tax more or spend less in this decade, they say, virtually guarantees lower living standards in the next. And while some would concede that Americans are not morally obliged to sacrifice the good life in order to guarantee a better one for the next generation, there is little reason to believe this momentous choice is being made by an electorate with its eyes open. Chronic deficits, concludes Richard Cooper of Harvard, are just ""the accidental result of political impasse."" **********Hardly anybody in the Reagan Administration expected the big deficits, a product of the humongous tax cuts of 1982, to endure. Conventionally minded analysts, notably Budget Director David Stockman, assumed that Washington would be forced to slash spending to bring the budget into balance. And unconventional supply-siders thought the economy would grow the budget into the black, as lower tax rates unleashed a surge of savings, investment and tax revenue. **********But rising Federal spending was not checked, and visions of supply side nirvana went unfulfilled. More surprising, perhaps, Uncle Sam's borrowing never drove up interest rates in the 1980's, and thus never forced business to cut back on investment. Asians, Europeans and Latin Americans proved willing and able to fill the savings plate that would otherwise have been picked clean by the U.S. Treasury. **********This unexpected turn of events stimulated an orgy of revisionism. Supply siders made much of the fact that Japan, too, ran chronic deficits, and still managed to double output every decade or so. Some liberal economists, notably Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, argued that the deficit was a statistical mirage -- that the U.S. Government should be no more obliged to balance its cash budget than a corporation that finances its growth through borrowing. **********But the revisionists have not made much intellectual headway among the mainstreamers. The heart of the matter, they say, is still the adequacy of national savings and investment. **********The Japanese Government can afford to spend more than it takes in, they point out, because corporations and individuals save more than enough to finance ambitious levels of private investment. America did get away with big deficits in the 1980's without a credit crunch. And as long as the economy is chugging along at half speed, an extra dollar of Government consumption need not crowd out a dollar of private investment. **********But eventually, the mainstreamers argue, the economy will recover, and eventually foreign savers will want their money back. Then, the chickens must come home to roost in the form of slow or no growth in American living standards. **********By the same token, Mr. Eisner may be correct that a proper accounting would show Uncle Sam invests as much as he borrows. But Robert Solow of M.I.T. contends that the revision is not relevant to the question at hand: What matters, he says, is that Uncle is consuming far more than he did before the tax cuts, and has thus contributed to the overall decline in national savings. **********Perhaps the choice is conscious; perhaps Americans are prepared to accept the trade of more consumption today for less in the long term. Mr. Solow scoffs at the suggestion. There is not a shred of evidence, he argues, to show that the Americans raised in the rapid growth era of the 1950's and 60's would willingly settle for anything less for their children. **********Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, goes further. America, he argues, is a heterogeneous nation united by a common dream of economic mobility. But if the pie stops expanding, the success of some will only come at the expense of others -- a sure recipe for bitter conflict. ""We require rapid growth,"" he concludes, ""to maintain social stability."""

Mr. Bao is not a student firebrand or worker organizer, but a 59-year-old member of Communist Party Central Committee who until 1989 was the political secretary to the Standing Committee of the Politburo. **********A lean, bespectacled man, Mr. Bao is by far the highest official to have been jailed in connection with the 1989 upheavals. As the right-hand man of Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party leader, Mr. Bao was an ardent proponent of political change, and he had a quiet but crucial effect on the nation's domestic and international policy. **********On Jan. 15, Mr. Bao was told that he was formally arrested, a procedure that usually signifies a trial will begin within a few months. That same afternoon his family was also notified of the arrest, according to three Chinese familiar with the case. He is accused of leaking state secrets and of spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda. **********The formal arrest, after Mr. Bao had been in detention for more than two years and seven months, suggests that the Government has decided how to dispose of the case. But while the leadership will almost certainly advise the court what sentence to impose, it is still unclear what the penalty will be. **********The complication is that Mr. Bao is not behaving the way Chinese prisoners are supposed to, not even the way Chinese leaders are supposed to. Normally, purged leaders -- like Deng Xiaoping in the past -- issue self-criticisms to win clemency, and then try to claw their way back to power. But Mr. Bao is refusing to acknowledge any guilt, according to two Chinese with firsthand knowledge of the case. **********""I haven't done anything wrong,"" one of the Chinese quoted Mr. Bao as saying. ""I haven't violated the law nor breached party discipline. So what is there to include in a self-criticism?"" **********On Jan. 20, his wife, Jiang Zongcao, along with his son and daughter, issued a bold and critical letter to top party, Government and judicial officials. They demanded an explanation for what they described as the unlawful detention of Mr. Bao, and called for an investigation into whether the authorities had abused their power. **********""This whole unusual process of first detaining the person and then gathering materials and determining the crime can't help but make one suspect that this is a frame-up,"" the family's letter said. **********Mr. Bao was summoned on May 28, 1989, supposedly to meet with the Standing Committee of the Politburo. Instead, on Politburo orders, he was incarcerated in a part of Qincheng Prison that was euphemistically called the ""guest house."" He was fed fairly well, allowed family visits once every month or two, and could receive clothing and food. Still, his white blood cell count has fallen to about 2,000, well below normal levels of 5,000 to 10,000. But the cause of this condition was not immediately clear. **********Despite rumors that he had been moved, he was never allowed out of Qincheng Prison, according to the Chinese familiar with the case. While in Qincheng, officials from the Organization Department repeatedly interrogated Mr. Bao about Mr. Zhao, apparently in an attempt to get evidence against the former party leader. **********The case of Mr. Zhao, who still is mostly confined to his house and has not been allowed to receive guests, has been handled as a party matter rather than as a criminal investigation. The results of the investigation have not yet been publicized, but many Chinese believe that it is unlikely Mr. Zhao will be severely punished. **********After his formal arrest last month, Mr. Bao was moved from the ""guest house"" to Qincheng's No. 1 Lockup for prisoners awaiting trial. Newly sent clothing was returned to his family, and he was refused permission to see family members during the Chinese New Year holiday a few days ago."

Chief Orders Investigation Of Statements in Iraq Bank Case,C.I.A. Chief Orders Investigation Of Statements in Iraq Bank Case," **********The head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Robert M. Gates, ordered its inspector general today to investigate the agency's misleading and incomplete statements to the Justice Department and a Federal judge about a bank fraud case involving billions of dollars in loans to Iraq. **********The internal investigation is the first to be publicly ordered by Mr. Gates since he took over as the Director of Central Intelligence nearly a year ago. It serves as an acknowledgment of a politically embarrassing error by the agency on an issue that is dogging President Bush's re-election campaign: the Administration's embrace of Saddam Hussein in the years before Iraq invaded Kuwait. **********The C.I.A.'s public admission of error and promise to investigate was not spontaneous. It came only after Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Tuesday that the C.I.A. had misled the Justice Department, a Federal court in Atlanta and Congress. **********For months, some Democratic members of the House, led by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, have charged that the C.I.A. has deliberately concealed information about the case as part of a cover-up, a charge that President Bush, the Justice Department and prosecutors in the case have repeatedly denied. **********Now the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is staunchly supportive of American intelligence agencies, has stepped forcefully into the debate, adding weight to the charges. Senator Boren and his Republican vice-chairman, Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, have sent a series of letters to Mr. Gates since June demanding more information on what the C.I.A. knew about the bank scandal. **********Senator Boren said today that he suspects the main culprit in the matter is not the C.I.A. but the Justice Department. In an interview, he said he is not ruling out the possibility of a cover-up. Senator Voices Suspicion **********""When you have inaccurate, inadequate, less-than-complete information being presented to a prosecutor and a judge in a case of this importance, you have to ask why,"" he said. ""Perhaps an even more important question to be asked is whether or not the intelligence community was in any way being manipulated by the Department of Justice or others in the Government during this period. I don't like the smell of the whole thing."" **********The case involves charges against Christopher P. Drogoul, a banker accused of extending billions of dollars in loans and credits to Iraq from the Atlanta branch of a Rome-based bank, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, in violation of the bank's regulations. **********Mr. Drogoul, who headed the Atlanta branch, pleaded guilty to the charges and admitted that he acted alone, and the Government's case is based on the premise that he defrauded the Rome bank. But he later moved to retract the guilty plea, and intelligence reports and the statements of some bank officials indicate that officials in Rome had some knowledge of the fraud scheme and may have approved it. **********It is not clear whether the agency's disclosures had an impact on the decision of prosecutors to allow Mr. Drogoul to withdraw his guilty plea last week and allow the case to go to trial. In a trial setting, the prosecution can prevent the introduction of classified information from being used in the case. **********At issue for the C.I.A. are two separate questions about its willingness to be forthcoming in the bank case. One is a Sept. 17 letter to the Atlanta prosecutors -- later released publicly -- stating that the C.I.A. had no independent secret information about the case when actually the C.I.A. had already received several classified reports about it. **********The other is the C.I.A.'s disclosure that it has recently found new intelligence reports about the activities of the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, calling into question its claims that it cooperated fully with the prosecution during its three-year investigation. **********But there is a larger issue involving the Justice Department. A number of the C.I.A. reports in late 1989 indicating that bank officials in Rome knew of the fraudulent loans were distributed immediately to the representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others in the American Embassy in Rome. That meant that the Justice Department should have known of intelligence reports about Rome's involvement as early as 1989. Complicity Was Ruled Out **********The issue of whether the Rome headquarters was involved was a major irritant in United States-Italian relations, and the Justice Department eventually concluded that Mr. Drogoul acted without the knowledge and complicity of his superiors. **********The C.I.A.'s internal review is particularly embarrassing for Mr. Gates because one of his first acts as director was to organize an agency task force that was designed in part to improve C.I.A. reporting to other agencies of government on possible criminal activity. He created the task force after admitting during his confirmation hearings last year that the agency had made mistakes in disseminating information to Government agencies about a different scandal, this one involving the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. **********The C.I.A. has denied that the agency purposely withheld information, but acknowledged that mistakes were made. Elizabeth Rindskopf, the chief lawyer for the C.I.A., called the flawed report ""an honest mistake that was certainly regrettable."" She said the C.I.A.'s failure to uncover all classified reports relating to the case was the result of on an inadequate filing system.  A Three-Year Delay **********Last week, in response to one of the Boren-Murkowski letters, the C.I.A. said it had uncovered reports written by the C.I.A.'s station chief in Rome in November 1989 stating that officials in the Rome headquarters of Banco Lavoro knew of the fraudulent loans.

But whenever Lufthansa has hinted that it would like to fly Americans around the United States on American-made aircraft operated by American pilots, the company has been no more welcome than a snowstorm in Miami. **********There are explanations for this apparent contradiction. For one thing, it's the law. The Civil Aviation Act of 1938 prohibits foreign control of a United States airline. For another, it makes for a plausible bargaining strategy: Investment rights remain a useful chip in Washington's sometime effort to increase global airline competition. **********But Clark Onstad, a Washington lawyer and consultant to airlines who was a senior aviation official in the Carter Administration, thinks the time is ripe to make an exception. What is more, he is sure that President Bush has the legal authority to do it without Congressional approval. **********The case for foreign ownership, Mr. Onstad argues, is as plain as the red ink dribbling off the airline industry's balance sheets. Three carriers (Eastern, Pan Am, Midway) met their maker last year. Three others (Continental, America West, T.W.A.) are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And two giants (Northwest, USAir) are vacuuming the seats for loose change. Only three major carriers -- American, United and Delta -- seem certain to weather the recessionary storms. **********Fresh capital from abroad could not transform an ugly duckling into a high-flying swan. But Mr. Onstad contends that well-placed investments could see cash-starved carriers through next winter, giving them a fair chance to prove their mettle in the post-recession economy. **********Of course, this capital need not come from foreign airlines. But they are the likeliest deep pockets because they want what even bankrupt American carriers have to offer -- access to the world's largest national market. **********Foreign carriers already have the right to buy minority stakes in United States airlines. And several have: KLM owns stock in Northwest, S.A.S. in Continental, Ansett in America West, J.A.L. in Hawaiian. But under the Department of Transportation's interpretation of the law, foreign companies are not permitted to own enough to assert control over key airline policies -- everything from pricing to routes to aircraft selection. **********Mr. Onstad argues that this interpretation of the statute is unnecessarily restrictive. The law specifies that an airline's president and two-thirds of the directors be American citizens, and that no more than 25 percent of voting stock be in foreign hands. But he believes that the Administration could allow foreigners to own preferred stock that gave them veto power over all material decisions, save those affecting United States security interests. **********The Transportation Department has never given anyone a reason to believe it would entertain such a deal. Indeed, the department held up a far less radical proposal for an alliance between Northwest and the Dutch airline KLM before caving in to pressure from free-market types in the White House. Why might the regulators change now? **********Foreign carriers have recently made it very, very clear that they would not open their purses simply to buy good will. Just after the Persian Gulf war, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner reportedly tried and failed to persuade the Japanese carrier J.A.L. to buy a passive interest in a distressed United States airline. **********Perhaps more important, the political stakes have grown. Three carriers including one of the biggest, Continental, are flying today at the sufferance of their creditors. And the fare war touched off by American Airlines' price restructuring last month is going to make it very difficult for them to amass enough cash during the summer season to make it through next winter. **********Presumably, any airline liquidation would embarrass officials charged with shielding airline deregulation from vocal Congressional critics. But an election-year liquidation of Continental, the largest employer in George Bush's hometown of Houston, or America West, a major economic force in the Republican stronghold of Phoenix, would be an embarrassment indeed. **********If the Administration chose to give the green light to a salvage job by a Lufthansa or a British Airways or a Singapore Airlines, there is little chance it could be thwarted by competitors or the distressed carrier's labor unions. Federal courts have proved very reluctant to second-guess regulators who buttress their decisions with even a shred of logic. The trickier tactical question is how to avoid a precedent that would weaken the bargaining leverage for, say, United to negotiate its entry into Europe's domestic airline markets. **********But there is one clean place to draw the line: bankruptcy. Foreigners willing to revitalize a failing carrier might be welcomed. Those who simply sought competitive advantage in America would have to wait for their own governments to open their home markets."

That accord may open the way to resolving other disputes, they said. **********With heads of state and government due to start arriving here on Thursday, negotiators are under intense pressure to complete the package of new environmental measures. Their leaders hope to sign the accords at the conclusion of the Earth Summit this weekend. Statement of Principles **********Those measures include a statement setting out the broad principles that should guide the world as its tries to avoid exhausting environmental resources yet sustain economic growth. The leaders also plan to adopt a more detailed action plan, known as Agenda 21, that outlines steps for achieving that goal in every environmental sector and provides for the North to help pay the extra costs that such safeguards will entail in the developing world. **********The United States is also pushing hard for a declaration on principles countries should follow to save the world's diminishing forests. The measure would be nonbinding, but would commit the nations to negotiating a binding convention on the issue later on. **********New conventions on curbing emissions of climate-changing gases and on preserving rare plants and animals have already been prepared for signature by the leaders attending the gathering, which is described as the biggest conference of governments ever held. Organizer Is 'Encouraged' **********At a news conference late this afternoon, the summit meeting's organizer, Maurice Strong of Canada, said he was ""very encouraged at the progress being made"" in the aid talks. ""Outstanding issues are not going to override the tremendous desire to suceed,"" he said. **********Other diplomats appeared more optimistic than they had been a day or so ago, when the gap between North and South seemed formidably large. The American Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Agriculture Affairs, Michael Young, said that ""things are falling into place."" **********Industrialized countries have been resisting third world demands that they enter into a binding new commitment to raise the volume of their assistance to 0.7 percent of their economic output by the year 2000. Their contributions currently average about 0.45 percent. **********The United States is outside the debate because it has never accepted the 0.7 percent target. Other industrialized nations endorsed that goal some 20 years ago but have never achieved it as a group. **********Diplomats say the ministers will try to reach agreement on a vaguer commitment by Western Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to reach the target of 0.7 percent ""as soon as possible"" or ""by the year 2000 or as soon as possible thereafter."" Concrete Aid Commitments **********To win the support of the developing world for this compromise, the industrialized countries are making a series of specific and immediate new aid commitments, diplomats said. **********The 12 European Community countries are discussing a plan to offer $3 billion to $5 billion in environmental aid over the next five years. This would involve rolling over some existing aid projects into a single community-wide package but would also include new money, officials said. **********Japan plans to increase its environmental aid to developing countries from $2.3 billion for the three-year period from 1989 through 1991 to $7 billion over the next five years. That would mean an increase from about $800 million a year to $1.4 billion a year. **********The United States and other donors are considering creating a new fund for the World Bank's International Development Agency next year that would provide virtually free environmental loans to the world's poorest nations. **********They are also expected to agree to double, or perhaps triple, the $1.3 billion Global Environment Facility they established at the World Bank three years ago to finance third world environmental projects. That financing comes up for renewal next year. **********Finally, heads of state and government from the industrialized world are expected to commit themselves to increasing the flow of aid when they address the Earth Summit at the end of the week, though it is unclear whether they will pledge specific amounts. **********Ministers attending the meeting on Thursday will also seek a compromise on a plan strongly supported by the United States to adopt a set of principles on forest preservation, including a commitment to negotiate a binding convention. **********In an effort to win African support for a strong statement on principles and a commitment to such a binding convention, the United States agreed today to support African countries in seeking another international convention to fight the creeping encroachment of the desert on their continent. **********Officials say the summit participants are likely to call on the United Nations General Assembly to set up a negotiating body to complete a convention on the desert by June 1994. Several Fighting Forest Pact **********Several countries with extensive forests, led by Malaysia but including India and Brazil, are opposed to the declaration of principles on forests and want to weaken it as much as possible. **********Finally, the ministers will try to deal with an effort by Saudi Arabia and other big oil producers to weaken proposed pledges on conserving energy. **********The Saudis argue that these pledges are unnecessary now that the nations have agreed to a convention on the climate that would require countries to curb their emissions of carbon dioxide and other warming gases generated by the burning of fossil fuels."

Once hailed as the next Intel Corporation for its advanced designs, MIPS has suffered from inconsistent profits and employee defections, including the departure last month of the company's president, Charles M. Boesenberg. **********Customers have been departing as well. Prime Computer and Groupe Bull of France recently stopped making computers based on MIPS chips.  And Digital Equipment, MIPS's largest customer, has said it will begin producing a competing microprocessor of its own. **********Silicon Graphics is so dependent on the MIPS microprocessor that it has already gone so far as to develop its own version of the chip, and was reported to be in talks with Toshiba of Japan about manufacturing it. **********""I think S.G.I. did the right thing, and they probably didn't have much choice,"" said Mark Stahlman, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons. **********""This is S.G.I.'s coming-out party."" he said. ""This is a company that's serious about being in the work-station business. To do that, they have no choice but to gain control of a microprocessor."" **********But he added that the deal would hurt Silicon Graphics' stock in the short term. And some competitors say the company will now find itself in the difficult position of trying to sell chips to rival computer makers. **********Silicon Graphics shares closed today at $21.875, down $4.75, on the New York Stock Exchange, reflecting analysts' concerns that the deal will dilute the value of the company's stock. **********Because of its recent repurchase of shares from the Compaq Computer Corporation after their joint venture dissolved, Silicon Graphics said today that it would have to reissue between 3.9 million and 5.4 million common shares to complete the MIPS merger without paying cash. Under the merger agreement, MIPS investors will receive 0.61 share of Silicon Graphics' common stock for each of MIPS's 25 million shares. **********MIPS's shares closed at $13.50, up $2.50, in over-the-counter trading. **********Long employed to design everything from buildings to automobiles, airplanes and drug molecules, Silicon Graphics machines have also found a growing market in audio and movie production, including the creation of the liquid-metal cyborg in the film ""Terminator 2."" **********MIPS is a leader in the technology known as RISC, for reduced instruction-set computing, a technique that makes computations faster by relegating more tasks to the software.  The company trails only Sun Microsystems in the number of computer makers using its RISC microprocessor designs. MIPS's Unusual Structure **********Customers and analysts respect MIPS's technology, but have never been comfortable with the company's unusual business structure. MIPS designs microprocessors that other companies manufacture and sell, paying MIPS royalties. Computer makers who use these chips pay MIPS one-time licensing fees. MIPS also makes computers using these chips that are sold by other companies under their own names, although this line of business has never made a profit. **********The chip-design business was what attracted Silicon Graphics to MIPS. ""Buying MIPS for its systems business would be crazy, but the technology is world class,"" said Edward R. McCracken, Silicon Graphics' president and chief executive. **********After the merger's expected completion by the end of June, MIPS -- to be renamed MIPS Technologies Inc.  -- will be established as a wholly owned subsidiary of Silicon Graphics to further the development of MIPS's microprocessor business. **********The unit will be headed by Robert C. Miller, MIPS's chairman, president and chief executive, who will also join the parent company's board. MIPS's computer systems business will be folded into Silicon Graphics, with redundant product models eliminated. **********With revenues of about $1 billion, the merged companies ""will have the wherewithal to continue MIPS's drive to make our architecture a standard,"" Mr. Miller said. Attempting to Calm Competitors **********Mr. Miller and Mr. McCracken said that word of the merger had been well received by the key members of ACE, the Advanced Computing Environment consortium that includes Microsoft, Digital Equipment and Compaq. MIPS's microprocessor is the only RISC chip endorsed by ACE. Structuring the merger to make MIPS Technologies a separate entity, Mr. Miller said, will ease computer makers' concerns that they are buying their key component, the microprocessor, from a competitor. **********He also noted that the competing microprocessors in the market are owned by computer makers, including I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and Sun. **********But Willem Roelandts, who heads Hewlett-Packard's work-station business, said Silicon Graphics would indeed be competing with its own customers. He said he doubted that Silicon Graphics had the money to keep up with the pace of microprocessor development, any more than MIPS did. ""It's just going to drag Silicon Graphics down with them,"" he said.  Close, but Uneasy, Relationship **********The close relationship between Silicon Graphics and MIPS dates to the early 1980's, when the founders of both companies were all professors at Stanford University. Silicon Graphics was the first customer for MIPS's chip designs. **********But the relationship has often been uneasy, with Silicon Graphics' chairman and founder, James Clark, publicly critical of MIPS's move into the computer manufacturing business. **********""The big difference between the two companies is that S.G.I. always had a strong focus on a system that met a specific user's needs,"" said Michael Slater, publisher of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ""MIPS has struggled to define what it is and why it exists."""

Morgenthau, the District Attorney for Manhattan, offered another view: that since June 1985 Cascade was not a business at all but rather a ""criminal enterprise"" engaged in defrauding investors and creditors of millions of dollars. Also Charged With Larceny **********Two former top officers of Cascade -- its chairman, Victor G. Incendy, who disappeared a year ago and is still missing, and its president, John T. Sirmans, a Boca Raton resident -- were indicted on charges that they violated the Organized Crime Control Act, New York State's anti-racketeering law. They were further charged with grand larceny in the possible defrauding of the Bank of Scotland of at least $10 million. The charges carry mandatory jail terms of up to 25 years and stiff financial penalties. **********At an arraignment yesterday before Acting Justice Brenda Soloff in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Sirmans pleaded not guilty and was released on bail, according to his lawyer, Howard D. Stave of Forest Hills, Queens. Mr. Incendy disappeared last Nov. 19, just before a meeting with Wall Street analysts. **********""Just a few years ago, Cascade International was touted as one of the hottest growth stocks in the over-the-counter market,"" Mr. Morgenthau said yesterday. ""All along, it really was a large-scale criminal fraud."" **********The indictment charges that Mr. Incendy, who took control of Cascade in June 1985, and Mr. Sirmans, who joined the company in 1986, filed false documents with securities regulators, provided phony ledgers to bankers to obtain loans, and misled investors in a private stock sale in February 1991. Bernard Levy, a New York accountant who audited the company's books, was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. **********Cascade filed for bankruptcy last December and is being liquidated to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Its stock, which traded for more than $11 a share in July 1991, plunged to $2.50 a share after Mr. Incendy disappeared, when trading was suspended. **********Yesterday's action by Mr. Morgenthau does not preclude Federal authorities in Florida from proceeding separately against Cascade and its former officers. In addition, investors have filed a class action suit against the company and its officers and professional advisers, including its former general counsel, Aaron Karp, a lawyer in New York."

'La Marseillaise' Is Besieged,Aux Barricades! 'La Marseillaise' Is Besieged," **********Exactly 200 years after France's stirringly revolutionary national anthem was composed, ""les enfants de la patrie"" are once again being called to arms -- this time to defend ""La Marseillaise"" against an attack by political correctness. **********The offensive has taken the form of a campaign to replace the anthem's most bloodthirsty lyrics with more brotherly phrases to demonstrate that French patriots no longer dream of spilling the ""tainted blood"" of foreigners. Instead, the new message would be kinder and gentler. **********But while more than 100 prominent citizens, including France's First Lady, Danielle Mitterrand, have endorsed the campaign, the response of traditionalists has been swift. This week, a Committee for the Defense of the Marseillaise was formed to the cry of ""Hands off our national anthem!"" **********""We should not touch it,"" Georges Suffert wrote in a signed editorial in Le Figaro on Tuesday. ""It is part of our history. We should not meddle with the past. It was a Soviet speciality to change the accounts of former times according to their mood. 'The Mar seillaise' is what it is."" **********The idea of softening the lyrics was first raised three years ago by Abbott Pierre, a much-admired defender of human rights, but it only gathered momentum after a 10-year-old girl, Severine Dupelloux, sang the anthem at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Albertville on Feb. 8. **********Suddenly, the contrast between the innocence of her unaccompanied voice and the ferocity of the words -- subtitled for the benefit of foreign television viewers -- seemed too much. ""How can one call out 'To Arms!' in an Olympic Stadium?"" Charles Ferauge, a retired fire department general, asked. **********In an article in Le Figaro, Mr. Ferauge described research by a former fireman, Armand Thuair, who had studied 175 national anthems and had reached the conclusion that ""France today is the only country in the world to have adopted and preserved a bellicose anthem."" Alternative Text **********He also quoted an alternative text written by Mr. Thuair in which ""To arms, O citizens"" becomes ""Together, O citizens"" and the anthem's aim goes from mobilizing the nation to fight a treacherous enemy intent on slaughtering ""sons, wives and kin"" to singing for liberty and silencing cannons. **********The Committee for a Marseillaise of Fraternity, which counts singers, industrialists and politicians as well as Mrs. Mitterrand among its sponsors, has in turn proposed a competition to come up with ""a text in harmony with the republican spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity and with the universal desire for peace."" **********The committee particularly wants the reference to ""tainted blood"" removed because, with xenophobic sentiments on the rise in France, it seems to play into the hands of the National Front, the ultra-rightist party that has called for the expulsion of third world immigrants. **********The debate is timely because April 24 marks the 200th anniversary of the night when Capt. Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle wrote the music and lyrics of what he first called ""The War Hymn of the Army of the Rhine"" to inspire French troops under siege by Prussian soldiers in Strasbourg. **********It immediately caught on and was given its present name after soldiers from Marseilles sang it on their march to Paris three months later. In 1795, it was adopted as the national anthem and, while it was abandoned for much of the 19th century, it was enshrined in the Constitution in 1879. **********Since then, its melody has become enormously popular around the world, at times even sung to different lyrics by foreign political movements. **********While a poll in the Roman Catholic weekly, Le Pelerin, said 40 percent of those questioned agreed that the anthem's lyrics are indeed bloody, only 25 percent wanted a constitutional amendment to approve a new text. And that has encouraged opponents of any change. **********""It's part of our national heritage,"" said Robert Panraud, a former Security Minister who heads the Committee for the Defense of the Marseillaise. ""It's like the monarchy in Britain: a bit out of date, perhaps, but important for national unity. Changing it would only create divisions in society."" 'Like Old Furniture' **********A former Defense Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, said the anthem was ""a symbol of the nation and the republic, indispensable in the formation of the citizen."" Michel Tournier, a writer, conceded that the anthem ""is ridiculous but we should leave it alone because, like old furniture, it gains in value over the years."" Germany Knows the Problem **********In Le Figaro, Mr. Suffert said that not even the Germans -- the targets of Captain Rouget de Lisle's patriotic fervor in 1792 -- object to the lyrics. ""They have long grown accustomed to our 'Marseillaise,' "" he wrote. **********Germany, though, is all too aware that national anthems can be misconstrued by foreigners. After World War II, it dropped the first verse of its ""Deutschlandlied,"" which starts with the words, ""Germany, Germany above everything, above everything in the world"" and goes on to describe the nation as stretching from the River Maas -- now in the Netherlands -- to the River Memel -- now in Lithuania. **********The second verse, which waxes poetic about German wine, women and song, was considered inappropriate for a national anthem, so the final verse was chosen, calling for ""unity, justice and freedom for the German fatherland."" Abroad, though, the Haydn melody is still immediately recognized by its first four words, ""Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles."" **********Of late, though, only the Soviet national anthem has completely disappeared, replaced by the anthems of its former republics. With the republics appearing as a unified team at the Albertville Winter Olympics and the European Indoors Athletics Championship, the compromise was to play the Olympic anthem when its competitors won gold medals."

Affairs, plans to hold hearings on this issue on Oct. 15 and 16 but has not decided how much will be public, Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the committee chairman, said in an interview on Tuesday. The committee has been holding closed intelligence briefings on the issue, and many once-classified Government documents have been made public. **********""There are some people saying these should be closed,"" Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said of the hearings next week. ""My general approach to government is: If in doubt, have it out in the open."" Many officials are reluctant to risk discussion of intelligence-gathering methods in public. **********The photographs under investigation, analyzed in newly released Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency documents, seemed to show letters or symbols marked on the ground or incorporated in building markings. The signs appear to match those that service personnel were told to use to identify their locations in captivity. **********Some analysts concede the possibility that the symbols could be military code, but say they have no evidence that Americans created them. Vietnam has insisted since 1973 that all American prisoners of war, including those in Laos, were returned that year. **********The two most compelling cases of apparent messages involve markings spotted on the roof of the Dong Mang prison camp, near Cam Pha in northern Vietnam, in May 1976, and the letters ""USA"" and possibly ""K"" -- an assigned code -- seen on a ricefield near Sam Neua, Laos, in 1988. **********The C.I.A. analyzed the Dong Mang report in July 1976 and concluded, ""We were unable to find any conclusive evidence that this prison might contain American P.O.W.'s."" **********Photographs apparently showed a pattern worked into roof coverings during repair work. One of the symbols appeared to be ""K"" in Morse code; others, less clear, may have read ""NT"" and ""TA."" Analysts have not explained what those letters might mean. **********In the Laotian ricefield, a January 1988 photo picked up ""USA"" in 11-foot-tall letters over an area where it had not been the previous autumn and would not be the following spring. The ""K"" seemed an older marking. **********""Paddies in this area are generally harvested in October or November and are allowed to remain fallow until planting season in February or March,"" a Government report said in December 1988. ""It is likely that the symbol was made after the 1987 harvest, but before the paddy was replowed and flooded for the 1988 planting."" **********Missing Americans were known to have disappeared in the area. But American-backed anti-Government Laotians also operated there, and United States officials in Southeast Asia suspect that the letters could have been dug into the ground by the rebels, some of whom have close ties with Americans who have been active in the P.O.W.-M.I.A issue. **********Some of those Americans are veterans who may have known the location codes, leading some analysts to say that both the Americans and the rebels might want to embarrass the Communist Government of Laos and publicize the issue in the United States. **********Today, the committee released closed-door testimony given on July 1 by Ross Perot, the Texas businessman and candidate for President. A large part related to his trips to Vietnam and Laos in 1969 and 1970. **********Mr. Perot told the committee counsel that on several occasions between 1969 and 1987, he had discussed possible trades of money or equipment for prisoners. Once, in 1970, Mr. Perot said, the North Vietnamese Ambassador in Laos offered to release prisoners in return for medical equipment. **********Mr. Perot also said in July and in public testimony in August that he had met several times with a Communist Pathet Lao official who, he said, acknowledged holding prisoners."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/30/business/markets-surge-as-the-fed-prepares-to-discuss-rates.html,Steven Greenhouse,1992-06-30,,1132,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Markets Surge as the Fed Prepares to Discuss Rates,Markets Surge as the Fed Prepares to Discuss Rates," **********Financial markets surged today on the eve of a Federal Reserve Board meeting as investors bet that the Fed would soon reduce interest rates -- just as President Bush called for last week. **********But many Fed watchers said Mr. Bush's call for lower rates could end up delaying a rate cut because the Fed cannot be seen as bowing to political pressure. They say a Fed that is viewed as responding to the White House might lead investors to question the central bank's commitment to fighting inflation. That could push up the long-term rates that are crucial to home-building and capital investment, defeating efforts to help the economy by lowering rates. **********Even so, the financial community was looking hopefully today to the Fed and its key meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Wall Street, the stock market posted its sharpest gains since early May in a rally that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 37.45 points, to 3,319.86. In the credit markets, short-term interest rates fell to their lowest level in more than two decades.  [ Pages D8 and D16. ] **********Many Fed watchers think that some recent weak economic reports -- including one today -- have heightened the chances of a rate cut. The Government reported today an unexpected 5.6 percent decline in sales of new homes in May, while the April figures were revised from a gain to a 2.7 percent decline. **********Last week, economists were surprised when the Government reported a 2.4 percent decline in May for sales of cars, refrigerators and other durable goods. In addition, retail sales and personal income have shown anemic growth in recent reports. **********""The economy is in a kind of modest recovery, but it's not the kind of recovery that I would like to live with,"" said Stephen Axilrod, a longtime economist for the Fed who is vice chairman of Nikko Securities. ""It needs a little more bolstering, and particularly it needs some bolstering in the housing area, which is critical to recovery."" **********But even if the Fed agrees, it will have a harder time acting now, some economists said. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's main policy-making group, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, comprises the Fed's seven governors and the five presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks. **********The Fed's governors are said to be more split than usual going into this week's meeting. As a result, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, might be not only the helmsman but also a swing vote. **********David M. Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities house, said the three Bush appointees -- Lawrence D. Lindsey, Susan Phillips and David W. Mullins Jr. -- were leaning toward a rate cut. He said the Reagan appointees -- Wayne D. Angell, Edward W. Kelley Jr. and John P. LaWare -- had indicated in recent weeks that they were satisfied that growth was taking hold and no further cuts were needed. Fed watchers say there are also divisions among the branch bank presidents on the Open Market Committee. **********Many economists say that rather than heed political pressures or pull out his hair over the meaning of the latest money-supply figures, Mr. Greenspan might do what he has often done before: let economic statistics steer him. **********""I think the Fed will weigh heavily this Thursday's employment and unemployment numbers,"" said Henry Kaufman, head of a New York economics consulting firm, noting that the May numbers were disappointing. **********""If there should be further weakness in the unemployment situation, I think they will respond with a lowering of the Federal funds rate, and there is an even chance if the employment numbers are weak, even a modest reduction of the discount rate."" **********Mr. Kaufman, who supports a rate cut, called the President's remarks ""unfortunate."" ""The central bank tries to display its impartiality,"" he noted, and what Mr. Bush said ""reduces the chances of a central bank response."" **********Other economists agreed. ""Bush's statement makes the situation much more difficult for the Fed to move,"" Mr. Jones said. **********He added: ""If a President in an election year, who is looking bad in the polls, tells you to ease, and you ease immediately, then you will be perceived as easing for political purposes. Then long-term bondholders might give up on the Fed as a credible inflation fighter, and that might push up long-term rates.""  Not everyone agrees that the Fed should cut rates now. Some economists -- including some Fed governors -- argue that the recovery has taken hold and no further stimulus is needed. They fear that further easing could send inflation out of control once the economy picks up. **********Some economists say the recent weak economic numbers should be discounted somewhat, arguing that they look weak mainly because the first-quarter housing and retail spending numbers were so strong, buoyed by mild winter weather. **********The Fed has lowered the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge on overnight loans to one another -- to 3.75 percent from almost 10 percent three years ago. The discount rate, the rate at which the Fed makes loans to banks, is 3.5 percent, down from 7 percent in 1989. But despite the Fed's cuts in short-term rates, long-term rates seem to refuse to budge much below 8 percent.  But supporters of a rate cut argue that the Fed is being too cautious. Mr. Bush, for example, said last week, ""Inflation appears to be under control."" **********Advocates of a rate cut point to low growth in M-2, the most closely watched gauge of the money supply, and say this could mean not enough money is being made available for loans. M-2, which includes most bank deposits and money market funds, inched up less than 2 percent in the last year. **********In a news briefing today, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said he worried that the slow growth in the money supply could drag down economic growth. **********Within the Fed itself, governors are debating how to interpret, and how to react to, the weak M-2 numbers. Some governors say it is not worth paying much attention to M-2, asserting that it is often dragged down by unusual factors. For example, many people are moving their money from certificates of deposit, which are counted as part of M-2, to mutual funds, which are not. **********Mr. Brady said that since the Fed's governors are no longer certain how trustworthy their money-supply gauges are, it would be wiser for them ""to overinsure in terms of money supply"" to sustain economic growth."

That agency has reported significant progress in cleaning up its books, monitoring the assets it seizes and supervising the thousands of contractors that it has hired. **********The report, by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, raises new concerns that the agency has been overwhelmed in its two-and-a-half-year life by the enormous load of assets it inherited from hundreds of failed savings associations. **********In one instance under investigation by Government auditors, the R.T.C. commissioned a $25 million project to look for nearly $7 billion that appeared to have vanished from its books. The agency lost track of the money after it was inundated with new assets from a wave of seizures ordered in the spring of 1990 by L. William Seidman, who was head of the trust corporation then. **********But officials now say the $25 million accounting project, known as Operation Western Storm, violated contracting procedures, overpaid contractors and hired hundreds of auditors who sat idle for days with no supervision. **********The authorities are still investigating whether the $7 billion in discrepancies involved fraud or was the result of incompetence and poor record-keeping. But senior officials at the trust corporation say the problems highlighted by Operation Western Storm may not be limited to the Denver office, where they occurred. **********""R.T.C. still does not have adequate systems in place to support its critical mission of managing and selling assets,"" said the General Accounting Office report, which was prepared by Richard L. Fogel, an Assistant Comptroller General. ""Major systems are plagued by fundamental problems."" **********In a statement submitted to the House Banking Committee in connection with testimony on the Administration's request for $55 billion more to continue the bailout, Albert V. Casey, the trust corporation's new president and chief executive, appeared to anticipate the report. **********""The Resolution Trust Corporation's internal management investigation and its outside audit firm have found several instances where management and oversight failures have resulted in waste,"" the statement said. ""Internal control problems existed in essentially all facets of the Western Storm Project."" Starting to Write a Bill **********Mr. Fogel will present his report at a House Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday, a day before a House subcommittee begins drafting a bill to provide more financing for the bailout. A copy of the report was provided to The New York Times by an aide to a lawmaker who has been critical of the rescue effort. **********The report also gives credit to the trust corporation for making good progress in selling assets and closing savings associations. It is nonetheless expected to make it more difficult for the trust corporation to get more financing from Congress. The agency has said that it will need more money by mid-March and will run out on April 1. **********""The G.A.O. report is clear evidence that the R.T.C. is doing a lousy job at preventing rip-offs and tracking assets,"" said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts. ""They come in and say they're doing their job and they need more money. But they aren't doing their job."" **********Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, as expected, asked Congress today for $55 billion to complete the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry and reported that significant progress had been made in both seizing troubled institutions and selling their assets. Cost Continues to Rise **********If the Bush Administration's request is granted, it will bring the costs of the rescue effort to $160 billion since 1989. That figure does not include those bailout deals that were struck under the Reagan Administration and interest payments to finance the trust corporation that could bring the total costs as high as $500 billion over the next 40 years. **********The request, which falls within the Treasury's 1991 estimates of the bail out but is still many times the $50 billion total estimate in 1989 when the rescue began, is expected to be acted upon in the next few weeks by Congress. It represents the fourth time in almost a year and a half that the lawmakers have been asked to provide financing for the highly unpopular effort. **********At a hearing today before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Brady and other officials who have been overseeing the bailout reported significant progress in seizing institutions and selling assets. Since August 1989, the Resolution Trust Corporation has seized more than 680 institutions with assets of more than $370 billion, and sold $240 billion of assets. May Get Half Face Value **********The Government has already received about 95 cents on the dollar for those assets, and its remaining portfolio of commercial loans, raw land and other less desirable assets is expected to be much harder to dispose of and, according to Mr. Casey, might only fetch 50 cents on the dollar, adding significantly to the costs of the rescue effort. **********A number of Republicans and Democrats at the hearing also advised the Administration and senior regulators to abandon a plan it is considering to rescue weak but solvent institutions through Government investments. While some regulators say the plan would be cheaper for the Government, it would also bail out the owners of the institutions, who unlike depositors, are not Federally insured. **********""I have grave concerns about it,"" said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the Banking Committee. **********Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said the Government should not involved in deciding which institutions to invest in. **********""Propping up sick institutions may look politically appealing in the short term for Presidential politics, but in the long term it could too easily result in an increase in taxpayer liabilities and undercut a major pinion of conservative economic philosophy,"" he said."

Silvia, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. ""Politically, that gives the Fed some flexibility.""  Retail Sales **********Retail sales of goods, which account for about one-third of the gross domestic product, rose five-tenths of 1 percent in June, the Department of Commerce reported yesterday. The agency also revised its May report on retail sales up to four-tenths of 1 percent from the previously reported two-tenths of 1 percent. **********But most of the June increase reflected brisker car sales, which ran at an annualized rate of about 6.5 million domestic models last month, a rate that continued in the first 10 days in July. Most of the gains, however, reflected purchases by rental fleets. **********""Consumers weren't buying many more cars in June than in May,"" Ms. Latta said. **********Spending on items other than cars edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent. ""The weather wasn't steamy hot in June,"" Ms. Latta added, ""so nobody was rushing out to buy fans, air-conditioners and bikinis."" **********Sales of building materials dropped sharply, a sign of weakness in the housing market. **********But discounting lifted clothing sales for the second straight month. And higher pump prices inflated gasoline sales. **********Overall spending in June was 3 percent or so higher than a year earlier, but the average for the second quarter was below that of the first. That suggests that consumer spending did not contribute much, if at all, to economic growth in the spring. DRI/McGraw Hill's G.D.P. forecast for the second quarter has assumed that modestly higher spending on services will just offset lower spending on goods. **********In any case, consumer spending seems likely to stay in low gear for several months to come. The weekly ABC/Money magazine consumer confidence poll shows that confidence is wavering in the wake of bad news on unemployment and company layoffs. Consumers do not have much in their wallets either. Income has been flat because jobs are not growing and pay increases have been tiny. Consumer Prices **********In the meantime, consumer price inflation shows no signs of picking up, despite a jolt from higher gasoline prices in June, which was the biggest spurt in energy prices since October 1990. The Consumer Price Index increased just three-tenths of 1 percent last month. And inflation for the second quarter amounted to only a 2.6 percent annual rate, down from a 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter. **********Energy prices jumped by 2 percent. The sharp increase largely reflects Saudi Arabia's success in tightening OPEC pricing policy. Oil prices are no longer declining. **********Food prices were nearly flat. And the prices of services were up a relatively modest three-tenths of 1 percent despite the effect of higher gasoline prices on transportation costs.

Hodges Jr., the bank's chairman, who was Deputy Secretary of Commerce in the Carter Administration, and 10 directors, including Thomas H. Boggs Jr., a leading lobbyist and fund-raiser for Democratic causes; Robert B. Washington Jr., a former chairman of the District of Columbia Democratic Committee, and Theodore Pedas, a movie producer. **********Their lawyers said today that the charges were unfair and that their clients had upheld their fiduciary responsibilities. **********The bank collapsed in 1990 after a two-year battle for control waged by a Middle Eastern investor, Wafic Rida Said, who owned 24 percent of National's stock. The complaint said that with their loyalties divided by their drive to sell the bank's holding company and their attention diverted by the internal battle for control, ""the defendants caused or permitted N.B.W. to engage in a pattern of imprudent and unethical transactions, which caused substantial and irreparable damage to N.B.W."" **********Stuart M. Gerson, the Assistant Attorney General who is head of the civil division of the Justice Department, said the action had been based in part upon the circumstances surrounding Mr. Hodges's $1.6 million ""golden parachute,"" or severance pay, and also on a blind trust created for his benefit. **********The Government maintained that Mr. Hodges's golden parachute had been conditioned upon his not making investments that violated the bank's conflict-of-interest policies. The complaint charges that Mr. Hodges had violated those policies, and therefore should not have received the $1.6 million.  Charges on Land Sale **********The Government also charged that Mr. Hodges had made ""a secret and unjust profit"" of at least $360,000 when the bank sold a tract of undeveloped land in Prince Georges County, Md., to four of his friends and business associates. **********The action also says that the directors were negligent or breached their fiduciary duties in extending a $10 million line of credit to the law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey months before the firm collapsed in November 1987. The complaint noted that Mr. Washington was affiliated with Finley, Kumble, and the bank's directors were therefore required to scrutinize the loan to insure that it was not unduly risky. **********The complaint also said that the bank had made a risky $12 million investment in Royal Windsor, a holding company in which two directors had an interest. The directors were Peter Del Col, head of Colson Investments, and Douglas W. Hawes, a partner at LeBoef, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae, a New York law firm.  Complaint Called Unfair **********Bernhardt K. Wruble, a lawyer for Mr. Hodges, called the Government's complaints unfair. He said, ""In many cases, particularly in respect to one supposed transaction whereby Mr. Hodges is alleged to have made a profit, the Government begins in the middle of the movie, and never tells you about the beginning."" **********He said that although the Government had made it appear that Mr. Hodges engineered the sale of the property, ""in point of fact, the Office of the Controller of the Currency required that the property be sold."" He said that only after nobody in the Washington area would buy the property at the asking price of $3.7 million, the tract was sold to Wall Associates, made up of Mr. Hodges's friends and associates in North Carolina. **********Michael R. Klein, who represents all the other directors, called the complaint ""completely devoid of any indication of what it is that these directors did that constitutes a basis for their liability."" **********Mr. Washington said in a statement today that although he was a partner of Finley, Kumble as well as a director of the bank at the time of the loan, ""I acted in a manner consistent with the National Bank of Washington's rules and regulations and in accordance with applicable Federal law and regulations."""

Mohammed Farah Aidid, a bellicose Somali factional leader, appealed today to aid agencies to keep their workers in the country. **********""We believe you are doing well by our people and that is why we believe humanitarian assistance should be handled by the non-governmental organizations,"" he said. ""We will do everything to protect your safety and your properties."" **********General Aidid's flattering remarks, delivered in his living room, which appeared to have been looted of its light fixtures, had a surreal quality: It has been his young gunmen from the bush who have ambushed the aid workers in the southern part of the city. **********With the exception of the International Committee of the Red Cross, many agencies expressed fear for the safety of their workers after the United States offered troops to bolster the relief effort. The Bush Administration said last week that it was willing to send the troops, under the United Nations flag, to deliver food. Words Without Content? **********Most aid officials discounted General Aidid's words today, saying he had little control over his unpaid fighters, who essentially survive by robbery. **********While the clan leader tried to make peace with the aid workers today, much of the United Nations operation seemed to be on hold. The port of Mogadishu, where 12,000 tons of United Nations grain is waiting to be distributed, remained closed, as did the airport. **********Somalis also described the difficulties the United States military would face in the anarchy that has devastated the country over the last two years. **********Some said the greatest obstacle would be how to deal with the clan rivalries that have inflamed the conflict. While Somali fighters would be no match for Americans forces with heavy firepower, they are extreme and often impetuous clan loyalists. **********""The Americans can't just start disarming them,"" said Hussein Ali Salaad, who worked for the United States Agency for International Development here until the embassy was evacuated in January 1991. ""They might encounter problems. If in the course of disarming they shoot one person, then one clan can come hunting the Americans. This can be of a very sensitive nature.""                    --------------------       Trusteeship Idea Floated **********KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine, Nov. 29 (Special to The New York Times) -- A senior aide traveling with President Bush said this weekend that Somalia might best be served by becoming a ward of the United Nations under some form of international stewardship. **********But he also suggested that an American position on such a move would undoubtedly have to be decided by Bill Clinton, not Mr. Bush, who is likely to leave office well before the United Nations might take up the matter. The official, who spoke with reporters Saturday on condition that he not be identified, said that for Mr. Bush, ""the problem is getting relief in there."" **********There was no suggestion that Mr. Bush favored such an approach or that it had been seriously discussed at the White House. **********The senior aide suggested that the United Nations may eventually consider exercising one of several forms of stewardship to stabilize the Somali situation. **********One, he said, is a trusteeship, in which the United Nations effectively deputizes a neutral nation to establish and a run civil system until authority and public services can be restored. **********A second option is to make Somalia an international protectorate, ""which the U.N. would manage and try to turn back into a state."" The United Nations is attempting something close to that now in Cambodia, with limited success."

The tank, the M1-A2, is an improved version of the M1-A1, the weapon that decimated Iraq's huge Soviet-built armor corps during the Persian Gulf war.  5,900 Jobs at Stake **********The extraordinary lobbying effort by high White House and Administration officials will help the tank's manufacturer, the General Dynamics Corporation, preserve 5,900 jobs, at least to the end of the decade, in two hotly contested states in this year's Presidential election. Ohio has 21 electoral votes; Michigan has 18. **********This year generally has seen a marked departure from the Administration's past practice as it has moved to approve or even actively promote arms sales to help military contractors stung by the decline in Pentagon spending. The Administration recently approved the sale of 150 General Dynamics F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan and 72 McDonnell-Douglas F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia. **********But never has Mr. Bush personally intervened to flex his leverage with a foreign head of government, in this case writing a letter to the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, an Administration official said today. **********The Administration was clearly motivated by more than just election-year politics. The award also came down to a veritable contest between Washington and London over which country could better promote its own products. National self-interest was on the line. **********The President did not mention the new contract on the campaign trail in Michigan today. **********In addition to the White House and Pentagon support, Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger wrote a letter to his Kuwaiti counterpart, and the Secretary of the Army, Michael P. W. Stone, flew to Kuwait during a head-to-head desert competition between the American and British tanks in August. **********""It is unusual, but it's a nice change,"" said Sandra Charles, a former National Security Council official who is now a private consultant in Washington. She has consulted for General Dynamics in the past. **********""The Brits always sent the prime minister, the foreign minister and the defense minister, and the French weren't far behind"" in promoting arms sales to the Middle East, she said. ""The United States was lucky to get a general to go."" **********The official Kuwait News Agency quoted Defense Minister Sheik Ali al-Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah as having said on Sunday that a committee of military experts selected the Abrams M1-A2 tank because it is ""the most responsive to Kuwaiti Army requirements."" A spokesman for General Dynamics said the United States Embassy in Kuwait notified the company. **********The Kuwaiti Defense Minister said the Abrams outperformed the British Challenger tank, manufactured by Vickers P.L.C., during the desert combat trials in Kuwait.  Rewarding Its Allies **********Just a few months ago, the Abrams was an underdog in the bidding, industry analysts said. After the gulf war, the Kuwaiti Government decided to repay its war debt by dividing among its allies its contracts for military equipment and reconstruction projects. Kuwait looked to the United States for fighter aircraft and air defenses, to Britain for tanks and ground equipment, and to France for ships. **********In September 1991, Kuwait signed a 10-year security agreement with the United States, allowing access to ports by United States Navy ships, the storage of military equipment and joint training exercises. The Kuwaiti military openly backed the M1-A2, while political leaders still favored the Challenger in order to spread the largesse. **********In a monthlong desert competition in August, the M1-A2 outperformed the Challenger, military analysts said. At one point, the Challenger broke down and had to be towed from the mock battlefield. In another incident, a shell jammed in the Challenger's gun barrel and the tank turret spun to point the gun at a reviewing stand full of terrified Kuwaiti dignitaries. **********As the Abrams pulled even in the contest, the bidding became a game of political one-upmanship between Washington and London. Prime Minister John Major openly supported the Challenger, and Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind visited Kuwait last month to lobby for the tank. **********Then Washington weighed in. **********Mr. Cheney wrote to Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, who is the Prime Minister and Crown Prince of Kuwait, on Sept. 14. Mr. Cheney then wrote to his counterpart in the Kuwait Government, Mr. Sabah, on Sept. 16. Mr. Quayle wrote the Crown Prince on Sept. 24. Mr. Bush's letter to the Emir followed. Defense Week, a trade publication, first reported the White House and Pentagon letters last week. **********""To have this kind of public display of Administration support is unprecedented,"" said one Pentagon official.  ""Mind you, though, if there were ever a country over which to exercise a certain leverage, it was Kuwait."" **********Kuwait will formally request the tank purchase in the next several weeks, the Pentagon official said. Following usual procedures, General Dynamics will sell the tanks to the United States Government, which will then sell them to Kuwait. The deal requires Congressional approval, which is expected. **********Industry and Pentagon officials say the Kuwaiti deal helps American contractors in one other prospective contract and hurts in another. As a consolation prize for London, Kuwait is likely to select the British Warrior fighting vehicle over the American Bradley, made by the FMC Corporation.  Another Possible Deal **********But Pentagon officials say the Kuwaiti award is expected to help the Abrams in another competition with the Challenger, this time in the United Arab Emirates, which is interested in buying 390 new battle tanks. The M1-A2's desert trials there start Saturday and will run until Oct. 26, General Dynamics said. **********Some British politicians today expressed dismay at what they said was the American leaders' outmuscling of their British counterparts. **********David Clelland, who is a member of the oppositiion Labor Party and rrepresents many Vickers workers in Parliament, said the British Government had not done enough to win the order, Reuters reported today. **********""It's quite clear this decision is a political decision,"" he said. ""It's timed to give President Bush the fill-up he needs. That's what it's about. It's nothing to do with technicalities."""

After trading lower much of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average barely budged, gaining 0.45 point, to 3,236.36. **********Blue-chip issues rallied at the close, as some investors who had sold stock short scurried in the face of market uncertainty to buy shares to cover those they had borrowed. The market may also have been held back as traders awaited economic data due out today, including reports on February consumer prices, housing starts, industrial production and capacity utilization. **********Also, the expiration of options on several products on Thursday and Friday could add volatility. Most Broader Indexes Down **********The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, another blue-chip barometer, rose 0.55 point at the close, to 406.39, while the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.18 points, to 402.88.

The lowest volume this year had been 160.8 million on March 9. Losing issues were ahead of gaining ones yesterday, 922 to 782. **********Under pressure early from a sharp decline in the Tokyo stock market that saw the Nikkei average fall 3 percent, to below 20,000 for the first time since 1987, United States stocks opened weaker, as some investors grew concerned over the flight of Japanese money from the American markets to cover losses at home. No Panic Selling **********But analysts at MMS International, an economic analysis and research firm, noted that the Tokyo decline came in modest volume, about 200 million shares, with no hint of panic selling. At the close of trading today, the Nikkei was up 80.47 points. **********Harry W. Laubscher, the senior vice president at Tucker Anthony Inc., said that jittery day traders moved to the sidelines awaiting further developments from the overseas markets, especially Tokyo. **********""In the absence of any help from bonds, prices drifted and selling pressures were light,"" Mr. Laubscher said. ""While a short-term news instigated rally can occur, the evidence suggests lower prices over the weeks."" **********Gene J. Seagle, the director of technical research at Gruntal & Company, said many investors feared that a liquidation in Japan could lead the Japanese to sell off United States stocks and bonds, but it had not happened. ""In fact,"" he said, ""our market has managed to move a lot in the face of the Tokyo market's decline. And I don't believe it will happen."" **********""However, for it to happen, they would have to have a major break in their banking system, and history shows that the Japanese banks are very competent in handling money,"" Mr. Seagle added. Synergen Rating Cut **********In other activity, Larry Bloom, an analyst at the Soundview Financial Group Inc. said he had lowered his rating on Synergen to a ""short-term sell"" from a ""short-term hold"" based on a negative article in this month's issue of The Journal of Immunology about a molecule the company is researching to treat septic shock. The stock declined 1 1/8, to 49. **********Shares of Weyerhaeuser rose 2 3/8, to 36 1/8, as George Adler, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, raised his earnings estimates for the first quarter and the year and said his target price for the paper company was 40 a share. **********A third-quarter earnings report of $1.08 a share at Nike sent the stock down 3 5/8, to 70 1/2. The earnings estimate was lower than Wall Street consensus estimates, but within the range of analysts' estimates. On Friday, the stock surged 2 3/4, to 74 1/8, after the athletic footwear maker said it was comfortable with estimates of $1.05 to $1.15 for the quarter. **********Recent signs of activity in the housing sector, leading to a strong gain in building-materials sales nationally, as well as higher lumber prices, prompted Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., to adjust his rating for Home Depot's stock to a ""strong buy"" from ""buy."" **********The analyst said he felt Home Depot, the home-improvement store chain, would benefit from putting new stores in the Northeast this year. The stock rose 2 1/4, to 64 7/8."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/28/world/health-care-evolves-as-issue-in-britain-s-general-election.html,Craig Whitney,1992-03-28,,1705,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Health Care Evolves as Issue In Britain's General Election,Health Care Evolves as Issue In Britain's General Election," **********Patrick Keane, a 44-year-old man from Cardiff, Wales, is entitled, like all other Britons, to medical care from the National Health Service. Mr. Keane changed doctors this winter, and the reasons he gave for doing so could spell trouble for Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Party in the national elections on April 9. **********""My doctor went private,"" Mr. Keane said. ""He's gone computerized, and lost the personal touch. He just didn't give me as good care."" **********Mr. Keane's doctor hadn't really ""gone private."" Like more than 3,000 other general practitioners, he had decided to take part in a new plan that Mr. Major's Government put into effect last year to allow some doctors and hospitals to administer their own budgets instead of letting the National Health bureaucracy run them. Commercial Creates a Dispute **********The plan is part of a Government program to encourage greater efficiency in delivering health care, which the Conservatives say only the free market, or something patterned after it, could bring to the National Health Service. **********Accusations by the opposition Labor Party that the plan amounts to a secret privatization of the health service, favoring people who can pay American-size doctor and hospital bills and leaving the rest to suffer on long waiting lists, led this week to the first big uproar of the campaign. It centered on a Labor television commercial that dramatized the case of two little girls with ear infections, one of whom had to wait nearly a year for an operation on National Health and the other who received treatment immediately by paying for it. Health has become one of the key issues that could decide whether Mr. Major or Neil Kinnock, the Labor Party leader, is Prime Minister on April 10. **********At present, 156 of the nation's 1,700 hospitals are self-managing, with their own Government-provided budgets, and 3,000 of the nation's 28,000 doctors are in a similar program, free to buy laboratory and operating-room services wherever they get the best treatment or the best deal instead of just having to take the Government-run ones the bureaucracy assigns to them. **********If the Conservatives win the election next month, they say they will bring 156 more hospitals into the new system next year, and 2,500 more doctors. If Labor wins, it says it will scrap the whole Conservative program and instead put more money into the health service, which has a budget this year of $:36 billion, or about $61.9 billion. **********Mr. Keane said his old doctor was so busy being more efficient that he failed to see that the medication he prescribed was causing him to suffer from a skin rash. And for Mr. Keane, and many people like him, that is one more good reason to vote Labor. If there's one thing a majority of Britons don't want, according to all the polls, it's to see the National Health Service privatized, which is what many believe the Conservatives want to do, despite their frequent and heated denials. Manifesto vs. Manifesto **********Labor is hoping to ride the health issue all the way to No. 10 Downing Street. ""This election will decide the future of the N.H.S.,"" the Labor Party manifesto says, promising that a Labor government would ""stop the privatization of the N.H.S."" and invest at least an additional $:1 billion ($1.72 billion) in the service over the next two years to correct a decade of what it calls underfinancing by the Conservatives. **********The Conservative manifesto says that the party ""is totally committed to the National Health Service,"" and asserts that financing for it has increased by 55 percent, after adjusting for inflation, since the Tories took office in 1979. **********""Every time the Conservatives talk about health,"" said Robert M. Worcester, head of the Mori polling organization, ""they lose."" A Mori poll of 1,109 voters across the country published in The Times of London on March 25 showed that 52 percent thought Labor had the best policies on health, compared with 22 percent for the Conservatives. The other 26 percent had no opinion or believed that the Liberal Democrats had the best health policies. **********As a percentage of its gross national product, Britain spends less on health care than any other European country except Greece, according to the Office of Health Economics in London. In 1990, the latest year for which statistics are available, Britain spent 6.1 percent, including the tiny private health care sector -- less than half of what Americans spent on health care, which was 12.4 percent of G.N.P. Set Up After World War II **********A Labor Government set up the National Health Service after World War II, establishing the principle that medical care should be available to all and financed through national taxation. Treatment, hospitalization, and medicines all cost patients nothing, though successive governments have brought in nominal fees for some things like prescriptions and eye examinations.  Prescriptions are now $:3.40, or about $5.85, but are rising to $:3.75, or about $6.45, next month. **********Britons who use the National Health Service for their primary medical care, which is nearly everybody, do not choose their own doctors but are assigned to so-called general practices near their homes. These are usually offices with 3 to 10 physicians. Laboratory arrangements and equipment vary from place to place. **********Usually, but not always, patients can ask to see the same doctor, and most doctors make house calls. Changing doctors for personal reasons is possible, but requires the consent of the doctor and approval of the health service, which is not always given. **********Defenders of the system often compare Britain with the United States, where nearly a third of all Americans have no health insurance at all and many people get their primary care by waiting for hours or days in the emergency rooms of municipal hospitals. Nothing $:5 Billion Won't Cure **********Health experts on both sides of the issue agree that there's nothing wrong with the health service that $:5 billion to $:15 billion more wouldn't cure, and that neither Labor nor the Conservatives are remotely likely to come up with that amount. **********""We're all facing the same problem,"" said Dr. David Brownridge, a doctor in Ombersley, near Worcester, who believes that the Government's program to put doctors like him on their own self-administered budgets is a potentially dangerous distraction from their prime duty to provide the best care they can, regardless of cost. **********""The fact is that 1990's medicine is just too expensive, so judgments have to be made about rationing,"" he said.  ""Our system has been the waiting list."" **********There were a total of 925,663 people on waiting lists to get into National Health Service hospitals at the end of February, according to the Health Department, and 826,487 of them had been waiting for less than one year. The rest had been waiting for up to three years, most of them for elective surgery for problems like defective hip or knee joints , cataracts, and hernias.  Politics of Waiting Lists **********The waiting lists are a political issue because Labor argues that the Conservative Government would like to encourage patients to turn to private medical care for faster treatment, as some already do. **********The health service already requires about 60 percent of the population to pay for most of the cost of dental treatment, which has not been free since the 1970's. Now many dentists refuse to take on health service cases, and Labor's suggestion is that basic health care could go the same way. **********The Labor commercial last week led to charges that the plight of the little girl who had to wait for treatment had been distorted for political purposes. **********Candidates from both parties traded charges and countercharges. William Waldegrave, the Conservative Health Secretary, said the film was ""absolutely disgraceful"" and reminiscent of Nazi propaganda techniques. Other Conservatives charged that it proved Mr. Kinnock was not fit to govern. Mr. Kinnock responded that it proved the Conservatives weren't fit to run the health service let alone the country. Doctors Have Different Views **********In his practice in rural Worcestershire, where he and his partner have 3,800 patients assigned to them by the health service, Dr. Brownridge said: ""The Government has spent about as much as Labor would have during the past 13 years, but on the wrong things. They're spending on paper, microchips, and accountants, and that's money that doesn't go into patient care. **********""Never before in the history of medicine has a doctor had to ask, 'can I afford to treat this patient?' "" he said, explaining his objections to administering his own budget. **********Dr. Paul W. Lambden, a doctor whose practice in the north London suburb of Cheshunt has been a showcase for the Government's changes, couldn't disagree more. **********""Rationing from outside can't possibly be as good as rationing from within,"" Dr. Lambden said. ""Before, hospitals would do operations until they ran out of money, and then they'd close down the beds until the beginning of the new fiscal year."" **********Managing their own budget, the doctors in his practice are in a position to pay fees to the hospitals to which they refer their patients and avoid this kind of arbitrary cutoff for people on the waiting lists. **********With the savings he and his colleagues have made, he said, they had built a four-bed intermediate-grade operating room and hired a physiotherapist and a psychological counselor. **********But the Labor Party says the effect of the changes is to create a ""two-tier"" health service, with the 14 percent of the population covered by doctors and hospitals in the self-management system sometimes getting favored treatment over the rest. **********Dr. Lambden disagrees and said the Labor Party was engaging in scare tactics. ""I'm not going to allow myself to be privatized,"" he said. **********Phyllis Winter, a patient at University Hospital of Wales, said she had not noticed any change for the worse in the treatment she got from her doctor after he went into the Government program. ""It won't change my vote, though,"" she said, adding that she always voted Labor."

While Mr. McNeely suspects it's more a matter of fate than managerial intention that they all ended up on the same trading desk, he does think that the competitive spirit carries through. **********""When you're an athlete who's competed on a high level, people know you're a team player, willing to do what it takes to reach your goal,"" Mr. McNeely said. ""You build a certain amount of mental toughness, so even if you fail to guard that big account, you pick yourself up and go at it even harder the next time. You don't accept failure."" **********Corporate sporting events, like Chemical Bank's Corporate Challenge series of five-kilometer races, are a measure of the emphasis on the competitive image. **********For this year's New York championships in June, Dun & Bradstreet sent 1,312 finance-minded men and women stampeding through Central Park in defense of corporate honor. In the Dallas race, NationsBank flew in its runners from branches all over the state, determined to best its rival, Texas Commerce Bank (a Chemical subsidiary), in every event. Georgia Federal Bank's chief executive, Richard Jackson, took such pride in his company's showings in the Atlanta Corporate Challenge that when Chemical decided to pull the race from that city, he took over the event, then strong-armed 876 of his 1,200 employees to run the 3.5 miles. **********Bill Campbell, president and chief executive of the GO Corporation, a Silicon Valley software firm who was head coach of the Columbia football team in the early 1970's, sees a firm link between competitive sports and successful business. **********""These days there are too many people who view themselves as more important than the organization they work for, and that's what breaks companies down,"" Mr.  Campbell said. ""Individual brilliance is fine, but you've got to temper it with teamwork. There's a camaraderie that comes from playing a team sport. You learn the importance of selfless sacrifice."" **********Mr. Campbell says he has never gone out of his way to hire athletes, but for Thomas W. Weisel, chairman and chief executive of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, sports is ""the big theme I've tried to build my firm around."" As he puts it: ""No one knows how you're going to perform until you get into a game for all the marbles. And in our business that happens between one and 10 times a day. You're dealing in a volatile and uncertain world where you've got to think fast and act fast and be very definitive, like a quarterback in a pressure cooker situation. People who don't flourish in that environment don't belong in our business."" **********Mr. Weisel says at least 50 of his 520 employees are ""dedicated, serious athletes,"" including Otto Tchudi, who skied for Norway in the 1968 and 1972 Olympic Games; Craig Johnson, who was No. 2 on the Stanford tennis team and is now a tournament-class golfer, and Alan Stein, who played on an Ivy League champion basketball team. **********Mr. Weisel, 51, began as a world-class speed skater, later turning to ski racing and recently to competitive cycling, in which he has set two world records for his age group. He claims that in 22 years he has never missed a day's work because of illness, another reason he favors hiring athletes. **********Montgomery Securities, a competitor in the annual Ski Classic, a nationwide racing circuit for executives, has placed first or second in its region in five of the six years the race has been run. **********Bill Shaw, president of Eiger Communications, the San Francisco sports marketing firm that organizes the Ski Classic, is astounded at how far some sports-minded companies will go to win. Bank of America, he noted, holds team trials. U.S. West has been known to show up with a uniformed cheerleading squad. Ford, A.T.&T.;, Wells Fargo and Chevron (last year's champion) comb their corporate ranks for top-level skiers and fly them in for races. Last year, Mr. Shaw said, 33,000 racers turned out for 32 weekends of competition. **********""With some of these teams, it's like war,"" Mr. Shaw says. ""Apple came out with some ads for a new line of laser printers, and next thing I know these guys from Hewlett-Packard show up saying, 'You've got to put us up against the Apple team.' They show up in custom ski shells with the logos all over them. They have team breakfasts and team ski waxing. The captains protest late starts. You try to say, 'Hey, guys, this is for fun.' And they say, 'That's what you think.' """

The airline is by far the largest carrier across the North Atlantic. **********Normally, when bookings are strong, carriers try to push up fares, and in addition the heavy losses caused by the Persian Gulf war last year have created pressure to try to recoup when times are good. **********But some analysts said that the economic recovery in many nations had been fragile and a fare increase could dampen a travel rebound that has begun on most international routes. **********British Air's fare increases are expected to be about 1 to 2 percent, Sir Colin said. 'A Good Idea' **********""Holding the line on a fare increase is a good idea,"" said Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst for County NatWest. ""The economies of the world are just getting their strength back and they could be set back again."" **********British Airways said that its April traffic increased 10.3 percent from April 1990. The comparison was not made to April 1991, it said, because the gulf war severely skewed that month's results. **********Holding down fare increases will mean that peak-season travel between the United States and Europe will be cheaper than it has been in some time. **********In 1989, for example, the lowest fare between London and New York available on weekends was $692 round trip. It rose to $738 in 1990, and increased again in 1991 to $758. This summer it is expected to be about $689. **********Sir Colin said that bookings in economy class, where most early bookings are made, were so strong that those who waited until the last minute might not find space. **********Virgin Atlantic recently announced a low fare of $398 round trip from New York to London but it must be bought on the day of travel. The offer is good until June 15. **********Sir Colin said British Air would consider the Virgin Atlantic low fare but said the airline already had attractive low fares and might decide not to match. **********Lori Levin, a spokeswoman for Virgin, said the carrier's bookings had been strong. **********Another reason that British Airways may want to keep fares low is that it plans a major increase in capacity on the North Atlantic of 11.5 percent over two years ago. The carrier will, for example, beef up its flights from one daily to two a day to London from Chicago, Boston, Washington and Miami. **********Sir Colin said that all the major carriers such as American, United and Virgin were putting more seats on the North Atlantic route.  A Strong Recovery **********Domestic traffic has been disappointing for the United States carriers, which hope that a good summer on recently acquired international routes will help offset the domestic weakness. **********British Airways has shown a strong recovery from the heavy losses that most carriers suffered last year. In the company's fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, the airline showed a profit of $37 million, compared with a loss of $254 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2 billion, up 29.3 percent. **********British Airways has also held its own in the increasing competition in the North Atlantic, having seen its market share go up by 1 percent at Heathrow even though 17 new carriers have begun service to Heathrow in recent years."

The product, which is actually a data base spreadsheet program, makes life easier for financial analysts who must combine scores of spreadsheets sent to the home office. The usual practice for consolidating all the numbers is to create a master sheet with a program like Excel or 1-2-3 and electronically cut and paste all the pieces together. Another approach is to link the spreadsheets. **********Both methods are time consuming and allow the data to be viewed only from a set of predetermined assumptions. If those assumptions change, an entirely new spreadsheet must be constructed. For example, if the master spreadsheet is set up to view a company's sales numbers by division, the branch office numbers might not be broken out. To see them, a new spreadsheet would have to be created. **********TM/1 treats numbers the same way a data base treats other types of information. The numbers are stored in named ""fields"" -- Sinper calls them dimensions and views -- and can be updated, sorted and quickly viewed in various ways. A new spreadsheet is constructed by placing the various dimensions in any order the user wishes. When the report is printed, TM/1 pulls the numbers from the data base and inserts them, properly recalculated when that is required. **********TM/1 has not gained wider acceptance because it does not fit into a neat category as either a piece of spreadsheet software or data base software. Sinper, which is based in Warren, N.J., is trying to counter this with the latest release of its network software, Spreadsheet Connector 2.0. **********Its novelty is that Spreadsheet Connector does not depend on TM/1 to work. Instead, it gives Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel users the same access to the numbers in the database as TM/1 does. **********""We've made the data independent of the interface,"" said Manny Perez, president of Sinper. ""It operates invisibly to users of other spreadsheets."" **********At Home Insurance in New York, Bruce Licht, a financial services executive, has become an enthusiastic booster of Sinper's software. ""Most of the people in our accounting department use Lotus,"" he said. ""Giving them that Lotus advantage makes them more comfortable"" with Sinper. **********Still, Mr. Licht's personal preference remains TM/1. ""I've been using it a long time and I find it a lot friendlier when building large, complex reports,"" he said. But he faults the software as being clumsy in handling printing reports. ""TM/1 doesn't give you the option to pretty up a report that you can get with Lotus or Excel,"" he said. ""When I need to print a fancy report, I send the data to Lotus. **********TM/1 Spreadsheet Connector comes in three versions -- basic, professional and corporate -- ranging in price from $985 for a 5-user basic package to $34,995 for a 50-user corporate version."

Advocacy groups like the Alzheimer's Association say buyers of the long-term care policies often have trouble understanding them. **********Patient advocates say that some policies do not assure reimbursement for people with deteriorating mental conditions. Some require medically necessary care or treatment prescribed by a physician in accordance with standard medical practice -- wording that they said could be interpreted to exclude the nonmedical care that many people with Alzheimer's require. **********Coverage for long-term disabilities, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has grown briskly in the last five years, to an estimated $3 billion in annual premiums. About 2.7 million people, most starting in their late 60's and early 70's, have bought the policies. Depending on age and what is covered, the cost may be $1,000 to $4,000 a year. **********About 8 percent of large- and medium-sized employers sponsor long-term care, and 18 percent more intend to do so by 1995, according to a survey of 166 companies by the William M. Mercer benefits consulting firm. The employees typically pay the costs. Richard E. Johnson, a Mercer managing director, said such benefits would be increasingly popular as the work force aged. **********Although dozens of companies offer group policies for long-term care, 85 percent of the purchasers buy them on their own. In an innovative move, the United Healthcare Corporation, based in Minnetonka, Minn., plans to offer long-term care as a paid option for people covered under the Federal Medicare program in health maintenance organizations. **********Nancy Bern, a vice president of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, said coverage had improved in recent years, particularly for people buying through employer groups. ""People can now use the coverage anywhere, as long as they are certified as disabled,"" she said. Added benefits include homemaker services, assigning case managers to advise families on centers for care and payment for ""respite care"" while family members of a person with Alzheimer's take a break. **********President-elect Bill Clinton has called for expanding Medicare benefits for the elderly and disabled, which Congressional aides said might mean coverage for prescription drugs. **********""Long-term care benefits will be phased in, starting with the most neglected area -- care in the home and community,"" Mr. Clinton said on Sept. 10, outlining his plans in The New England Journal of Medicine. He noted that Arkansas had tried paying for ""home health care, personal care, transportation to senior centers, a nurse's services, or attendance at an adult day-care center."" **********A coalition of long-term care insurers and nursing home groups expects Congress to pre-empt the traditional state role of setting standards for the sale of these products, said Ron Hagen, a vice president of the Amex Life Assurance Company. **********The insurers would like a new standards law to include a provision for a Federal tax break for long-term care like the advantages that companies and employers get for benefits covering other illnesses. But a tax change is considered less imminent. By some estimates, it could cost $200 million to $400 million a year in lost revenues. But losses could be offset by Medicaid savings if more people bought private coverage instead of following the common practice of disposing of assets to qualify for nursing care at taxpayer expense. **********Industry executives and Congressional health policy aides doubt that sweeping long-term care measures will be enacted soon. They speculate that a comprehensive program may be postponed until the new Clinton Administration has addressed other health issues, notably access to hospitals and doctors for 35 million uninsured Americans. **********At the state level, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is also considering new safeguards for consumers. One change under study by the commissioners' long-term care task force would assure longtime policyholders of a partial payoff if they became incapacitated, even if they had stopped paying their premiums. The industry opposes the measure, arguing that premiums would have to be raised to pay for it. **********On a separate but related issue, some companies already promise to pay for care, if an Alzheimer's patient's family promptly demonstrates that payments lapsed because of memory loss associated with the disease. **********Mr. Hagen heads an industry group that is pushing state commissioners to recommend clear wording in policies to protect people with Alzheimer's who can still function with help and supervision, for example, in adult day-care centers. **********Jay Greenberg, president of the Long Term Care Group, a Boston-based unit of United Healthcare, said there had been ""a lot of progress"" on this issue, ""but there still is a way to go."" He added: ""You have to be very sophisticated to understand the policies. People need to look carefully at their policy."""

Conservative critics -- notably, Alvin Rabushka, an economist at the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies in Jerusalem -- contend big government is an addiction that Israel will not kick until it is threatened with the loss of American aid. **********But Benjamin Gaon disagrees. And as the chief executive of Koor Industries, his views cannot be lightly dismissed. Four years ago Koor was the very symbol of Israeli-style statism, an arteriosclerotic, union-owned behemoth that measured success by the size of the payroll. Today, thanks in part to a tough stance by the Israeli Government, Koor is a lean-and-mean conglomerate that sheds money-losing businesses faster than you can say ""Charles Darwin."" **********When critics talk of Israeli socialism, argues Arye Hillman, an economist at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, they are generally talking sloppily. For Israel is not especially prone to the hallmark sins of socialism. Price controls have not generated chronic shortages. Private accumulation of wealth has not been discouraged; relatively few businesses have ever been state-owned. **********What Israel has been guilty of, however, is economic paternalism. Private enterprises were deemed virtuous by the Government because they served defense interests, or welcomed immigrants, or made the desert bloom. And once lodged on the Zionist honor roll, they were nurtured with subsidies and protection from competition. **********Few people quarreled with the formula in the early days, because the formula was apparently a success: 10 percent annual growth for two decades is not chopped liver. But growth slowed in the mid-1970's, while wildly accelerating inflation in the mid-1980's turned business investment into a lottery and gave Israelis a taste of what makes much of the third world run. ""Only when the inflationary seas subsided,"" says Amos Rubin, economic adviser to Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir, ""did the boulders stick out."" **********One of the larger rocks was Koor Industries, the manufacturing arm of the Histadrut, the national labor federation, whose 31,000 employees made everything from cement to salad oil. The company's proud slogan: We Are Big. **********Koor was owned by the 85 percent of the Israeli work force that belongs to the Histadrut -- and thus, effectively, by no one. Whenever a manager of one of Koor's 80 plants challenged worker perquisites, Mr. Gaon explained, he was warned off by the head office. What is a union for, after all, if not to defend the interests of its locals? **********In 1987, two years after the Government's price stabilization program reduced the inflation rates from 300 percent to 20 percent, Koor reported a loss of $250 million and acknowledged that it had a negative net worth. Foreign bank creditors, figuring the Government would never let a company representing one-tenth of Israel's industrial capacity go belly up, demanded repayment. **********The creditors figured wrong. The Government called their bluff, denying Koor's plea for a bailout. And since Israel had no equivalent of Chapter 11 reorganization in bankruptcy, only the informal intervention by a judge kept the cement and salad oil pouring. **********What Koor got instead of a court-supervised liquidation was Mr. Gaon, a plain-speaking executive who had turned around Israel's deeply distressed Co-Op supermarket chain. He survived local strikes and creditor revolts to slash Koor's payroll by one-third and debts by half. In some cases, the struggle was more than cerebral: one of his lieutenants bloodied a union official in a fistfight. **********Under the restructuring plan completed last September, the Histadrut's stake has been diluted to 26 percent. But even that remnant could prove quite valuable: earlier this month, Koor reported a nine-month profit of about $60 million. The ultimate goal, Mr. Gaon says, is to transform Koor into a holding company, one that delegates all management decisions to individual enterprises. **********A visit to one of those enterprises, the Makhteshim Chemical Works in the depressed industrial city of Beersheba, provided no evidence of enduring bitterness. Do the 1,000 employees performing tasks previously allotted to 1,300 resent the change? Dov Griedlinger, chairman of the union local, shrugged at the suggestion. Once the Government demanded that Koor get by on its own resources, he said, this end was inevitable. **********The new face of the Israeli economy would not be easily recognizable to the Zionist pioneers. But then, the new Israel must learn to survive in a cold capitalist world. All the pioneers had to worry about was a host of Arab armies and a lot of sand."

The capture of the city came after nearly 14 years of civil war against a succession of Soviet-backed Communist Governments. **********The Presidential palace, army garrisons and armories, police stations and the television and radio complexes were swiftly occupied by heavily armed guerrillas who met almost no resistance. **********Two rival groups, the Jamiat-i-Islami of Ahmad Shah Masood and the militant Hezb-i-Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, vied to capture portions of the city's center, a competition that led to occasional shoving matches but apparently no serious armed clashes in the daylight. But as dark fell, the stutter of rifle and heavy machine-gun fire could be heard throughout the city.  Fundamentalist Offensive **********The suddenness of the takeover, initiated by the Hezb-i-Islami, which represents the southern Pathan ethnic group, gave rise to speculation that Mr. Hekmatyar was trying to grab the capital and power for himself at the expense of the many other rebel groups that have formed an alliance. **********But very quickly, other guerrillas, particularly fighters from Jamiat-i-Islami, emerged from hiding and outflanked the Hezb-i-Islami forces to occupy most of the important installations in the capital. Many of these groups are dominated by northern and western ethnic minorities who resent centuries of dominance by the Pathans. **********Earlier this morning, in the Pakistani border town of Peshawar, a gathering of Islamic rebel groups announced the formation of an interim governing council, although Mr. Hekmatyar, the most rigid fundamentalist among the Islamic rebel leaders, declared that he would not participate. It was not clear this evening whether the council would travel to Kabul to take the reins of the government. **********The Associated Press reported that at the Pakistan headquarters of the resistance, nine rebel chiefs -- not including Mr. Hekmatyar -- issued a communique saying Mr. Masood was in charge of Kabul until their arrival. **********While the political prospects were unclear, the capture of the city today was clearly the crowning military victory of a struggle that began nearly 14 years ago when the first Islamic rebels took to the mountains to fight the Communist Government of Noor Mohammed Taraki. **********The conflict soon became the last cold-war battleground between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviets intervened in December 1979, sending the first of more than 100,000 troops to fight the Muslim guerrillas. The United States responded by sending arms to the guerrillas at their bases in Pakistan. **********Unable to crush the resistance and facing growing internal problems, the Soviet Union completed its withdrawal in February 1989. The rebels continued fighting President Najibullah, who was installed by Moscow in 1986 and who finally fell from power last week. **********As the Soviet Union began to collapse and warmer ties developed with the United States, Moscow and Washington agreed to cut off aid to their clients. The rebels continued to press the Najibullah Government, and a string of victories north of the capital last week presaged today's triumph. Many Losses, Few Victories **********An estimated two million Afghans died in the fighting and nearly six million became refugees in Pakistan or Iran. Countless others were injured.  Many villages today are hollow shells of shattered buildings and overgrown fields. More than 30 million mines litter the landscape, and the country's economy has collapsed. **********The first move by the guerrillas this morning came when more than 500 fighters from Mr. Hekmatyar's units, who had been hidden in the Ministry of the Interior, took up positions outside the iron gates of the complex. **********Quickly, light machine guns were deployed and guerrillas were posted at the entrance, mixing easily with the ministry's own rifle-toting security forces. Many of the guerrillas wore khaki army jackets with patches reading ""U.S. Army."" **********Mohammed Kareen, a commander of Hezb-i-Islami, said: ""We came two days ago. We stayed in the ministry until now. They told us to go to the Ministry of Interior. This ministry belongs to Hezb-i-Islami."" **********The commander, who said he directed about 500 fighters, said he did not know of any agreement with the forces of Mr. Masood.  'We Do Not Want to Fight' **********""We are not yet together with Ahmad Shah Masood,"" he said. ""We do not want to fight. If they want to fight, I will start fighting. But it is better for us to be together, because they are my brothers."" **********Elsewhere in Kabul, a group of rebels shouting ""God is great!"" stormed the headquarters of the secret police, and here and there across the city crowds of people waving the green banner of Islam paraded through the streets shouting ""Long live the mujahedeen,"" or holy warriors. **********Yet even as some of Kabul's citizens celebrated the arrival of the guerrillas, others, including many Government workers and members of the once-dominant Watan Party, hurried to take refuge in their homes. By mid-afternoon, the streets were deserted, except for an occasional jeep or armored car speeding along raising clouds of dust. **********As night fell, the blackness over Kabul was torn apart by the crimson stitching of tracer bullets arcing into the sky, the white flash of flares and the crackle of automatic weapons as guerrillas celebrated their victory. Deep thumps of tank fire echoed in the hills and occasional explosions of uncertain origin mingled with the splatter of light weapons. Masood Accuses Hekmatyar **********Mr. Hekmatyar was believed to be outside the city, as was Mr. Masood. At his base in Charikar, 35 miles north of here, Mr. Masood told reporters that Mr. Hekmatyar had collaborated with Communist elements to try to take over the city. **********The collapsing Kabul Government had been weakened by defections in the military; and as Hezb-i-Islami forces moved to capture sites around the center of the city, the extent of cooperation between elements of the Government's forces and Mr. Masood became clear. **********Late this afternoon, 18 air force helicopters began ferrying 1,800 of Mr. Masood's troops to the capital from Jabal-us-Siraj, about 40 miles north of here. Earlier, a column of heavily armed fighters from Jamiat-i-Islami wearing backpacks marched into the capital's television station. Machine-gun nests were set up on the roof and army guards at the gates were supplemented by Jamiat fighters. **********""We asked them to come to control the station,"" said Akbar Nihad, who said he was the general director of advertising. ""We called them today, in the morning. It is necessary for them to have control of the television station. It is important."" **********Kabul's fall became inevitable as the rest of Afghanistan entered the embrace of Islamic guerrilla organizations. Across the country, varied coalitions and alliances of rebel groups, former government militia and army units assumed control over every major city and town in recent weeks, with the last major provincial capital, Jalalabad, falling on Friday. **********Many of these coalitions are bound together by regional, ethnic and linguistic identities, or by loyalties to prominent leaders. **********On Friday, many of Kabul's neighborhoods were infiltrated by rebels from many organizations. In the southwest of the city, an area populated by Hazaras, Shiite Muslims from the west of the country, forces of the Iranian-backed guerrilla groups Hezb-i-Wahadat and Harakat-e-Inquilab-e-Islami established offices, set up checkpoints and occupied police stations. **********Thousands of rebels, perhaps as many as 100,000 from various factions, took up positions in the mountains surrounding Kabul and along the main roads. For the most part, the north of the capital was dominated by Mr. Masood's forces, while Mr. Hekmatyar's fighters took up positions to the south. **********Afghan Army soldiers and troops from the northern coalition headed by General Abdul Rashid Doestam, supported by Mr. Masood's fighters, had established a defensive perimeter on the southern edges of the city. But over the last week, the boundaries of the city became so porous that as many as 20,000 guerrillas filtered in. **********Today, rebels in the city rushed to capture Government armories. The Kabul garrison, led by General Nabi Azimi, a Tajik who supervised the Government's military council in the waning days of the regime, invited Mr. Masood's fighters into his cantonment several days ago.  Awaiting Orders **********Early this afternoon, a group of Hezb-i-Islami guerrillas seized a national guard armory. From a ground-floor room, weathered fighters in loose turbans handed out new AK-47's, their barrels gleaming with fresh oil, and bayonets to the 100 rebels commanded by Turran Sarshar. **********""We arrived one hour ago,"" Mr. Sarshar said. ""We control this building and are guarding the area. So far there has been no fighting. Every party wants an Islamic country so there should be no fighting."" **********But Mr. Sarshar was adamant in backing Mr. Hekmatyar's refusal to enter an alliance with other groups. **********Apart from securing his neighborhood, Mr. Sarshar said he was unclear what was expected of him. ""We want a program,"" he said. ""We want orders."" **********The collapse of the Kabul Government began last winter, first with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Mr. Najibullah's principal benefactor. As the flow of weapons and money dried up, Mr. Najibullah stepped up his calls for a peaceful settlement. At every turn, the guerrillas rejected his pleas for compromise, vowing they would not lay down their arms until he was removed from office. **********In January, alarmed at the rising ethnic chauvinism within the armed forces, Mr. Najibullah tried to replace a group of generals in the north, all of whom were either Uzbeks or Tajiks, with Pathan commanders. But the officers rebelled and formed an alliance with General Doestam, the most powerful militia commander in the north and an Uzbek. Ally of President Rebels **********Time and again in the last three years, General Doestam had sent his soldiers to shore up Government defenses around the country, but the President's attempt to assert the control of Pathan officers over the military drove him into revolt. **********Alliances between commanders and guerrilla factions proliferated, with many coalescing into shuras, or governing councils, that assumed administration of towns and cities. **********Then nine days ago, Mr. Najibullah, without informing his senior aides, attempted to flee in the plane belonging to the United Nations special envoy, Benon Sevan. But control of the airport had been turned over to General Doestam's soldiers, who refused to let the former President leave the country. He fled to sanctuary in a United Nations building in the city, and his whereabouts today were not known. **********Kabul's fall may spell an end to the four-year campaign to find a peaceful settlement. Mr. Sevan worked strenuously, meeting with rebel factions in Peshawar and Teheran, as well as with Mr. Najibullah and his Government. Last month, it appeared that his efforts had finally borne fruit when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in Geneva, announced the outlines of a plan for an interim administration and elections for a new government. That plan seemed to lie in shambles amid the jubilant gunfire thundering in Kabul's streets tonight. **********Mr. Sevan is in Pakistan with the Secretary General and is to return to Kabul on Monday. But it is now unclear whether he will, or what he can accomplish if he does. And while guerrillas and their supporters cruised the streets of Kabul jammed into the back of trucks, and while the faces of fighters who have spent many of the last 14 years in the mountains of Afghanistan show genuine smiles at their victory, there is little sense of what will happen tomorrow."

Mrs. Fava, 70 years old and sprightly, is one of them. **********The question people talk about, though, is: how many more will there be like her? **********For centuries the village remained closed, accessible only by water or footpath, tending its olive and lemon groves while its three main families provided brides and grooms for one another. Intermarriage preserved the genetic mutation and nurtured it. **********Then, in 1950, the road came. **********And the problem now, said Maria Grazia Risatti, who does not think she has the mutation, is that many villagers are marrying outsiders. **********Some villagers fear the genetic magic is being diluted and lost. ""Once we were like a small island,"" said Mrs. Risatti, whose family runs four hotels but does not seem blessed with the protein. ""Now people are marrying outsiders and the protein's getting more difficult to find."" **********The story started in 1982 with a man called Valerio Dagnoli, a son of the village who worked on the railways in Milan. When he went for a medical check-up in 1982 it was discovered that he had such high levels of cholesterol that he should have been feeling very ill. The only problem was, as village lore has it, he felt just fine. **********Examinations by a team directed by Prof. Cesare Sartori disclosed a mutation in the A-1 protein that protected Mr. Dagnoli against the adverse effects of high cholesterol. The mutation has not been found anywhere else. **********In the village, news of the strange protein set people pondering. **********""People thought that it was maybe our very fine olive oil, or our lemons, or the water,"" said Mrs. Fava. **********""My theory,"" said Enrico Rossaro, who runs a publicity firm here and who does not think he has the mutation, ""is that years ago when the village was closed, they lived a very healthy life. They had to bring in the soil for the lemon groves by boat from across the lake, and carry it up the mountain. It made them very healthy."" **********But the real secret seemed to lie in the archives of the village church, where a local historian, Domenico Fava, and the priest, the Rev. Mario Trebeschi, began poring over the records of births, marriages and deaths. (Mr. Fava disputes Felicita Fava's theory that they are related.) **********They started with the names of the three families in which the mutation had most frequently been identified: the Girardis, the Segalas and the Pomarolis. Tracing the family trees, they discovered that all three had among their early members Cristoforo Pomaroli and Rosa Giovanelli, immigrants from nearby Trento who had married here in 1644. **********Stephen Sturley, of the department of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview that the church records suggested that the origin of the mutation lay with the couple. ""It was a chance event that created the specific mutation,"" he said. ""The isolation of the village preserved it primarily through intermarriage."" **********Milan University scientists, who have tested every resident, say about 44 people now have the mutation. **********The mutation enables the A-1 protein to ""bind fat much faster than a normal one and release it faster,"" said Dr. Sartori, who is the head of clinical pharmacology at Milan University and holds a doctorate from the University of Kansas. This greatly accelerates the process of preventing cholesterol build-ups that cause arteriosclerosis. **********Dr. Sartori said that the protein had been duplicated in a laboratory and that pharmaceutical concerns in Belgium and Sweden were both working on an application of it. **********And babies are still being born of parents with the mutation. ""In 200 years, it will still be there,"" he said."

Economists, in contrast to politicians, generally put consumers' interests ahead of producers'. And in the case of the proposed alliance between the high-flying British carrier and money-hemorrhaging (and now strike-bound) USAir, it requires tortured logic to construct a story in which American travelers would not come out ahead from the added competition. **********But it may yet be possible to have it both ways. If pushed hard enough by Washington, economists predict that Britain will open its own skies in return for broader horizons in America. **********USAir badly needs capital, full-fare passengers and a way to shake off its image as the carrier of choice to Appalachia. For its part, British Airways wants an American affiliate to feed its lucrative, cartel-controlled trans-Atlantic routes and, perhaps later on, a full-fledged American subsidiary. **********But American law, like that of most other countries, prohibits foreign control of domestic airlines. So the two carriers worked out a deal that gives the United States Transportation Department a fig leaf to approve the near-acquisition of USAir, if it is so inclined. **********For $750 million, USAir would sell just a minority interest to British Airways. But the two carriers would coordinate their American and trans-Atlantic operations, with British Air having enough say to erase any doubts about who was really running the shop. The two would also share flight codes in the travel agents' reservation systems, allowing them to sell a single ticket from anywhere USAir flies to anywhere British Airways goes. **********But there is more to the deal than a wad of cash for USAir, a speculative investment for British Airways and a marketing gimmick for both. The dream, notes Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, is ""seamless service to Europe and parts beyond,"" with synchronized schedules, Euro-chic service and perhaps even the Union Jack logo on USAir tails. **********More Americans would have better airline service at home and abroad. Both carriers would still rely heavily on aircraft made in America. USAir flights would still be piloted and serviced by American workers. What is not to like? **********Plenty, if you are an American airline executive who is itching to fly from city to city within Europe and cannot buy the right for all the marks in the Bundesbank. Led by Robert L. Crandall, the fire-breathing chairman of American Airlines, the big American carriers are demanding open skies abroad as British Airways' dowry in the proposed marriage to USAir. **********Mr. Stelzer notes that the Crandall demand cannot possibly be met since Britain has no right to negotiate on the European Community's behalf. He would ask for more air access to and within Britain, but believes that the British Air deal is worth blessing, even if the concession proves to be unilateral. And negotiating from this perspective, he acknowledged, would be ""like pointing a gun at your foot and threatening to shoot."" **********But other economists believe tough bargaining is the order of the day. Daniel Kasper at the Harbridge House consulting firm in Boston thinks ""the risk is not large"" that the British would turn Washington down flat on proposals to give American carriers a better toehold in Britain: British Airways has too much to lose. And since USAir admits there is no immediate threat to its survival if the deal falls through, a hard line from Washington would be credible. **********Michael Levine, an executive vice president of Northwest Airlines, notes that more is at stake than a few more gates at London's Heathrow Airport or landing rights at a few more British cities. If Washington could work out a mutually attractive bargain in which British Air gained access to the huge domestic American market, he reasons that Air France, Lufthansa and Alitalia would no longer be able to take much comfort in Fortress Europe. Then they, too, would have strong incentives to support a grand bargain that opened both the American and European air markets to trans-Atlantic rivals. **********Consider, too, the wheels within the negotiating wheels. British Airways may not relish the prospect of stiffer competition at home from Delta, American and United. But British concessions now would set a precedent for the Continent -- one that served British Airways' perceived long-term interest in unrestrained competition within Europe. ""It's a win-win situation,"" concluded Mr. Kasper. **********USAir is pressing for pre-election approval by the Bush Administration, which has veered from a hard line on foreign airline investment to a very soft one. But with high-volume opposition coming from American and Delta, which both have big payrolls in tightly contested Texas, the decision will probably be put off. And no matter who wins in November, the betting now is that Britain will have to give something to get what it wants."

Milken's motive for masterminding a securities fraud and embezzlement scheme was his sense of desperation in the face of growing competition in 1985 to his junk bond empire at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the prosecution contended yesterday in Federal court in Manhattan. **********The assertion was offered by an assistant United States attorney, Karen J. Patton, in her closing argument in the trial of Alan E. Rosenthal, a protege and close friend of Mr. Milken's at Drexel who is charged with helping Mr. Milken carry out the conspiracy. **********The case, which goes to the jury today, has raised a number of questions on why Mr. Milken, who seemed at the pinnacle of unparalleled American financial success in the mid-1980's, would risk committing the crimes to which he pleaded guilty in 1990. Faced Growing Competition **********Part of the answer, Ms. Patton said yesterday, was that Mr. Milken was ""desperate"" in the face of growing competition from other Wall Street firms, like First Boston and Merrill Lynch, which were bent on taking bigger shares of the highly profitable junk bond business. As a result, she said, Mr. Milken felt compelled to help David R. Solomon, the head of a $2 billion investment fund, cheat on his 1985 taxes in order to keep his investments at Drexel Burnham. **********And in giving Mr. Solomon a number of ""big favors,"" Ms. Patton said, Mr. Rosenthal was given the task of carrying them out. **********But Mr. Rosenthal's lawyer, Peter Fleming, argued that the case against his client depended on witnesses like Mr. Solomon, who was given immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony, and Mr. Milken, who is seeking a reduction of his 10-year prison sentence. **********Referring to a statement by prosecutors that Mr. Milken's ""cooperation"" thus far had only ""limited"" law enforcement value, Mr. Fleming said ""Mr. Milken hasn't produced any scalps so far."" **********""Alan Rosenthal is the only scalp left,"" Mr. Fleming said, continuing in a mournful tone: ""Alan Rosenthal is Michael Milken's only ticket, and I'm not going to blame him,"" adding that any man serving a 10-year prison term, ""may not be strong enough to resist."" **********But law enforcement officials said they believed that Mr. Milken's testimony did not help the prosecutors that much and might have helped the defense more. As a result, they said they did not believe Mr. Milken had helped his chances for a substantial reduction of his sentence, which could end in two years when he becomes eligible for parole. **********If convicted on all counts, Mr. Rosenthal faces more than 40 years in prison."

""Optimism is a luxury."" **********After hopes for a democratic Myanmar were brutally crushed by the junta when it ignored election results in 1990 and jailed and tortured many of the winning candidates, optimism, he said, is a thing still easily smothered by fear. **********Foreign diplomats in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, admit they are also puzzled by elements of the Government's decree. They say there is great -- and justifiable -- suspicion over the motives of the soldier who now appears to be running the country, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the 52-year-old director of Myanmar's secret police. Pictures of Prisoners **********In tea houses and noodle stands along the steamy, tree-shaded sidestreets of Yangon, formerly Rangoon, people this week have been hunched over copies of the Government newspaper, The Working People's Daily, to study the grainy photographs of the 19 political prisoners who have been released so far. **********""She looks very thin,"" said a shopkeeper eating breakfast at a noodle stand on Pansodan Street, pointing to the photograph of Ma Theingi, a writer who was Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's personal assistant. On Sunday, Ms. Theingi was released from detention in Yangon's notorious Insein Prison. **********Between spoonfuls of an aromatic noodle soup flavored with banana stem and a sprinkling of fried garlic, the shopkeeper looked at the photograph again and again. **********""Mah Theingi is not smiling in the photograph,"" he said. ""The other political prisoners are smiling. Why isn't Mah Theingi smiling? Perhaps she knows this is a trick. We all hope these developments mean more openness. But we all know this could be a trick."" **********The shopkeeper and a group of friends stopped their loud chattering -- their faces froze, in fact -- when a Western reporter, traveling in Myanmar on a tourist visa since journalists are officially banned from the country, asked them about the soldier whose picture appeared on the front page of the newspaper, General Khin Nyunt. **********""This man is very powerful,"" whispered one of the friends, brave enough to say something about General Khin Nyunt but not brave enough to actually utter his name in a place where strangers might be listening. Informers working for the general's secret police are thought to be everywhere. **********Several Western and Asian diplomats in Yangon say they believe that General Khin Nyunt engineered the moves that began Thursday night with the announcement that the chairman of the junta, General Saw Maung, had stepped down because of ill health. **********His health problems were not specified in the announcement, although diplomats say that the 64-year-old general suffered a nervous breakdown. **********Last December, as he was about to tee off at a golf tournament, he reportedly started screaming, for no apparent reason, ""I am the great King Kyanzittha! I am great King Kyanzittha!"" a reference to a monarch of the ancient Pagan empire. At recent public gatherings, he has been incoherent. Known as Slorc **********The junta calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council and is better known by Myanmar's large English-speaking population by the acronym Slorc. **********""Essentially, Khin Nyunt is running Slorc,"" said a Western diplomat. **********""Saw Maung seems to have been the bottleneck to progress,"" said another diplomat. ""Khin Nyunt is no angel, of course. But he seems to be much more pragmatic, more sophisticated than his colleagues. He knows that something has to be done to prevent Burma from being isolated any further in the international community."" **********[ That isolation eased some on Tuesday when Myanmar's Foreign Minister and his Bangladesh counterpart signed an agreement under which Myanmar will accept the return of thousands of Burmese Muslims who fled across the border since early 1991, charging they were driven out of Myanmar, which is predominantly Buddhist. More than 200,000 Burmese Muslims are now in living in squalid camps in Bangladesh. ] Power Believed to Be Shared **********Others in diplomatic circles say that General Khin Nyunt's power is still far from absolute, and that his authority is shared with other generals, most notably Than Shwe, who is now the junta's titular chairman, and Ne Win, the architect of the 1962 coup that began three decades of xenophobic authoritarian rule in Myanmar. **********Among those freed last weekend was the nation's last democratically elected Prime Minister, 85-year-old U Nu, who had been held under house arrest since December 1989. He was reported by his family to be in good health. **********To no one's surprise in Yangon, the order did not include Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, the charismatic leader of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement and the dissident whom junta members often angrily refer to in their speeches simply as ""that woman."" **********The daughter of Aung San, the nation's founder, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been held under house arrest in Yangon since July 1989. Last year she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize for her nonviolent campaign to bring democracy to Myanmar. **********On Saturday, it was announced that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's British husband and their two children would be allowed to meet with her for the first time in more than two years. Could Remain a Prisoner **********There has been no suggestion that she will be released anytime soon from her family's gracious lakeside home on Yangon's University Avenue, and diplomats say that unless she agrees to leave Myanmar and renounce politics -- something she has refused to do -- Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi could remain a prisoner of the junta for years. **********As the head of the nation's secret police, the Directorate of the Defense Services Intelligence, General Khin Nyunt is thought to be well aware of, if not actually directing, the Government-sanctioned torture and killing of junta opponents allied with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. **********In its 1991 report on international human rights practices, the State Department found credible evidence ""to suggest a number of civilian deaths at the hands of government officials or soldiers"" in Myanmar, and that political opponents were routinely tortured by methods that included electric shock, cigarette burns, suffocation and sleep and food deprivation.                    --------------------       Military Operations to Stop **********BANGKOK, Thailand, April 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- The military government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, announced today that it would suspend military operations against the nation's best-armed rebel group in hopes of negotiatiating a peaceful settlement to an insurgency that began more than four decades ago. **********The announcement, carried on Myanmar's state radio, amounted to an admission that Government troops would be unable to overrun the ethnic Karen rebels during the dry season, which ends in a few weeks. **********Earlier in the year, the junta vowed that it would take the Karen headquarters, Manerplaw, by March 27, Armed Services Day. It missed that deadline, although Government forces did capture several other Karen strongholds in fierce battles."

But the way prices fell defied the strange logic that normally governs trading patterns. **********""We weren't surprised that the Fed didn't move,"" one government securities trader said. ""But the market is fixated on that. And when they don't move when the market thinks they might, it causes everything to be for sale."" **********While prices of most securities fell off their highs, bond prices, which had been up by nearly 3/4 point early in the day, were hit the hardest. Prices of shorter-term notes, which would have benefited most had the Fed moved to ease policy quickly, barely budged. **********Dealers said a lack of interest from retail investors forced bond prices down from their highs. With the Treasury scheduled to auction $10 billion worth of bonds on Thursday, the final leg of its quarterly refunding auctions, there are few compelling reasons for clients to buy long-term issues now, the dealers said. **********By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10226/32 , up 3/32 , to yield 7.75 percent, compared with 7.76 percent late Thursday and 7.75 percent on Jan. 31. Shortly after the employment data were released, the price of the benchmark issue rose to a high of 103 5/8. **********Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 1029/32 in late trading, up a 1/4 point, to yield 7.16 percent. Prices of the 6.25 percent five-year notes rose by 5/32 , to 9918/32 , to yield 6.35 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9930/32 , up 9/32 , to yield 4.90 percent.  Short-Term Rates Fall **********Short-term Treasury bill rates fell sharply, as traders remained hopeful the Fed would soon lower its target on the overnight Federal funds rate from its current level of 4 percent. **********In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.72 percent, down 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 11 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.75 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.87 percent."

The billionaire founder of the giant Hyundai industrial group, Chung Ju Yung, drew about 16 percent. Takes Office in February **********Kim Young Sam, who turns 65 on Sunday, will take office in February, succeeding Roh Tae Woo. Mr. Roh, a former general who narrowly defeated both Kims in the country's first open election five years ago, is constitutionally prohibited from serving another term. **********In a campaign dominated by fears that the country's competitive edge is eroding after years of remarkable growth, the vote for Kim Young Sam seemed driven by a national desire for stability. **********While he promised moderate change, Mr. Kim merged his own party with President Roh's in 1990, abandoning a lifetime served in the opposition. Since then he has closely associated himself with the Roh Administration's policies on everything from keeping American troops based here to a growing dialogue with the Communist Government in North Korea. Vote Shows 'Desire for Change' **********Speaking at a news conference this morning to declare victory, Mr. Kim said the vote ""shows the people's desire for change and reform amid stability."" **********Perhaps more importantly, he also won the grudging respect, though not the affection, of South Korea's military elite. In 1987, there were rumors of military intervention if anyone but Mr. Roh was elected. This year there was none of that, and Western diplomats here say they expect the military to stay out of politics in coming years. **********""They can live with him,"" a senior United States official said not long ago. **********Mr. Kim will inherit management of what may be the most critical transition Seoul has faced since the Korean War 40 years ago: Negotiating a permanent peace, and later a possible reunification, with the North, at a time that the Communist Government is still believed to be attempting to build nuclear weapons. **********Seoul's fear is that the North Korean economy could collapse, costing the nation hundreds of billions of dollars that otherwise would be spent competing with Japan and the United States and moving South Korea to a more advanced phase of its development. **********Though he has long been a fixture in South Korean politics Mr. Kim, the only son of a weathly shipping and fishing magnate, remains something of a mystery to many Koreans. At the age of 26, before the Korean War, he was secretary to the then prime minister, and was elected to Parliament nine times. At moments in his career he has taken large risks, once even staging a 23-day hunger strike to demand that the Government permit far greater liberty in South Korea. Reputation for Honesty **********In a country marked by political corruption, Mr. Kim enjoys a strong reputation for honesty. Yet he speaks in vague terms and sometimes seems to have a loose grasp on complex national issues. His critics have described him as an opportunist whose lifetme ambition to become President has compromised his judgment. **********In 1990, Mr. Kim calculated that he stood a better chance of getting elected by joining Mr. Roh's party than by staying in the opposition. So he announced a merger with the ruling Democratic Liberal Party in return for what many suspsect was an informal guarantee that he would be the party's candidate for president this year. Though many of his supporters were angry and alienated, Friday's results showed that many more came back to the fold. **********In the days leading up to Friday's election, Mr. Kim's candidacy seemed threatened by a scandal in his hometown area of Pusan, where the mayor and a variety of intelligence and police officials were secretly recorded plotting a way to assure his election. But there was no evidence that their activities were santioned by Mr. Kim, and in the end it seemed to have cost him relatively little support. **********The surprise in the campaign was the relatively weak performance of Mr. Chung, whose enormous wealth -- he is reportedly worth $4 billion to $6 billion -- and his powerful reputation as a leader of Korea's best-known industrial group made him a daunting candidate. Kim Young Sam's supporters feared he would split the country's conservative vote, handing the election to Kim Dae Jung. But in the end, the 77-year old Mr. Chung's popularity waned. A Final Setback **********The results were perhaps the final setback for the 67-year-old Kim Dae Jung, who was making his third try for the presidency. Known in the West as the man who survived death sentences, imprisonment and exile in the cause of bringing democracy to South Korea, he was unable to persuade the country's voters that he would not quash the nation's economic miracle. **********While he performed strongly in his southern stronghold of Cholla, where he had upwards of 90 percent of the vote, he barely won in the critical precincts of Seoul. He needed a big win in the capital, his supporters said, to make up for his unpopularity throughout much of the rest of the country. **********Today, Kim Dae Jung conceded that he had feen fairly defeated and announced his retirement from politics. Milestone for Democracy **********For Korea, Friday's election marked a major milestone in the country's democratization. Unlike the 1987 election in which Mr. Roh took office with 36 percent of the vote, today there were no major accusations of disappearing ballots, intimidation at the polls or computer fraud in the counting. **********""In 1987 there was a lot of vote buying,"" said Chung Won Bok, a 45-year-old worker at Korea Telecom, as he stood on the steps of a polling place in a working-class neighborhood on the western fringes of Seoul on Friay. ""I even received a little present from a candidate then,"" he said. **********But this year, he added, ""I've seen very little of that."" **********All day long Korean families could be seen lining up, many with young children in tow, outside schools and neighborhood offices, clutching their national identity cards and the small stamps used in many Asian nations to seal important documents. Each was given a numbered paper ballot, stuffed into giant green metal bins at more than 15,000 locations across the country. At times the atmosphere seemed festive, with friends moving from the polling places to coffee houses and department stores after voting."

And while there is widespread feeling that the Saudis are bluffing, it raises anew the question of how far oil-importing nations should go along to get along. **********To Morris Adelman, professor emeritus of economics at M.I.T., the Saudis' reported motive, pique at the prospect of an anti-greenhouse tax on carbon fuels, is just a frustrating reminder that OPEC's efforts to raise oil prices have always been vulnerable to strategic countermeasures. Philip Verleger, an oil specialist at the Institute of International Economics in Washington, is more cautious: The Saudi tilt, he suggests, is a warning that the West would be well advised to curb carbon in ways less likely to provoke confrontation. **********According to news reports last week, Saudi Arabia had planned to raise output this summer in order to keep oil prices near the current $18-$21 a barrel benchmark at a time of rising demand. But the Saudis changed their mind, serving notice that they would no longer champion price moderation if the industrialized nations went along with a European Community proposal to tax carbon emissions. **********Mr. Verleger doubts the Saudis are showing all their cards. The carbon-tax proposal, he notes, was already dead on arrival at the Rio environmental summit since the Bush Administration is not buying it, and the Europeans will not go it alone. **********The real story, Mr. Verleger speculates, goes something like this. Oil prices spiked a bit before the OPEC meeting, perhaps on rumors of an assassination attempt on the King of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis then quietly decided to allow prices to stay up for a few months as a gift to the financially pressed (and politically unstable) governments of Venezuela and Nigeria -- but chose to use the occasion to register their protest over carbon taxes. **********This fits with the near-consensus view that Saudi Arabia's strategy for long-term survival -- an image of moderation built around stable oil prices -- has not really changed. It also meshes with the view that the Saudis no longer believe they could keep prices much above the current level without racheting down the flow of oil below the rate that keeps them in Rolexes and Range Rovers. **********Mr. Adelman, who has long believed that the importers were foolish to concede any price-setting power to OPEC, says the Saudis have done us a favor. The right course, he argues, is full speed ahead on conservation. **********He says the Saudis are right to worry about carbon taxes. For while the money would initially come out of the pockets of consumers, the ultimate incidence of carbon tax, like any other excise tax, would turn on how buyers and sellers responded. And since energy consumers have substantial capacity to shift to energy-conserving technologies, the tax would almost certainly reduce the price of oil at the wellhead. **********While other energy analysts do not disagree with the thrust of Mr. Adelman's analysis, many still fear there is risk to playing hardball. Jack Riggs, the staff director of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, guesses that the Saudis do perceive some flexibility in long-term pricing -- surely not the $10 or $15 a barrel assumed by OPEC hawks in the 1970's, but perhaps a few dollars. And it hardly seems wise to provoke them to try for a higher price if importing countries can find producer-friendlier ways to meet policy objectives. **********That, of course, leaves open the question of how to put meat on these worthy bones. One way, suggests Mr. Verleger, would be to use free markets -- but not taxes -- to limit carbon emissions. **********The model is the trading system now in place for sulfur. An overall national limit on sulfur emissions was set in the 1990 Clean Air Act, with each polluting electric utility assigned a quota according to past rates of emissions. The utilities are now free to clean up their own mess, or to buy emissions rights from others who can trap sulfur at lower cost. **********The design and enforcement of a trading system for carbon would be far more problematic because there are so many sources of emissions. But economists at the Environmental Defense Fund say it could be done. And the ends, least-cost adjustment to fossil fuel conservation, would be identical to that achievable through a carbon tax. **********The one big difference is that the Government would not collect a giant pot of money. That might be seen as a big disadvantage by people who would use the tax to fund the budget. But it could prove a big advantage in dealing with Saudi Arabia, which apparently sees itself in competition with governments for the oil consumer's dollar."

But like the country as a whole, it is suddenly troubled by the long suppressed memory of the Vichy Government's persecution of Jews during World War II. **********On the outskirts of town, just a couple of miles from a central square where old men play boules and the wind carries the waft of fermenting grapes, stands a former prison camp. Several thousand people, many of them Jews, were held there by the French authorities for more than a year during the war before being herded into trucks for the journey to Nazi concentration camps and death. **********Today, the camp is a vast expanse of crumbling yellowish barracks, their walls pockmarked with bullet holes, their red-tile roofs toppling, their floors a mass of rubble and barbed wire. No sign identifies the place or commemorates what happened here, as if its lack were a token of a collective will to forget. **********""The army owns this land and wants to hang on to it,"" Andre Bascou, the Mayor of Rivesaltes, said as he surveyed the desolate scene. ""And frankly, nobody in town has paid much attention to the camp or been aware of what happened here. The memory just faded from generation to generation."" A Survivor's Story **********But for Paul Niedermann, a former inmate of the camp, the memory is vivid. He was taken with his family to Rivesaltes in 1941 when he was 13 years old. In the summer of 1942, his mother was moved to Auschwitz and his father to Maidanek, Poland, where they died in gas chambers. ""France has never taken up this chapter of its past,"" said Mr. Niedermann, now 64. **********Troubled by the country's wartime record, France has avoided teaching what happened at places like Rivesaltes. Rather, official attention has focused on the French Resistance and on the London-based Free French Forces of de Gaulle. **********But in recent weeks, as the country has marked the 50th anniversary of the herding of 12,884 Parisian Jews into a cycling stadium in preparation for deportation, a national debate has started over the camps and the oblivion into which they have been allowed to fall. France's wartime Government, led by Marshal Philippe Petain and based in Vichy after the Germans prevailed in 1940, deported 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps. Only 2,600 returned. **********Intellectuals and members of the Jewish community, angered by the acquittal last April of the wartime militia chief Paul Touvier, have been pressing President Francois Mitterrand to apologize in the name of France for the deeds of Vichy. No such apology has ever been made. In his annual Bastille Day television interview last week, Mr. Mitterand argued that since it was the Vichy Government that committed the atrocities, ""the Republic should not be held to account."" **********The so-called Vel d'Hiv committee, named after the Velodrome d'Hiver stadium where Jews were held after the roundup in Paris on July 16, 1942, replied in a statement: ""We are told that the Republic was not involved in Vichy's actions. Yet Vichy was served by French administrators, French judges and French police who agreed en masse to pledge obedience to Petain, to carry out inhuman orders and, at times, to take criminal initiatives themselves."" **********The exchange illustrates the uneasiness and even outright anger that characterize France's recent efforts to confront its wartime past. This discomfort is evident in Rivesaltes, where a gulf divides the town and its bleak, almost forgotten camp. **********""Of course there was moral and physical distress in the camp,"" said Jean Baills, a 69-year-old town official. ""But that was shared by everyone at the time, Jews and others. We were all afraid of the Germans. I myself was sent to a labor camp in Germany. So it was pretty much the same for everyone."" 'Nothing to Be Ashamed Of' **********Mayor Bascou said he had been shocked by a recent cover story in the weekly Nouvel Observateur, which, citing research by a historian, provided details of the horrors of the Rivesaltes camp. The article said the site was one of 17 camps holding a total of 40,000 Jews in February 1941. **********""That article said the town of Rivesaltes felt ashamed,"" said the Mayor, who is 44 years old. ""But we have nothing to be ashamed of. We did not know what was going on."" **********Mr. Niedermann, the camp survivor, said he and his family were arrested in Karlsruhe in western Germany in October 1940. Along with 6,500 other German Jews, he was placed in one of nine trains that initially carried prisoners to a camp in southwestern France called Gurs. **********""We were handed over to French authorities, who enthusiastically took over where the Nazis left off,"" said Mr. Niedermann, now a photographer and translator. ""Southern France was then a free zone, and we could have been put on boats to Africa."" **********Nearly six months later, in March 1941, the family was transferred by Vichy police officers to the Rivesaltes camp, where food was scarce and rats were abundant. Mr. Niedermann and his younger brother Arnold, who now lives in Los Angeles, stayed there until the summer of 1942, when they escaped with help from a Jewish organization set up to save children. **********Their parents were deported a few months later on the first of eight convoys from Rivesaltes that ultimately took nearly 2,000 Jews, including 135 children, to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps. **********""France must talk about what happened. The fact is collaboration with the Nazis worked extensively in this country,"" Mr. Niedermann said. **********In Rivesaltes today, a visitor finds a monument topped by a Star of David in an obscure spot near the back wall of a Catholic cemetery called St.-Andre.  Five Plastic Tulips **********Starting with the name of Rosa Adel and ending with that of Wasyl Zwin, the monument commemorates the 120 Jews who died of starvation and illness in the camp. Beside it, five dirty plastic tulips stand in a vase. **********Although the dates of their deaths are recorded, the birth dates are not, as if nobody was prepared to take the time to find out. **********As for the camp itself, there is some talk of turning it into a museum. ""But the army does not want to sell it,"" the Mayor said, ""because it's in a strategic position and occasionally they use it for firing practice."""

He said Europeans should ""shut down"" Yugoslavia economically. **********From the beginning of old Yugoslavia's dissolution a year ago, the Germans have actively supported the breakaway republics and critical of the Serbs. Germany first pressed for recognition of Slovenia and Croatia when the United States argued for restraint. **********Now the Germans and the Bush Administration find themselves on the same side of the debate over sanctions against Yugoslavia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, a Serbian nationalist as well as an old-line Communist. Now a Matter of the Details **********As the European Community searches for a common approach on a response to Serbian attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Portuguese spokesman for the community's rotating presidency declared here today that new sanctions were coming. ""But we must now choose which ones,"" he said. **********France and Greece have been reported reluctant to treat the truncated Yugoslavia -- the former republics of Serbia and Montenegro -- too harshly. **********Mr. Baker returned to the Bosnian matter in a speech he delivered here today at the opening session of a 62-nation meeting on aid to the former Soviet republics. ""I call upon every state and organization at this conference,"" he said, ""to use whatever influence you have to make known that there is a cost for aggression and that the world demands safe passage for humanitarian convoys and the opening of Sarajevo airport immediately."" **********He asked those present to ""join in a collective effort to mobilize our political, diplomatic, economic influence to make it plain there's a price to be paid for blocking peace and terrorizing innocent peoples."" **********On Friday, the United States announced that it was expelling a number of Yugoslav diplomats and closing two of three Yugoslav consulates. Mr. Baker also said that he had decided not to send back the American Ambassador, Warren Zimmermann, who is in Washington for consultations. Links with the Yugoslav military will be broken, too, Mr. Baker said. **********The European foreign ministers met over lunch today to discuss the Bosnian crisis, but deferred decisions on their response until the meeting Tuesday. **********The leader of ethnic Serbs in Bosnia who have joined the Yugoslav military in opposing the independence of the republic is also in Lisbon, urging Europeans to think twice about sanctions. **********The official, Radovan Karadzic, has been taking part in the community's discussions with all the Bosnian ethnic groups. He told reporters today that the Americans and Europeans were risking ""a total Balkan war"" if they instituted more crippling economic measures against Belgrade."

Another, more subtle, reason might be that in many ways the story that the movie tells echoes the retailing giant's recent travails. **********Like the eponymous alien in ""E.T."" who desperately desires to return home, so does Sears. This urge was underscored when the nation's third-largest retailer disclosed in September that it would divest itself of securities, real-estate and credit-card subsidiaries to return to concentrating on its traditional retail operations. **********""We're all gratified they're trying to focus their attention and energies on what had been their core business,"" said Edward A. Weller, managing director at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. **********Sears, of course, prefers to ascribe the ""E.T."" encore, which begins with its sole sponsorship of CBS's repeat broadcast of the film Thanksgiving night, to the success of last year's promotion, offering shoppers the videotape of the film, plus an ""E.T."" poster, for $9.99. Sears also believes that ""E.T."" 's family appeal dovetails with the company's own emphasis on merchandise like hardware, appliances and apparel aimed at customers en famille. **********""This is a store whose unique appeal to the family is key to its success and the key to its future,"" said Tom Hall, president and chief executive at Ogilvy & Mather Chicago, the Sears agency. ""It's logical that on Thanksgiving, the day when families get together, we present the tradition of 'E.T.' "" **********Whatever the reasoning, retail analysts are skeptical about the ability of ""E.T."" to perform as well the second time as it did the first, when almost 500,000 videotapes were sold. **********""It sounds to me like what they're doing is more of the same,"" said Peter Siris, a vice president at UBS Securities in New York. **********Mr. Weller said, ""It's a rule of thumb in retailing that it's hard to go back to what you did last year and have it be just as effective."" **********Nevertheless, Sears is convinced that ""E.T."" redux will energize consumers during the all-important pre-Christmas period. **********""We're very confident 'E.T.' will deliver extraordinary results again,"" Ralph Hoch, national retail advertising manager at the Sears Merchandise Group in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said in a telephone interview. ""The challenge for us this year is what can we do to make it better."" **********So in a blizzard of television and radio commercials, print advertisements and direct-mail pieces, Ogilvy Chicago will shift strategies, playing down last year's image-building approach, which was intended to familiarize consumers with a new companywide theme, ""You can count on me."" **********For Christmas 1992, Mr. Hoch said, ""a greater percentage of time will be allocated to using the merchandise itself to demonstrate why Sears should be your store of choice."" **********And actual Sears workers will deliver that message in the television spots, carrying the subtheme ""You can count on Sears for all your Christmas wishes."" Their participation was meant, Mr. Hoch added, to dramatize the ""better service level"" that shoppers are supposed to find since the company introduced a program encouraging 175,000 sales employees to intensify customer service; compensation was revamped to decrease salaries in favor of higher commissions. **********Mr. Siris said: ""What's hurt Sears up until now has been a general perception its sales personnel are not the most helpful people in the world. But you're starting to get people in the stores who know if they don't come up and say 'Can I help you?,' they're not going to have a Christmas."" **********Mr. Hall said the service-oriented advertising was directed as much to employees as to customers. ""You're in effect holding up a standard of performance for an organization,"" he said. **********Mr. Hoch said Sears had ""a cautiously optimistic view of Christmas,"" hoping that recent sales gains of 2 to 3 percent in stores opened more than a year might continue through December. **********""Somewhere in the 1 to 5 or 6 percent range would be a very achievable objective for us,"" he added. Last year, sales in November in stores that had been open more than a year rose 2 percent from November 1990, but in December, they fell 1.5 percent from the December 1990 level. **********As it did last year, the ""E.T."" promotion will offer shoppers a chance to buy the videotape and poster, at a price that has been cut to $7.99. The offer will also include a certificate for a free 15-minute A.T.& T. long-distance telephone call during nights or weekends, valued at $2.25. **********Those wondering why Sears sweetened the promotion with free phone calls need only remember the plaintive words the anthropomorphic alien uttered during the film: ""E.T. phone home."""

Chrysler rose 1 1/4, to 16 3/8; Ford Motor was up 1 7/8, to 37 1/8, and General Motors was up 1 1/2, to 38 1/8. The companies hogged three of the top five spots on the New York Stock Exchange active list. **********Talk among analysts is that auto sales are expected to improve this spring as a result of the Federal Reserve's efforts to lower interest rates, and that the average car is now more than eight years old, so there is a replacement demand. Besides that, they note that the Japanese are raising their prices. **********John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president and director of research for Advest Inc., said he was surprised ""that the market did not react more negatively to the poor 30-year auction on Thursday and the fact that interest rates are backing up.""

B.P. Off 1 1/8, to 58 1/4 **********In trading yesterday, British Petroleum fell 1 1/8, to 58 1/4, as analysts said the company was not ruling out a future dividend cut, following disappointing 1991 earnings results released Thursday. Traders said John Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., did not think that a dividend cut was likely but that it might not be as safe as he had thought. **********Citing what he said was an accelerating earnings growth, Mark Gulley, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, raised his rating on Morton International, an industrial and consumer products company, to buy from hold. Mr. Gulley said investors were looking ahead at 1993 earnings as the company prepared to step up production of air bags for the 1994 car model year. **********The stock was up 2 1/8 yesterday, to 62 1/2."

The ads go on to say that Chesterfield shuns ""cheap filler tobacco"" and removes ""coarse stems,"" even though ""other companies chop 'em up and put 'em back in."" **********""We reckon it flat-out makes a better smoke,"" the ads, by Ogilvy & Mather New York, conclude. ""Try them and let us know what you think."" **********Those hoping to do so had better not call. Directory assistance has no listing for a Chesterfield Cigarette Company in Durham. There is, however, a listing for the Liggett Group, which markets brands like Eve, Lark -- and Chesterfield. **********Gerry Reid, senior vice president of marketing at Liggett, acknowledges the gimmick to revive the faded brand of cigarettes. **********""It's a nice little advertising homily, if you will,"" he said, meant to underscore Liggett's status as the smallest of America's six major tobacco companies. A red-brick Liggett factory in the ads does bear the Chesterfield name, he added. **********Faux corporate parentage is a common ploy in selling image-driven products. Though the Limited Inc. is based in Columbus, Ohio, advertising for its Express clothing stores make them seem French. And the Jack Daniel Distillery in tiny Lynchburg, Tenn., is actually owned by the giant Brown-Forman Corporation in Louisville, Ky. **********Yet Chesterfield's comeback bid goes beyond advertising its fanciful origins. Liggett is pursuing the risky strategy of selling the brand at full price -- $2.60 a pack or higher in some cities -- despite a strong counter-trend toward discount cigarettes, priced as low as $1.25 a pack. **********""They're running against the tide,"" said John Maxwell Jr., an analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond. ""Discount brands are almost a third of the market,"" compared with 3 percent a decade ago, ""and it won't be too much longer before they're 40 percent."" **********The decision is doubly daunting because it was Liggett that kicked off the low-price boom in 1980 with cigarettes in plain wrappers or carrying store names in place of brand names. **********Yet about a year ago, Mr. Reid said, Liggett ""determined those brands were perhaps not the best strategy for financial growth and glory."" The primary reason was that sales of discount cigarettes had ballooned to 70 percent of Liggett's total volume -- though their profit margins are 30 to 50 percent below those of full-price brands. **********So Liggett resumed advertising some full-price brands like Eve and Lark, and decided to introduce another to be promoted as a higher-quality product, Mr. Reid said. After testing a number of trademarks, he continued, ""we found the idea was significantly enhanced by the Chesterfield trademark."" **********Ross Sutherland, senior vice president and executive creative director at Ogilvy New York, said: ""There is a lot of equity in old brand names."" **********""Americans have a certain place in their hearts for names that ring a familiar bell,"" he added. ""To let them vanish is so short-term."" **********And Chesterfield, with an unfiltered version brought out in 1912 that is still sold, is one of America's oldest brand names. From the 1920's through 1950's, Chesterfield vied for supremacy against brands including Camel, Lucky Strike and Old Gold. Advertising with ""Chesterfield Girls"" like Lucille Ball (before ""I Love Lucy"") and endorsers like Jack Webb of ""Dragnet"" urged smokers to ""Always buy Chesterfield"" because ""They satisfy,"" a theme echoed in the new campaign's slogan, ""Slow to burn. Sure to satisfy."" **********Though ads continued through the 60's -- featuring a band marching through a tobacco field playing a brassy jingle, ""Twenty-one great tobaccos make 20 wonderful smokes"" -- Chesterfield by then had been overwhelmed by filtered brands like Winston and Marlboro. **********Though two previous efforts in the 60's and 80's to popularize filtered Chesterfields failed -- as did the ""silly millimeter longer"" 101-millimeter version -- Mr. Sutherland said the third time could be the charm because of the concept of selling the brand as ""a quality product that on paper, you could justify at a premium price."" **********""Smokers don't get many rewards today,"" he added. ""You can reward them with better value for the money."" **********Mr. Maxwell praised the strategy of introducing the cigarette into an intensely competitive market with a known, rather than an unknown, brand name. **********""If everybody's heard of Chesterfield, but haven't tried it recently, it might be easier to launch,"" he added, because Liggett might be able to spend less than the $50 million to $100 million required to familiarize smokers with a new brand. **********R. J. Reynolds has found success with that strategy, updating its 79-year-old Camel brand with a filter and the hip ""Joe Camel"" advertising character. **********Mr. Reid said Liggett planned to spend more than $20 million to reintroduce filtered Chesterfields, which is ""more than the company spent in the last five or six years"" on all its brands. **********And if Chesterfield is resurrected, he added, Liggett might try to revive L&M, its popular 50's filter brand. **********If so, there is an obvious faux corporate name by which to reintroduce it: the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, Liggett's original name and the source of the ""L"" and ""M"" in L&M."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/09/business/all-about-composting-two-towns-experiment-with-the-alchemy-of-trash.html,John Holusha,1992-08-09,,1574,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,All About/Composting; Two Towns Experiment With the Alchemy of Trash,All About/Composting; Two Towns Experiment With the Alchemy of Trash," **********Earlier this year, about 400 households in Greenwich and Fairfield, Conn., took a big step forward in their longstanding trash-recycling program. For a month, they set up ""wet bags"" to collect table scraps, soiled paper and yard clippings. While such garbage is unsuitable for the usual recycling sorting bins, it can be composted. **********The results, measured in the further reduction of trash that would otherwise clog landfills and incinerators, make conventional recycling of cans, bottles and paper seem like only a half measure. But the time and space needed for large-scale composting make the chances slim that any but the most dedicated of communities will even experiment with the process. **********The point of the exercise, which was organized in March by an unusual alliance of the National Audubon Society and the Procter & Gamble Company, was to see how much more household trash could be diverted from landfills and incinerators by adding composting to the usual recycling methods. In the two towns, recycling alone had diverted about 40 percent of household garbage by weight. That still left most for incineration. **********The experiment's results exceeded the sponsors' expectations, said Jan Beyea, chief scientist for the Audubon Society. **********Using a paper bag lined with cellophane (which resists seepage like plastic, but is derived from plants) for the organic materials allowed families to keep an additional 30 percent of their garbage out of the trash can. That lifted the total recycling rate to 70 percent. **********""Everybody seemed to love it,"" Mr. Beyea said. ""We were not prepared for such a positive reaction."" **********Despite such enthusiasm by sponsors and residents, the experiment is not likely to be repeated or expanded. That is because large amounts of household trash would overwhelm the small municipal composting plant in Fairfield, which is kept busy producing compost from sewage sludge and yard waste like leaves and grass clippings. **********Still, Mr. Beyea and other experts on solid-waste disposal say the experiment shows the value of composting garbage and points the way for larger projects in other areas. New in Recycling  Making Compost From Wet Garbage **********The idea in composting is to encourage the naturally occurring bacteria present in carbon-based materials to break complex chunks down into a relatively fine dirt-like substance. In the process the lined paper bag goes the way of its contents. **********Biological combustion has the welcome effect of reducing both the mass and volume of material, without dirtying the air the way incinerators do. Compost contains nutrients that are released slowly to plants, making it a useful addition to soils in landscaping, agriculture and nurseries. **********Since it retains water well, compost is useful in areas that have sandy, quick-draining soils, as in much of Florida, or where water for irrigation is in short supply, as in some areas of California. **********The compost produced in the Connecticut experiment is being tested to determine its purity and effectiveness compared with composts prepared by other methods. Some other methods have resulted in compost too contaminated with bits of plastic or pieces of bone to be used in agriculture. A final report is expected by yearend and it could spark more interest. **********Although composting is well known to gardeners, it is only gradually gaining adherence as a method of disposing household trash. Those who like the idea say it should be seen as a form of recycling because it removes material from garbage cans, processes it and creates a product with value. **********""We are saying that organics have a value as well as the glass, metal and paper that is now collected for recycling,"" said Charles Cannon, executive vice president of the Solid Waste Composting Council. The council is a trade group formed by Procter & Gamble, DuPont, Kraft General Foods and other corporations that generate, directly or indirectly, large amounts of waste to promote composting. An Unusual Alliance  Environmentalists And Corporations **********If widely adopted, composting could have a big impact on trash disposal. According to reports prepared for the Environmental Protection Agency, leaves and other yard waste, food scraps and paper that are not likely to be recycled make up about 50 percent of municipal waste nationally. Since all are composed of carbon compounds, they are adaptable to the composting process. **********""Conventional recycling is only going to get 15 to 20 percent of solid waste,"" said Bruce Jones, who is a composting specialist at Procter & Gamble. ""But when you look at the organic fraction, it's 50 percent. That could have a big impact on waste management."" **********He said he and Mr. Beyea had a common interest in the subject and decided on the joint project, thereby forging an alliance between one of the nation's leading environmental groups and one of the largest consumer products companies. **********""Jan and I had been talking and we said let's do something to show how effective recycling and composting can be,"" Mr. Jones said. ""We decided to get our hands dirty and show how it could work."" **********One of the things they did was recruit the Greenwich chapter of the Audubon Society to help coordinate the project and set up a toll-free number for people who had questions or needed more bags. Of the 225 calls logged, only 7 were from people complaining that the extra separation was too much effort. **********Although the two organizations collaborated on the project, they do not see eye to eye on everything. To keep compost from becoming contaminated by undesirable materials, like pesticides, that households discard, Mr. Beyea favors separating the organic materials for the compost in the home, as was done in Connecticut. Mr. Jones and P.&G. say that to better assure the purity of the compost, and to save on collection costs, the organic materials can be pulled out of the mix of trash. **********""We agreed to disagree,"" Mr. Beyea said. Dirt that Pays Balancing the Costs Against the Gains **********Processing trash by composting is still rare among cities, with only 19 having such operations, according to the composting council. But there are more than 2,000 facilities for composting leaves and yard waste across the country, and several hundred communities are planning to include composting in their future waste-disposal plans, association officials said. **********Most of the technology used in trash composting programs in this country originated in Europe. There, more densely populated countries ran out of landfill space before it became a problem the United States paid much attention to. **********As with most recycling programs, the economics of composting are driven more by the costs of getting rid of trash than by the value of the recovered material. **********""The cost of building a facility is $4.5 million to $8 million per hundred tons per day,"" depending on the technology involved, Mr. Jones said. A publicly owned plant would have to charge a dumping fee of about $50 a ton to operate satisfactorily, while a tax-paying, profit-making private enterprise would probably need to charge nearly $80 a ton. **********Once a site has developed a reputation for producing high-quality compost that is low in contaminants and free of visible debris like plastic shards and stones, it could sell the product for $5 to $20 a ton, Mr. Jones said. **********Composting is considered a step below recycling in the environmental hierarchy because it converts some materials, like paper, into a lower-value material. So the organizers of the Greenwich-Fairfield program were careful to stress that residents should recycle paper wherever possible, rather than tossing it into the composting bag.  A CLEANER WORLD BUT, OH, THE SMELL **********Despite the admirable service composting plants perform in gobbling up trash and keeping the environment a little cleaner, no one wants one built next door. **********At least two major projects, one in Florida and another in Oregon, had to be shut down after nearby residents complained about foul odors coming from the plants. **********""Once the neighbors get a whiff from a plant, they do not forget about it,"" said Charles Cannon of the Solid Waste Composting Council. **********For that reason, even those favoring composting as a means of treating household trash, say that composting operations should be located as far away from people as possible. As long as the trash is not left sitting around too long, the process is not inherently particularly smelly. But the compounds produced when biological action takes place in the absence of oxygen tend to be smellier than those formed in an oxygen-rich environment. **********In heavily populated areas, the preferred solution is to enclose the process and maintain a slightly negative air pressure inside the building. That way, any random air flow comes from the outside in, not the other way. **********Of course, just as with the human lungs, air that is pulled in will eventually have to be exhausted. But by controlling airflow, plant operators can treat it to remove odors before it is released. **********The treatment of the air can be done chemically or biologically. In the latter, some composting plants in the United States filter their exhaust air through a thick layer of finished compost, peat moss and leaves. **********The microbes present in these materials break down the chemicals that cause the smells."

""They said yes."" **********Rebel Serbs in Croatia, backed by the Yugoslav National Army, went to war last year to enforce their demands for their own republic, now known as the Serbian Krajina Republic, which they clearly sought to link up with Serbia in a Yugoslav state. **********The seven-month conflict, which spread this spring to neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, left well over 10,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced before the United Nations mediated a successful cease-fire on Jan. 3. **********Krajina covers about a third of Croatia's territory and cuts across most of the republic's vital transportation arteries.

Ceredase is the first drug available to treat about 5,000 to 10,000 patients who suffer from Gaucher's disease, a genetic disorder. Genzyme shares closed at $39.375, off $3.625, in over-the-counter trading.

'There for the Taking' **********""They said the guarantees are there for the taking,"" said Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, referring to senior White House and State Department officials with whom he met last week in Washington after Mr. Rabin's Labor Party defeated the governing Likud Party in Israel's general elections. **********An official of another American Jewish group agreed that ""there definitely is a will to give Rabin a gift."" The official said a possibility was $2 billion in loan guarantees for one year, with any money that the new Government may spend on settlements subtracted from that figure. **********In the election campaign, Mr. Rabin accused the Likud Government of building ""political"" settlements. He says he will avoid this practice and build only communities considered necessary for Israel's security -- in and around Jerusalem, on the Golan Heights and in the Jordan Valley. But Mr. Rabin has left the details vague, and Mr. Siegman said in an interview that it was not clear if the Bush Administration would recognize such distinctions. **********A related question is how much of the construction in progress Washington will be willing to accept, even though in principle it wants a total freeze on settlements. The present Government says there are 16,500 housing units in assorted stages of construction across the territories, and it seems likely that Mr. Rabin will allow many to be completed and occupied.  The Comfort Zone **********The American officials would ""feel reasonably comfortable"" if about 5,000 units are finished, Mr. Siegman said. ""They would not feel comfortable much beyond that."" **********[ In Washington, Bush Administration officials say that they expect to have a much easier time negotiating the terms and conditions for loan guarantees with Mr. Rabin than they did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But, they add, the Israeli Government will still be expected to agree in some way to limit settlement building in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for the loan guarantees. Mr. Rabin is expected to visit the United States in late July or August to work out the arrangements with Mr. Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Congressional leaders. ] **********Mr. Rabin, whose party won the June 23 election but with only a plurality over Likud, assured himself a parliamentary majority Thursday night when he signed on the left-wing Meretz bloc and the Shas religious party as coalition partners. He is now assured of 62 votes in the 120-member Parliament, plus support from two Arab parties with 5 votes between them that will not actually be part of the Government. **********It is not quite the Government he would prefer, for it is too left-leaning for his taste and too vulnerable to collapse should one partner decide to leave. As a result, he continued today to try drawing in the right-wing Tsomet Party and a religious group, United Torah Judaism, in the hope of giving his alliance political balance and insurance against a one-party walkout. **********Whatever happens in this tug of war, it is clear that Mr. Rabin will enjoy a honeymoon period with Washington, if only because he is not Mr. Shamir, who was viewed by the Americans as intransigent and even untrustworthy in his insistence on expanding Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Confirming these suspicions, some Shamir opponents say, were remarks attributed to Mr. Shamir two weeks ago in an Israeli newspaper, Maariv. He was quoted as saying that he would have dragged out peace talks with the Palestinians for a decade while vastly increasing the settlers' numbers.  Silence Is Broken **********Through his spokesman, Mr. Shamir denied having made any such remarks, but he himself said nothing publicly despite repeated attempts to elicit direct comments. Today, he broke his silence in an interview with Israel radio, saying it was ""complete nonsense"" that he wanted to prolong autonomy talks that have moved along fitfully since they began last fall. **********""It's complete nonsense,"" he said when asked if that was his intention. ""It's total nonsense. Nobody thought of it."" **********There was no reason to drag out the talks, he said, because from the beginning he felt that Israel had a right to continue settlement activity even after the Palestinians gained some form of self-rule in the territories. **********""I never saw any contradiction between the existence of autonomy and Jewish settlement in those sections of the Land of Israel,"" he said. ""Therefore, what do I need to drag this out for?"""

The rise -- the fourth in the last six months -- suggests that the May decline in industrial production is not apt to continue. **********""We're not going down,"" said Rosanne Cahn, an economist at First Boston. ""This is more like a plateau than a triple dip."" **********But the backlog in order books continued to shrink, a sign both that executives remain cautious and that no significant revival in factory hiring is imminent. **********""A new pickup will have to wait for housing and consumer spending to react to lower mortgage rates, probably in August or September,"" Ms. Cahn said. ""Manufacturing will reflect that activity a month or two later."" **********Orders for all types of durables headed higher. **********Military goods, a particularly volatile category that accounted for about one-third of the rise in durables orders, jumped 17.6 percent in June after a 27.6 percent slide in May. **********More important, orders for capital goods -- an indication that business is determined to invest to raise efficiency -- increased nine-tenths of 1 percent in June after a 1.7 percent rise in May. The latest increases followed two back-to-back declines. **********Apart from military goods, the largest leap was for industrial machinery, a top United States export, which increased 4.5 percent after a small decrease in May. **********""Capital goods are on a bit of a rising trend,"" Ms. Cahn said. ""It reflects some of the strength of the economy early this year plus the introduction of new computer mainframes."" **********Primary metals like steel, copper and aluminum shot up 2.8 percent after a small gain in May. Electrical equipment grew 2.4 percent after a small loss the prior month. Transportation orders -- including aircraft -- were up 1.9 percent, but they had plunged 6.6 percent the month before."

United Nations officials said they had still not determined which group might have fired at the plane. Nor was it clear which faction fired at two United States helicopters that were searching for the wreckage, forcing them to withdraw. **********Gen. Ratko Mladic, the top army commander of the so-called Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, asserted that Croatian and Muslim fighters had downed the cargo plane. He denied any connection between Serbian forces and the downing of the plane. He made his accusation in a letter to Gen. Satish Nambiar of India, the commander of the United Nations peacekeeping forces. **********But President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia said the plane had been hit by missiles that came from an area controlled by Serbs. **********Neither General Mladic nor President Izetbegovic offered evidence for their statements. **********Italian Air Force and United Nations investigators arrived at the crash site today to inspect the wreckage of the G-222 twin-propeller airplane, which crashed in Jasenik, 20 miles west of the capital. All four crew members died. **********Witnesses told journalists and United Nations officials that at least one missile had hit the plane, but a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, Fernando del Mundo, said United Nations personnel had not yet found hard evidence to support these accounts. **********""The wreckage of the plane is strewn around an area of about 1.5 kilometers, which indicates there was some sort of explosion before impact,"" said Peter Kessler, a United Nations spokesman in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. **********Fighting between all the factions in Bosnia continued today, and diplomats said it was too early to tell whether there was progress in fulfilling commitments made last week at a London peace conference. Parliament Backs Premier **********In Belgrade, factions on the Serbian side that favor a conciliatory stance achieved a victory when the federal Parliament voted to endorse the policies of Prime Minister Milan Panic. But Serbian forces in the field are believed to pay far more attention to the Serbian Government, which is led by President Slobodan Milosevic. Serbia and Montenegro are the only two republics remaining in Yugoslavia. **********Mr. Panic, a Serbian-American millionaire, was appointed Prime Minister to improve Yugoslavia's image and help persuade the United States and European countries to lift economic sanctions, and he appears to have achieved a measure of support among people weary of the hardships caused by the sanctions. **********Mr. Panic favors adherence to Serbian promises to dismantle detention camps and turn over heavy weapons to United Nations forces. But negotiators express doubt that Mr. Milosevic will let these steps be carried out in full. **********Mr. Panic, for instance, has angered nationalist Serbs by advocating the recognition of Croatia and Bosnia within the borders that existed before the fighting began, in effect supporting withdrawal of Serbian forces from large areas of the republics. **********In London, representatives of all the factions agreed to end their sieges of various towns and cities and bring irregular militias under central control. The Serbs have also lifted their four-month siege of the mostly Muslim Bosnian town of Gorazde and allowed United Nations observers access to gun emplacements above Sarajevo, one diplomat said."

In addition, Mercury agreed to cut its rates by $10 million for new policyholders and not to seek any rate increase for at least a year, the California Insurance Department said. **********Mercury, which is based in Los Angeles, said that it had previously set aside $25.5 million to cover any rebates, and that it would take a charge in the current quarter of another $20.3 million to cover the rest.

The results seemed to be mixed. **********The brightest spot was provided by Jordan, which offered the Israelis a vision of peace that would include diplomatic relations. But the Israelis and the Syrians, and the Israelis and the Palestinians made little progress on determining the order and subjects of what is to be discussed, and they used their briefings after the talks to shower insults and contempt on one another. **********According to Middle East diplomats, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d plans to meet with the Arab and Israeli negotiators on Wednesday morning, in an apparent effort to energize the talks. **********Israel's chief negotiator, Yossi Ben-Aharon, said today that his negotiating teams were still scheduled to leave on Wednesday evening, and he dismissed criticism by the Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, over Israel's insistence in keeping to that schedule. **********The Israelis say they have been in Washington for a week waiting for the Arabs to arrive and they must now get back to their other jobs in Israel. Rival Agenda Proposals **********""Dr. Ashrawi doesn't work in any government,"" Mr. Ben-Aharon said. ""I am a Government official, and I have work to do in Israel."" **********To make matters stickier yet, the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is facing a potentially fatal political problem at home. Far-right parties in his Cabinet said today that they would bolt his coalition and presumably vote to bring him down if his negotiators so much as placed a proposal for Palestinian self-rule on the negotiating table.  [ Page A6. ] **********The Israeli and Jordanian negotiators and the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators each presented their proposed agendas, and there was apparently little similarity between them. This means it is likely to take weeks or months more to agree on how the negotiating teams will proceed in their talks. The one hopeful sign was provided by Jordan. **********The Jordanian spokesman, Marwan Mouasher, said, ""Our vision of peace -- when the issues between us are resolved -- would certainly include full cooperation including diplomatic relations."" **********Neither Syria nor Lebanon has held out such a vision to the Israelis if they will withdraw from territory captured in the 1967 war and occupied since. **********According to the invitation to the peace conference, the Israelis and Palestinians are supposed to begin by discussing ""interim self-government arrangements for the Palestinians"" in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. **********The reasons these old adversaries cannot quickly confront this issue are twofold. First is Mr. Shamir's political quandary. **********The two rightist parties, Tehiya and Moledet, believe that Israel must hold onto the West Bank forever. Together, they have five seats in the almost evenly divided Israeli Parliament, and their defection would leave Mr. Shamir two seats shy of a governing majority. Request for Loan Guarantees **********At the same time, the Bush Administration is in the final stages of preparing its response to Israel's request for $10 billion in housing loan guarantees, to help Israel to absorb immigrants. **********In order to help secure these guarantees, Israel must appear to be taking the peace talks seriously. **********This has created a situation in which Israeli officials at home are telling news organizations there that nothing is happening in Washington because all that the sides are discussing is the agenda, while the Israeli negotiators in here in Washington are telling the press that the discussions are beginning to focus on ""substance"" because agenda is substance. **********All Mr. Ben-Aharon would say was that Israel will submit its autonomy plan at an ""appropriate time."" Demand for Settlement Freeze **********The other serious hurdle for Israel to quick substantive discussion is that the Palestinians are asking their agreement, among other things, to immediately freeze the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem so as to create proper conditions for the talks. Israel rejects this demand. **********Although the Palestinians said today they will also present a self-rule plan, Mrs. Ashrawi declared: ""The most serious and the most important issue that has to be resolved in terms of immediate and decisive action would be the cessation of all settlement activities in the occupied territories -- territory. If they continue to steal the land literally from beneath our very feet, there is no reason to discuss any arrangements because the land will be gone."" **********Mrs. Ashrawi was asked whether the Palestinians would be prepared to suspend their intifada, or uprising, in the West Bank and Gaza, as the United States has suggested, in return for a suspension of the Israeli settlements. Palestinian's Reply **********She replied: ""Since we have given everything possible to give from the beginning, and Israel has taken everything possible from the beginning, I think that you should ask the Israelis what they should give. The intifada is a natural and normal reaction, a response to a very abnormal situation, which is the situation of occupation."" **********The Israelis' separate negotiations with the Syrians and with the Lebanese went nowhere again today. Israel continued to insist that it would not even discuss the question of exchanging all or part of the Golan Heights for peace with Syria until the Syrians agreed to recognize Israel, and the Syrians refuse to do that until they receive some commitment from Israel to withdraw from the Golan region. **********When Mr. Ben-Aharon, Israel's chief negotiator, was asked whether it would be helpful if Mr. Baker stepped in with a compromise proposal, he answered: **********""We have told, in no uncertain terms, our Americans friends not to get themselves involved in the substance of the negotiations. We believe most strongly and sincerely that it will not be conducive to progress. Once you introduce a third party, you may undermine the capacity of the two partners to the negotiations to achieve some kind of common ground."" **********The mood of the talks was best summed up by Syria's chief negotiator, Muwaffak Allaf, who told reporters after his session today: **********""We discussed for four hours, but we seem to be repeating ourselves. They continue to bring up subjects that we consider as irrelevant. They keep asking why we do not accept to respond to their questions. But those questions always concern things which we consider as the fruits of the peace process that we are undertaking. And whenever we answer like this they go back to another issue, which they have raised 10 times and go back once more to the previous issue."""

Baker 3d was trying to persuade former Soviet republics in recent weeks to give up their nuclear weapons, the only holdout was Kazakhstan. Though it ultimately went along, the largest nation of Central Asia was toying with the idea of using nuclear weapons as political bargaining chips to get international attention. **********The affairs of Kazakhstan, along with those of the other four former Soviet republics of Central Asia, have been largely overshadowed by developments in republics like Russia or Ukraine, which are better known outside the former Soviet Union. With their Islamic, often anti-Russian populations, moreover, the Central Asia countries -- nicknamed the ""stans"" after their common suffix -- are emerging from the collapse of the Soviet empire as a world apart from Moscow, policy analysts and area specialists say. **********Despite their separate identities, these nations continue to be treated by the United States as branch offices of Russia, said Paul Goble, a former State Department adviser on Soviet nationalities. ""We're acting as if the Soviet Union still lives,"" said Mr. Goble, now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. **********In policy research organizations and embassies, analysts are questioning whether the Bush Administration is responding with sufficiently new ideas and policies for the region. Many view Washington's approach as simplistic and old-world, focusing on nuclear issues and promoting Turkey as a secular model for a region whose Muslim populations raise fears in the West of Islamic militancy. Closer to the South **********Culturally, the area -- which encompasses Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan -- is non-European and traditionally closer to the broad band of nations to the south, stretching from Iran through Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and into western China. **********The State Department, however, still classifies the region bureaucratically as part of Europe. **********The Administration's decision to leave Central Asia in the State Department's European bureau with other remnants of the former Soviet Union was not a casual one, a State Department spokeswoman said. It was made to keep the Central Asians in the sphere of European organizations, especially the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sets standards for political and human rights. **********Nonetheless, Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the New York Democrat who wrote legislation that recently created a new South Asian bureau for the State Department, said there is ""some merit"" in considering inclusion of the Central Asian nations under the purview of the new bureau, which is still in its formative stages. Searching for Ports **********The new countries' developing economic links and search for ports, for example, are likely to draw them closer to Asian neighbors. Iran, Pakistan, India and China have an interest in the future of the region, which is also poised to influence Afghanistan and the independence movement in Indian Kashmir. **********Several of the five nations have approached the Asian Development Bank about membership. Pakistanis, Iranians and Indians have moved aggressively to develop business relations in the Central Asian capitals. Pakistani textile mills hope, for instance, to draw on the cotton grown in the region. **********Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, who recently toured Central Asia and has been active in questioning the Administration on its aid plans for the region, praises Secretary Baker for taking the lead in opening embassies there. But the Senator said in an interview that he is concerned that Washington is listening too closely to fears of Islamic revivalism voiced for political reasons by old-guard Communists still in power in several new states. **********Mr. DeConcini is also critical of the Administration's decision to meet the threat of Islamic militancy through a policy of encouraging Turkey as a model for Central Asia. Administration officials say they have agreed on a joint technical pact with Turkey, which is Islamic but secular, to ""foster democratic and market reforms, and orient their trade and other ties westward."" **********""Turkey has immense problems, including in human rights,"" the Senator said.  'Cold War Pattern' Faulted **********Barnett Rubin, director of the recently revived Center for the Study of Central Asia at Columbia University, said: ""The main obstacle to intelligent policymaking in Central Asia is the repetition of the cold war pattern of looking for a threat and for a partner against that threat -- and then finding that the partner has a regional agenda that isn't yours."" In this case, it is the spread of Turkic influence across the region. **********""At the moment, the new threat perception is some kind of Iranian fundamentalism, and our partner is so-called secular Turkey,"" Mr. Rubin said in an interview. ""I think that the Central Asian nations are not going to be the passive recipients of somebody else's models."" **********Edward Allworth, also of the Columbia center, said making Turkey the model was ""a simple-minded solution to a very complex problem."" He said that the five Central Asian nations were all different in various ways, but that at the grass-roots level it appeared that the urge to adopt an Asian Islamic identity was strong. **********Firuz Kazemzadeh, professor of history at Yale University, told a Congressional subcommittee recently: ""Central Asia is not well known in the Western world. Even the term itself has no universally accepted definition.""  A Range of Islam **********Professor Kazemzadeh, a scholar of the Russian empire and the nationalities it absorbed over the centuries, said any post-Communist revival of Islam would take different forms -- ranging from Kazakhstan, with a large non-Muslim, ethnic Russian population, to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, whose cities were centers of Islamic scholarship. **********But he added, ""Islam has had a stronger hold on the masses of Central Asia than Orthodox Christianity had on the Russians."" He advised American policymakers to be prepared to accept some aspects of government there that might not be tolerated at home, including limited electoral franchise and a central involvement of religion in the state. **********""Conducting relations with Central Asia will not be easy,"" he said, even with a great deal of interest among Central Asians in closer ties to the West. ""Yet the United States stands at a propitious moment for influencing the future of that remote and very significant part of the world."""

Interrogated American,Vietnam Admits K.G.B. Interrogated American," **********The Government of Vietnam has confirmed that it allowed at least one American prisoner of war to be questioned by the K.G.B. **********In a radio announcement in Hanoi on Monday and a statement today by Vietnam's United Nations Mission in New York, the Vietnamese said the interrogation took place in January 1973. **********The Vietnamese announcement that an American prisoner was interrogated shortly before prisoners were returned to the United States as part of the cease-fire agreement was meant, in effect, to rebut the assertions made by a former K.G.B. official who has said Americans were still being held by Vietnam as late as 1978 and were interrogated by the K.G.B. **********The official, Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, who says he was head of the K.G.B.'s counterintelligence operations, testified today before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. In his testimony, General Kalugin repeated his assertions that the K.G.B. interviewed several Americans in Vietnam as late as 1975-78, after the war had ended and all American prisoners were reported released. Recruiting Soviet Spies **********General Kalugin, in more than three hours of testimony that was often vague on detail, told the committee that the K.G.B.'s intent in meeting a few of ""a handful"" of Americans held by Vietnam after the war was not primarily to gather intelligence but to recruit spies for the Soviet Union from among the prisoners. On the whole, the effort was a failure, he said. **********He also said that the Soviet Army intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U., its initials in Russian, was more interested than the K.G.B in gathering technical information from American prisoners about advanced equipment and procedures. Americans in Hanoi's possession might have been subject to G.R.U. interrogation, General Kalugin said. **********Vietnam's admission that it had turned over an American to Soviet interrogators in 1973 came after an investigation requested by the United States M.I.A.-P.O.W. liaison office in Hanoi, which was established last year.  The Bush Administration and the Select Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, have also been pressing the Russian Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin for information on reports that some Americans might have been taken to the Soviet Union. **********The Vietnamese statement indentified the prisoner interrogated in 1973 as Eugene Andre Weaver, whom the Vietnamese say they captured on Jan. 31, 1968, in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. At that time, Hue was the center of some of the fiercest fighting of the 1968 Tet offensive. **********Mr. Weaver might have been a C.I.A. agent that Hanoi had sought unsuccessfully to exchange for one of its top intelligence chiefs held by the South Vietnamese in 1972, people in the American intelligence community said. Interrogation of Americans **********The Vietnamese say that the Soviet Union wanted to meet Mr. Weaver because he was ""of Soviet origin."" Hanoi says that after the first meeting, Mr. Weaver declined to see Soviet officials a second time, and that no other Americans were subsequently turned over. **********The Vietnamese say that the Soviet interrogator in the Weaver case was Oleg Nechiporenko, an agent working for General Kalugin. Mr. Nechiporenko said earlier that he had interviewed an American in January 1973. But he has challenged General Kalugin's assertions that Americans were interrogated after that. **********The United States and Vietnam signed a peace accord in January 1973. Vietnam has always insisted that all American prisoners were returned to the United States in March and April of that year. **********Today, Vietnam seemed to be owning up to the interview reported by Mr. Nechiporenko. It continues to brand General Kalugin's accusations that Americans were interviewed as late as 1978 ""fabrications with ill purpose."" **********Mr. Kalugin said that efforts to discredit him in Vietnam and from within the K.G.B. derive from a desire among the remnants of the Soviet intelligence system to protect Vietnam as Moscow's ""last listening post in the Far East,"" following the loss of cooperative arrangements with the former Communist regimes of Eastern Europe. He said that it did not suprise him that Vietnam and hard-liners in the K.G.B. would synchronize their stories. Seized C.I.A. Agents **********The details revealed by Hanoi about Mr. Weaver's case match those of a Central Intelligence Agency description of one of two agents it admitted on Jan. 3 were picked up in Vietnam and might have been questioned by Russians. The C.I.A. did not name the men. But it said one had been captured in 1968 and released in 1973, after being interrogated in Hanoi ""by an individual who may have been a Soviet intelligence officer."" **********In that statement, moreover, the C.I.A. acknowledged that a second C.I.A. officer had been seized in South Vietnam in April 1975, the month in which Hanoi's army captured Saigon. The second agent, also not named, was released the following October. The C.I.A. says that ""Soviet officials may have been supporting"" his interrogation, ""but none were directly involved."" This case could lend credence to General Kalugin's assertions. **********Today a spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment on whether Mr. Weaver was one of its agents, saying that longstanding policy dictates that the agency not confirm or deny the idenity of an employee. **********As the Select Committee proceeds with its investigations and hearings, it is becoming evident that the P.O.W.-M.I.A. debate revolves around two sets of Americans connected to the war. **********On one hand, there are the publicly acknowledged cases of 2,267 servicemen still listed as missing, or who are known to have died but whose bodies have not been found. On the other hand, there are an unknown number of more shadowy American figures, among them C.I.A. agents and people connected to the agency's airline, Air America. There are also servicemen who were on secret missions after the 1973 withdrawal of American forces."

Michael W. Cramer, said at a Pentagon briefing that the rival clans were trying to maximize their gains before the United States Marines arrived, citing the heavy fighting in recent days in Baidoa, Bardera and Kismayu. Some clan members have left Mogadishu and have been fighting north of the city, he said. **********Admiral Cramer said that some of the fighting in Baidoa and Barbera appeared to be fading, but that the situation was more precarious in Kismayu, a port that the United States and other members of the multinational force hope to use. **********In light of the Pentagon briefing, it appeared that the first real test for the military would come when troops move out into the countryside. According to the plan outlined by Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, marines were to move into Baidoa after securing the port and airfield at Mogadishu. **********Lieut. Gen. Martin L. Brandtner, the chief operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today that the plan might be changed. Instead of moving quickly into Baidoa, the first site outside Mogadishu to be secured may be Baledogle, which also has an airfield but is closer to Mogadishu. **********General Brandtner said the recent fighting in Baidoa was not a factor in the rethinking of the plan. He said the modification was a result of logistical considerations. **********Pentagon officials said there were no casualities or serious injuries among the 1,700 marines who swept into the capital. **********""Our assessment of no organized resistance in Mogadishu is holding,"" said Admiral Cramer, the chief of intelligence. As the Marines began to take control of Mogadishu, the flow of troops continued. The commander of the operation, Lieut. Gen. Robert Johnston, was on his way from Camp Pendleton, as were the first elements of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, which is based there. **********Air Force personnel were also on the way, equipped with electrical generators and radar equipment. They hope to establish 24-hour operations at the airport by Thursday evening. The Navy announced that a hospital ship was being sent. **********General Brandtner, the operations officer, told reporters at the Pentagon that the Navy might have to dredge the port to ease operations there. Even so, only one large ship will be able to dock at a time. **********The Pentagon said General Johnston would decide how much of the city should be occupied. Marines have searched the area around the airport and ports for weapons, as well as what was the United States Embassy compound, but have found no arms caches. **********While marines in Mogadishu encountered no significant resistance, the military seems equally concerned that the Somalis and the American public may have exaggerated expectations of what the troops plan to do. **********""We are not going to build Mogadishu,"" General Brandtner said. ""We're not going to provide it with electricity. The engineer support and combat support elements are there to sustain and maintain the ability of the United States force to carry out the mission."""

But for years, the business was dominated by mom and pop outfits that failed to forcefully market themselves as an option for people who needed tools for repairs or silverware for parties. **********In the last decade, though, the industry has consolidated and bigger companies with extensive operations are now aggressively preaching the gospel of renting, employing advertising campaigns and sales techniques adopted from retailers. **********The shift in strategy has contributed to strong growth, with revenues for the industry -- which excludes rentals of housing, cars, billboards and office space -- increasing from $6 billion in 1982 to $20.8 billion in 1990, according to the American Rental Association, a trade group with 6,000 members. **********""The whole idea of a rental transaction has become more familiar,"" said Chris Fletcher, editor of Rental Equipment Register, a monthly magazine that follows the industry. ""The pride of ownership is not what it had been,"" he said. **********The surge in the 1980's, received an added boost in 1986, when Congress abolished the investment tax credit as part of the Tax Reform Act. Investment tax credits permit businesses to subtract directly from their tax bills a percentage of the money they invest in plants and machinery. After the law went into effect, many companies concluded that instead of buying, they were better off renting from one of the 12,000 rental outlets in the United States. Why Customers Rent  For the Convenience And Expertise **********Why rent instead of buy? **********Many contractors have no alternative. They must rent heavy machinery because they do not have the capital to purchase it or they need it only occasionally. Some homeowners might also fall into this category. **********But the choices may not be so stark for many customers, even after the costs are compared. That is why many equipment rental companies emphasize convenience and the extra services they provide: training to operate complicated machinery, delivery, long-term maintenance, fuel and computerized accounts to help executives manage operations. **********As a result, most rental outlets set aside space for more than just equipment. At the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, a subsidiary of the car rental company that specializes in serving contractors, outlets have offices, fuel tanks, a 6,000- to 10,000-square-foot building for repairing equipment and enough open space to accommodate $3 million to $12 million in merchandise, as well as tractor-trailers for deliveries. Hertz has 84 equipment rental locations in such cities as Newark, Miami and San Diego. **********The staff must be familiar with such popular items as backhoes (which rent for $195 to $275 a day), small air compressors ($70 a day) and dump trucks ($160 a day). **********Equipment rental operations that specialize in smaller wares like power tools and party goods require less space, but they usually try to maintain a large inventory because they fear alienating customers if they are out of items. **********Industry executives say this concern points to an important aspect of their business: many people are still unfamiliar with renting, so first impressions are important. **********""That's really the key, making them know what's available,"" said Michael C. Kupperman, president of Acme Tool and Equipment Rental, which has two outlets, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and in Staten Island. ""A lot of people just don't know the scope of what's there."" Recession-Proof Myth  The Downturn Is Hurting This Time **********Many industry executives used to maintain that the rental business was immune to recessions. Based on past experience, they reasoned that though some customers might have less money to spend in a downturn, others would find that it was cheaper to rent than buy. And some homeowners might conclude that they save money by doing their own work with rented tools instead of hiring carpenters or other tradespeople. **********But this recession has been different. **********With housing starts and other construction down around the nation, many contractors have cut their rentals more sharply than expected. **********Revenues at the Prime Equipment Company, which has 66 outlets catering to contractors and refiners in 10 Sunbelt states, declined 18 percent last year to $200 million, said Thomas E. Bennett, its president. At Hertz, revenues from equipment rentals dropped about 10 percent to $225 million, after growing an average of 22 percent a year from 1982 through 1990. **********Smaller companies and independent businesses have suffered as well, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, where the recession has been most severe. And lately, revenues in California have begun to sag. **********""Clearly, our whole category of the small contractor has been hit pretty directly,"" said Dick Dandurand, president of Taylor Rental, a subsidiary of the Stanley Works Corporation that has more than 300 outlets. **********Party goods -- like silverware, large coffee makers, tents and costumes -- have performed well despite the recession, leading many outlets to expand in this area while cutting back on other goods. The Retail Mind-Set  Using Advertising To Find Converts **********That many consumers remain unfamiliar with renting was driven home by a Gallup Poll in 1990 that found that only 38 percent of respondents had ever rented equipment. **********Neighborhood rental outlets have long relied almost solely on the Yellow Pages to market themselves. But many companies are now exploring other ways, including advertising on cable television and in local newspapers and direct mail solicitations. They are also computerizing their operations and using their data bases for marketing analysis and to insure repeat business. **********""We can give them reports that tell them exactly what they are using,"" said Mr. Kaplan of Hertz. ""They can assure themselves that the equipment they have is being 100 percent utilized."" **********The industry has discovered that many consumers first learned about renting from video rental stores. Many companies are trying to build on this awareness by educating the public that renting a wheelbarrow is just as easy as taking out a copy of ""Fatal Attraction"" for the night. **********But even industry stalwarts believe they face a challenge. **********""Culturally, the American public is still accustomed to retail,"" said James R. Irish, executive vice president of the American Rental Association. ""Trying to get the public to think in terms of renting the correct piece of equipment to get the job done -- that's a concept that still needs to be seeded.""  AVOIDING LIABILITY FOR ACCIDENTS **********Equipment rental companies delight in stocking a variety of goods. But lately, many are shying away from some items because of growing liability expenses. **********Rental outlets across the country have been stung by lawsuits filed by people who were injured using rented equipment. Many companies are now so wary that they refuse to stock items that they consider particularly dangerous, like powder-activated nail guns, which use gun powder blanks to shoot nails into concrete, and acetylene blow torches. **********American Rental Centers, which has seven outlets in Connecticut, no longer rents small boats and canoes because it is worried about accidents, said Dave Edwards, the company's operations director. **********""Liability is always a major concern,"" said Michael C. Kupperman, president of Acme Tool and Equipment Rental, which has two outlets, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and in Staten Island. ""Insurance is a high cost for equipment and full instruction is mandatory for the customer."" **********The Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, one of the nation's largest rental concerns, began a safety program two years ago that focuses on training construction workers in proper use of machinery. The program has ""dramatically decreased"" the number of accidents caused by Hertz's equipment, said Daniel I. Kaplan, its president. **********Other companies are also focusing on ways to limit mishaps. **********""You have to work hard to make sure you have excellent equipment and the maintenance is good,"" said William F. Berry, president of U.S. Rentals, which specializes in serving contractors. ""Otherwise, the defense can be very, very expensive."""

The campaign, which begins today with a print advertisement in Newsday, heralds what it calls ""the new ice age."" **********""We think the Islanders are a wonderful brand name that's been a bit beaten up and underutilized,"" Jerome Grossman, the team's new president and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview from Garden City, L.I., after a news conference yesterday at which he and his partners announced a revamping of the team's front office. **********To call the Islanders ""a bit beaten up"" would be like describing Brooklyn as a tad miffed when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles. After a spectacular streak during which the team won four consecutive Stanley Cups, the Islanders have missed the playoffs for three of the last four seasons. As a result, attendance at the Coliseum plunged last season to an average of 10,099 a game, lowest in the National Hockey League and more than 6,000 below capacity. **********So in the print ad, the new management asserts: ""We're your neighbors. We believe in the Islanders. We've been as frustrated as you by the slide. And we've pledged ourselves into remaking them into an institution we can all be proud of."" **********And in a slickly produced direct-mail package, sent to season ticket holders, they say: ""You've shown amazing passion and perseverance over the years. And we're committed to living up to your loyalty. That means bringing the Stanley Cup back to the Coliseum -- where it belongs."" **********The Islanders' campaign is emblematic of a trend in sports marketing in which teams that performed poorly the previous season try to cajole aggrieved fans into giving them another chance. The trend parallels a similar development in packaged goods, when marketers offer mea culpas for miscues like discontinuing products or changing formulas. **********Perhaps the sports campaign most refreshing in its frankness is one created by Bozell Minneapolis for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League. In one television commercial, a team receptionist, responding to fans, makes disparaging remarks about unpopular players no longer on the roster. **********""Mr. Walker is pursuing other interests,"" she says about the running back Hershel Walker. Referring to another, unidentified player, she says, ""We booted his butt, too."" **********""The fans were so disenchanted with the team, we knew it would take a Herculean effort,"" said Terry Gruggen, senior vice president and management supervisor at Bozell Minneapolis. ""So we just came out and told the truth."" **********That strategy was endorsed by Alan Friedman, editor of Team Marketing Report, a Chicago newsletter. **********""Fans are way too smart for teams to gloss over their problems,"" he said. ""If there are tickets to sell and you want to change people's minds about a team, you have to address it."" **********That is particularly necessary, he added, for teams in sports like hockey and football. **********""In baseball, you can romance the product,"" he continued, with slogans like "" 'Relive your childhood memories.' In hockey, you have to sell performance. Unless you're a fight fan."" **********Ron Burkhardt, chief executive and executive creative director at Burkhardt & Christy Advertising Inc. in New York, the agency for the Islanders' archrival, the Rangers, expressed similar sentiments. **********""It's always better to be honest and open with the fans instead of hiding,"" he said. The Rangers will introduce a campaign carrying the theme ""Back with a vengeance,"" he added. **********Mr. Grossman said that the Islanders had selected Slater Hanft Martin of New York because of ""the wonderful work"" the agency produced for the Shark, a computer system that tracks securities prices. The Shark was marketed by Walsh Greenwood & Company, whose principals, Stephen Walsh and Paul Greenwood, are among the new Islander management group, along with Mr. Grossman, Ralph Palleschi and Robert Rosenthal. **********In a separate development yesterday, Charles F. Dolan, chairman of the Cablevision Systems Corporation, Woodbury, L.I., announced that he had reached an agreement to buy 99 percent of the Islanders from the current owner, John O. Pickett. **********Referring to Adam Hanft, the agency's president and creative director, Mr. Grossman said: ""He's a friend of ours, and he's a Long Islander. We're keeping it all in the family."" **********Mr. Hanft, who lives in Port Washington, L.I., said the campaign would cost in the neighborhood of $1 million. **********Of his agency's strategy, he added: ""In packaged-goods terms, we needed a relaunch. That was the genesis of 'the new ice age' concept -- not just new ownership, but a new attitude."" **********And to persuade fans ""to resample the team,"" he continued, the campaign details a freeze on prices of many tickets and a lowering of prices on about 20 percent of Coliseum seats -- ""for those who are watching the bucks along with the pucks,"" as the print ad puts it."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/27/world/ireland-apparently-turns-down-freer-abortion-law.html,James Clarity,1992-11-27,,884,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Ireland Apparently Turns Down Freer Abortion Law,Ireland Apparently Turns Down Freer Abortion Law," **********Ireland has apparently voted against a constitutional amendment that would have broadened the grounds for legal abortion in this predominantly Roman Catholic country, early results of the balloting indicated today. **********The partial results, announced by party and election officials and reported by national radio and television, showed that while one abortion amendment had been defeated, two others had been approved, one guaranteeing access to abortion information and another making it legal for women to travel abroad for abortion. Previously a ban against traveling abroad for abortions could not usually be enforced. **********Election officials and organizations on both sides of the abortion issue emphasized that the results were projections from a handful of districts in Dublin and elsewhere in the country, but would probably stand up when all the votes were counted. Change Apparently Rejected **********John Bowman, an analyst for national television, said the results meant it was ""highly, highly probable,"" that the amendment to expand grounds had been defeated. William Binchy, a Trinity College law professor and leader of the campaign against abortion, said the results meant ""we have a clear rejection of legalized abortion in this country."" **********In the Wednesday balloting, the country also appeared to have rejected the appeal by outgoing Prime Minister Albert Reynolds for the 83 seats his Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny) party needed to govern as a majority, without partners. As his party strength fell, that of the Labor Party of Dick Spring grew significantly and was apparently in the king maker position for the formation of a new coalition government. **********Labor, which had 16 seats in the outgoing Parliament, was expected to have 29 or 30 when the final count of paper ballots was complete. The Irish system of proportional representation can require a dozen counts of the vote to determine the winner of a single seat. The counting was also slow because each of the three abortion amendments required a separate paper ballot, and all four voting papers were dumped in the same box for transfer to counting centers, where they had to be separated again. Political officials were hungry for the results of the Parliamentary vote, so that was counted first. **********The Labor Party surge, acknowledged by all parties, was largely because of the stagnant economy in a country with 20 percent unemployment, double the European Community rate. Mr. Spring, a 42-year-old former rugby star from Tralee, in western Ireland, in his 10 years as party leader, had joined as junior partner in Government with the Fine Gael party from 1982 to 1987, serving as Deputy Prime Minister. He has also transformed his party from classical socialism, to acceptance of a mixed economy. **********He said today that the results represented a ""watershed in Irish politics."" He declined to say how he might use his new power in the coming haggling among the parties to form a new government by the official Dec. 14 deadline. Several party leaders said they would approach such negotiations ""with a long spoon."" **********The possibilities for the new government included coalitions of Fine Gael, (Tribe of Gaels) which was expected to hold from 46 to 50 seats, and the Progressive Democrats, expected to hold 8 to 10. The Progessive Democrats, headed by Desmond O'Malley had been Mr. Reynolds partner in the Government that collapsed two and a half weeks ago after Mr. Reynolds and Mr. O'Malley waged a bitter personal feud in public. **********Arithmetically, Mr. Reynolds' party could head a coalition with the Progressive Democrats or Labor. But anlaysts of both parties said today that the differences between the parties and their leaders made that less likely than a coalition of parties that excluded Mr. Reynolds. The prospect was that although Fine Gael actually lost strength in the voting Wednesday, its leader, John Bruton, might become Prime Minister in a coaltion with Mr. Spring and Mr. O'Malley. Defeat Seen for Amendment **********On abortion, polls taken just before the voting showed that the amendment to broaden legal grounds would be defeated, as it was opposed both by the Pro-Life Campaign, and by groups usually on the other side of the question who want a liberalized abortion law. The groups against abortion felt the amendment legalized what they consider murder; the liberals objected to the amendment provision that abortion would be allowed to save ""the life"" as distinct from ""the health"" of the mother. **********In the campaign, the Roman Catholic bishops denounced abortion, but said people were free to vote their consciences. The defeat of the amendment leaves the country's abortion law based on the Surpreme Court decision in March that permitted a 14-year-old girl who said she had been raped to travel to London for an abortion after her doctors said she had threatened suicide. **********The Government amendment apparently rejected Wednesday excluded suicide threats as grounds for legal abortion, as well as rape and incest. The decision was condemned by anti-abortion groups as paving the way for easy access to abortion in a country whose constitution had apparently banned it in in a referendum in 1983. The issue now is left to the new government and parliament, which can create a new law, or let the issue drop until it rises again in a test case."

An airport spokesman said travelers should expect long delays. **********Airports remained closed in most other western German cities, including Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, Cologne-Bonn, Hamburg and Hanover, as well as both airports in western Berlin. **********Although polls show that an overwhelming majority of Germans do not support the strike, it has aroused resignation more than passion. Most view the walkout as a power struggle between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the unions over how to divide the costs of rebuilding eastern Germany. **********Garbage piles and late trains may offend Germans' well-known preference for order, yet people seem reluctant to criticize those who provide the missing services. **********""The strike hasn't really affected my life much,"" said Solweig Fischer, a 36-year-old executive secretary who commutes to Frankfurt. ""It does stink a little in the streets. But anyone who has been to New York City knows that the streets there look a lot worse just on a normal day.

But maybe that's a valuable reminder of how good things usually are here."" **********Kai Knaak, a 26-year-old physiology student from Roswirth in the Ruhr industrial region, said he understands why the public service workers are striking, but wants a rapid solution. When he commutes to a Bonn health club, where he works as a trainer, he finds himself having to fight his way through rush-hour autobahn traffic that is more jammed than usual. **********""Normally it's a 30-minute trip,"" he said. ""Since the strike started it takes at least two hours. I hope they settle it soon. But I don't think the strike is about money. If it were, they would have settled already since the difference in positions isn't that great."" **********At the Stuttgart negotiations, the unions are officially demanding a 9.5 percent raise, but have indicated that they will accept a raise exceeding the 5.4 percent suggested at nonbinding arbitration last month. That was rejected by the Government side as too expensive, and talks broke off. **********The employers' delegation is led by Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters. It previously offered a 4.8 percent increase to approximately 2.6 million public service workers. **********Neither union nor Government officials would confirm news reports that a 5.6 percent raise would be offered to low-paid workers while the employers stood fast at 4.8 percent for employees with higher salaries. **********Union leaders said they would be willing to accept a two-tier scale. But Monika Wulf-Mathies, head of the Union of Public Services, said she had only limited expectations. **********She added that she would not accept a settlement lower than the arbitrators' package. That proposal, in addition to the 5.4 percent raise, included a lump-sum payment of $300 and an increase in vacation pay of about $60. **********If a settlement is reached, it will face approval by a vote of the rank and file. Between a settlement and the union vote, strike measures would presumably be scaled back to a symbolic level. **********It is unclear how soon an agreement can be expected. Hours before the talks resumed, Mr. Kohl's party accused Mrs. Wulf-Mathies, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, of fomenting the strike to assure her re-election next month as union leader."

Military Response Sought **********The exiled President's representative at the talks, the Rev. Antoine Adrien, said in an interview on Saturday that the Haitian military has been asked by the Organization of American States to respond by Tuesday to the proposal. **********Father Adrien said that the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Joao Clemente Baena Soares, who mediated in the talks, was ready to dispatch the first 18 ""democracy monitors"" as early as Wednesday. Four officials of the organization are already in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, to set up the operation. **********The Haitian military's representative at the meeting, Foreign Minister Francois Benoit, has not discussed publicly what went on in the talks, which ended late Friday night. Officials at the O.A.S. would say only that the talks had been ""useful"" and had opened a new channel of communication to the military leadership. **********Mr. Benoit and Haiti's current Prime Minister, Marc Bazin, can operate only with the sufferance of the military, which is suspicious of any international intervention and fearful that the return of Father Aristide could make officers vulnerable to criminal trials. **********The military has nullified previous agreements reached under O.A.S. auspices. **********In the interview, Father Adrien, who heads a 10-member commission appointed in July by the exiled President and based in Port-au-Prince, called on the Bush Administration to lend its active support to the new initiative by putting pressure on the military to accept O.A.S. monitors. **********He said Washington appeared to view the military leader of Haiti, Gen. Raoul Cedras, with the same tolerance it accorded the former Nicargauan strongman, Antonio Somoza Debayle. **********""We have been making concession after concession, but nothing is asked from the people on the other side of the table,"" he said, reflecting the opinion of many of Father Aristide's supporters that a leader who won two-thirds of the popular vote in a reasonably free and fair election should expect more help from the Bush Administration. **********""The other side has made no concessions at all,"" Father Adrien said. ""They preside over this incredible violence and yet nothing is asked of them. There is no accountability for what they are doing."" **********Recent reports by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Amnesty International and other groups have painted a bleak picture of Haiti. They say that the level and style of violence recalls the worst days of the Tontons Macoutes, the death squads of the Duvalier family. **********Father Adrien, who has set up an office in the Haitian capital to represent Father Aristide, said repression by the military Government has grown more intense in the last three months. He attributes this to discontent among the people over the political stalemate and the economic embargo, however porous, which has hurt many Haitians. **********""Repression is the sign there is resistance to the military,"" Father Adrien said, speaking by telephone from Brooklyn before his return to Haiti today. ""It goes up because resistance is up."" **********The exiled President's representative said that the talks this week were not negotiations about Father Aristide's returning to Haiti. **********""We were talking about stopping the violence,"" he said. ""Only that."" **********The introduction of rights monitors, similar to teams operating in Nicaragua and Suriname, has been discussed for nearly 10 months. Volunteers from the United States and Canada who speak French or Creole have been asking to join, O.A.S. officials said. **********The Aristide camp wanted to send 18 monitors to each of Haiti's administrative regions, called departments.

Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. **********""And the decline in money supply will probably take some of the sting out of an unusually strong employment report, if that happens,"" he added. **********In advance of the employment report, most Wall Street economists were forecasting that nonfarm payroll employment rose by between 50,000 and 75,000 jobs last month. An increase of that size would be consistent with the sluggish, halting recovery most analysts say is unfolding. **********The money supply report partly overshadowed the Treasury bond auction, which was the concluding piece of what turned out to be a highly successful quarterly refunding for the Treasury. **********At the auction, the bonds were sold at an average yield of 8 percent, up from an average of 7.91 percent at the last bond sale on Feb. 13.  Existing Issue 'Reopened' **********Rather than issue a new bond, the Treasury chose to ""reopen"" an existing issue -- the 8 percent bonds of November 2021 -- that were originally sold in November 1991. The decision was made because current market conditions were not conducive to a new issue. **********It was the first time since 1984 that the Treasury had chosen to reopen an outstanding bond more than once. The reopening created a huge, $32 billion issue. **********""Even though this is the third time the Street has bid for this issue, there was surprisingly good demand,"" said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.  ""Given the fact that the bonds have a record floating supply and that the employment report is imminent, this was an excellent auction.""  Outstanding Issues Rise **********As Mr. Kahan suggested, the money supply report did seem to allay traders' concerns about the employment statistics, because prices of outstanding notes and bonds moved higher late in the session. **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 3/8, down 1/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday. **********Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 6 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 10019/32 , down 1/32 , to yield 6.73 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, down 1/32 , to yield 5.24 percent. **********Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly. **********Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.58 percent late yesterday, unchanged from late Wednesday. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 3.70 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late rate of 3.99 percent.  High-Yield Issue **********Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a $400 million offering of high-yield securities issued by the Adelphia Communicactions Corporation. **********The 12.50 percent senior notes mature in 2002 and were priced at $100, or par. **********Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which, because of heavy demand, was increased in size from $275 million. **********The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and B by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was sluggish, traders said, partly because of the Treasury's refunding auctions. **********Prices of most investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged on the day, according to market participants. And municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 29 1/2-year Treasury bonds:  (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 100.000  Average Yield . . . 8.00%  Low Price . . . 100.000  High Yield . . . 8.00%  High Price . . . 100.113  Low Yield . . . 7.99%  Accepted at low price . . . 61%  Total applied for . . . $24,899,829  Accepted . . . $10,043,767  N.Y. applied for . . . $23,625,606  N.Y. accepted . . . $9,838,964  Noncompetitive . . . $361,000  Interest set at . . . 8%  The 30-year bond matures Nov. 15, 2021."

The 15-hour journey to Belgrade started on roads now controlled by the Serbian militias who have effectively encircled the city and cut it off from relief. **********The fighting on Saturday left more bodies lying on the streets in the central part of the city, and Mufid Lazic, chief surgeon of the Koshevo Hospital, one the biggest in the city, said that the 84 wounded brought in had put a new strain on the hospital's dwindling reserves of medicines, including critically low supplies of anesthetics. **********Elsewhere, there were numerous reports of large numbers of people sheltering in basements, without running water, proper sanitation or electrical power, and in many cases with hardly any food. The Fighting Declines **********Today, as 80 more United Nations staff members left, following the 200 evacuated on Saturday, there was a reduction in the level of fighting. **********The fighting led Sarajevo radio, controlled by Muslim Slav and Croatian groups that have been hanging on to pockets of the city, to offer an assessment that many saw as encapsulating the bloodshed of the last six weeks.  ""Madness reigns on all sides,"" the radio said. **********In a similar commentary, Belgrade radio, a Government-controlled station in the Serbian capital, described Sarajevo as ""the city of fire."" **********For many residents, the pullout of the United Nations staff members, who had been in Sarajevo for two months as the headquarters force for a 14,400-member peacekeeping operation under way in neighboring Croatia, was a major blow. Although the United Nations force was never intended as more than a token presence, it was regarded by many Bosnians of all ethnic groups as a potentially stabilizing force and as a symbol that the rest of the world had not abandoned them.  Desperate to Escape **********After leading the first convoy out of the city, Lieut. Gen Philippe Morillion, the French officer who is deputy commander of the peacekeeping force, said today in Belgrade, where many of the headquarters staff will now work: ""It was terrible to see the way that things were going. We had the impression that the Bosnian population was committing suicide."" **********Many Sarajevo residents were desperate to escape the fighting, but unable to do so. Where telephones still worked, people were calling friends in Belgrade and elsewhere, inquiring whether any outside relief, in the form of international military intervention or food supplies, was likely. **********A diplomat in Belgrade said she had received a call from a friend who told her that he had less than three days' worth of food left for himself and his family and that fighting in his neighborhood, near Sarajevo's airport, was so intense that he was unable to go outside to look for more supplies. **********The caller also said Serbian militias were going from building to building in his area, looking for non-Serbs and taking them away. This appeared to be a reflection of a broader pattern elsewhere in Bosnia, under which Serbian militias, on a widespread scale, and Muslim Slav and Croatian militias in areas of their strength, have been driving people from their homes. **********International relief agencies say about 700,000 Bosnians have become homeless, creating the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War 11. **********The United Nations pullback from Sarajevo, ordered last week by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General, has left about 120 United Nations personnel in the city, under the command of Col. John Wilson, an Australian. The residual force, which includes 50 military observers and about 40 French soldiers, will be available as cease-fire mediators and to aid relief convoys that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees hopes to run to Sarajevo later this week. **********The agency has 600 tons of food, part of it contributed by the United States and flown in aboard military aircraft on Saturday to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, but Serbian militia commanders have so far refused to issue documents for the convoy's safe passage."

A $10 million line of credit extended by the Connecticut Development Authority and Creditanstalt, an Austrian bank, will keep the company running and give the state majority ownership of the company. **********In 1990, Colt's, already in trouble, was purchased in a leveraged buyout by the Connecticut state pension fund and investors backed by Creditanstalt. **********Industry experts attributed the company's plight to excessive debt, the loss of military and police orders and an outdated line of revolvers with diminishing appeal for civilians wanting semiautomatic weapons. **********The bankruptcy petition, filed Wednesday, listed total assets of $91.5 million and liabilities of $82.5 million. **********Colt's, a high-profile business with 925 jobs, is a company that state politicians say they want very much to save. While Republicans criticized the state's original investment in 1990, critics of yesterday's plan were scarce. **********""This is one crown jewel that doesn't leave the state of Connecticut,"" said Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. at a news conference held at the company's office in Hartford. ""We think it's a hell of a good investment."" **********The company also announced yesterday that its chairman, Anthony Autorino, had resigned on March 1. He was replaced by Worth Loomis, president of the Hartford Graduate Center, a satellite of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. **********Colt's, one of Connecticut's oldest companies, said it would use bankruptcy protection to reorganize its finances, which have been battered in recent years by both internal difficulties, including a protracted labor dispute, and external events. **********The leveraged buyout had placed the company in a precarious position. ""We were on thin ice anyway,"" Ronald Stilwell, the president, said in a telephone interview. ""There was not much flexibility to react properly to ups and downs."" **********One of those downs occurred last year, when orders from Kuwait worth millions of dollars evaporated after the Persian Gulf war ended abruptly. **********The company has also lost important military and law enforcement customers in recent years because of its high prices and outdated products, said Gregory I. Fetter, senior defense analyst of Forecast International, a market research firm in Newtown, Conn. Slow Civilian Demand **********The company's troubles were worsened by sluggish civilian demand, with buyers preferring cheaper ""Saturday night specials"" or more powerful guns, analysts said. **********Scott A. Farrell, editor of Shooting Industry magazine, added that the company had tended to focus on revolvers when many customers wanted semiautomatic weapons. ""Their product line, in general, is a bit behind the times,"" he said. **********The Hartford police use Smith & Wesson .45 semiautomatic pistols made in Springfield, Mass. Colt's did not have a product that met the department's needs when the force shopped for a new weapon several years ago, a spokesman said. **********The credit lines will help preserve jobs belonging mostly to hourly workers represented by the United Automobile Workers union. Phil Wheeler, a U.A.W. official, said the union was willing to consider concessions. **********Mr. Stilwell, the president, said he anticipated that the company would emerge from bankruptcy protection from creditors in about a year. At yesterday's news conference, he said the company had a backlog of orders from the Federal Government worth $13 million and had received $6 million of new orders in the past several weeks. **********The bankruptcy filing caps several years of turmoil at Colt's. A dispute over wages and benefits in 1986 prompted one of the state's longest strikes. The company also lost out in bidding for a five-year contract beginning in 1988 to produce M-16 rifles for the Army, a contract it had held since the model was introduced in 1964. **********In 1989, Colt Industries, its parent company at the time, put the firearms unit up for sale. The state pension fund invested $25 million and Creditanstalt lent more than $35 million to an investor group to help buy it in 1990. Not the First Bankruptcy **********The company dates to 1836, when Samuel Colt won a patent for a revolver and built a plant in Paterson, N.J., with financing from relatives. Sales were sluggish, and the Colt's Patent Arms Manufacturing Company was bankrupt by 1842. **********But Mr. Colt persisted in trying to sell arms to the military. The advent of the Mexican War in 1846 produced a big order for the .44 caliber Walker revolver, which he decided to produce in Hartford. **********The company's most famous gun, the six-shot .45-caliber revolver, was introduced in 1872, 10 years after Samuel Colt's death. The Colt family owned the company until 1901, when it was sold to an investor. **********In 1990, Colt's produced 145,010 guns, making it the seventh-largest gun producer in the nation, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms."

The nation's biggest cable television company said yesterday that as early as 1994 it would install technology that would ultimately let its customers receive as many as 500 channels. **********In the long run, this new digital technology is likely to greatly accelerate the marriage between computers and television, allowing customers to roam through video libraries hundreds of miles away. **********But shorter term, the company, Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, hopes to offer customers a broad range of pay-per-view services, including the ability to order up movies virtually on demand or to choose among 50 different college football games on a Saturday afternoon. Push-Button Pizza, Too **********The company also expects to offer a broad range of interactive shop-at-home services, in which customers order anything from pizza to jewelry by pressing a button on the television remote control. And company officials say they also expect to offer high-speed information services, from sports scores to computer games, for owners of personal computers. **********""Television will never be the same,"" John C. Malone, president of Tele-Communications, said at a news conference in Anaheim, Calif. **********While many cable systems are experimenting with fiber optics and other new technologies to increase the number of channels they offer, the move by Tele-Communications marks the first big commitment to install the multichannel digital technology nationally. **********The new technique was developed jointly by the General Instrument Corporation, a maker of decoders and other equipment for the cable television industry, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********Officials at the three companies said digital technology, which transmits video images in the ones and zeroes of computer code, can expand the capacity of a cable-TV line tenfold. The technology also provides a sharper image than the conventional transmission signal used by cable operators and television broadcasters. **********With digital technology, customers would continue to use their existing television sets, but would rent or buy a new set-top device to decode the digital information. Mr. Malone said his company planned to make an initial investment of several hundred million dollars on new transmission equipment and to buy a million set-top boxes. **********The new digital services will be available to people who own backyard satellite dishes as early as next summer, and cable customers in selected cities will begin getting the new offerings in 1994. **********Mr. Malone declined to identify the cities in which Tele-Communications plans to introduce the new technology. The company operates 443 local systems that serve a total of nine million customers, and it owns partial stakes in other local outlets that reach another two million people. Puts Pressure on Broadcasters **********Yesterday's action is likely to add to the pressure on television broadcasters, who have been struggling to keep up with competition from cable companies over the last 10 years. **********""We're not just talking about better pictures and sound,"" said Alfred C. Sikes, Federal Communications Commission chairman. ""We're talking about whole new services that haven't even been thought of yet."" **********The alliance of Tele-Communications, General Instrument and A.T.& T. also raises intriguing questions about the adoption of a new transmission standard for broadcasting high-definition television, or HDTV, which promises wide-screen images almost as crisp as those in a movie theater. **********General Instrument is one of four competitors proposing a technical standard for all-digital transmission of HDTV. But one of its leading rivals in the HDTV race is A.T.& T., which has teamed up with Zenith Electronics in proposing a separate standard. The F.C.C. has now finished testing the competing technologies and is expected to select one next year. **********Until now, cable operators and television broadcasters have transmitted images using an ""analog"" form of electrical waves that are analogous to the original image. **********Digital technology makes it possible to produce images that are far more clear and free of defects than in ordinary broadcasting, and it also makes possible the design of television sets that store and manipulate information like a computer. **********In recent years, equipment manufacturers have made enormous advances in reducing the amount of data needed to reconstruct an image by employing ever-more-sophisticated mathematical tricks to weed out noncrucial information. Rather than retransmitting every detail of a mountain backdrop 30 times a second, for example, the new systems transmit only the details -- a cowboy on horseback, say -- that change from frame to frame. **********General Instrument and A.T.& T. have both been leaders in developing these ""compression"" technologies, and most experts are now convinced that digital television broadcasting is not only feasible but inevitable. Satellite Distribution Planned **********Tele-Communications officials said yesterday that they would convert programs into a digital form at a central operations post and then distribute them by satellite to local cable systems around the country. The local systems would then transmit the shows to their customers over standard cable lines. **********Initially, Tele-Communications will set aside only six or seven of today's channels for digital transmission, each of which could carry 10 separate programs simultaneously. Mr. Malone said the company was trying to encourage suppliers of programming to dream up offerings that would appeal to narrow niches of the population but could be made available to customers for as little as 50 cents or a dollar a month. **********Among other possibilities, he said, cable systems could offer multiple re-runs of popular television shows, like ""60 Minutes,"" to people who missed the original broadcast. **********The potentially huge new capacity of cable lines could also be used to transmit data to home computers much more quickly than is possible over ordinary household telephone lines. Prodigy Services Inc., which provides on-line information services to owners of personal computers, has been exploring the possibility of offering its service over cable."

And 51 percent said that they would sacrifice some quality to buy a product that would cause less damage to the environment. **********But the study also indicated that consumers were wary of companies' ecological messages.

David? No Matter; Ted Koppel Is Likely Winner,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; Is It Jay? David? No Matter; Ted Koppel Is Likely Winner," **********While the television industry watches to see whether Jay Leno or David Letterman is left standing after their shootout at the late-night corral, the real winner may be the innocent bystander. **********That's the theory at ABC, which owns the bystanding program, ""Nightline."" ABC News executives are especially relishing the prospect that no matter what the ultimate configuration -- Mr. Letterman at CBS and Mr. Leno at NBC, or vice versa -- the entertainment audience at 11:30 P.M. Eastern time will be split, leaving ""Nightline"" to dominate the period with its news audience. **********""If Letterman and Leno divide up the audience now watching the 'Tonight' show,"" Roone Arledge, president of ABC News, said in an interview last week, ""the one program that's different stands to benefit. We have the program that's different."" **********""Nightline"" is already different enough to stand out from the rest of the late-night lineup, which includes Mr. Leno's ""Tonight"" show on NBC, ""Studs"" on Fox stations, and syndicated shows including ""Arsenio Hall"" and ""Rush Limbaugh."" **********The late-night news program with Ted Koppel is finishing one of its most successful years, with its overall ratings up significantly from the previous year. For the first 12 weeks of the fourth quarter, ""Nightline"" has been averaging a 5.2 rating. (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) That's up 13 percent from the 4.6 rating the program averaged in the fourth quarter of 1991. **********""Nightline"" is also much closer to Mr. Leno's ""Tonight"" show than it was in its last year under Johnny Carson. This year, Mr. Leno has averaged a 5.3 rating in the half hour that opposes ""Nightline."" Last year, ""Tonight"" had a 5.7 rating for that period. **********""Nightline"" was helped by the attention that surrounded the Presidential election. ""Nightline"" owns the franchise in late-night news coverage and always dominates during major news events. It also had high ratings for the week American troops landed in Somalia. **********But ""Nightline"" has also won in the ratings when the news was not especially compelling. It won one week in November covering such topics as the movie ""Malcolm X"" and Lee A. Iacocca. **********Mr. Arledge credited a new format for the show, under a new executive producer, Tom Bettag, which includes more investigative reports and features and fewer interviews. **********If Mr. Letterman and Mr. Leno go head to head with entertainment, ""Nightline"" also stands to pick up more profits. ""It's a very profitable program the way it is,"" Mr. Arledge said, declining to be specific. **********NBC takes in $75 million to $100 million in profit for its late-night lineup, but that's almost certain to decline. NBC could be hit with the cost of matching Mr. Letterman's $16 million-a-year offer from CBS, which would also mean a $10 million buyout of Mr. Leno, or else it could see its profits on both its 11:30 and 12:30 programs diminish if they have to face serious competition from CBS. **********Mr. Arledge said profits at ""Nightline"" should increase if it becomes the clear-cut late-night leader. **********Still, one senior advertising agency executive said: ""News can't charge as high a price as entertainment. Some advertisers worry about news content; others simply prefer to place their commercials inside an entertainment framework."" **********What makes the success of ""Nightline"" this year a more significant achievement, Mr. Arledge said, is the disadvantage the program works under every week. ""Here we are almost tied for No. 1, and we only have 62 percent live clearances."" **********Indeed, about 40 percent of viewers do not see ""Nightline"" immediately after their late local news. Instead they see syndicated shows like ""Cheers"" and ""Entertainment Tonight"" and must wait at least a half hour -- until midnight in the East -- to see the show. **********For years, ABC has urged its stations to help ""Nightline"" by moving it to the spot immediately after the late local news. But many stations make too much revenue from the syndicated programs to consider the move. **********ABC had hoped to increase the incentive for the stations still delaying ""Nightline"" by grabbing Mr. Letterman for itself, and placing his show at midnight, directly after ""Nightline."" Mr. Koppel even appeared as a guest on Mr. Letterman's NBC show and urged him to take that deal from ABC. A Koppel/Letterman lineup would have compelled many of the stations now delaying ""Nightline"" to abandon the syndicated shows. **********But Mr. Letterman's agents at the Creative Artists Agency mandated that Mr. Letterman get a show in the 11:30 time period. That ended negotiations because the network refused to consider moving ""Nightline"" back an hour. **********""It's true that the network had hoped to get Letterman for midnight,"" Mr. Arledge said. ""But our second-biggest wish was for him to go to CBS. Our biggest nightmare was for him to go into syndication."" **********If Mr. Letterman had chosen to start up a late-night show in syndication, ""Nightline"" might have been seriously threatened, Mr. Arledge said, because a number of ABC stations surely would have signed on to take Mr. Letterman's show, forcing ""Nightline"" to be delayed a full hour instead of a half hour. **********""But this is working out very well for us,"" Mr. Arledge said. ""If Leno and Letterman each end up with about a 4 rating, and we're still getting a 5.2, then Ted Koppel will be the biggest star in late night."""

'Younger, Cheaper Staff' **********""There was a movement at Kidder to open up positions for younger executives,"" said James L. Lee, the commission's chief lawyer in the New York metropolitan area. ""They apparently were trying to get a younger, cheaper staff."" **********Describing the charges as ""ridiculous,"" a spokeswoman for Kidder, Peabody & Company, Helen B. Platt, said the company maintained strict policies against discrimination. Ms. Platt said the company would not comment on the specific individuals but she added that ""typically these complaints come from people who are underperforming."" **********She said the company had 5,000 employees in 46 cities and eight foreign counties and that ""lots of them are over the age of 40 and 50."" Since January 1990, Ms. Platt said, more than 100 other ""professionals"" had been dismissed, laid off or resigned from jobs at levels similar to those of the 17 cited in the suit. **********A lawyer for the firm, Ronald M. Green, said Kidder, Peabody was being used as a ""legal guinea pig"" by the commission to determine if the agency has jurisdiction to investigate disputes involving employees who are registered with the New York Stock Exchange. All of the 17, as a condition of employment, had signed agreements requiring them to submit dismissal grievances to binding arbitration, rather than through court action, he said. **********The year the Kidder dismissals began, 1990, was one of the most unprofitable for Wall Street, with Kidder itself losing $50 million. Securities firms cut jobs by the thousands to stanch the losses, and many of the companies were accused in civil lawsuits of dismissing the oldest employees, and women, first. **********In 1991, Kidder rode Wall Street's return to profitability. The firm earned $119 million that year. And for 1992, Kidder, a unit of the General Electric Company, has had what its executives expect to be one of the most profitable years in securities firm's history. Donald R. Livingston, the commission's general counsel, maintained that under a 1991 Supreme Court ruling, the agency had the authority to pursue age discrimination suits brought to its attention against brokerage companies. **********Mr. Lee said the commission had brought age-discrimination suits concerning hundreds of complainants against individual companies but never before a multiple case against a securities firm. **********In the suit filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan, the commission said that based on a two-year investigation, it found that the 17 had been discharged ""because of their age,"" in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. **********Mr. Livingston, at a news conference announcing the suit, said that the number of age-bias complaints made nationwide to the agency had increased by 25 percent since 1990, from 14,526 to 19,350 for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. He attributed the rise mainly to the economic recession. **********""When the economy gets bad, some employers believe they can achieve greater savings sometimes on the backs of older employees,"" he said. **********The vast majority of the complaints are settled through conciliation instead of suits, Mr. Livingston noted. **********Mr. Livingston said the commission's inquiry had not turned up evidence of widespread age discrimination in the securities industry. Most of the 17 named in the suit had worked at Kidder, Peabody's main office at 10 Hanover Square in the Manhattan's financial district but several were in the company's Boston branch. **********Louis Graziano, the commission's trial lawyer for the case, said that several of the discharged employees, whom he declined to identify, had been asked to retire although they were in their 40's or 50's. One complainant, according to Mr. Graziano, said that before being dismissed, a high management official told him that Kidder, Peabody needed younger bankers. **********""The complainant was warned that the company wanted to get rid of gray hairs and dead wood,"" Mr. Graziano said. **********The investigation arose from a complaint by Charles D. Erickson, who was dismissed in June 1990, at the age of 50, as a managing director in the firm's investment banking division. He had been in charge of sales in the utility finance group. **********Mr. Erickson, who had been with the company for 25 years, brought his complaints to the commission in November 1990. **********In an interview, Mr. Erickson, who lives in Essex Fells, N.J., said he had been selected by the company as its ""Man of the Year"" in 1986 for the volume of business he had brought to the utility finance group. **********He maintained that the four executives ousted in his division were all over the age of 40."

The action signals that the Big Three plan to strengthen their lobbying efforts on trade and other issues. **********Honda, which has been striving to position itself in the eyes of consumers and lawmakers as a United States auto maker, said it was disappointed to be excluded. Honda executives said the company had been generous in sharing its advanced manufacturing skills with competitors. ""Although we are a new entrant, we consider ourselves to be part of the American automobile industry,"" Toyoji Yashiki, president of Honda's United States manufacturing subsidiary, said. Hard to Reach a Consensus **********Privately, officials of Honda and the Big Three acknowledged that it had become increasingly difficult for them to reach a consensus on issues like the recent negotiations with Mexico on the North American Free Trade Agreement. The United States, with guidance from the auto makers' trade group, was able to secure provisions for the Big Three that give them great advantages in the Mexican market over Honda and other Japanese auto companies. **********Moreover, in the Big Three's complaint to the Government last year contending that some Japanese auto makers had dumped mini-vans on the United States market below costs, Honda was embarrassed because it believed the trade organization's staff was working on behalf of the Big Three. Although Honda was not a target of the complaint -- it does not build mini-vans -- it did not agree with the Big Three's action, according to a Honda official who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. **********The decision to turn the trade group into the Big Three's exclusive province also was a triumph over longstanding intramural rivalries. ""They had been talking about this for some time, but no one could really decide,"" said Thomas H. Hanna, the group's president. Mr. Hanna traveled to Honda's factory in Marysville, Ohio, today to deliver the news personally. **********""We tried to be as sensitive as we could,"" he said. ""No insult or disparagement was intended."" **********Harry Pearce, who was named an executive vice president in G.M.'s shake-up of top management in early November, apparently played a key role in encouraging the decision to restructure the Big Three's trade group without Honda. Among his new duties, Mr. Pearce oversees G.M.'s government and industry relations. **********Lawmakers, particularly those from the Michigan delegation, have repeatedly criticized the Big Three for failing to cooperate with one another when pursuing legislative goals like erecting import barriers to vehicles from Japan or improving access to the Japanese market. **********Often, the Big Three split on specific legislative proposals. Chrysler, for example, tends to take the most strident anti-Japanese position of the three, while G.M. has historically pursued the most free-trade stance. Indeed, today's action may be a hint that G.M. is retreating a bit from its position on free trade. **********But as Japanese auto makers have grown in strength in recent years, the Big Three have been forced to rely more on one another in areas of mutual interest. **********As part of the trade group's reorganization, which will include moving its headquarters from Detroit to Washington, nine Big Three research and development groups will be transferred to its supervision. The research groups have been organized in the last few years to study advanced batteries, emissions and other technical subjects as a way of improving United States competitiveness. **********Honda's application seven years ago to join the trade organization took the Big Three by surprise. Volkswagen had been a member by virtue of its assembly plant in western Pennsylvania, so there seemed no reason to deny membership to Honda. **********But, perhaps realizing that additional Japanese members could threaten the organization's clout, the group then changed its bylaws to require that applicants build in this country at least half the cars they sell here, a condition that no foreign manufacturer could meet. **********In any case, Mr. Hanna said, ""Japanese manufacturers such as Honda have adequate affiliation and representation not only in Japan but in the United States as well"" in other trade groups."

Yet Super Valu Inc., which will become the nation's largest food wholesaler after it completes its acquisition of Wetterau Inc., barely gets a glance from investors. **********Many believe that wholesalers are dinosaurs, doomed for extinction, as ever-increasing efficiencies eliminate the middleman's role. **********Most large grocery chains, like Albertson's and A.& P., buy directly from the food companies. Wholesalers like Super Valu and the Fleming Companies are left to supply small independent chains. The argument goes that the small chains are in danger as big regional chains expand and as huge discount retailers, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Kmart Corporation, increasingly turn their attention to selling food. **********Super Valu officials and the handful of analysts who follow the company argue that things are not so bleak. Still, Craig Carver, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Company in Minneapolis, said that over the long term, Super Valu was unlikely to increase its profits by more than 8 percent a year. **********""If you have a conservative bent, that's fine,"" Mr. Carver said. ""You are not going to get rich overnight owning Super Valu."" He rates the stock a hold. **********Clare W. Zempel, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, said, ""Many investors don't even want to discuss wholesale food retailing."" He contends that the bears are overstating the threats to Super Valu. ""The pendulum has swung too far in one direction,"" he said. He rates the stock a buy. **********On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Super Valu's shares closed at $25.75 yesterday, up 87.5 cents, but below its 52-week high of $30.50. **********In an effort to speed its growth, Super Valu is moving more and more into owning grocery stores, as well as supplying them. **********Super Valu's chairman, Michael W. Wright, told investors at a presentation in Minneapolis last month that the company would be one of the 10 top food retailers in the country by the end of the decade. **********In an interview last month, Mr. Wright called wholesale food distribution ""an outstanding business."" But he added, ""On the retail side, there may be more opportunity to grow at a little faster rate."" **********For the year ended Feb. 29, Super Valu earned $194.4 million, or $2.60 a share. Although that was a 25.3 percent increase from the previous fiscal year, the 1991-92 earnings included a one-time after-tax gain of $51.3 million, as well as an accounting charge of $13.3 million. Sales totaled $10.6 billion, up 5.2 percent from a year earlier. Retail sales accounted for nearly 20 percent of the total, or $2 billion. **********In this year's first quarter, the Eden Prairie, Minn., company earned $45.6 million, or 64 cents a share, up from $31.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. But most of the 44 percent increase was a result of the year-earlier earnings being depressed by the $13.3 million accounting charge. Sales totaled $3.3 billion, up 4.2 percent. **********Analysts applaud the more aggressive push into food retailing. ""It may be the best way to survive in the future,"" said Charles Cerankosky, with Kemper Securities Inc. in Cleveland. **********Super Valu's main retail arm consists of its discount Cub Food stores. The company owned 44 Cub stores at the end of the year. **********By acquiring Wetterau, Super Valu is getting another large wholesaler that is also interested in retailing. Mr. Wright is enthusiastic about Wetterau's Save-A-Lot stores. A cross between a convenience store and a supermarket, the Save-A-Lot's do well in urban areas, selling a lot of canned food. **********In focusing on food retailing, Super Valu last year sold 54 percent of its Shopko discount store division. Investors had nagged Super Valu for years to get rid of the discount stores, which were running head on into Wal-Mart. The sale raised $420 million, which is being used to help pay for the $644 million pending acquisition of Wetterau."

The buses were part of a caravan, led by the leader of India's right-wing opposition party, that was headed for the strife-torn Vale of Kashmir. **********The caravan, led by Murli Manohar Joshi, president of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, left southern India on Dec. 11 for Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. There, Mr. Joshi has said, he plans to unfurl the Indian flag on Sunday, India's national day, to demonstrate the unity of the country. **********After a group of buses passed through the town of Phagwara, two men dressed in police uniforms sprayed the lead bus with assault-rifle fire, K. P .S. Gill, inspector general of police, said in an interview tonight. **********The driver of the bus, a Sikh, and two party workers, both Hindus, were killed. Both gunmen escaped, Mr. Gill said. Trip Called Unsafe **********Mr. Joshi said he had no intention of halting his cavalcade. **********""There is no question of my turning back,"" he said. **********Mr. Joshi's trek, emulating a march staged last year by another party leader that was plagued by rioting between Hindus and Muslims, has provoked unease among Government leaders in New Delhi who see this new procession as needlessly provocative. **********Home Minister S. B. Chavan, the country's senior official in charge of internal security, has repeatedly warned Mr. Joshi that it is unsafe for him and his followers to travel through the Punjab and into Kashmir. Degree of Autonomy **********For nearly a decade, Sikh militants have been waging a hit-and-run war with the police and army as part of an effort to win independence for the Punjab. **********And in Kashmir to the north, a full-scale guerrilla war is being waged by Kashmiri rebels seeking a separate nation. Human-rights groups have regularly denounced the activities of India's security forces in the Punjab and Kashmir, citing hundreds of instances of torture and killing of suspects. **********Under the Indian Constitution, Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim region, has been accorded a degree of autonomy far greater than have India's other states. Indeed, Kashmir's very status remains in some doubt, with Pakistan and India claiming the region. **********It is the strength and endurance of the Kashmiri rebellion that prompted Mr. Joshi to set off on his so-called pilgrimage for unity. His party insists that Kashmir be brought firmly into the Indian union and that the uprising there be suppressed with whatever force that is necessary. An Inflammatory Act **********Because the Government in New Delhi, and earlier Governments as well, have endeavored to placate the concerns of Kashmiris while keeping them within the Indian fold, militant nationalists like Mr. Joshi's followers have used the issue to whip up Hindu antagonisms toward Kashmir and toward India's large Muslim population. **********While it is widely recognized in New Delhi among political commentators and analysts that Mr. Joshi's attempt to raise the Indian flag in the center of Srinigar is an inflammatory act, Mr. Joshi insists that he has every right to express his patriotism in every corner of India. **********The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the most widely supported of the guerrilla groups in Kashmir, has said that it has formed special squads to shoot anyone found carrying an Indian flag on Sunday. It has also said that it will attack any vehicle traveling on the road through the Vale of Kashmir. For their part, the army and security forces in Kashmir have warned residents to stay away from the highway for the next two days. **********For the most part, Mr. Joshi's trip has been met with small and subdued crowds, particularly in the south. But in the heart of the cow belt, the swaths of Hindi-speaking northern India, there has been more enthusiasm for this avowed champion of Hindu religion and culture. There had been virtually no violence in reaction to his procession until today. Specially Built Pulpit **********Amid the bleating of horns, the waving of flags and hoarse shouts of Hindu supremacy, Mr. Joshi, standing in a specially designed pulpit atop a Toyota truck decked with garlands of saffron marigolds, churned into the Punjab this morning, surrounded by motorcyclists waving the party's saffron flags and guarded by thousands of police officers and soldiers with automatic weapons. **********Busloads of party workers preceded and followed Mr. Joshi's vehicle, speakers blasting from the roofs of their buses the gospel of Hinduism. **********As he progressed northward, Mr. Joshi has given dozens of speeches, each combining of mixture of patriotism, Hindu religious fundamentalism and vitriolic diatribes against Pakistan, which he says is financing and arming the rebels in the Punjab and Kashmir. **********At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Joshi called for Indian troops to invade Pakistan and destroy what he said were training bases for guerrillas, a policy he called ""hot pursuit."" **********Mr. Joshi is to enter Kashmir on Saturday despite warnings from the central Government that his safety is in jeopardy."

The approaching elections in the United States and political tensions in France have made progress less likely, they add. **********Despite growing international pressure for a rapid conclusion, some officials warn that further delay increases the odds that the trade talks will ultimately fail. ""The talks in Geneva are heading for collapse if no decisive political action is taken,"" Jurgen Mollemann, the Economics Minister of Germany, said Friday. **********Trade officials cited the refusal of France to consider deep cuts in its farm subsidies as the main reason the deadline for a trade agreement might have to be extended again. The original deadline was December 1990. A date of April 15 was approved by the 108 nations in the negotiations on Jan. 13 as part of a compromise to restart the stalled talks. **********""Our trade negotiators are increasingly frustrated,"" a German official said. ""When they meet with their counterparts from France, the French position is no cuts, period. That is not a basis for compromise."" French officials deny that they are stonewalling. Discord on agriculture policy has slowed progress toward a trade agreement since talks began five and a half years ago in Punte del Este, Uruguay. Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the Geneva-based organization that sets trade rules and organizes the talks -- warned last week that dragging out the discussions would destroy GATT's credibility. **********""The hour of truth has arrived for the Uruguay Round,"" Mr. Dunkel said. **********An agreement could significantly expand the world's trade. Failure would probably mean a trade war, President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina said in a speech last week to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. ""As is the case in most wars, everyone ends up losing,"" he said. Argentina is one of the world's leading exporters of farm products. **********The United States, Argentina and other top farming nations are demanding deep cuts in the export subsidies and price supports the 12-member European Community pays to its farmers. The community has offered more modest reductions, contending that severe cuts would call into question the very foundation of its agricultural policy.Deadline for Draft Accord **********To end that impasse, Mr. Dunkel persuaded the GATT nations to agree on Jan. 13 to accept a 500-page draft of a final trade agreement that he prepared as a basis for further negotiations. It set mid-April as a deadline. He also secured their agreement to resolve the most disputed issues, including agriculture, in a separate negotiating process involving senior politicians rather than trade specialists. Little progress is evident so far. **********Mr. Dunkel is roaming the globe to rally support. Some European trade officials say they think a GATT agreement could still be reached this spring. But they warn that pushing back the deadline more than a few weeks raises the risk that a settlement will not be reached this year. **********""The negotiations would then conflict with elections in the United States,"" a senior German official said. ""Those elections will monopolize the attention of Government officials and legislators. Getting an agreement will no longer be a top priority for the Americans."" **********Election-year politics in the United States and a possible right-wing victory in French regional elections next month could make trade an even more volatile issue, further increasing the chances that the trade talks will fail.Role of Politics **********""Domestic politics in the United States and Europe are playing a crucial role in GATT,"" said Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN coalition. That group, whose name stands for Multilateral Trade Negotiations, represents 14,000 American companies that support a strong trade pact. **********""It is still a very good question whether or not there will even be an agreement,"" Mr. Freeman said, and echoing Mr. Menem's fears of a trade war, he added, ""Not getting one would be tragic."" **********French officials say they are not blocking a deal on agriculture, pointing out that France's influence is diluted by having the European Community represent it in the GATT talks. But as Europe's largest producer of farm products, France clearly has the most at stake. Its farmers have protested repeatedly and sometimes violently against any cuts in subsidies. President Francois Mitterrand has refused to budge on the issue this year. **********""His Government is weak in the polls,"" Mr. Freeman said. ""If Mitterrand hurts French farmers, I think you can say goodbye to the Socialist Party's chance of winning an election for a long time to come.Bush Urged to Intervene **********Other European officials blamed the United States for the lack of progress and called for concessions from President Bush to break the deadlock. **********""We have made an effort and we expect an effort by President Bush himself, since his negotiators won't budge,"" the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, said after meeting Friday with Mr. Mitterrand. **********Pressure for an agreement is clearly rising, most recently as a result of Vice President Dan Quayle's mid-February European trip. Mr. Quayle shocked European officials by appearing to suggest that the American commitment to defend Europe depends on trade progress. A day later, he bluntly threatened retaliation in kind if the community does not cut farm subsidies. **********""It is critical to the security of Europe, the security of the United States and the security of Asia,"" Mr. Quayle said in a speech in Geneva. ""We have to conclude the Uruguay Round of this GATT negotiation."" But he later denied any linkage between United States troop levels and progress on GATT."

Boucher, a State Department spokesman, insisted that there were still no documented cases to prove that any individual sent back to Haiti had suffered persecution. **********The questions before the Supreme Court as posed by lawyers for Haitian refugees are whether a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, lifting the ban on forced returns should be reviewed, and whether the ban should be reinstated during that review. **********In sticking to the position that the law requires specific fears of retribution among people fleeing the country or documented evidence of harm to those forcibly returned earlier before any individual or group can be granted asylum or ""temporary protected status,"" the Administration grows more isolated from Congress, human-rights groups, major religious organizations and international refugee agencies. **********Saying that Congress had to ""step into the breach"" to counter the Adminstration's lack of flexibility in dealing with the crisis in Haiti, a senior member of Congress asked President Bush and Attorney General William P. Barr today to halt the return of Haitian refugees by executive order under existing immigration legislation. 'Gives Us a Black Eye' **********The Congressman, Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Goverment Operations Committee and a leading member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he would press at the same time for legislation that would give safe haven to Haitian exiles in the United States until democracy was restored in Haiti if the Administration did not act. **********The House Judiciary Committee is already preparing to debate legislation next week that would stop the forced return of Haitians for six months. **********Flanked at a news conference by leaders of major human-rights organizations, Mr. Conyers asserted that the Bush policy ""gives us a black eye and calls into question our humanity."" He announced that he had asked the General Accounting Office, the investigation arm of Congress, to look into the treatment of Haitian exiles by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. **********In a separate move, 15 members of Congress have formally called for the sending of a United Nations peacekeeping force and a human-rights monitoring team from the Organization of American States to Haiti."

Focus on Growth, Not Short Rates"," **********President Bush may be right about the need for lower interest rates, but jawboning the Federal Reserve as he did last week could actually undermine his goal of more rapid economic growth. The public needs pro-growth fiscal policies from the President much more than another small decline in short-term interest rates. The Fed has already tamed inflation. Giving in to political pressure now could jeopardize this achievement and the recovery as well. **********Understanding why requires a look at how short-term and long-term interest rates have been heading in opposite directions. The President asked the Fed to lower short-term rates, which it can control by adding or draining the money banks hold as reserves. Short-term rates have fallen by 4 percentage points over the past 20 months to below 4 percent, or near their 30-year lows. **********But long-term rates have risen about three-tenths of 1 percentage point since January. These rates, reflecting investors' expectations of inflation, have a more powerful influence on the economy. They have remained stubbornly high, near 8 percent, slowing the recovery in business investment and housing. **********Paradoxically, if the Fed pushes short rates down too far, creating an overdose of new money, then long-term rates would actually rise from renewed inflation fears. This is a risk the President ought to consider, for another spike in long-term rates might well abort a recovery that is already slower than usual. **********Lower short-term rates would also reduce global demand for dollars, as investors buy other currencies offering higher returns. The dollar's purchasing power and hence the inflation outlook depend on the willingness of people to hold it. If no one wants it, its value plummets, causing prices and interest rates to rise. The exchange rate has already fallen by 13 percent over the past year, an inflationary omen. **********Some of the President's advisers are probably telling him that the money supply is growing too slowly. M2, the most closely watched indicator, which includes most bank deposits and money-market funds, has risen by less than 2 percent over the past 12 months. But other money supply and bank reserve measures indicate growth rates of 8 percent to 16 percent. **********If the President were communicating more closely with the Federal Reserve board, he would know that Greenspan & Co. have developed a new approach to balancing money supply and demand. They use inflation-sensitive market indicators -- including such commodity indexes as the price of gold -- to determine whether the balance is deflationary, inflationary or just right. **********Their approach makes plenty of sense. In our global, high-speed markets, prices immediately change to reflect all the available information. Every nanosecond, the world market price of gold contains more information and wisdom than all the computer models used by the Council of Economic Advisers. **********In the past two years, Fed policies have stabilized the gold price in a narrow band around $350 an ounce, while broader commodity indexes have also remained steady. These indicators confirm the Fed's progress against inflation. **********The producer price index has increased by only 1.1 percent over the past 12 months, the consumer price index by 3 percent. Only two years ago, these inflation measures were at 6.5 percent to 7 percent. **********By politicizing election-year monetary policy, the President may well create more uncertainty, keeping long-term rates sticky despite the progress on inflation. If he truly wants to improve the prospects for growth, he should endorse the Fed's Bretton Woods-style effort to restrain inflation and make the dollar as good as gold. **********Then he should pursue his own growth program, with enterprise zones, a reduction in the capital gains tax, a spending freeze and a middle-income tax cut. These measures could take the economy from about 2.5 percent growth now to 3.5 or 4 percent next year without renewed inflation. This would be a winning economic policy for the Bush Administration in November."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/05/business/waiting-for-consumers-to-spend.html,Steven Greenhouse,1992-10-05,,1459,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Waiting for Consumers to Spend,Waiting for Consumers to Spend," **********Sometimes a burst of consumer spending lifts the nation out of recession. Sometimes a pickup in housing construction does the trick. Sometimes business investment gives the economy the needed push forward. **********And with the dollar so weak, many economists and Government officials have been hoping that exports, for the first time, will pave the way to a robust recovery. **********But all these engines of economic growth have stalled or malfunctioned. So, lacking anywhere else to turn, many economists are looking to that abiding American hero, the consumer, for a push-start. Confidence Ebbing **********All that is needed, they say, is a surge in consumer confidence, which remains stubbornly low. Then consumers would loosen the purse strings and start spending again. Because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic output, that would do the trick, getting factories humming again. **********""The reason they're not spending is they're concerned about their own and their families' prospects and job security,"" said Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris & Associates, the polling organization. ""Until these concerns change, which is a psychological thing, not a material one, confidence is going to stay low."" **********So the question becomes: What will it take to lift consumers out of the dumps? **********A cornucopia of proposals have urged government to do more to cheer up consumers. Those recommendations include an aggressive round of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve going well beyond the Fed's previous cuts, new tax incentives that would stimulate investment, and a multibillion-dollar public investment program that would put Americans back to work. **********The push for a large public works program got a lift today from economic advisers to Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. Appearing on ""Meet the Press"" on NBC, Robert Reich, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, and John P. White, author of Mr. Perot's deficit-reduction plan, called for fiscal stimulus if the economy does not pick up soon. **********""If, in fact, we are in the state we're in for several more months, which would be tragic,"" Mr. White said, ""then there's going to have to be something else done in a stimulus way."" **********Mr. Reich said he agreed that if the economy is as bad in January as it is now, he would accelerate planned spending for public investment. Mr. White and Mr. Reich said any fiscal stimulus, which would increase the estimated $330 billion budget deficit, should be accompanied by a serious plan to reduce the deficit longer term. **********Previous administrations often used fiscal stimulus, sometimes called pump-priming, to propel the nation out of recession. But many Bush Administration officials and economists have opposed this approach because it would increase the budget deficit. **********On ""Meet the Press,"" Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, said he favored some acceleration of planned spending to speed up growth, but he added, ""If we became much too loose minded in the short term, we would just compound the long-term problem."" **********But economics handicappers say fiscal stimulus and other new Government efforts to end the slump appear highly unlikely over the next few months. A Vicious Circle **********Still, one thing is clear: if consumers do not get out of their funk soon, the economy will remain in a funk for months. Many forecasters fear that growth will remain anemic well into 1993, languishing far below the 3 percent rate needed to get the jobless rate down significantly. **********In the view of some economists, the election results might make a big difference for consumer confidence. Some say Mr. Clinton, simply as a new presence in the White House, could give a psychological lift to depressed consumers and businesses. **********""If we give a new Clinton Administration the benefit of the doubt, and they come on real strong and give us lots of happy talk the way Ronald Reagan did, maybe that will revive animal spirits and consumer confidence enough that it would feed on itself and the economy would improve,"" said Edward Yardeni, a prominent Wall Street economist at the C. J. Lawrence brokerage firm. **********But Jason Bram, a consumer research expert at the Conference Board, a research organization, argued that whoever is elected will make little difference to confidence. ""If the 48 percent who voted for the new President feel more confident, and the 42 percent who voted against don't, it's not going to have a big effect,"" he said. **********The economy appears to be caught in a vicious circle. When Americans trim their spending, sales weaken, pushing Corporate America to lay off workers and hold the line on pay increases. This in turn squeezes household incomes, contributing to a downward spiral. **********""What's making people so cautious is you just haven't had much job growth,"" said David D. Hale, chief economist for the Kemper Financial Companies in Chicago. **********Last Friday's employment report is not expected to raise confidence; the decline in the jobless rate to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent was coupled with a drop of 57,000 in the number of Americans employed. While the nation is technically out of recession, growth remains so feeble, at around 1.5 percent, that employment has stubbornly refused to grow. **********Federal Reserve officials see some rays of hope. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, and his colleagues see a halting pickup, as consumers reduce the huge debts they developed during the overheated binge years of the 1980's. **********But Fed officials acknowledge that the process will not be easy. Even as Americans pay off their debts, the value of many homes has declined, making the owners feel their financial plight is not improving. **********""We are moving along slowly, painstakingly, in working our way through these problems,"" said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. ""We believe this period is systematically laying the foundation for a much healthier economy going forward, one in which debt ratios are in line, in which businesses are far more competitive, and in which inflation is much lower."" **********No one will ever broadcast nationwide that debt levels have dropped so much that every American should start spending again. Instead, Americans here and there will conclude they can loosen their purse strings. **********""There is no real catalyst that is suddenly going to catapult us into a boom,"" said Mr. Bram of the Conference Board. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported its index of confidence, with 100 being normal, slipped to 56.4 in September from 59 in August. **********Earlier this year, consumers did their duty and went on a spending spree. In the first quarter, consumer spending soared 5.1 percent. But in the second quarter it fell. **********The problem was that this boomlet was not matched by improved business confidence. Like consumers, corporate executives felt queasy about the economy, and despite the jump in consumer spending, they remained reluctant to invest or increase production. Profits Up, Investment Down **********""When consumer spending picked up, we didn't have the follow-through of employment and capital investment,"" said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. ""The business community turned so conservative about the strength and durability of this recovery that they said, 'I'm going to wait until this is a convincing recovery.' The business community, acting very logically, one by one short-circuited the normal recovery process."" **********Many businesses also hoped to expand by selling more abroad, but export growth stalled as Europe and Japan became mired in slumps. **********Now, no one expects business confidence to revive magically. Even though corporate profits are up, reflecting the reduced costs brought on by layoffs and plant closings, investment remains weak because executives see little need to expand. Investment Incentives Sought **********That leads to the call for investment incentives, like temporary investment tax credits or accelerated depreciation allowances. Higher investment would increase employment and consumer confidence, healthy developments that should feed on themselves. **********""If the Government took some of its wasteful expenditures,"" said Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, ""and put that to use in the form of incentives to spur investment, I think within six months we'd see some good effects on the economy."" **********While Republicans stress investment incentives, Democrats urge public works spending to lift the economy. Many Democrats, including Mr. Clinton, support heavy investment in new highways, railroads and telecommunications systems, even though this would increase the estimated $330 billion budget deficit. **********In this view, public investment will help build a more efficient economy and serve as the most readily available engine to encourage growth and jobs while other sectors languish."

The money would go to the developer of a refrigerator that would use 25 percent to 50 percent less electricity and no ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons. **********The utilities, often at the urging of government regulators, have been encouraging increased efficiency in electricity use, as a cheaper way to balance supply with demand. The alternative is building new power plants and adding to pollution. A 'Golden Carrot' **********The prize, which the utilities are calling a ""golden carrot,"" represents a new approach -- one that rewards manufacturers rather than consumers. For the last few years several utilities have paid subsidies to consumers to stimulate sales of more efficient refrigerators, or even quietly offered ""incentives"" to appliance store sales personnel to steer shoppers toward the more efficient models. **********In offering the prize, ""we're buying the production and delivery of super-efficient refrigerators into the service territories of the participating utilities,"" said Gary B. Fernstrom, the supervisor of residential program development at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the chief financial officer of the utility consortium formed to administer the prize. **********The 23 utilities, scattered across the United States but with strong representation in the Northeast and on the Pacific Coast, serve a total of about 20 million of the nation's 94 million households. More companies may join, swelling the $30 million jackpot.  Bids Are Sought **********The group asked for bids from manufacturers, due in October, and promised to pick two semifinalists in December who would build prototypes by next June. The winner would be paid the $30 million as the refrigerators were delivered to appliance dealers. Each manufacturer's initial bid is to specify the number of refrigerators the company promises to produce. **********Members of the consortium met yesterday in Chicago with representatives of refrigerator manufacturers.  As a result, manufacturing executives most directly involved were out of their offices and unavailable for comment. Others said it was too soon to talk about whether the unusual structure, a winner-take-all prize, was a cost-effective way to improve the average efficiency of refrigerators. **********But one expert, a senior engineering executive at a major manufacturer, said that the plan could place the losers at a severe disadvantage. The engineer, who refused to be named for fear of offending the utilities and hurting his company's chance at the prize, said: ""The research and development by one company is going to be funded by the utility companies. The rest of the industry will have to duplicate the product at some period in time, and everybody else is going to have to absorb those costs internally."" The Kilowatt-Hour Goal **********Refrigerators and freezers use about 20 percent of the nation's electricity, and vary widely in efficiency. A typical 18-cubic-foot model delivered to a kitchen 20 years ago and still in use will consume 1,500 to 1,800 kilowatt-hours a year, while the average model on the today's showroom floor uses about 900 kilowatt-hours, according to Mr. Fernstrom. His goal is a refrigerator that will use only 400 to 500 kilowatt-hours annually. **********If a customer replaced an 1,800-kilowatt-hour model with a 500-kilowatt-hour model, the utility could avoid burning two and a half barrels of oil a year, or 1,200 pounds of coal or 13,000 cubic feet of natural gas, and it would not need the power-plant capacity to burn them."

""They think spending money is part of their job description."" **********The agencies coming under attack by Senator Pryor are: BBDO Worldwide in New York, which handles the estimated $16.7 million Navy account; J. Walter Thompson, Atlanta, which handles the estimated $10.1 million Marine Corps account; Bozell Inc. in New York, which handles the estimated $25 million Air Force account, and Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York, which handles the estimated $57 million Army account. **********Also under fire is Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc. in New York, which in September was awarded the joint recruitment program sponsored by all four services (""Opportunity is waiting for you in the U.S. Armed Forces""). The account, estimated at $10 million to $12 million, had been handled by Grey Advertising Inc. in New York. **********In the 1992 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, Defense Department figures supplied by the Senator's office showed a budget of $122.1 million for recruitment advertising. While that represented an 11 percent decline from $136.5 million in the 1991 fiscal year, the budget is scheduled to rise 1 percent in the 1993 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, to $123.2 million. **********Senator Pryor's efforts come amid a resurgence of demands that the Pentagon cut back support services in keeping with plans to reduce America's armed forces. Congressional critics like Senator Pryor are focusing on everything from sophisticated weapons systems to a proposed 10-year, $1 billion renovation of the Pentagon Building itself. **********The Senator's pet peeve is the entire military recruitment program, particularly the ad campaigns and a network of more than 6,000 recruiting offices nationwide that are staffed by more than 23,000 employees. **********""People are being paid to get out of the service,"" he said, referring to programs intended to encourage trimming the ranks of armed-forces personnel, ""yet we're spending all these millions of dollars to get more people to come in."" **********The renewal of Y. & R.'s contract last month prompted some of Senator Pryor's sharpest, slyest gibes. In a speech to the Senate on March 4, in which he likened military advertising to ""a propaganda campaign,"" he complained that ""the big-city, Madison Avenue advertising agencies are among those who continue to get fat on the military's advertising dollars at the taxpayer's expense."" **********Some of the Senator's sentiments seemed to be tailored to his constituents, who might enjoy a bit of fun at the expense of New York City ad executives. Senator Pryor said in the interview that his remarks did include ""a little local color, a little hyperbole."" **********Not surprisingly, most agencies involved declined to comment on his proposal, referring inquiries to the military. **********""We believe our advertising budget is properly sized for the recruiting mission we have remaining,"" said Tom Evans, the deputy director of advertising and public affairs for the Army Recruiting Command in Fort Sheridan, Ill., whose ""Be all you can be"" is perhaps the best known of the military ad slogans. **********""Recruiters do the same thing that salesmen of high-priced products do,"" he added. ""If we have recruiters out there, they need the support they get from advertising."" **********When the armed forces relied on the draft for recruits, most of the advertising they ran was created by agencies on a pro-bono basis and appeared as public-service messages. **********The decision to buy media time and space, and lift the individual ad budgets of the military branches to levels equal to those of large advertisers like BMW and Wal-Mart, followed the conversion to an all-volunteer armed forces almost two decades ago."

It also represents the latest in a series of clashes between Baghdad and the Security Council that started earlier this summer when Mr. Hussein said he would no longer cooperate with the United Nations unless it agreed to start easing economic sanctions. **********Baghdad rejected a Council plan for limited oil sales to pay for food and medicine and to start compensating victims of its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

They know the intent of that law just as well as anybody else."" **********Aid has been suspended since the autumn of 1990 under the arms cutoff law, which says that if the Administration cannot certify to Congress that Pakistan's nuclear program is for peaceful uses, all military assistance must be halted and no new economic help sent beyond what is on the way. **********The arms sales were publicized in Senate hearings early last month. Soon after, in a gesture to Washington, a ranking Pakistani foreign affairs official, Shahrya M. Khan acknowledged that his country had the ability to make nuclear weapons. This confirmed what American intelligence had already indicated. **********Mr. Pressler said the State Department had not complied with his request for a memorandum explaining why the commercial arms sales are legal under the cutoff legislation, which is known as the Pressler Amendment. **********""If they can't produce a legal opinion signed by their legal adviser, then they can't do it and they shouldn't be doing it,"" he said in a telephone interview."" **********The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said at a briefing Friday that what she called commercial exports of spare parts and maintenance items were continuing. **********The Washington Post said in an article today that an Administration official had acknowledged that the United States issued licenses for more than $100 million in military-equipment sales to Pakistan in 1990 and 1991. The article followed a report on the sales Friday in The Los Angeles Times. The arms sales reportedly include spare parts for Pakistan's F-16 fighters and other American-made arms. **********The Pressler Amendment, adopted in 1985, says that as long as the Islamabad Government has a nuclear bomb or a bomb's main components, ""no assistance shall be furnished to Pakistan and no military equipment or technology shall be sold or transferred to Pakistan."" **********In October 1990, the Bush Administration for the first time refused to certify that Pakistan did not have a nuclear bomb. At that time, the United States was willing to take a tougher stance toward Pakistan because Soviet troops had left Afghanistan and Pakistan's aid to the rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan Government had become less important. Rivals at Ingratiation **********The Pressler Amendment leaves Islamabad in a difficult situation because of military tension with India and because the two old adversaries are vying to be friends of Washington. **********Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview today that permitting the sale ""certainly goes against the spirit of the Pressler Amendment."" He added that ""if the majority of the Congress is as concerned as I am, some strong actions might be taken."" **********Senator Pressler said he had asked Secretary Baker in the hearings last month to provide him with the legal basis for the commercial sales. He said that the State Department gave him a document on Friday that he considered inadequate. ""It just makes some arguments,"" he said. ""No one signed it. What we're looking for is something signed by a legal adviser, stating the legal authority for what their doing."" **********Miss Tutwiler said the department believed that commercial sales were not covered by the amendment. **********Senator Glenn said the State Department's position provided scant incentive for developing nations to abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Pakistan has refused to sign. **********""They play little word games, but while they're doing that, this nuclear proliferation goes on with no penalty,"" Mr. Glenn said today. ""Nations will ask why should they stay aboard with the nonproliferation treaty when nations that are transgressors in buliding nuclear weapons get favored treatment."""

Col. Milan Simic said, had acted to ""insure the peace and security of Visegrad's citizens"" and maintained that its assault on Visegrad was the result of an ""invitation"" by Visegrad's citizens. **********The news agency report said one Serb had been killed in today's fighting but did not mention how many of the town's Muslim-Slav defenders had died. **********The army's assault on Visegrad began on Tuesday when a column of Serbian soldiers and artillery advanced from Serbia in an operation that Western diplomats called a ""foreign invasion.""

Those acti...",674,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Germany Moves to Ban a Second Neo-Nazi Party,Germany Moves to Ban a Second Neo-Nazi Party," **********In a rare display of solidarity, Germany's parliamentary leaders closed ranks today to condemn the rising violence against foreigners, and the Government banned a second neo-Nazi party and started a wave of house searches and arrests. **********Those actions coincided with a speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that opened a scheduled parliamentary debate on the violence. After weeks of relative silence, Mr. Kohl took his toughest stand so far, saying Germany has a moral duty imposed by its past to act against neo-Nazis responsible for the violence against foreigners and Jewish memorials. He promised ""no leniency."" **********The Chancellor said there have been more than 2,000 such attacks this year that have taken 17 lives, eight of them foreigners. **********""We are all witnesses to a terrifying increase in violence in our country,"" Mr. Kohl said. He cited the deaths of a Turkish woman and two girls in a firebombing in the western German town of Molln in late November as a chilling example of the right-wing violence that has badly tarnished Germany's international image. **********""Whoever thinks that they can change our land with a climate of intimidation and fear, they are fooling themselves,"" Mr. Kohl said. ""Germany is a democracy that can defend itself and we will prove it now."" **********The Government quickly backed those words by banning the Deutsche Alternativ (German Alternative), a neo-Nazi party based in western Germany, with a stronghold in the eastern German town of Cottbus. It is the second neo-Nazi party to be banned. On Nov. 27, Rudolf Seiters, Germany's Interior Minister, banned a group called the Nationalist Front. **********Answering critics who have accused him of playing down the violence in an attempt to win right-wing voters, Mr. Kohl said Germany's history has given it an enduring obligation to battle militancy from the left or right. **********""With the background of history in this century, especially the National Socialist dictatorship, we Germans are in a very special way called upon to stand up against any kind of violence and guarantee human dignity,"" Mr. Kohl said. ""We extend special solidarity to all people of the Jewish faith. This is what we, and future generations in Germany, owe to the memory of the victims of National Socialism."" **********The current crackdown began after the Molln killings. But that has fueled criticism that Germany's leaders are partly responsible for those deaths because they waited too long and treated the right-wing threat too lightly. **********Some Germans, including Ignaz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, have suggested the Government's actions were prompted not by humane concern but by fears that the country's image and its export-oriented economy could be severely damaged if the violence is not brought under control. **********""There might be some truth in that, but not the whole truth,"" said Werner Hoyer, the parliamentary whip of the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in Mr. Kohl's conservative coalition. ""We are taking this thing seriously and we are going to solve it. I and the great majority of Germans are deeply disturbed and deeply, personally ashamed of what is going on."" **********The scope of today's action surpassed previous efforts to supress the neo-Nazis. Hundreds of police officers raided more than 40 of the Deutsche Alternativ's offices and dozens of its members' homes in six German states early this morning, just after Mr. Seiters announced that he had banned the party for inciting racial hatred and seeking to restore Nazism. Propaganda materials and crude, homemade weapons were seized. **********""The disgusting work of these rabble-rousers must be stopped,"" Mr. Seiters said. **********Frank Hubner, the party's 27-year-old chairman, was detained in Cottbus, but then released, a police spokesman in Cottbus said. **********The Deutsche Alternativ party was founded in 1989 and had gained considerable power at the local level, particularly in eastern German towns near the Polish border, where many foreigners enter Germany illegally and there is widespread unemployment."

In exchange, however, the telephone companies would have to agree to upgrade their entire networks with high-capacity optical fibers by 2015. **********Supporters of the legislation argue that lifting the ban would provide much-needed competition to existing cable companies and that it would speed the installation of an advanced communications network that could deliver everything from ordinary telephone conversations to high-speed data transmission and high-definition television. **********But the bill has been vigorously opposed by cable companies, newspaper publishers, broadcasters and others who fear that the telephone companies would compete unfairly. **********The Bush Administration has long supported dropping the ban on cross-ownership of telephone and cable systems, but it has also opposed the bill's mandated timetable for installing optical fibers. **********But in today's hearing, the Administration and the F.C.C. went to great lengths to praise the general purpose of the bill and suggested that the timetables could be irrelevant because telephone companies may modernize their networks well before the year 2015. **********Alfred C. Sikes, the F.C.C. chairman, told the committee: ""If we create a public network that is a thoroughly modern, state-of-the-art platform for news and entertainment, then I am convinced that we will make much more rapid progress than the Japanese by the year 2015 and much more rapid progress than the bill envisions by 2015. I think 2015 misses the mark in part because it's too pessimistic."" **********Mr. Sikes today also changed his long-held position that telephone companies should be able to serve only as conduits and not be allowed to produce video programming themselves. As chairman of the commission, which is an independent regulatory agency, Mr. Sikes has differed with the White House position until now and has argued that telephone companies might well abuse their dominance of local telephone services to stifle competition in video services. **********Thomas Sugrue, Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce in charge of telecommunications policy, nodded as Mr. Sikes spoke, and in a subsequent interview expressed hope about negotiating a bargain. ""I think there's room on that front where we could work something out with the interested senators,"" he said. **********""The Administration strongly supports the deregulatory, pro-competitive thrust"" of the bill, Mr. Sugrue testified. ""In our view, removing a statutory barrier to broader telephone company provision of video programming, when coupled with safeguards to prevent anti-competitive behavior, would increase competition in the video marketplace."" **********Mr. Sugrue went on to express concern that without greater freedom the telephone networks of the United States would fall behind those of other industrial countries within a decade.  In another departure from the Administration's previous line, Mr. Sugrue said the Administration would not oppose a requirement that telephone companies offer video services through separate subsidiaries with separate books and personnel. **********The regional Bell telephone companies are themselves divided about their position on the bill. While they have long sought entry into cable television, they are skittish about making a commitment to long-term timetables on deploying fiber optics. **********""Twenty-five years is too long a planning cycle to be realistic,"" said Ronald Stowe, vice president for Washington operations at Pacific Telesis Group. Mr. Stowe added that the telephone companies were having ""very active discussions"" with lawmakers and the Administration but had not yet taken a public position on the bill."

So now the air and water will be entrusted to more sensible folk, right? **********Maybe. President Bush actually played a better environmental game than he talked. He acted responsibly to protect -- dare one say it -- the ozone layer. He clamped down on acid rain. He even signed legislation to keep wetlands wetter at the expense of California's influential farmers. **********If President Bush's record looks better on reflection, the challenges to President Clinton look more daunting. For decades, Washington has been setting environmental goals, whose bills are only now coming due. And while White House rhetoric on the environment will no doubt veer toward the warm and fuzzy, the behind-closed-doors debates over how much to spend and where to spend it are not likely to be any less fierce in the new Administration than in the current one. **********On one side stand traditional environmentalists, who want to get on with the job of just saying no to polluters. On the other are economists and fellow travelers, who view a clean environment as a virtue -- but only one of many. And while some of the battles will be about how much crud is too much, others will be about the least-cost strategies for keeping it away from children and other living things. **********Traditionalists like their regulation plain, if not always simple: do it, and do it now. Economics types are partial to market-based plans -- taxes or freely tradable permits to pollute -- that appall the old-timers because they imply that some level of pollution is acceptable. **********The best guess is that President Clinton will choose an administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency who is not identified with either side -- Madeleine M. Kunin, the former Governor of Vermont, tops nearly everyone's list. And that suggests the big policy battles will be fought one at a time. Among those looming on the horizon: **********Farm runoff. The Clean Water Act has taken a giant gulp from the sewage and industrial waste once dumped into rivers and lakes. Most of the muck still flowing is largely unregulated runoff from farmland. Robert Stavins, a researcher at Harvard's Kennedy School in line for the top planning job at the Environmental Protection Agency, predicts that these ""nonpoint"" sources will be Topic A in reauthorization of the law. **********Traditionalists lean toward tough anti-runoff rules, possibly baited with grants to offset compliance costs. The economists' fix of choice would be effluent taxes or trading systems, in which polluters could buy the right to pollute from those who could cut runoff more cheaply. **********Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, has already designed a trading system for southern Florida, where farmers are under court order to prevent fertilizer runoff from corrupting the Everglades. Estimated savings over the brute-force approach run as high as 80 percent. **********Infrastructure. For all the chatter about high-tech data networks and 300 m.p.h. trains, Congress and its suburban constituents are lusting for more money for highways. Dan Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund thinks a scuffle is shaping over how big a slice of the infrastructure pie will go for environmentally benign mass transit. Perhaps more important, he sees a fight over whether new roads should pay their own way and whether Federal cash could be used as a lever to get cities to charge congestion fees for using roads at rush hour. **********Superfund. The widely applauded idea of Superfund is to clean up abandoned toxic waste without first pinning down who is liable for the bill. But the law also demands ""permanent"" solutions -- restoration of the sites to pre-industrial condition. And that, argues Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, often means a multimillion-dollar incineration of debris and soil, where a less fastidious scrub and a sturdy fence would keep people out of harm's way. **********There will be a push next year for a standard that balances health risks with costs -- one that could save tens of billions of dollars. And as a portent of trouble to come, much of the opposition will come from businesses now making big bucks on the cleanup. **********Active waste sites. While abandoned dumps are absorbing cash by the billions, Paul Portney, an economist at Resources for the Future, thinks toxic wastes stored on working business properties could prove an even greater drag on the economy. To add waste or change storage methods, companies must now meet exacting modern standards for the entire site -- even if the old waste poses little threat. **********This rule could be modified without changing the law. But like much of the economists' agenda, it will not be altered without a sea change in the way Washington views the environment. And after decades of cleaner-is-better politics, that change will not come easily."

Analysts said they expected further selling. **********Declining expectations of lower interest rates, signs of a continuing weak economy and reports of serious loan-loss problems at banks contributed to today's selloff, analysts said. **********The Nikkei index of 225 issues plunged 663.59 points, or 4 percent, to close at 15,884.48. Trading was extremely thin. The loss was the equivalent of a drop of about 133 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. On Friday, the Nikkei lost 418.71 points. **********The Nikkei has lost some 60 percent of its value from its peak at the end of 1989, when the current bear market took hold. The market bobbed up past the 17,000 mark just last month, encouraging a wave of optimism that the worst was over. Those hopes have all but disappeared now, analysts said. **********""It's hard to see what will bring the market back,"" said Tim Hayashida, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. ""Realistically, it could still be months before we see a bottom to this market."" **********He noted that foreign investors, who had been consistent buyers of Japanese stocks for months last year and earlier this year, have grown bearish after waiting in vain for prices to stabilize and begin a comeback. Whenever prices do show signs of recovery, he said, the foreigners have been using the opportunity to unload shares. **********""This is the second time the market tried to make its way back and couldn't hold it, which is a bad sign,"" said Yuichi Matsushita, a market strategist at Nikko Securities. ""We may still have to wait some time for real improvement."" **********One overriding concern is that the Japanese economy, which began to slide into a sharp slowdown late last year, is not recovering as swiftly as the Government had predicted. After saying earlier this year that the rebound would begin this summer, the Government is now forecasting a recovery later this year. But some private economists are more pessimistic, saying economic growth may not quicken significantly until 1993. **********The slowdown is depressing corporate profits and contributing to a wave of loan-loss problems at banks and other financial institutions, largely because of the weak property market. Many investors are concerned that the longer it takes the economy to rebound, the worse the real estate losses will become. **********Newspapers have been filled for months with stories of huge losses for banks and other financial institutions. The fear now is that construction companies and other companies that speculated in the property market may suffer further due to the weak economy, which will be reflected in the stock market."

Sikes, who has argued that greater freedom will help revitalize the radio industry. Three of the agency's five commissioners are now believed to favor stricter regulation, and lawmakers in both House and Senate have threatened to reverse the agency through legislation. **********In March, the commission voted 4 to 1 to let a company own as many as 30 AM and 30 FM stations nationwide, up from 12 each under the previous rule. Association officials said today, however, that they would argue that a single company should generally not be allowed to own more than 25 AM and 25 FM stations.

But his visit is not expected to achieve any breakthrough on the territorial disputes along the countries' land border and in the South China Sea. **********China and Vietnam fought a brief border war in 1979, and there have been periodic skirmishes since then. This year China has challenged Hanoi by taking a more assertive posture toward its territorial claims. **********Sensitive to charges that they have been bullying Vietnam, Chinese officials are eager to portray the trip as a sign of friendship between the former enemies. 'A Very Important Visit' **********""It will be a very important visit,"" said Wu Jianmin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. ""There is far more common ground between China and Vietnam than there are differences and problems between them."" **********One of the most important topics during Mr. Li's visit will be the dispute over the Spratly and Paracel islands in the South China Sea. The islands are claimed fully or in part by six nations in the region, but China is in the best position to back its claims by force. **********In May, China signed a contract with an American company to explore for oil in a region of sea that is much closer to Vietnam than to China. Then in September, a Chinese ship began drilling near the Gulf of Tonkin, in waters that Vietnam claims as its own. **********Western diplomats take no position on whose territory it is, but they warn that the dispute could lead to another Chinese-Vietnamese war -- particularly if oil is found in the South China Sea. **********China's trade minister, Li Lanqing, is to accompany Prime Minister Li to Hanoi, and economic ties are also expected to be on the agenda. **********""We expect our trade and economic collaboration will receive a shot in the arm from the talks,"" Wei Xiaorong, a trade official, told the China Daily newspaper. **********Since relations were formally normalized in November 1991, air links have been restored and trade has soared. In the first nine months of 1992, trade totaled $104 million, more than three times the figure in the similar period of 1991. **********In fact, total trade is far higher, because many goods are smuggled by merchants across narrow mountain trails or by fishermen in the South China Sea. **********Rail links were supposed to have been restored as well, but China annoyed Vietnam by building a station in a buffer zone at ""Friendship Pass"" along the border. In addition, China announced that a strip of several hundred yards of what used to be Vietnam was now its own territory. **********Another obstacle for trade is the recent practice by the Chinese border police of seizing cargo ships plying between Hong Kong and Vietnam. At least 19 ships have been seized, and the total is probably higher since some shipowners try to avoid publicity. The ships are normally freed after an investigation, but some cargoes have been confiscated. **********China says its purpose is to curb smuggling, and Hong Kong officials say there may be something to that. But the seizures have focused on ships heading for Vietnam, and some see them as official piracy -- as well as a way of showing Vietnam who is stronger. **********China was a firm supporter of the Communist Government in Hanoi during the 1960's and the early part of the 1970's. According to Chinese estimates, 300,000 Chinese volunteers took part in the Vietnam War on the side of Hanoi, with 1,100 killed. **********Vietnam later angered China by expelling and often severely mistreating its ethnic Chinese inhabitants. The friendship collapsed completely at the end of 1978, when Vietnam's Army invaded Cambodia to oust the regime of the Khmer Rouge, China's ally."

All preliminary results had shown the Angolan President with more than 50 percent. **********Under the rules, if a candidate had more than 50 percent he would be declared the winner, but if no candidate had a majority the two top vote getters would have to compete in a runoff in about a month. 'So Much Fraud, So Much Lying' **********Until today, Mr. Savimbi had threatened a return to Angola's civil war because of what he called systematic fraud and vote-tampering in the elections. **********""There has been so much fraud, so much lying,"" Mr. Savimbi told reporters in Huambo today. ""Even with so much fraud, so much lying, he did not get over 50 percent. I have just talked with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros-Ghali, who confirmed that the results were 49.57 percent for dos Santos and 40.6 percent. Therefore there has to be a second round."" **********United Nations officials in New York confirmed the gist of Mr. Savimbi's comments. **********He said that once the election results were officially released, he would fly to Luanda to meet with Mr. Dos Santos, presumably to discuss his stated desire for some kind of power sharing between his American-supported organization, the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, and Mr. dos Santos's Government, which received backing from the Soviet Union and Cuba for years. **********The coming negotiations are largely a result of a form of shuttle diplomacy in recent days by Roelof F. Botha, the South African Foreign Minister. Mr. Botha has held talks with Mr. Dos Santos at the presidential residence on the outskirts of Luanda and with Mr. Savimbi in Huambo. **********South Africa, along with the United States, was the major backer of Mr. Savimbi's organization, known as Unita from its Portuguese initials, in its 16-year-long civil war against the governing party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.  Savimbi Accuses the U.S. **********Mr. Botha's role has proved decisive because Mr. Savimbi has apparently had a falling out with the Americans, whom he has accused of siding with the Luanda Government during the voting. **********Until now Mr. Savimbi has been reluctant to return to Luanda because he feared for his safety here. In a dramatic indication of Luanda's deteriorating security situation, a huge blast rocked an ammunition dump near the international airport on Wednesday night, lighting up the night sky and sending clouds of smoke drifting across much of the city. Diplomats said at least 13 people were killed in an eruption of gunfire between Government forces and Unita troops after the explosion. **********A senior South African diplomat, Gary Scallan, said that Mr. Savimbi had been invited to fly to Luanda today in Mr. Botha's personal plane and that it had been sent to Huambo to pick him up. But by nightfall, the South African authorities could not confirm whether he had taken the plane or intended to do so later. **********The diplomatic efforts to resolve the electoral dispute has been given added urgency by the fact that Unita appears to have a formidable fighting force and weaponry to back up its threats. Under the peace accords reached in May 1991, both sides committed themselves to demobilizing their troops and to forming a new integrated national army.  But diplomats and political commentators here have long suspected both sides retained large numbers of soldiers and weapons. **********An intelligence official from Eastern Europe with close ties to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or M.P.L.A., said that in the event of renewed warfare the Government would be able to muster about 30,000 troops, most of whom are now part of the new national army. Unita is believed to have 25,000 to 30,000 troops spread across the country, most of whom could be easily armed and mobilized. Partition a Possibility **********In the short term, analysts here say, Unita appears to have a slight edge in terms of combat readiness because the new integrated army is at present a fighting force more in name than in reality. None of its troops have taken part in even routine training maneuvers. By contrast, much of Unita's army consists of seasoned soldiers hardened by years of guerrilla warfare. **********While a full-blown resumption of Angola's civil war is still a possibility, analysts say a more likely possibility is that the country could become effectively partitioned unless the political impasse is resolved soon. **********""Unita already has control of most of the central highlands,"" a Western diplomat said. ""All they have to do is to hold onto that territory and dare the M.P.L.A. to take it away. **********""The fact is is that there's no way Unita can take control of Luanda, and on the other hand no way the M.P.L.A. can push Unita out of Huambo. And unless this electoral dispute is resolved, Angola will again be divided in half."""

Corporations issued $162.57 billion in securities in the quarter, up from $80.48 billion in the last quarter of 1990, according to IDD. **********""It was a banner year in virtually all categories,"" said Roger M. Vasey, executive vice president at Merrill Lynch & Company in charge of the debt markets group. ""We saw significantly increased issuance on the part of industrials, as well as financials and utilities."" Rushing to Trim Debt **********The boom in underwritings was fueled by the rapid cuts in interest rates throughout 1991, underwriters said. Corporations rushed to reduce borrowing costs and cut debt levels. **********The heavy business brought near-record fees to Wall Street investment houses. Disclosed fees more than doubled, to $4.54 billion from $1.94 billion earned in 1990. That surpassed the 1987 results of $4.51 billion, but fell short of the 1986 record of $5 billion. **********Fourth-quarter results in fees were even stronger in comparison, with the amounts nearly quadrupling, to $1.57 billion, from $395.9 million in the 1990 quarter. **********Virtually all the securities firms saw more business for the year and the quarter than they had a year earlier. The only exception was Salomon Brothers Inc.; its volume of underwritings dropped slightly in the fourth quarter, as it struggled to recover from the Treasuries market scandal that began in August. Merrill Lynch Holds Lead **********The biggest underwriter for the fourth straight year was Merrill Lynch. In 1988, Merrill surpassed Salomon, which had been the perennial leader in underwriting, and Merrill has been building a steady lead since. **********Last year, Merrill posted a 79.6 percent rise in underwritings, with $99.98 billion in securities, compared with $55.68 billion in 1990. But the firm's market share slipped to 17.2 percent in 1991, from 17.8 percent the previous year. **********Goldman, Sachs & Company maintained its second-place ranking, with an 86.5 percent rise, to $72.74 billion, in underwritings, giving it 12.5 percent of the market. That compared with $39 billion in 1990. Goldman ranked third for the fourth quarter, although its underwritings doubled, to $19.32 billion, from $9.67 billion in the 1990 period. **********Lehman Brothers jumped in the rankings to third place, from seventh in 1990. The firm underwrote $67.62 billion in securities last year, more than triple its $19.9 billion in 1990. For the quarter, Lehman ranked second, underwriting $23.49 billion, up sharply from the $3.5 billion underwritten in last year's quarter. **********But the increase did not translate into proportionately higher fees. The firm ranked fifth in fees, with $335 million, compared with $125.3 million in 1990, when it ranked seventh. **********The stock market began climbing early in the year after the beginning of the American-led bombing in Iraq, and after some backing and filling later in the year, surged to topple records at the close of the year. **********Equity underwriting volume grew by more than twofold for the year, IDD said, and showed a sevenfold increase for the fourth quarter of 1991 over the 1990 period, which was exceptionally weak after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. **********Initial public offerings were among the biggest beneficiaries of the appetite for stock. New public companies issued $54.83 billion in stock in 1991, more than double the $19.16 billion in 1990. More Nonconvertible Debt **********For all nonconvertible debt, issues rose by 75.6 percent, to a total of $497 billion, from $283 billion in 1990. Among nonconvertibles, junk bonds had a significant recovery during the year, after being largely deemed as having collapsed in 1990. In 1991, Wall Street underwrote 42 junk-bond issues, six times as many as in 1990, when it underwrote seven. **********""One of the most significant events in my opinion during the year was the movement of the institutional investor back into the higher-yield securities,"" Mr. Vasey of Merrill Lynch said. ""Investors have moved into the triple-B category and double-B category in search of yield, wherever they have been able to find improving credits."""

He said that the lower fare was still in effect but under a different name. **********He said that the only limitation on the lower coach fare, generally used by business travelers, was that the number of seats was limited. **********Mr. Becker did not comment specifically on what other steps American might take involving its fares except to say that ""we are always evaluating a lot of things in the marketing area."" **********An executive at a leading travel agency said that the carrier had been working on the new coach fare plan for at least a year and had been trying parts of it on the travel industry for the last six months. **********An airline executive who did not want his named used said that the American move was expected to be aimed at simplifying the current fare structure and might be a way for the airline to save some of the billions of dollars that go to travel agents. Travel agents generally make about 10 percent in commissions on airline tickets.  Briefing Scheduled **********Leading travel suppliers, including executives of big agencies, are scheduled to be briefed this week by an American Airlines executive at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The new fares are expected to be announced to the public by Friday. **********A travel industry executive said that based on his discussions over the last few months with American officials, the carrier was eager to narrow the disparity between fares for business travelers, who generally pay full fare, and leisure travelers, who usually buy discounted tickets in advance of travel at much lower fares. **********The executive said that the aim of Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American, was to ""create enough hoopla"" for the new fare structure so that major competitors like United and Delta would go along, like they have in the past.  Higher Leisure Fees **********He also said that under the strategy, Mr. Crandall would not hesitate to raise discount fares for leisure travelers even though the fares might be higher than those offered by troubled competitors like T.W.A. and America West. **********The current issue of Travel Agent magazine quotes Michael Gunn, American's senior vice president of marketing, as having told delegates to a recent business travel symposium in Los Angeles that American would announce a new pricing structure. **********Mr. Gunn is quoted as saying that new fares are necessary because there is ""a significant disparity between full fares that are too high and average fares that are way too low; a complex price structure that the public can't figure out, and a traveling public that doesn't think air travel is a good value."" **********Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines said yesterday that although they did not know the details of American's plans, they would remain competitive. **********American's fare restructuring comes at an opportune time. Although traffic has increased somewhat in the last few months, fare discounting by weaker carriers struggling to survive and promotions by major airlines have hurt overall revenue growth. The industry might embrace a fare increase as a result. **********But carriers are also worried that a fare increase could scare away travelers, and an industrywide acceptance of American's moves is not assured. In March, other carriers did not match a modest 2 percent increase proposed by United Airlines.                    --------------------       America West Cuts **********By The Associated Press -- America West Airlines, one of three large carriers flying in bankruptcy, has cut fares for many leisure travelers. Most of its rivals have made only partially matching cuts. **********America West lowered fares last month on many 14-day advance purchase tickets, in some cases by almost one-third. For example, the price of a Baltimore-to-Los Angeles round trip dropped from $498 to $348.  United, American, Delta, Northwest and Continental matched America West's prices only in markets where they compete and only for a limited time and with more restrictions. USAir matched America West's deal in competitive markets, and T.W.A. matched America West fully in some markets and partially in others."

It also reported a profit for 1991, its first full-year profit since the company was acquired in a leveraged buyout in 1987. **********For the year, the company earned $368 million, or 22 cents a share, compared with a $429 million loss in 1990. That difference was largely the result of lower interest payments. It paid $2.1 billion in interest in 1991, compared with $3 billion a year earlier. **********During the year, the company paid off $4.3 billion, leaving a still-hefty debt of $14.4 billion from the buyout, the largest in United States history, which left it $29.1 billion in debt. **********For the fourth quarter, RJR's sales were $3.98 billion, up 7.9 percent from $3.69 billion a year earlier. **********For the year, sales were up 7.9 percent, to $14.99 billion, from $13.88 billion in 1990. Operating income rose 3.9 percent, to $2.93 billion from $2.82 billion. **********Saying 1991 ""really was a milestone year"" for the company, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., RJR's chairman and chief executive, declared, ""We put the LBO behind us several years ahead of schedule."" **********The company's share price rose 25 cents, to $10.50, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Two of RJR's three main businesses performed well during the fourth quarter, food and international tobacco, while the third main business, United States tobacco, declined. **********Overseas, sales of tobacco rose 12 percent in the quarter, and operating profits were up 10 percent, because of gains in Europe and the Middle East. Operating profits of the domestic tobacco business fell 11 percent. **********Over all, tobacco sales were up 6.8 percent for the quarter, to $2.20 billion from $2.06 billion. Declines for Winston and Salem **********""Winston and Salem have been losing a lot of market share"" to bargain brands, said Ronald B. Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. In addition, Philip Morris's Marlboro brand gained share last year. **********Food sales in the fourth quarter were $1.78 billion, up 9.2 percent, from $1.63 billion for the quarter in 1990. Operating profits rose 11 percent in the quarter for the food group. **********The company also took advantage of lower interest rates to refinance some of its debt in 1991."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/08/business/company-news-yes-they-have-too-many-bananas.html,Eben Shapiro,1992-07-08,,1260,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"Yes, They Have Too Many Bananas","COMPANY NEWS; Yes, They Have Too Many Bananas"," **********Call it the great banana war of 1992. It broke out when the European market did not open as expected, saddling the big growers, newly expanded for the cause, with surpluses. Prices in Europe -- and to a lesser degree in the United States -- dropped along with the profits of the big brand companies like Del Monte, Dole and Chiquita. Investors have stampeded out of fruit stocks. **********As the world's biggest banana marketer and the only one of the Big Three that relies on bananas for its fortunes, Chiquita Brands International has been kicked hardest. While shares of Dole Foods, the other large public company with banana operations, dropped to $27.75 yesterday, from a high of $48 last year, Chiquita's stock price has plunged to $15.75 from a high of $50.75 last year. That brings the company's stock price below its year-end book value of $19.39 a share. **********Chiquita's hard knocks show the difficulty of dressing up what is essentially a commodity food as a premium brand. The Cincinnati-based company spends about $20 million a year on television and magazine advertising to convince shoppers, grocers and its stockholders that bananas blessed with the Chiquita seal are somehow worth more than the others. **********But a banana is just a banana. ""Nobody has been successful at putting a brand name on a perishable commodity,"" said Michael Kennedy, an analyst at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis. ""They always say, this time it's going to be different."" **********Not even the company's Carmen Miranda-esque logo protected Chiquita from having to sell its bananas at prices within pennies of the lowest on the pier. ""Sometimes the premium is pretty narrow,"" said David Diver, vice president for produce at Hannaford Brothers, a supermarket chain in Portland, Me. **********Industry executives disagree somewhat about the reason for the weak prices. Dole, which is somewhat cushioned because of its operations in other fresh fruits and in real estate and packaged goods, blamed the ""high volumes of shipments in the banana industry, which have depressed prices worldwide"" for a 25 percent decline in second-quarter profits. **********Yet Keith Lindner, Chiquita's 32-year-old president and son of the financier Carl H. Lindner, attributes falling prices -- and Chiquita's own 89 percent plunge in profits in the first quarter -- to an industrywide crop of poor-quality fruit as well as to fierce competition in Europe this year. **********He rejected the criticism by some analysts on Wall Street that the company, which is 46 percent owned by the Lindners' American Financial Corporation, was too aggressive in expanding banana production. **********Nevertheless, Chiquita, at least temporarily, plans to stop planting more banana trees this year after spending heavily in the previous two years to expand. Financed in part with the proceeds from public offerings that raised $474 million, Chiquita aggressively stepped up spending on land, production operations and freighters a few years ago, investing $282 million in 1990 and more than $400 million last year. In the 1980's, it typically spent between $30 million to $78 million a year. **********Chiquita is by no means stopping investment. It will spend more than $400 million -- the same as last year -- but mostly on six previously ordered ships for Chiquita's Great White Fleet of refrigerated freighters. (One of the latest additions, the Courtney, is named after Keith Lindner's wife.) **********The company took advantage of a steadily rising stock price in 1990 and 1991 to sell shares, in part to finance the expansion. In early 1990, it sold 7.1 million shares at $19.07 a share. That December, it sold 3.3 million shares at $30.625 a share. Last summer, the company sold 5.6 million shares at $43.625 a share. **********American growers had great hopes that a unified European market would bring new selling opportunities. ""There was a feeling that the door in Europe would swing wide open,"" said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities. **********But because of a breakdown in trade talks between the United States and the European Community, countries like Spain, France and Britain were allowed to keep exclusive agreements to buy all their bananas from their former colonies. The community is also considering a 20 percent tariff on bananas from Latin America, where the Big Three brands grow most of their produce. **********Without explosive demand in Europe, bananas have been left to rot on the piers in Ecuador, banana executives said. Fruit from Latin America is flooding into European countries like Germany and Austria that lack entrenched relationships with banana-growing countries. Banana companies have also tried to increase their market share in the event that quotas are set based on current volumes. **********As a result, retail prices in parts of Europe dropped this spring by 20 percent from last year. They fell a more modest 12 percent in the United States, which also absorbed some of the excesses, and could tumble more here if tariffs are imposed in European markets now open to Latin fruit. **********In New York, bananas cost about 29 cents a pound retail, down a nickel from last year. **********Profits of the fruit companies have suffered. In April, Chiquita stunned Wall Street when it reported that earnings for the first quarter had plunged 89 percent, to $5.5 million on sales of $1.16 billion, down 1.8 percent.  A Different Image **********Chiquita's problems are a setback for Keith Lindner. Some analysts said the company was overly optimistic about the prospects for expansion in Europe and that the company had hid from Wall Street just how severely the low prices would hurt it. **********""I basically feel I've been lied to,"" said Timothy S. Ramey, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence in New York. Since 1984, when his family purchased a controlling interest in the company, then known as United Fruit, Mr. Lindner deliberately set out to cultivate a more open image than his secretive father, who runs a far-ranging empire with holdings in insurance and broadcasting. Unlike his father, Keith Lindner regularly talks to Wall Street analysts and the news media. **********He has also worked to overcome lingering questions about his father's investment style. In the 1970's, Carl Lindner was accused of fraud and stock manipulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the same case as his business associate, Charles H. Keating Jr. Both men settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt and agreed not to violate securities laws, but the case made some investors wary about investing with the Lindners in Chiquita. **********news media. **********He has also worked to overcome lingering questions about his father's investment style.

The fast-growing company's stock, once a source of glee in the town, plummeted on Nov. 25 to a fraction of its former value after its chairman, William J. Hebding, and two other top executives were suspended for falsifying the books. **********The news stunned Wall Street, which had been attracted to the little company's robust growth and clean-cut image. But if the people here share Wall Street's pain, they do not share its astonishment. The men who founded and built the company to annual sales of $101 million, and who have now disgraced it, were figures in a society where the distance between the lofty and the humble is often no wider than the local luncheonette counter. **********Community members saw what Wall Street missed: the long, bitter feud among the original founders, the shedding of old wives for new ones, the sudden adoption of an opulent life style. **********""They were spending a lot of money trying to grow too fast,"" said Dan Williams, a local businessman. ""I guess they just wanted to goose the stock so they could be rich in a hurry."" **********Some local residents who were early investors in the company rode the stock rise to wealth, too. But those who held their shares too long now feel devastated at the stock's collapse. ""I tell folks those are just paper losses if they don't sell right now,"" said Mr. Williams, part of the regular crowd gathered for early coffee at the McDonald's across the street from the original Comptronix factory, which makes electronic circuit boards and assembles parts for other companies. ""But that doesn't help much."" **********In reality, though, the 7,000 people in this little town, on a peninsula in one of Alabama's largest man-made lakes, have much more than money at stake in the current scandal. Comptronix is the town's largest employer, with 750 people working at two local plants. Local industrial development bonds helped finance the company's birth, and local banks are among its lenders. Almost everyone in town has someone who works at the company, and E. Townes Duncan, an outside director who has stepped in as interim chairman, has met with employees to try to reassure them about the company's future. **********Mr. Duncan announced today that the company's bankers had agreed to continue its $20 million line of credit for working capital, although its inability to produce reliable audits put it in violation of the terms of those credit lines. The announcement helped the stock as it gained 75 cents today, to close at $7.375 in over-the-counter trading. **********But in a town where ""S.E.C."" is a football conference, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, the complicated crisis at Comptronix remains a source of bleak confusion. ""Do you think they will hire those three guys back?"" asked a clerk at the courthouse. Explanations about the obstacles of investor lawsuits and S.E.C. inquiries and fraud audits drew nothing but a frown and a shake of the head. **********""The town is right to be worried,"" said one industry analyst who is examining the Comptronix financial records. ""Something like this can completely erode the industry's confidence in a company. When that is gone, you can't get it back."" **********Besides Mr. Hebding, two other men -- Allen L. Shifflett, the Comptronix president, and J. Paul Medlin, its treasurer -- were suspended for participating in the accounting scheme that had artificially inflated the company's profits for more than three years. **********Mr. Hebding did not respond to a message left at his home here, nor did his lawyer respond to calls to his office. Mr. Shifflett has an unlisted telephone number at his home, and could not be reached. And messages left on an answering machine at Mr. Medlin's home were not returned. **********But through interviews with current Comptronix management, numerous former colleagues, analysts and lawyers and a review of company and courthouse records, it is possible to retrace the path that these men followed to fortune and to scandal. **********Comptronix was the brainchild of a small, close-knit team of men, mostly young and all discontented, who had climbed their way up in the growing electronics industry centered on Huntsville, 35 miles to the northwest.  Hired in Huntsville **********Bill Hebding joined that community in 1974, when he was hired to assist the chief financial officer at S.C.I. Systems, then a modest but booming electronics maker and now a $1.2 billion company. When Mr. Hebding joined S.C.I., he met Mr. Shifflett, an operations manager who had joined the year before. **********The hard-working Mr. Hebding soon eclipsed his boss, former colleagues said, and in 1986 he was named chief financial officer of S.C.I. Mr. Medlin, a young University of Alabama graduate who had joined S.C.I. in 1979, soon became his assistant. **********In 1981, S.C.I. hired Harvey L. Pegram, a middle-aged man with more than two decades of experience in the arcane craft of electronics parts purchasing. Charles D. Tillett, another perky and eager executive, rounded out the group that clustered around the ingratiating Mr. Hebding at S.C.I. in the early 1980's. **********This was the team that helped form Comptronix in late 1983 and early 1984. Only Mr. Tillett did not stay the course. Within a few years he had returned to S.C.I., where he remained until last year, when he was appointed as a vice president at Comptronix and returned to Guntersville. Today, in the aftermath of the scandal, he is the company's interim chief operating officer. **********Mr. Hebding may have been the catalyst for the exodus from S.C.I., former colleagues say. They had become aware of increased tension between him and the senior management at S.C.I., friction that reached its culmination at an S.C.I. managers' meeting in 1983. At that session the company's chairman, Olin King, apparently offended Mr. Hebding by publicly admonishing him not to play favorites when he allocated fixed costs among the various profit centers. **********Mr. King would not comment on the incident, which occurred before more than 100 managers. ""Anything I might say would just sound like sour grapes at this point,"" he said this week. ""So I would rather just not comment on what happened then, or now.""  Treated Like Royalty **********Guntersville, a modest county seat whose last business boom had been based on livestock feed and cotton mills, greeted the young electronics entrepreneurs like royalty. The town's fathers, led by Mayor Robert L. Hembree, offered a deal on an empty knitting mill on Gunter Avenue. Mr. Hembree was invited to sit on the Comptronix board. Jimmy Kimsey, president of the Home Bank, arranged some welcome credit, and he, too, joined the young company's board. **********Enthusiasm and hard work could not disguise the red ink that flowed for the next two years. But by 1987, venture capitalists, some of whom had known Mr. Hebding as the chief financial contact at S.C.I., had taken an interest in Comptronix. They included Mr. Duncan, a partner in the Massey Burch Investment Group, a venture capital firm in Nashville, , and now the interim chairman. **********In 1989, after two years of stellar sales and solid profits, the team of men who had gambled to form Comptronix finally grasped the entrepreneurial brass ring: their company went public, selling its stock to investors for $5 a share. **********But if 1989 was the year that these men's dream came true, it was also the year, in hindsight, when the dream began to dissolve into a nightmare. **********For it was sometime in 1989 that Mr. Hebding, Mr. Shifflett and Mr. Medlin first devised and put into place the profit-inflating scheme that was exposed last week. That year, the company, fresh from its rosy promises to Wall Street, saw S.C.I. take away a major customer, Connor Peripherals, and its founding team split apart in a bitter feud that continues to this day. **********There had already been signs of strain for the men leading Comptronix, local court records show. Mr. Hebding's marriage had failed, and he had led an active bachelor life that had generated a few unseemly spats around town. Mr. Shifflett, too, had divorced and remarried. In summer 1989 a fight broke out between Mr. Hebding and Mr. Pegram, the company's executive vice president, who had grown increasingly disenchanted with his status in the company. He sued in August and left the company in December 1989.  A Local Life Style **********Meanwhile, Mr. Hebding and Mr. Shifflett were constructing a local life style that contrasted sharply with their conservative, modest image among the half-dozen Wall Street analysts who had visited the company's offices here. **********""I wish I had counted the number of times that people calling me had said that Bill Hebding was the last person on earth they would have suspected of this,"" said Mark Plummer, an analyst who follows the company for Stephens & Company in Little Rock, Ark. ""I had been out to his house a few years ago, and it was nice but not a mansion. He struck me as a simple, honest man."" **********It is hard to find any word but ""mansion"" to describe the $1 million home Mr. Hebding bought last year on the shores of Buck Island, across the lake from Guntersville. A long, Normandy-style home is flanked by a two-bay boathouse and a pool; a bright red Jaguar is in the garage. A wrought-iron fence with a filagreed electric gate, hung now with wreaths and red ribbons, protects the property. **********Similarly Mr. Shifflett's recent real estate holdings fill several pages of the local deed and mortgage records. He and his second wife have recently purchased a scenic lot in an expensive country club community outside the nearby town of Arab. **********No one here will guess at what initially motivated these men, at the pinnacle of success, to cheat on their company's audits. One analyst suggested that it might have been the pressure of losing a major customer in 1989, right after making promises to Wall Street. A former colleague at S.C.I. wondered if Mr. Hebding might not simply have been driven to outdo his former mentor, Mr. King, by whatever means necessary. Townspeople like Mr. Williams offer a simpler answer: ""Greed.""  Timing Seems Mystery **********Mr. Duncan, the interim chairman, said he had no idea why Mr. Hebding suddenly, on Nov. 13, disclosed the long-running scheme to the company's lawyers. ""There was a routine tax audit going on,"" he said. ""Maybe that triggered it. We just don't know."" **********When the executives were confronted by the stunned directors and ultimately suspended from their jobs, Mr. Duncan said, they showed no emotional reaction at all. **********""There were perhaps some attempts to explain, and words to the effect that we should do whatever was best for the company,"" he said. ""But there was no dramatic reaction, really."" **********He added: ""It's like I told a group of our bankers. The questions that arise here are questions for novelists and psychologists, not for businessmen and lawyers."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/20/business/new-type-of-company-stirs-tax-worry-in-albany.html,Kevin Sack,1992-06-20,,909,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,New Type of Company Stirs Tax Worry in Albany,New Type of Company Stirs Tax Worry in Albany," **********State lawmakers said this week that efforts to create a new kind of business entity in New York had been seriously wounded by new projections showing that the businesses could mean the state would lose up to $65 million a year in tax revenue. **********The businesses, known as limited liability companies, are hybrid entities with the legal insulation of a corporation and the preferred tax treatment of a limited partnership. **********Limited liability companies, authorized by the Internal Revenue Service in 1988, could be attractive for a wide spectrum of businesses, including real estate firms, investment banks and venture capital projects. **********Among the most active lobbyists for the bill in Albany is Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street house. James D. Featherstonhaugh, the firm's Albany lobbyist, said Goldman, Sachs would ""in all likelihood"" convert from its current limited partnership status to a limited liability company if the bill passed. **********There has also been heavy lobbying by lawyers and accountants, who see rich new markets in the companies. They contend that many businesses might form limited liability companies in other states if New York does not authorize them soon. They cite in particular Delaware, which has long competed with New York for new business formations. **********Like a limited partnership, a limited liability company would not be subject to corporate income tax. Instead, the business income would be taxable only as the personal income of its investors. But like a corporation, a limited liability company would minimize legal risk to its investors. If a company lost a lawsuit, the liability of its members would be limited to the amount of their personal investments. **********""It's the best of all possible worlds,"" said Richard Runes, counsel to the Senate Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee. **********But James W. Wetzler, the state Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, is not enthusaistic. A recent analysis by his department concluded that the state could lose $40 million to $65 million a year in tax revenue from corporations that became limited liability companies. Hope Not Abandoned **********The sponsors of the bill, which would make New York the 15th state to allow the formation of limited liability companies, have not yet abandoned hope. But with the state's straitened fiscal condition, several key legislators said today, it would be unthinkable to pass a bill that could cost the state so much money. **********Legislators are discussing the idea of compensating for lost tax revenue by imposing heavy filing fees when limited liability companies are formed. But there is no agreement yet on how to avoid a revenue loss and the Legislature is likely to recess within the next two weeks. **********""It may cause a fatal problem,"" said Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan and chairman of the Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee. ""We won't do the bill unless we can find a way to make it revenue-neutral."" **********Supporters of the bill see limited liability companies as the wave of the future in business formation. While offering the tax advantages of a limited partnership and the legal protection of a corporation, they are not burdened by many of the organizational restrictions of those business structures. S Corporations Available **********Some businesses in New York can already form what are known as S corporations after the subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes them. These, too, offer limited liability to their shareholders and pay no corporate income tax. **********But an S corporation has certain restrictions that would not apply to a limited liability company; for example, they can have no more than 35 shareholders, and no foreign shareholders.. **********Unlike investors in a limited partnership, who are barred from managing the business, investors in a limited liability company can play a management role. **********""It has has enormous flexibility and it has simplicity,"" said Howard N. Lefkowitz, chairman of the corporation law committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. ""It allows people to take part in the control of a company without subjecting them to the liabilities of the company."" **********Even if legislators fashion a last-minute solution to the revenue problem, they must also settle a dispute over a provision that would require limited liability companies to advertise their formation in legal journals and other newspapers. **********The Republican-dominated Senate is insisting on a clause that would require the publication of formation notices in two newspapers for six consecutive weeks, at a cost of up to $2,000. That measure has been supported by The New York Law Journal, published by James Finkelstein, the brother of the City Council President, Andrew Stein, and by the New York Press Association, a consortium of more than 300 weekly newspapers. **********Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell, Democrat of the Bronx and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, objects strongly to the provision, saying the publication costs may drive limited liability companies to other states where publication is not required. **********""There's absolutely no public benefit,"" Mr. Koppell said. ""It's featherbedding at its worst."" **********But Senator John B. Daly, a Republican of Lewiston and chairman of the Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee, wants the publication provision. **********""The purpose is just to notify people that a company is forming,"" he said. ""And I don't see that as much of a disincentive for people to form a limited liablity company in New York State."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/24/world/lethal-violence-rises-in-israeli-occupied-territory.html,Clyde Haberman,1992-12-24,,845,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Lethal Violence Rises in Israeli-Occupied Territory,Lethal Violence Rises in Israeli-Occupied Territory," **********Israel's deportation of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon last week has led to a surge of unrest in the occupied territories and, with it, a sharp rise in the number of Palestinians shot to death by soldiers. **********Israeli Army officers insist that they have not changed standing regulations in a way that allows soldiers in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to open fire more readily than before. **********But they acknowledge that an unusually large number of people are being killed in the territories -- 11 in the last six days -- raising questions about whether a trend in recent years toward fewer such deaths is starting to be reversed. **********""When you have so many killed, you're doing something wrong,"" an Israeli official said. **********The expelled Palestinians remained in a patch of southern Lebanon today, caught between Lebanese Army forces who refuse to let them pass and Israeli authorities who say they are now Beirut's responsibility. **********In an attempt to increase international pressure on Israel to take the exiles back, Lebanon is blocking relief agencies from delivering supplies to their tent camp. And the Palestinians, Islamic fundamentalists judged by Israel to be security threats, say openly that they view their hardship as a publicity-generating weapon in the campaign against Israel.  Conditions of Life Worsening **********Journalists who visited their camp today said conditions had deteriorated, with clean drinking water gone and food and medicine short. An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross said that since the Lebanese authorities refuse to let supplies through, he wants to bring them in through a strip of southern Lebanon controlled by Israel and a client militia. **********But in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres insisted that supplying aid was not Israel's issue. ""They are under Lebanese rule,"" he said, ""and it's really for the Lebanese to decide to open or to close the ways needed to support the deportees."" **********At this point, the fate of the expelled Palestinians seems a battle of words between Palestinian negotiators in the Middle East peace talks, who feel under pressure to be firm, and Israeli leaders, who hope to mitigate the effects of condemnations abroad. **********Faisal al-Husseini, the Palestinian leader in East Jerusalem, warned at a news conference today that the Mideast talks were dying and that Palestinians had other choices than negotiations, including ""the armed struggle option."" Asked if the time for armed struggle was at hand, Mr. Husseini replied, ""We are at the edge."" There was no sign, however, that the Palestinians had given up on the talks for good. **********The Israelis sought to put the best face on a difficult situation. Some ministers again urged Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to offset the expulsions by agreeing to negotiate directly with the Palestine Liberation Organization, but Mr. Rabin turned them down. **********There were, however, hints that the Government might start inching its way toward open talks with someone like Mr. Husseini, who as a P.L.O. associate they have thus far avoided. **********Israel must also contend with strong Palestinian street anger over the expulsions, which for many people evokes their worst fears that Israel's ultimate goal is a policy of mass transfer, as advocated by some on the far right. **********That rage has led to occasional battles with soldiers, and to deaths. **********In the six days since the deportations, 11 Palestinians have been killed, 10 in the Gaza town of Khan Yunis and an adjacent refugee district. Why Khan Yunis has been singularly violent is not clear. But clashes there have been fierce whenever the Israelis authorities even briefly lifted a curfew that had been imposed on the entire Gaza Strip until today. **********Two brothers were killed today during new disorders in Khan Yunis. The army has not made public its account, but Gazans said Ismail Abdeen, 27, had stepped out on a second-floor balcony, perhaps to see what was happening below, and was shot. **********His body tumbled from the balcony to the street. Seeing this, his brother, Naim, 32, became enraged and, according to a cousin, started throwing stones at the soldiers. They then shot him, too. Previous Killings of Israelis **********In the cyclical nature of this long conflict, the latest Palestinian deaths followed a spurt of severe violence against Israelis, dominated by the killing of five servicemen this month. That event led directly to the expulsions. **********Even before the expulsions, the death rate had been rising, especially in Gaza's hardscrabble refugee areas and towns. Since Oct. 1, at least 48 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers. This monthly average of at least 16 is double that in the last two years. **********In fact, Israel had taken pains to point out that in the last few years Palestinians were more and more likely to be killed by fellow Arabs than by soldiers, suspected as collaborators. Now, the death rate more closely resembles that of the early months of the Palestinian uprising in 1987 and 1988, when several dozen people were killed in a typical month."

He said this was to prevent opposing parties from busing supporters to voting districts where they were weak. **********And two of the main opposition contenders, Oginga Odinga and Mwai Kibaki, charged that serious electoral irregularities had already occurred. They insisted that the President would finish no higher than third in a fair election. **********Mr. Moi, who succeeded Jomo Kenyatta as President in 1978, may have surpassed him in concentrating Kenyan political power in the presidency. After a coup attempt 10 years ago, he intensified efforts to put down dissent. **********A year ago, Mr. Moi grudgingly agreed under foreign pressure to end a ban on opposition parties and promised fair elections. Some thought Kenya, long a one-party state, was moving toward political pluralism. **********But increasingly in recent weeks, the political climate has again turned rough and sometimes ugly, with little focus on issues. Candidates and their supporters have often campaigned with invective and have sometimes returned to violence. **********An editorial today in The Nation, an independent paper, reflected the anger and anxiety many Kenyans feel. **********""It impossible to pretend,"" it said, ""that the electoral process has been totally fair. Kenyans should make no mistake: as a country we are at a crossroads. Kenya's once-booming economy is under severe pressure"" and can no longer bear ""the effects of accumulated corruption and inefficiency that is pulling it down."". Once Seen as a Model **********Such pessimism is striking in light of Kenya's previous reputation as an economically stable and politically mature African country. In the 1970's and 80's, in part because of its pro-Western outlook and position on the Indian Ocean, Kenya received large amounts of Western aid. **********In recent months, though, much aid has been suspended because donors including the United States regard the Moi Government as increasingly corrupt and authoritarian. **********The conventional wisdom in Kenyan political circles had at first been that virtually any of the seven candidates challenging Mr. Moi would win handily in a fair contest. So incompetent and unpopular was the incumbent, it was said, that he would be lucky to win a majority even among his own small tribe, the Kalenjin. **********But Mr. Moi is a relentless campaigner and his party, the long-ruling Kenya African National Union, remains a vote-generating machine. **********The President's pitch has not wavered: Stability, he says, can be guaranteed only if he and his party win. The other parties, he insists, represent tribalism, the curse of Africa. **********""The opposition badly underestimated Moi,"" said an African diplomat with long experience in Kenya. ""Here is a man who has been a professional politician for 37 years; you don't last that long at the top unless you're smart and savvy. Moi has outwitted them all.""  Second Round Possible **********Still, predictions about the outcome are uncertain. The main question is whether Mr. Moi can win the 25 percent in five of the eight provinces that is required for outright victory. If he fails, most impartial observers believe, he will face a tougher run-off against the strongest challenger. **********The prospects for a first-round opposition victory, however, are hardly promising. The opposition is deeply split along regional and tribal lines. Mr. Odinga, a Luo from western Kenya and a former Vice President, leads one faction. Kenneth Matiba, a Kikuyu and former Cabinet minister, who was detained by Mr. Moi for almost a year in 1990 and 1991 for urging an end to one-party rule, leads another. Still another faction, the Democratic Party, is led by a former Vice President and Finance Minister, Mwai Kibaki, who is also from the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and formerly the most powerful in Kenya. **********Perceptions of electoral integrity, or the lack of it, are expected to determine whether Kenya stands at the dawn of progress under a new democracy or the brink of political disarray. Only the Government and the ruling-party apparatus can tamper with the vote effectively. If Mr. Moi wins, the cheating issue will loom large. **********Whether the election is perceived as being fair will determine in large part whether donor nations will continue to reduce or withhold aid."

There is a file here on each of the institute's 600 employees, and although they are never allowed to peek inside, they live all their lives with their file looming over them. **********As part of China's complex system of social control and surveillance, the authorities keep a dangan, or file, on virtually everyone except peasants. Indeed, most Chinese have two dangan: one at their workplace and another in their local police station. **********""Here's one, a man called Ji,"" Zhang Yuhong, a 34-year-old Communist Party member and dangan clerk at the design institute, said as she skimmed through the loose-leaf binder that served as Mr. Ji's dangan, pronounced dahng-ahn. **********""School records and grade transcripts,"" she began, offering a foreigner a rare look into the dangan system. ""Entry into the Communist Youth League and the Communist Party. Family members and photo. Promotions and level of work. Performance evaluations. That kind of thing. About 10 items."" Employer Keeps the File **********A file is opened on each urban citizen when he or she enters elementary school, and it shadows the person throughout life, moving on to high school, college and employer. Particularly for officials, students, professors and Communist Party members, the dangan contain political evaluations that affect career prospects and permission to leave the country. **********The file system in China is fundamentally different from any in the West, not only because the Chinese system encompasses all urban citizens, but because the file is kept by one's employer. The dangan affects promotions and job opportunities, and it is difficult to escape from because any prospective employer is supposed to examine an applicant's dangan before making a hiring decision. And there is no Freedom of Information Act to allow access to material in one's file. **********The dangan is part of a web of social controls that insure order in China. Other elements of the web include the personal identity card that each citizen must carry, the residence permit that determines in what city a person can live, and the ""work unit"" that provides lifetime employment, housing, political study and permission to have a child. **********It is a remarkable achievement for a poor developing country that it can maintain hundreds of millions of secret files on its urban population. From an American perspective, the extensive dangan system is one way in which China distinguishes itself as an aspiring totalitarian regime rather than a mere dictatorship. **********Yet from a Chinese perspective, the absence of a comprehensive system of national files is one of the most perplexing lapses of American society, like the inability of New York to curb graffiti or narcotics. In China, which has a 3,000-year history of bureaucratic controls and no tradition of privacy -- not even a good way of expressing the idea in the Chinese language -- virtually nobody seems upset about the presence of the dangan system. **********In part, this is because most of the files are now innocuous. Those who have seen files of ordinary workers say that they contain mostly mundane school and job records. But the dangan are much more important for intellectuals and officials, and the Communist Party Organization Department reviews the dangan of any candidate for promotion to department director. **********In any case, the dangan system is losing its effectiveness as a method of social surveillance. **********""I don't think a dangan is very important any more,"" said an academic whose heavy involvement in the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989 has somehow been overlooked and who continues to be entrusted with delicate Government assignments. ""It doesn't always matter very much what's inside."" **********With the same ingenuity that they use to get around other Government regulations, young Chinese have devised a catalogue of ways to render their files harmless, even if they took part in the 1989 protests. Out of Harm's Way **********Many of those with politically questionable backgrounds, for example, resigned from their work units and arranged to transfer their file into an employment company for young intellectuals. With the files out of harm's way, they could complete the paperwork necessary to go abroad. **********Another option, for those with plenty of money, is to pay a huge ""fee"" of thousands of dollars to a company with close links to family members of China's leaders. The company then arranges for the applicant to be sent abroad on an ""official"" trip. **********Yet another alternative is to go into business -- an increasingly attractive idea to many intellectuals, considering the huge profits that can be earned. Companies in bustling southern China often do not even ask to see a job applicant's file, which remains with the previous employer or with the ""street committee"" that controls the area where the worker lives. **********""Companies just care about making money,"" said a woman who has some political problems and is leaving her job in the Government. ""They'll never even see my dangan."" **********The riskiest approach of all is to get hold of one's file and either destroy it or take out any nasty bits. This is possible because when people transfer from one job to another they are sometimes given their dangan -- suitably sealed -- to deliver personally to their new employer. A fine cut along the side allows access to the contents and can easily be pasted shut again, the cognoscenti say. **********To prevent tampering, the files of a work unit's leaders are not kept in the regular file room of that unit but in the organization that supervises it.  There are also clear rules about who can add an item to a file or remove it; in theory, adjustments to the dangan can be made only by a personnel committee acting together. But there are occasional abuses. **********China's official newspapers reported the case of a soldier who was discharged after a fine career in the army, but was puzzled when every prospective employer turned him down in horror. Finally, he learned that a personal enemy who worked in the army's file office had added a report to his dangan saying he had a bad attitude and an immoral personal life. **********The file clerk responsible for the tampering was punished, and the false report was removed from the file."

S. Inc., the bankrupt drugstore chain, said yesterday that it had agreed to pay the Jack Eckerd Corporation $7.5 million to drop its takeover bid. **********The payment, which must be approved by Judge Harold White of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio, clears the way for Revco to emerge from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings it entered in July 1988. **********""After three years and seven months, this thing is finally over,"" said Stuart Hertzberg, an attorney for Revco's trade creditors, which include Procter & Gamble, Eastman Kodak and Gillette. ""We are delighted to be moving forward."" **********The payment covers Eckerd's expenses of pursuing the $1 billion takeover bid it began last spring. The deal comes five weeks after the Rite Aid Corporation, the nation's largest drugstore chain, withdrew its $730 million bid for Revco. **********Revco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, was once the largest drugstore chain in the world. Its bankruptcy filing came less than two years after it took on $1.4 billion in debt in a management buyout. **********While having to pay lawyers and financial consultants during the drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings, Revco executives have struggled to regain control of the company, which was reduced to 1,150 stores from 2,000 in 1988. **********For much of last year, they were fighting the takeover bids of Eckerd, based in Clearwater, Fla., and Rite Aid, based in Shiremanstown, Pa. With Eckerd's retreat and Rite Aid's withdrawal, Revco appears to have survived; no new bidders are expected. **********Under the agreement with Eckerd, Revco will raise $7.5 million from holders of its junk bonds by offering one million shares of new Revco stock at $7.47 a share. Revco's financial partner, the Zell/Chilmark Fund, has agreed to buy any unsold shares. **********""Revco is not actually paying this $7.5 million,"" said Diana Lupetow, a Revco spokeswoman. ""It's coming from the outside."" **********The plan has already been approved by Revco's three main creditor committees, representing about 80 percent of the outstanding debt, Ms. Lupeton said. Two other creditor groups -- holders of pre-1988 debt -- are still studying the proposal. **********If the bankruptcy court does not object to the disclosure statement of Revco's reorganization plan to be submitted at a hearing today, it will go to the creditors for a vote by March 6. According to Revco's plan, the court will then grant or deny approval on March 11. Revco was valued at $925 million in the plan submitted to court. **********Eckerd agreed to ""postpone indefinetely"" its offer because it would have led to greater costs and delays than it was willing to bear, the company's chairman, Stewart Turley, said in a statement. The $7.5 million fee, a spokesman said, represented legal, banking and administrative costs incurred since May 1991. **********Eckerd, however, reserved the right to resubmit a bid should the Revco reorganization plan fail to be approved."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/27/business/credit-markets-bonds-rally-as-dollar-stabilizes.html,Jonathan Fuerbringer,1992-08-27,,1009,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bonds Rally as Dollar Stabilizes,CREDIT MARKETS; Bonds Rally as Dollar Stabilizes," **********The bond market put together a decent rally yesterday after the dollar stabilized, a key economic barometer confirmed that the economy was barely growing and the Treasury's five-year note auction went fairly well. **********The rise in prices and drop in yields was across the board, from three-month bills to the 30-year bond. The move started slowly in the morning, gained as the report on durable goods was released and then moved on as it seemed clear that the dollar would hold its own for a day. **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at 98 in late trading, up 5/8, to yield 7.41 percent, compared with 7.47 percent Tuesday. The 6.375 percent 10-year bond was up 21/32, to yield 6.63 percent, compared with 6.72 percent the day before. The 4.25 percent two-year note that had a mediocre auction Tuesday rebounded yesterday. It was up 5/32 to yield 4.25 percent, compared with the 4.30 percent average yield in the auction and the 4.34 percent it was trading at after the Tuesday auction. Presidential Election Uncertainty **********No one knows how long the dollar calm will last. Many currency analysts think the sluggish American economy, the uncertainty about the Presidential election and much higher interest rates in Europe will continue to push the dollar lower. **********It is still hard to gauge how effective the coordinated central bank intervention, led by the Federal Reserve, has been and will be in slowing the dollar decline. In the last two days, the central banks have not intervened to buy dollars and the dollar has not declined. When they intervened last Friday the dollar fell 1 percent and when they bought dollars again on Monday the American currency fell 2 percent. **********""It could turn around quickly,"" said John Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation. ""We will be as finicky as the dollar in the next couple of weeks."" **********It is possible that if the decline is slow, the fundamental forces that are supporting the bond market -- low inflation and slow economic growth - will prevail again. But no one seems willing to make that bet now. **********The price rally yesterday, however, was not as much as might have been expected given that the durable goods report showed an unexpectedly sharp decline in July. The fall of 3.4 percent in orders was the steepest in six months and way beyond market forecasts, which ranged from up a little to down a little. Durable goods rose a revised 2.8 percent in June. **********In addition, the level of orders on the books fell for the 11th straight month. Many economists say this decline means that it will be some time before manufacturing companies begin hiring additional workers, another factor that means economic growth will continue to be sluggish. **********But traders said that the weakness of the dollar means that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to ease interest rates in the near future, even if the economic data continue to be weak. For investors, therefore, there is less of a chance that short-term interest rates will move lower soon, which would give the bond market another reason to rally. And so the durable goods report gave the market less of a boost than it might have a month ago. **********""The Federal Reserve has been neutralized as a market factor by the dollar,"" said Joseph Liro, the newly appointed chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company in New York. ""The Fed will not tighten to defend the dollar. And they can not ease because the dollar is too weak."" Treasury 5-Year Note Sale **********The Treasury auction of $10.6 billion in five-year notes went well, in part because the decline in bond market prices in the last several days had increased the coupon and the yield on the new note and made it much more attractive. Bond and note prices move in the opposite direciton of yields. **********The average yield at the auction was 5.74 percent, which is far above the 5.56 percent a month ago, which is a reflection of the damage the falling dollar did to the bond market. The yield is even farther above the 5.46 percent the note was trading at in the pre-auction or when issued market late last week. **********But the combination of a 5.625 percent coupon and a lot of cash that had been sitting on the sidelines for several days while the dollar was falling made for some decent demand, traders said. And that was also reflected in the trading after the auction results were announced. Late yesterday, the yield on the new-five year note had fallen to 5.67 percent, which means that the demand had drivien its price higher. **********Mr. Costas of First Boston also said that the market was helped over all yesterday by some good buying from pension and other funds in the United States and from foreigners, who also had been sitting out the last several days. He said the combination of a stable -- but very weak -- dollar and the recent decline in bond and note prices made the American market especially attractive to foreign investors. **********Following are the results of the Treasury auction of the five-year note yesterday: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.506  Average Yield . . . 5.74%  Low Price . . . 99.506  High Yield . . . 5.74%  High Price . . . 99.592  Low Yield . . . 5.72%  Accepted at low price . . . 66%  Total applied for . . . $29,350 500  Accepted . . . $10,587,749  N.Y. applied for . . . $27,286,856  N.Y. accepted . . . $10,001,587  Noncompetitive . . . $590,000  Interest set at . . . 5 5/8%  The five-year notes mature Aug. 31, 1997."

After the announcement, the German stock market rose 4.4 percent, and the French, Belgian and Italian markets gained more than 3.5 percent each.  [ In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.52 points, or 2.1 percent. ]  Bonds and the dollar also rallied in world markets. German Rates Remain High **********But the gains today and the optimism surrounding them would almost certainly evaporate if the French reject the unification treaty. **********And even with the cuts, German rates remain high. The Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's ceiling on short-term rates, was cut to 9.5 percent from 9.75 percent; the discount rate, at which commercial banks borrow from the central bank, was cut to 8.25 percent from 8.75 percent. **********These cuts by themselves are not sufficient to jump-start the economies of Europe or the United States, economists said. Rather, they said, it would take a series of interest-rate reductions, in Germany and in other nations, at a time when most governments are grappling with large fiscal deficits as well as their monetary problems.  Tightfisted Policies **********But the symbolism seemed as important as the actual size of the cuts. The Bundesbank is famed for its tightfisted, anti-inflationary policies and its independence from political pressures, and it has been willing to hold German interest rates at high levels with no regard for the effect on its fellow members of the European Community and the rest of the world economy. **********The high German rates had been blamed for snuffing out any chance of economic recovery in Europe by forcing other nations to keep their rates high to defend the value of their currencies. Even the modest drop in German rates gives other nations more flexibility to lower their own rates, or at least avert an increase. In the United States, for example, the Federal Reserve might feel it has the freedom to nudge the already low interest rates lower, hoping to stimulate the economy. **********Because lower rates improve the outlook for economic recovery, they foster optimism among investors, rallying the stock markets. **********A healthier Europe would be beneficial to the United States by increasing demand for goods from American companies. **********The high German rates also attracted investments from other countries, strengthening the mark against other currencies and contributing to the slide of the dollar, the Italian lira and other currencies.  The Markets' Hope **********""It looks pretty clear that the Bundesbank has done the minimum it can get away with,"" said Nigel Gault, the chief European economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm. ""But the markets seem to be looking at it with the hope that German rates have peaked and will now trend down."" **********The Bundesbank had shocked the financial markets with its statement on Sunday night that it would reduce rates today. But it did not reveal then how large the cuts would be. Its commitment to reducing rates was made as part of a coordinated effort in the European Community to stabilize currency markets by devaluing the Italian lira, the weakest of the leading European currencies. **********In currency trading today, the dollar posted solid gains and the lira surged. Indeed, Europe's central banks were forced to buy British pounds because that currency slipped so sharply against the lira. **********""There may have been some disappointment in the markets because there had been some people saying that the Bundesbank might push down rates 1 or 2 percent, but in my opinion that was never realistic,"" said Ulrich Beckmann, an economist at Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt. ""Otherwise, the markets have reacted very positively."" Sign of Cooperation **********Proponents of closer European unification seized on the shift as a sign that nations could put aside their conflicting economic agendas to work together. **********With just six days left until the French referendum on the European union treaty, which was agreed to by the leaders of the 12 European Community nations in the Dutch town of Maastricht last year, Government officials campaigning in favor of a ""yes"" vote portrayed the move as proof that Germany, Europe's economic engine, could be counted on as a partner in a more unified community. **********""The spirit of Maastricht has prevailed over purely national interests,"" Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy of France said. **********Opponents of the Maastricht treaty, however, said the modest size of the reductions and the continuing uncertainty in the markets simply proved that it was unwise to allow Germany, in effect, to set monetary policy throughout Europe. 'Bit of a Cosmetic Exercise' **********""This proves that this was perhaps just a bit of a cosmetic exercise, and it underlines the fact that the European finance ministers have little control on the market,"" said John Carlisle, a Conservative member of the British Parliament. **********Economists were divided on the significance of the decision by the Bundesbank to cut rates within days of reasserting its longheld position that vigilance against inflation precluded moves to spur more economic growth. **********Some said the bank was making a historic change in policy by putting international considerations ahead of its inflation-fighting mandate. But others said it was probably motivated by a recognition that the German economy had slowed even more than the bank had earlier recognized, and that a small reduction could be justified. **********If the French reject the Maastricht treaty on Sunday, economists said, the currency markets will plunge into turmoil. If the push for European unification ends, they said, currency traders would no longer put so much faith in the determination of European nations to keep inflation low and exchange rates stable -- and will pull investments out of vulnerable currencies like the pound."

The list included Zoloft, a Pfizer treatment for depression that analysts predicted would have $1 billion in worldwide sales by 1995. **********Working late on New Year's Eve, F.D.A. officials also approved two antibiotics, Eli Lilly's Lorabid, and Warner-Lambert's Penetrex, as well as Ismo, a chest-pain treatment made by American Home Products. Analysts predicted that even bigger sales would come from Zocor, a Merck & Company treatment to reduce cholesterol levels, which was approved last week; they foresaw global sales of $1.5 billion. **********Also approved last week were SmithKline Beecham's Relafen, a nonsteroid arthritis treatment; Bristol-Myers Squibb's Cefzil, an antibiotic, and Johnson & Johnson's Supprelin to treat premature puberty in young children. **********The eight approvals topped off a year in which the Federal agency's 30 approvals equaled the 1985 approval total -- which had been the record year since the agency began keeping an annual tally in the early 60's. In 1990, 23 were approved. **********The agency said it had substantially reduced the approval time for new drug applications. The median time for new drugs approved this year was 22 months, compared with 24 months in 1990 and 29 in 1989. **********Analysts and industry spokesmen praised Dr. David Kessler, who became Food and Drug Commissioner in October 1990. ""He has truly lit a fire under the F.D.A.,"" said Neil B. Sweig, a drug analyst with Brenner Securities. **********Jeffrey W. Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Washington, said the F.D.A. was ""headed in the right direction with respect to drug approvals."" **********In a telephone interview, Dr. Kessler said the agency was already ""streamlining"" the approval process before he was appointed and that it would be making more changes to try to comply with the six-month Congressional limit for F.D.A. action, particularly for drugs for lethal diseases. **********He noted that a Bristol-Myers AIDS drug known as DDI, was approved in October, only 6.2 months after the application was submitted. He added that the average approval time for cancer treatments had been about 12 months for several years. **********""We are not going to be a bottleneck,"" Dr. Kessler said. **********Commenting on recent proposals by the White House Competitiveness Council, Dr. Kessler said he had rejected a council idea that would have let drug companies choose and pay scientists to review new drugs. **********But he said the agency would begin trying a council proposal to use outsiders, and would supervise private reviews of 8 to 12 drugs in ""areas where we have a backlog"" like arthritis and lung disease. Only drugs in a backlog will participate in such private reviews. ""We retain the decision-making,"" he added. **********Other major new drugs approved this year included Glaxo's Zofran to prevent nausea during cancer chemotherapy, and Bristol-Myers's Pravachol to lower cholesterol levels. Analysts said both would be in the billion-dollar category. **********Analysts also said that two of the recently approved drugs, Lorabid and Penetrex, would have at least $200 million in global sales by 1995, as would American Home Products' arthritis drug Lodine; three blood pressure treatments -- Bristol-Myers's Monopril, Ciba-Geigy's Lotensin and Merck's Plendil -- Syntex's Ticlid for stroke patients, and an Abbott Laboratories' antibiotic, Biaxin. **********Zithromax, a Pfizer antibiotic that was approved Nov. 1, will be delayed because the company had omitted information on 19 pneumonia patients, including four who later died from complications of the disease, Pfizer said. 'Best Is Yet to Come' **********Sam Isaly, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research in New York, projected Zithromax would have worldwide sales of $600 million, split evenly between Pfizer and a Yugoslav company, Pliva. **********""It's been a great year for new drug approvals,"" Mr. Isaly said. ""Unlike many of the 1991 drugs, which were ""based on old technologies,"" he said, ""Zofran, Zoloft and Zithromax involved really novel technology."" And other new approaches are in the test stage. ""The best is yet to come,"" he said. **********The 30 new chemical entities that have been approved do not include new systems for delivering brand-name drugs like the one-a-day capsule form of Marion Merrell Dow's blood-pressure drug Cardizem, also approved this week by the F.D.A. The company got exclusive rights for three years to sell the new version of Cardizem, which had $900 million in 1991 sales. **********The F.D.A. will report later on new vaccines, drugs based on natural components, those that are genetically engineered and generic versions of products on which patent protection has expired."

Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ""It doesn't look like it is going to get a lot better, but I don't think it is going to get worse.""  Negative Sentiment in Market **********Traders said the bounce in prices probably did not represent any sort of shift away from the negative sentiment that has dominated the market in recent weeks. **********""Trading is very thin, so any incremental buying exaggerates price moves,"" one government bond trader said. ""And after the housing numbers the market was very cheap."" **********In the price slide that followed release of the housing starts data, yields on two-year notes popped up to close at 6 percent and bond yields moved as high as 8.10 percent. **********""People were saying they didn't know if they were going to get rich on this trade, but that yields at those levels represented value,"" the trader said. **********Analysts said they were encouraged by the economic reports, but remained cautious about what recent data really portend for the future. **********""There is good evidence now that we are in fact coming out of recession,"" Mr. Kasriel said. **********""But there is considerable uncertainty about how strong the economy will be and how long it will stay that way."" **********For example, Mr. Kasriel and other analysts said abnormally warm weather in February probably lifted housing activity. And they noted that much of the gain in industrial production, the first increase in five months, resulted from a rise in automobile output. With car sales still at disappointingly low levels, similar increases in production may not be repeated in the months ahead, the analysts said. **********John Tucillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, estimated the mild weather added between 75,000 and 100,000 homes to the housing starts numbers in February. **********""I think starts will be down in March from where they were in February,"" he said, ""but we are still on an upswing."" 30-Year Bond Offering **********In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 9930/32 , up 23/32 , to yield 8.00 percent, compared with 8.06 percent late Monday. **********Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 9910/32 , up 1/2 point, to yield 7.59 percent.

But investors might be disappointed. **********A clearer picture of the economy, along with the naming of some economic officials in the Clinton Administration, would give investors and traders hope of finding a new direction for the bond market, which has been stuck in a tight trading range since the election. **********While the conclusion that the Federal Reserve is finished reducing short-term interest rates pushed up yields on Treasury bills and short-term notes, the continued reports of low inflation have helped lift the price and lower the yield of the 30-year bond. **********But if the pattern of recent economic data continues, the jobs data are more likely to give a less definitive glimpse of the economy than investors want. In addition, while other recent economic data have shown a stronger economy, auto and retail sales for November look so far to be a lot weaker than hoped. More figures on car sales will be released today. Interest Rates on Hold **********""People have come to the view that the economy is doing a little better, and people generally believe that the Fed is on hold on interest rates,"" said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc. And he said if nonfarm payroll jobs increased 150,000 in November ""that will very much solidify that view."" **********But Mr. Fine said he expected an increase of 75,000 -- higher than the consensus forecast of 60,000. He also argued that a very strong increase or an unexpected decline might have less impact than might be expected. **********That is because a large increase would mean a stronger economy. While that would normally worry credit market investors, in this case such fears might be muted; signs of a stronger economy might temper the new Administration's plans for an economic stimulus program. On the other hand, a weak number, which could rekindle thoughts of an easing of interest rates by the Fed, would be counterbalanced by the greater likelihood of a strong stimulus program. **********Robert B. Reich, who is directing the economic policy transition team for the President-elect, added to the nervousness surrounding the employment report when he said the Administration would be watching these figures most closely when it decides on the how much punch it wants in its stimulus plan. **********In trading yesterday, prices of notes declined in the morning but rebounded to end up a bit in afternoon trading. The price of 30-year bond rose in the morning but slumped in the afternoon to end only slightly higher. In late trading the bond was offered at 10025/32 , up 2/32 , to yield 7.56 percent, the same as the day before. **********Trading was influenced by several factors. **********One was investors and speculators selling short-term notes and buying the 30-year bond in the morning. This is a trade that tries to take advantage of the narrowing spread between the yields on 2-year notes and 30-year bonds -- known as a flattening trade. **********The spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bond recently widened to more than 360 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. But yesterday morning it narrowed to 271 basis points. **********Mr. Reich contributed indirectly to this trading when it was reported that he had said the new Administration was considering shifting more debt sales to shorter maturities from longer maturities. **********Such a shift could save the Government money because the interest rates on shorter maturities are lower than those on the 30-year bond. Some analysts also argue that the shift could help bring down longer-term interest rates, which could help bolster the housing market and help the economic recovery. **********""Reich was talked about all morning,"" said Joel Kazis, managing director for government trading and sales at UBS Securities. ""That helped flatten the curve."" **********But by the the afternoon, some of those trades were reversed, and prices of short-term notes rose. Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation, said that some traders had apparently just decided that the safer bet ahead of the employment figures was short-term maturities, which are less volatile. In late trading, the spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bond widened to 279 basis points. Treasury Candidates **********Based on reports from people connected with the Clinton transition team, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has been downgraded as a choice for Treasury Secretary in the new Administration. Moving to the top of the list were Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, and Robert E. Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********But Mr. Volcker has not lost his favor with traders, analysts and salesmen in the bond market, where the attitude toward Mr. Clinton will have a major impact on interest rates and, in turn, the economy. According to a poll taken by Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, Mr. Volcker is the top choice by far. Of 202 traders, executives and anlaysts polled, 171 favored Mr. Volcker, and only 16 each chose Senator Bentsen and Mr. Rubin. But then it is only Mr. Clinton's vote that counts. Municipal Bonds **********In the municipal market, there was good demand for the New York City's general obligation bonds. By the end of the day, Prudential Securities was able to reprice the $568.5 million of securities and lower their yields by 5 to 25 basis points depending on the length of the maturity. **********The serial bonds due in 1993 were priced to yield 3 percent. The yield for bonds due in 2005 is 6.65 percent. The group A bonds due from 2006 through 2009 yield 6.70 percent, and the group B bonds due in 2009 and 2012 yield 6.15 percent."

Yugoslavia Protests Move **********In Belgrade, Reuters reported, Yugoslavia's Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Milan Vares, told reporters, ""This unilateral decision, which, in fact, is a recognition of secession, is a flagrant violation of the principles and provisions of international law."" He expressed the Government's ""strong disapproval and regret"" over the Vatican move, and said it was ""direct interference in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia."" **********Vatican officials were not available today to comment on why the recognition had apparently been brought forward. The only other European power to recognize Croatia and Slovenia is Germany, which will formally establish diplomatic relations with the two republics on Wednesday. **********Relations between the Vatican and Belgrade seem already to be upset. Yugoslavia's Ambassador to the Holy See, Ivica Mastruko, a Croat, told reporters today that the federal authorities dismissed him from his post last week because he ignored Belgrade's directives. That, he said, had left the Yugoslav federation without a representative to the Vatican. **********Mr. Mastruko said that from now on he would represent Croatia. ""Two hours after Belgrade told me to go, the Croatian Government sent me a fax asking me to represent them for the time being,"" he said. ""I had no intention of sending a resignation letter to Belgrade because that would have signified recognition of the federal Government. So they fired me."" Church Destruction 'Revolting' **********Before today, the Pope had often championed the cause of the two republics, particularly Croatia, fighting a six-month-old war against the predominantly Eastern Orthodox, Serbian-led federal army. Last weekend, in an annual address to diplomats, the Pope called the destruction of churches and hospitals ""revolting."" **********At the same time, however, the Vatican has sought to play down any suggestion that the war has a religious character related to the 1,000-year schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. ""There are other passions of politics and history that are more important,"" an official said. **********But some diplomats suggested that the Vatican's recognition of the two breakaway states could bring religious differences into much sharper focus. **********In its statement today, the Vatican said both Croatia and Slovenia had quickly accepted conditions for recognition, including adherence to democratic principles and pledges to safeguard the rights of ethnic minorities."

'Great Prejudice' **********Justice Robert Blair of the Ontario Court of Justice said that if he allowed the court actions to proceed, ""there might be a great prejudice to Olympia & York if its attention is diverted from the corporate restructuring process and it is required to expend time and energy in defending an action of the complexity and dimension of this one."" **********Justice Blair said that while he could allow the suit against the bank to proceed, there was little likelihood it would go very far without Olympia's participation. **********An Olympia spokesman said the company was pleased with the ruling."

But it avoided any hint of what, if anything, Israel might do should the xenophobic thuggery continue. **********History assigns Israel a special obligation to speak out, Mr. Rabin later told a group of newspaper editors in Tel Aviv. ""You must not let things develop from the beginning,"" he said. ""You must crush the head of the snake when it's still small."" **********It is axiomatic that Nazis, neo- or otherwise, will be reviled in a Jewish land. Far more complicated is how Israel should act -- given the bounds of diplomatic and economic reality and fair play -- toward a German Government that operates on the premise that this is not 1933 and it is not the hapless Weimar Republic. **********On that question, no Israeli consensus has emerged. ""It's really a very tight rope here, and one should walk it very carefully,"" an official said. After all, he noted, Israelis bristle when outsiders lecture them about how they treat Palestinians.  Israel Called Vulnerable, Too **********Along a similar line, Tourism Minister Uzi Baram, a Labor Party liberal, emerged from the Cabinet meeting today saying that Israel had to be cautious about condemning Germany because extremists exist here, too. He cited the Kach movement of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, which Israeli courts barred from participating in the June elections, declaring it racist. **********Like Jews in other lands, Israelis have roiled emotions about Germany. Some will not go near the country, including people who were born here and did not lose relatives to the Nazis. For them, buying a Volkswagen is morally equivalent to blasphemy. **********But not everyone shares that conviction, or there would not be so many Audis and Mercedeses on the streets and Braun coffee makers in homes. **********Israelis routinely do business in Germany, and go there for tours and study. Their Government dealt with the divided Germanys almost from independence in 1948. It has had formal relations with West Germany since 1965. After the United States, Germany is Israel's most important trading partner, with exports and imports last year totaling $2.8 billion. **********Nervousness about recent events turned to revulsion for many this weekend when Israel television broadcast a German report that juxtaposed images of Nazi-saluting youths of today with scenes from Auschwitz. **********""We at last understood that this is not a fringe occurrence but something demonic that is happening in Germany,"" wrote Yosef Lapid, a columnist for the newspaper Maariv.  Advocates of a Hard Line **********On Saturday night, Education Minister Shulamit Aloni, a left-liberal who visited Germany just two months ago, urged a boycott by Jews unless Bonn cracked down on the neo-Nazis -- a position that she backed away from today as perhaps going too far for now. **********Moshe Katsav, a leader of the opposition Likud Party, had said that Israel should sever diplomatic relations if the rightist revival was not squelched. Today, Health Minister Chaim Ramon argued that Israel should at least bring its Ambassador to Bonn home for consultations as a form of protest. But others said boycotts were a questionable tactic for a country that has itself been the object of a long Arab boycott. **********In the end, the Cabinet contented itself with a strong denunciation of the neo-Nazi phenomenon and an expression of ""appreciation to public elements in Germany who struggle against racism and anti-Semitism."" Nevertheless, the atmosphere was sufficiently thick that a committee of Parliament called off its visit to Germany planned later this week. **********Israelis also heard the German Ambassador to their country, Otto von der Gablentz, caution against boycotts and other attempts to ""isolate Germany,"" no matter how understandable their sensitivity might be. **********""I do understand emotional reactions,"" the Ambassador said on Israel radio. But he added, ""Isolation helps those who do not want to have an open society, who do not want to have a democracy."""

Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, demands that America take a stand against Japanese car imports surely he must not be talking about car No. 11AMRXML2D19W-C06, which rolled off the line here the other day. **********The car was produced by teams of Japanese workers all wearing neat uniforms with ""Mitsubishi Motors"" emblazoned on the back.  But the sporty. bright red model is a Dodge Stealth, made by Mitsubishi, and sold in America starting at about $17,000. And the only thing that makes it seem American is the word ""Dodge"" etched in the front bumper. Mr. Iacocca made no mention of Mitsubishi's Nagoya plant when he visited Japan with President Bush in January, and these days people at the plant say as little as possible about Mr. Iacocca. Confused Feelings **********""We feel a little funny about him,"" Kozo Naruse, the deputy general manager, conceded the other day, shaking his head. ""Here he is talking about keeping Japanese cars out of America, and every day we come to work and make very good Chryslers."" **********As a ""buy American"" movement in the United States provokes continuing confusion about what constitutes the more American car -- is it better to buy a Honda made in Ohio, or a Ford mini-van also produced in Ohio in a joint venture with Nissan? -- there is little question about the national origin of the 164,352 vehicles produced in Japan last year and sold as Chryslers, Dodges and Chevrolets. They are thoroughly Japanese. **********But the fact that they keep pouring off the production lines headed for American dealerships says a lot about the Big Three's continuing dependence on Japanese manufacturing at a time when, for example, the General Motors Corporation is announcing plant closings and the layoffs of thousands of workers. **********Moreover, many analysts point out, the Japanese production raises questions about how an obvious opportunity to break into the Japanese auto market has been largely squandered by Chrysler, which owns nearly 11 percent of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and G.M., which owns a stake in Isuzu Motors. Among the Big Three, only the Ford Motor Company uses its Japanese partner, Mazda Motor, to make cars for sale to Japanese consumers rather than for export to America. **********Without question, the cars Japanese makers produce for the Big Three account for a significant part of the American market. Last year Japanese cars accounted for a bit more than 30 percent of the American market, up from 27.8 percent the year before. But if you include autos made for G.M. and Chrysler here, and at Japanese or joint-venture ""transplants"" in America, the true Japanese market share exceeded 36 percent. In one way, the figure is even higher: by some estimates the Japanese share of retail auto sales in America -- excluding Detroit's sales to the car rental fleets -- is close to 50 percent. **********What makes the Mitsubishi-Chrysler arrangement particularly noteworthy, though, is that by Chrysler's own description it has been an overwhelming success. ""The Stealth is one of our hottest cars, even in a depressed market,"" said Luis Franco, who heads Chrysler International's liaison office here. **********""Obviously, we are very happy with Mitsubishi as a supplier and partner,"" he added. (Mitsubishi also provides competition to Chrysler in the United States, offering a nearly identical car to the Stealth, the Mitsubishi 3000 GT, at American Mitsubishi dealers.) **********Still, Mitsubishi's executives openly cringe at Mr. Iacocca's oratory, and in a subtle way they have begun to fight back. In recent weeks, Mitsubishi's top American officer, Richard D. Recchia, formerly of Chrysler, has done what other Japanese auto makers have been loath to try: he has taken Mr. Iacocca head on. The conflict between the two has stepped up since Mr. Iacocca, returning from Tokyo, declared that America was being transformed into an exploited colony, exporting raw materials to Japan, and buying back expensive manufactured goods. Attracting Attention **********When Mr. Recchia told the National Automobile Dealers Association recently that anti-Japanese feeling in Detroit has ""reached down to tap latent racial prejudice,"" his comments were prominently reported here. So was his contention that legislation to limit Japan's American market presence proposed by Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, and Senator Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, would cost thousands of American jobs and ""perpetuate fundamental problems in the U.S. economy."" **********""I can't help but believe that the emotional response we see today is in some way attributable to coments from politicians and U.S. executives following that trip,"" he said to the dealers who met for their annual convention in Dallas. **********A senior Japanese executive of Mitsubishi said of Mr. Recchia: ""He is saying aloud what we can't say. It means a lot more coming from an American than from one of us."" But others are not so sure. ""It never helps to argue back,"" one senior executive at Toyota said recently. **********For Chrysler, the Nagoya plant may be a place to learn some important manufacturing lessons. Though the plant itself is among Mitsubishi Motors' oldest, it has been tooled to place many different models on the same production line, an idea that General Motors and others in Detroit want to copy. Mitsubishi intersperses production of Chrysler's Stealth with Mitsubishi's own new luxury car, the $25,000 Diamante. **********More important, the robots that do much of the assembly work reconfigure themselves automatically to put the steering wheel on the left side of one car, the right side of the next. A chart on the wall shows that even now, with the plant operating well below capacity, productivity gains are impressive. In the last year, the number of worker-hours required to produce a car has decreased by 15 percent. And many of the workers are not typical Japanese auto assemblers: 300 of the plant's 2,600 workers are Brazilians of Japanese ancestry, brought here to reduce the severe shortage of workers willing to do the dirty, noisy job of making cars. One Sensitive Issue **********One problem the plant's workers are hesitant to talk about is the internationally sensitive issue of auto parts. A walk through the plant suggested that an overwhelming number of components going into the Dodge Stealth are not American. Mitsubishi officials say, however, that they do buy catalytic converters, wheels, glass, carpeting and air bags from the United States. **********Chrysler also supplies the plant by shipping transmissions to Nagoya for pickup trucks. With little prompting, though, quality-control managers here volunteer that there are frequent quality problems with the shipments. In some batches, 1 percent of the transmissions are defective. **********""When we go back to the United States and raise the issue,"" one engineer said, ""the message comes back that they think 1 percent defect ratios are normal. Here, 1 percent is a big, big problem."" **********The solution? Mitsubishi installs the Chrysler transmissions only in the trucks it ships back to Chrysler; Japanese models get a Japanese transmission. Officially, the company says that the arrangement makes sense because it would be difficult to get a Chrysler transmission serviced in Japan. **********Indeed, Chrysler's presence in Japan is minuscule. Last year it sold roughly 1,000 cars here, the worst sales record of any of the Big Three, and even far behind Honda of America, which shipped thousands of its American-made Accords to Japanese showrooms. A List of Obstacles **********Mr. Iacocca, during his trip with President Bush, argued that the numbers were so low because of the tremendous cost of meeting Japanese technical specifications, passing Japanese car inspections, and shipping cars from America to Japan. On the surface, it would seem as if the Nagoyaplant would offer an easy solution: The plant is already tooled to produce cars for the Japanese market, even with the steering wheel on the right side. But in Nagoya you cannot buy a Nagoya-made Chrysler. **********Mr. Franco said that Mitsubishi and Chrysler had periodically discussed such an arrangement, but neither side had taken the conversation very far. ""You have to remember, we have only been selling here since 1987,"" he said. ""It is still pretty early."" Moreover, he said, it would make little sense to put a Stealth and its Mitsubishi equivalent sold in Japan, the GTO, in the same showroom. ""That would have nothing going for it,"" he said. **********Ford, of course, has taken that course, selling cars produced for it by Mazda at dealerships called Autorama, partly owned by Ford. It sells about 70,000 units a year. But Chrysler and General Motors, in an argument that often seems a bit circular, say it makes no sense to invest in new dealerships until they first sell some more cars here."

Japan's Restricted Mutual-Funds"," **********Last week, the Japanese Government called for efforts to bolster the country's troubled stock market, including measures to encourage more mutual funds investing in Japanese stocks. However, the Japanese Government did not put forward one obvious proposal -- to abolish the regulatory barriers that prevent American firms like mine from offering mutual funds to Japanese investors. **********Because they provide portfolio diversification and professional management at a modest cost, mutual funds have attracted individual investors to the securities markets. **********Yet no American firm is licensed to offer mutual funds in Japan, although several Japanese firms sell mutual funds to the American public. While Japanese managers are given a chance to expand the $1 trillion fund business in the United States, American managers are obstructed by several barriers from expanding Japan's 50-trillion-yen fund market. *********** To enter the Japanese market, an American manager must first apply for a license from the Japanese Finance Ministry, which makes subjective decisions shrouded in secrecy and may take several years to do so. By contrast, a Japanese manager can get approval within six months from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which reviews applications according to clearly defined and objective criteria. *********** The Finance Ministry further requires American managers to invest at least $7 million to start a yen fund and caps the total management fee at 35 basis points (seven-twentieths of 1 percent). By contrast, the S.E.C. requires Japanese managers to invest only $100,000 to start an American fund and allows them to set their own fees. *********** The Finance Ministry requires United States managers to hire at least 30 full-time Japanese employees to run the fund even if the job could be done by fewer people. The S.E.C. allows Japanese managers to contract out administrative functions, which can be done cheaply for a new fund. *********** After obtaining a license to start a fund, an American manager must endure another lengthy process with the Finance Ministry, requiring another large capital commitment, to distribute fund shares. By contrast, a Japanese manager can register a broker-dealer to distribute the shares of its American funds by filing some papers and investing $25,000. **********To address these egregious differences between Japanese and American barriers to entry, President Bush should throw his weight behind the Fair Trade in Financial Services Act. The measure has passed the Senate, but is mired in the House because of committee turf battles and conflicting signals from the Bush Administration. **********The act would direct the United States Treasury Department to determine whether American financial firms are being treated fairly in foreign countries and, if not, to negotiate to eliminate any unfair practices. Most important, if such negotiations fail, the act empowers Treasury to deny licenses to firms from the offending countries."

Whatever his merits, Spain concluded, Columbus should not be allowed to spoil the party. **********Expo's real purpose, after all, was more topical -- to show that Spain has turned its back on a different ""dark past"" -- on the backwardness and isolation brought by Franco's dictatorship in the middle years of this century -- and is now a modern and prosperous European democracy. A Proud Native Son **********And that was the theme chosen by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez when he addressed a huge crowd, including King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, in the first of two closing ceremonies at the 540-acre Expo site on the Island of Cartuja in the Guadalquivir River beside Seville. ""The image of Spain is today more respected,"" he said. **********No less important, Mr. Gonzalez went on, the success of the World's Fair ""has enabled us to prove to ourselves that we are capable of organizing an event like this as well as anyone else"" because, he added, ever the improvisers, Spaniards have spent a long time ""not believing in ourselves."" **********As a native son of Seville, Mr. Gonzalez had double reason to be proud. To prepare for Expo, some $10 billion was also spent on a high-speed railroad from Madrid, a new airport and eight bridges in Seville and highways throughout Andalusia, all aimed at integrating the long-neglected south into the rest of Spain. **********Dedicated to ""The Age of Discoveries,"" the show began on April 20 with 110 countries, 27 international organizations and a score of companies represented, 98 pavilions crowded with everything from Old Masters to tropical fruit-juice and thousands of artists contracted to bring music, dance and theater. **********In the end, though, it was understood that Expo's success would be measured by attendance. And, by late July, its organizers were close to panic as press criticism began to grow. The worst of the summer heat was about to strangle Seville and the expected masses of tourists had not yet showed up. **********But then, inexplicably, the rhythm suddenly changed. After receiving only 5.2 million visits in July, Expo recorded 8.1 million in August and 10.9 million in September. And if the smallest crowd comprised 110,000 people one early June day, all records were broken on Oct. 3 when 629,000 people crowded the fair. Canada Tries the Patience **********The final count enabled officials to claim success today. The number of different visitors -- 16 million -- fell short of the target of 18 million but, allowing for those who spent more than one day at Expo, the number of visits -- 42 million -- surpassed the hoped-for total of 36 million. **********Of the visitors, two-thirds were Spaniards, but there were also one million French, 900,000 Portuguese, 300,000 Italians and, unexpectedly, 280,000 Americans. Then there were the dignitaries: 77 heads of state or government and 44 members of royal families received V.I.P. treatment. **********Among pavilions competing fiercely to draw crowds, those of Canada, Spain, Fujitsu, Monaco, Australia, the Vatican and one theme pavilion dedicated to Navigation were the acknowledged winners. In these cases, though, the patience of crowds was sorely tested: the record wait was seven hours to see two movies in Canada's pavilion. **********The United States pavilion, built at the last minute because of delays and cutbacks in financing, exhibited the Bill of Rights and a film, but its main draw was a program of sports and cultural events in an open-air plaza -- even though Arnold Schwarzenegger, who agreed to serve as its Honorary Commissioner for Sports, canceled a scheduled appearance last month, citing a movie commitment. **********Beginning Tuesday, a new program called Cartuja '93 begins. Spain's national, regional and theme pavilions will remain in place, forming part of a permanent theme and technological park. Other countries are now scrambling either to donate or sell their pavilions to avoid the cost of dismantling them. **********Denmark's pavilion has been sold to Japanese investors, Canada has given its pavilion to Spain for a symbolic $1 and France hopes to convert its pavilion into a cultural center. An iceberg brought here by Chile will be dropped in the Guadalquivir River this weekend, while a huge Mexican maguey cactus will remain here. **********But today, at least, the mood was still festive. Visitors from as far away as Brazil and Japan rushed to catch a quick glimpse of this temporary 21st-century city, while much of Seville showed up for this evening's final fireworks display before King Juan Carlos formally closed the fair. **********Indeed, perhaps the only worried faces amid tonight's late partying were of those among the 35,000 people employed at Expo who will be out of a job on Tuesday. ""I'm going to go home and sleep for a week,"" a young security guard said. ""After that, I'm on the dole."""

Yes, Says Benny Begin.","Likud Again? Yes, Says Benny Begin."," **********On a chilled afternoon in early March, Benjamin Begin stood at a graveside on the Mount of Olives and recited the Kaddish for his father, former Prime Minister Menachem Begin. **********In the aftermath of the recent Israeli election, some here would also like to say the Jewish prayer for the dead for Menachem Begin's Likud Party, now that it is about to enter the opposition after 15 years in power. **********But his son and political heir cautions that prayers are premature. **********Despite its resounding defeat at Labor's hands, he says, Likud not only can bounce back but it can -- no, it must -- also do so without compromising its basic message: Keep Israel strong, expand Jewish settlements in occupied territories and hold on to all the land that he calls ""our sacred Jewish soil.""  Finds Four Illusions **********""There are those with the illusion that you can relinquish Judea and Samaria and still expect that a terrorist, independent Arab state would not be established,"" Mr. Begin said, using the biblical names for the West Bank. ""Either we are there, or the P.L.O. and fundamentalist Hamas take over. **********""Another illusion is that you could have a so-called two-state solution west of the Jordan River and let Israel enjoy one day of peace. The third illusion is that so-called territorial compromise is a viable solution, the illusion that the Arab leader has been born who would sign an agreement of territorial compromise, which means he would have to overtly give up part of the sacred Arab land of Palestine. The fourth illusion is that the P.L.O. is anything but a murder syndicate."" **********The man known universally here as Benny suddenly interrupted his checklist. ""Aren't four enough?"" he said with a laugh. **********There is one more illusion, some political commentators here add, saying that it is Mr. Begin's if he believes Israeli voters did not demonstrate in the June 23 election that they had grown weary of unbending Likud ideology on territory and settlements.  Sees a Rebound Coming **********Not so, Benny Begin replies. New immigrants from Russia, he says, voted hands down for Labor out of economic unhappiness, not ideology. Likud lost some votes because of its internal dissension. And Labor's leader, Yitzhak Rabin, campaigned as ""Likud B, a surrogate,"" less hawkish than the present Government only by degrees on most issues. **********""If this analysis is correct,"" he said in an interview this week, ""it gives us great hope for a rebound in a rather short while, and not the 15 years that the Labor Party waited."" **********As Likud sorts out just what hit it on election day, the 49-year-old Mr. Begin, very much his father's son in ideas, looks and mannerisms, seems destined to become a pivotal figure in the psychodrama that political recovery is likely to be. **********""This is a party that's been socked to the floor, hit right in the solar plexus,"" said Benjamin Netanyahu, 42, Israel's chief spokesman at the Middle East peace talks and perhaps Benny Begin's main rival for future Likud leadership.  Skipping a Generation **********The generational change may have already begun. **********It is only a question of weeks, maybe days, before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 76, ambles off into retirement. His presumed heir, Defense Minister Moshe Arens, 66, is so embittered in the aftermath of Likud's defeat that he says he is quitting politics, too. **********There is the ambitious Housing Minister, Ariel Sharon, 64, who is more than ready to take the helm. But the former general, reportedly about to undergo gallbladder surgery, alienates at least as many people as he inspires. The same could be said of another man of towering ambition, Foreign Minister David Levy, 54. **********So some in Likud are ready to skip an entire generation. They want to make leaders now out of the likes of Mr. Begin, who entered politics only four years ago but had an obvious head start in name recognition, and Mr. Netanyahu, who knows his way around a sound bite and is made for the television age.  To Run for Party Leader **********Both men have already declared their intention to run for party leader in a primary scheduled for the end of the year -- a new procedure that Likud adopted this week in open imitation of Labor, which in February used it with obvious success to install Mr. Rabin. **********If a Gallup Israel poll published today is accurate, Mr. Netanyahu is by far the strongest candidate to carry Likud back to power, especially since the next time around voters will directly elect the Prime Minister, a change approved by Parliament earlier this year. The survey showed Mr. Netanyahu with 57 percent support, well ahead of the 17 percent for Mr. Begin and the roughly 10 percent each for Mr. Levy and Mr. Sharon. **********Still, Likud seems headed for rough months of internal turmoil although it is not yet clear how nasty it may get. Even Mr. Netanyahu acknowledges that blood will be spilled, possibly including some of his, no matter what the polls say about him for now. **********And while Mr. Begin insists that fundamental Likud philosophy mustn't change, some in his party do not agree.  Religion vs. Needs **********Mr. Arens shocked many here when he declared last weekend that the vision of a ""Greater Israel,"" which formed the core of Menachem Begin's beliefs that he himself had championed, was not shared by many Israelis. He was prepared to give up the Gaza Strip, the Defense Minister said. **********Another Likud member of Parliament, Meir Shitreet, committed what would have been branded as heresy in the elder Begin's day, saying that the party had overemphasized ideology at the expense of the economic needs of its working-class constituency. ""The Land of Israel,"" he said, ""isn't a religion."" **********Maybe not, Benny Begin says. But it certainly comes close, he says, and he sees no reason to change it. ""We have a platform and we should adhere to it,"" he said. ""It is very clear, very realistic approach to life at large and to the Middle East in particular."" **********He does not like the idea of direct elections, Mr. Begin says. He insists that it is not because some of his opponents may fare better than he on television (notably Mr. Netanyahu) but because it is an American-style innovation unsuited for Israel's political culture of consensus.  A Name Still Golden **********Of course, he acknowledges that he has an advantage of his own, his name, which is still golden in the bustling markets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, where during the campaign shopkeepers put up more pictures of Menachem Begin than of Yitzhak Shamir. He was a geologist when Likud officials persuaded him to run for Parliament in 1988, and he knows they did not approach him for his scientific skills. **********""The political equipment I come with, I learned at home,"" he said. ""I never had any pretense of originality in either my political thinking or my writing."" **********""Suppose,"" he added, ""that I go to the Shaare Tsedek hospital across the valley and tell them that I just inherited $1 million and would like to contribute it to them. Do you think their treasurer would ask me if I earned it by myself or if I inherited it, and then say, 'Sir, we're only interested in contributions from people who make their own money.' """

The goal is to expand trade, attract foreign investment and create a more stable economic climate in the region, which has a history of hyperinflation, corruption and inefficient industries run by the Government.  Significant Obstacles **********If the trade coalition is successful, economists here believe it could be a precursor to a common market for all of South America. Chile, the most economically advanced economy in the region, has been considering joining the Mercosur, and Bolivia has formally asked to join the group. **********To be sure, significant obstacles exist: Brazil is still struggling to control inflation and privatize its economy, while Chile is resisting the prospect of being weighed down by its neighbors. **********Economists also warn that political and economic instability could easily return in countries like Argentina, and they question whether such a complex integration, with all its political pitfalls, can be completed in two and a half years. Analysts point to the difficulties that the Europe is having completing the integration of the European Common Market. **********""It is obvious that the political will exists,"" said Steven Darch, former head of J. P. Morgan & Company in Buenos Aires. ""But it is another thing to be able to overcome all the differences."" Brazil 'Still a Basket Case' **********Mr. Darch added that the big unanswered question was still whether Brazil would be able to establish enough open-market policies, reduce Government deficits, control inflation and privatize state-owned companies in time to meet the deadline. **********""All the multinational companies are looking at the region, and the obvious place to put a plant is Brazil, but it is still a basket case,"" Mr. Darch said. ""Until Brazil gets its fiscal side in order, it is difficult to see Mercosur as much more than a regional free-trade zone among the countries."" **********Though Brazil's President, Fernando Collor de Mello, has tried to impose changes to create a more open market, he has been stymied by resistance within Brazil from many industry leaders, labor unions and politicians. Moreover, recent accusations about corruption have continued to isolate him within Brazil and weaken his political strength. **********Despite the doubts, the agreement illustrates that the four countries have come a long way in trying to modernize and stabilize their economies. In Argentina, for example, inflation was more than 1,000 percent only two years ago. It is running close to 20 percent now. Transportation Challenges **********In addition to harmonizing tax, customs and trade agreements, the four countries face considerable problems with roads, bridges and waterways that significantly hamper economic integration. They are trying to agree on several new projects to alleviate the transportation problems, including a highway from Buenos Aires to Porto Alegre in Brazil, passing through Uruguay. The road might also extend to Paraguay and Chile. **********The four Mercosur countries, plus Bolivia, signed an agreement to spend almost $1 billion on dredging and upgrading ports along the Parana and Paraguay rivers, creating one of the longest navigable waterways in the world, with a length of almost 2,000 miles. **********Chile also agreed to a regional immigration policy with those countries that would allow a freerer flow of people across borders. Chile's Qualms **********Though Chile has shown interest in the regional trade group, it has resisted formal entry for several reasons. It is concerned about the history of economic instability in Brazil and Argentina and is concerned that such ties might jeopardize the image of Chile as perhaps the most stable and robust economy in Latin America. **********Chile is also engaged in negotations with the United States on a free-trade agreement that the Bush Administration has promised to grant after such an accord is reached with Mexico. **********Also, while Chile has long sought access to an Atlantic port, it has resisted binational overtures from Argentina, fearing, among other things, that agricultural pests from Argentina might infect Chile's agricultural and wine industries."

It confirms the dismal performance of our economy in comparison with other advanced democracies over the last 25 years. The United States scores well below average when it comes to gross domestic product growth, per capita G.D.P. growth, the savings rate, export growth, resource mobilization for the public sector, labor productivity and the equality of income distribution. **********Many factors contribute to America's poor economic performance, like mediocre political leadership, complacent and sometimes inept management in industry and finance, and bad economic policies. But behind our distress lies an erosion of traditional values and attitudes -- about the future, work, frugality, education, excellence, merit and the community -- that explained America's earlier success. **********The economies that grew fastest between 1965 and '90 were those of Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Though these countries differ significantly, all are strongly influenced by the Confucian ethos, which emphasizes precisely the values that have suffered erosion in America It is an ethos strikingly similar to the Protestant ethic, the wellspring of our own value system. **********I believe America's success, magnified by its pre-eminence after World War II, is at the root of our economic decline. We became complacent, self-centered and self-indulgent. Today, the future is less important than ""now,"" a shift underscored by the World Bank's data on the decline of gross domestic savings from 21 percent of G.D.P. in 1965 to 15 percent in 1990. **********Community has also become less important than ""me,"" or ""my group,"" which is reflected in an increasingly unequal distribution of wealth: the share of income received by the bottom 20 percent of American households -- 4.7 percent -- was lower than in any other advanced country except Australia. And, as numerous studies confirm, trust has eroded, be it in one another, in government or in our private institutions. **********Our propensity to spend and our declining sense of community are also reflected in our burgeoning fiscal deficit and our failure to tax ourselves adequately. According to the World Bank, government revenue in the United States, as a percentage of G.D.P., was the lowest of all ""high income"" countries in 1990. **********FOR many American conservatives, ""bloated"" government is the problem. For many liberals, ""greedy"" business is the problem. Yet there is no solution to the social and fiscal distress we face -- in our homes, in our cities, in budgets at all levels of government and in our universities -- without a dynamic economy. As the Confucian societies remind us, that depends on a marriage of effective government with vigorous entrepreneurship and business excellence. **********History is littered with the remains of successful societies that got complacent and hedonistic: Greece, Rome, Spain and 20th-century Britain. **********We are a nation in decline. We can't kid ourselves that everything will be fine when the recession is over. The values that are sorely in need of repair go well beyond ""family."" We need a leadership with a vision of a more dynamic, more unified, more responsible America and with the courage and skill to galvanize the society -- government, business, the media, the churches, the schools, the people -- to get behind a program of national renewal."

Those include many for which construction contracts were signed but real work not begun. **********It was the most politically sensitive action taken thus far by the young Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and obviously it fell well short of Arab demands for a complete building freeze.  West Bank Roads Halted **********In principle it also flies in the face of the Bush Administration's opposition to Israel's settlement activity as a major obstacle to peace. Although the Americans have spoken approvingly of Mr. Rabin for moving in the desired direction, it is not clear how they will react to the large numbers of new houses that will be finished **********In addition to freezing future housing plans, Israel also halted work on several West Bank highways defined by senior officials as ""political roads,"" designed by the former Government to help settlers avoid routes along which they risked attacks by Palestinians. **********The 8,700 units given the go-ahead are now in various stages of construction, from little more than a hole in the ground to, far more commonly, near-completion. Senior officials say a large majority are either in the final stages or well beyond merely a framework.  Shamir Assails 'a Nightmare' **********The Government also did not touch 1,000 new apartments planned for areas around Jerusalem that Mr. Rabin, like his predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, considers an integral part of Israel and not negotiable. **********The action today left Israelis unhappy on the political left and right. **********Mr. Shamir said the announced freeze was ""a nightmare,"" and Benny Katzover, head of a settlers' group called the Samaria Regional Council, denounced it as ""a grave anti-Zionist act."" **********There were calls for protests and unspecified forms of resistance from some of the 110,000 Jews estimated to be living in 140 West Bank and Gaza communities. **********On the left, Peace Now, a prominent anti-settlements organization, said that by allowing thousands of apartments to be completed, the Government would increase the settlers' population by about 50,000, in the process ""adding an obstacle to talks toward an agreement with the Palestinians."" **********It was not feasible to stop existing work in its tracks at this stage, Israeli officials said, asserting that the important point was that they had begun to shift national direction on the issue. **********In separate interviews, the new Finance Minister and Housing Minister said that their goal was a sharp and swift scaling back of future settlement-building, and that that would be reflected in their 1993 budget proposal. **********""I would say the investment will be negligible in proportion to what was before,"" Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said. **********It is now up to the United States to decide whether the Israeli actions amount to the glass being half full or half empty if Washington intends to give Israel $10 billion in loan guarantees that have been suspended for months because of friction over the settlements. **********Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Mr. Rabin had told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d about the planned housing restrictions when the Secretary visited Israel early this week at the start of his latest swing through the Middle East. **********In Cairo on Wednesday, Mr. Baker pronounced himself ""really very satisfied with the philosophy and the orientation"" of the Rabin Government on settlements, and he predicted ""a severe and substantial reduction"" in construction. **********Earlier, in Amman, Jordan, he said that he did not accept Mr. Rabin's distinctions between ""political settlements,"" which the Israeli promises to end, and ""security settlements,"" which he says must continue. But the Americans have strongly suggested that they are interested in bolstering Mr. Rabin's 10-day-old Government, and may be ready to turn a blind eye to a certain level of construction. **********""We see an entirely new situation,"" Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today on the NBC program ""Today."" Mr. Peres also expressed confidence that a loan-guarantees agreement will be reached, saying, ""We feel the air is very favorable."" **********In the last few days, Palestinian peace negotiators from the territories have also begun to adjust their settlements position. They still want a freeze, they say, but they have also expressed willingness to accept some construction as long as there are assurances that no American aid ends up financing such activity. **********Although Jewish neighborhoods in the territories are routinely referred to as ""settlements,"" the word can be misleading. For many people it conjures up visions of tent cities and messianic pioneers. In fact, many -- perhaps most -- are indistinguishable from red-roofed suburbs in Israel. **********And the settlers, far from having gleams in their eye, are often families and young couples initially lured to the territories by the lower prices and favorable mortgages to be found there. **********Mr. Rabin and his ministers insist that they are not kowtowing to the Americans but rather are shifting national priorities on their own away from settlements and toward other social and economic needs. **********In addition, Mr. Ben-Eliezer said, the intense construction championed by the former Likud-led Government amounted to an ""undeclared annexation"" of the territories that in his opinion endangered the peace talks. **********The new settlements policy has emerged in stages over the last week, relying in part on gestures like a Cabinet order last weekend to review previous Government decisions to approve about a dozen new communities in the territories. On paper, it looked like a new freeze. In fact, the order lacked immediate significance because even Likud had not found the wherewithal to start those settlements."

Mondale -- have breached their fiduciary responsibilities. **********Now it appears that shareholders, who have been forced to watch from the sidelines for nearly three years, will finally get to choose between two competing groups that want to run the consumer-electronics company, and indirectly between two competing plans to restructure it. **********The annual meeting of shareholders is scheduled for July 7 in Elizabeth, N.J., as a result of a court ruling resisted by management. Holders will choose between two slates, one favoring the incumbent managers and one backed by the company's largest shareholder. The last annual meeting was held in September 1989. 'Sale' to Suppliers **********In what the company called an effort to bring in badly needed capital -- and that insurgent shareholders dismissed as an effort to entrench management -- the company late last month ""sold"" 6.6 million shares, or a 15 percent stake, to Hong Kong suppliers of the company. Under terms of the deal, the company did not have access to the cash paid for the shares, which the buyers could force the company to repurchase under some conditions. **********In a ruling on Friday, Judge Arthur N. D'Italia of Superior Court in Jersey City ruled that those shares could not be counted when the shareholders vote. He added that the directors had breached their fiduciary duties, although he said he could not conclude that they had acted in bad faith. **********""I conclude that the board was more concerned with locking in 6.6 million friendly votes before the record date than in negotiating a deal acceptable to the lenders and therefore in the best interests of the shareholders,"" the judge said. He concluded that the board had ""breached its duty of loyalty"" to the shareholders as well as its ""duty of care."" A transcript of the oral ruling became available yesterday. **********In an interview yesterday, Gerald Zarin, the chairman and chief executive of Emerson, said he had acted properly in trying to arrange for capital that all agree is badly needed. He said the judge's decision was being appealed and warned that without a capital infusion the company might be forced into bankruptcy. **********The two most prominent directors of Emerson are Mr. Mondale, the Democratic nominee for President in 1984, and Lyle E. Gramley, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board. Their lawyer, William Hibbs, a partner with Mr. Mondale in a Minneapolis law firm, Dorsey & Whitney, said yesterday that he had not seen the opinion, but added: ""They have done the utmost they could do to fulfill their fiduciary duties as directors of Emerson Radio. I believe and I know they believe they have at all times exercised their best efforts for the benefit of the shareholders.""  Emerson imports inexpensive consumer electronics products, ranging from VCR's to microwave ovens, from various Asian countries. It got into trouble in part because of ill-conceived expansions into higher-priced merchandise and computers, which it has since eliminated. Mr. Zarin, who was hired last August, says he has begun a business turnaround, but the company is still losing money. **********The last time shareholders voted was in September 1989, when Emerson shares sold for more than $6 each and things appeared to be going well.  In the intervening period there have been shareholder suits, ending in a $7.5 million settlement; the forcing out of Stephen L. Lane, the former chief executive, and the withdrawal of one offer to provide an infusion of equity. The shares closed at $2 yesterday, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading. **********The largest shareholder, with a 20 percent stake, is Fidenas Investment Ltd., a Bermuda company that has had two representatives on the board since September 1990. Fidenas successfully sued to force an annual meeting and is now waging a proxy fight. **********The shareholder suit settlement promised that the board would be expanded to 11 members and that the company's anti-takeover ""poison pill"" would be revoked. The board was reduced in size rather than expanded -- the company says it did not have time to recruit new directors -- and a new poison pill was immediately put in place to block Fidenas from buying more shares. **********Fidenas has made numerous offers to inject more equity into Emerson, at what it calls more generous terms than the company negotiated with the Hong Kong suppliers in the deal that has been held up by the court ruling. In an interview yesterday, Eugene I. Davis, Fidenas's lawyer and an Emerson director, said the company had refused to discuss the proposals. Mr. Zarin complained that Fidenas was trying to take control of the company at a low price. **********Whichever side loses is likely to fight on in court. Fidenas says that if it wins it will dismiss Mr. Zarin and seek to void his employment contract, which has been lengthened to five years, from three. Mr. Davis angrily denies Mr. Zarin's assertion that he had offered to keep Mr. Zarin if he supported the Fidenas side in the proxy fight. **********For shareholders, the good news is that a number of groups clearly think there is value in Emerson. The bad news is that all the money being spent in squabbling about it may yet wipe out most of that value."

The Public Needs Pictures **********Jim Newton, a spokesman for World Vision, an American organization rushing to establish operations in Somalia, said: ""All humanitarian organizations have some regrets that we didn't move in sooner, but part of the problem was that we did not have the funds. One of the dilemmas is that the public does not respond until they see pictures. When the TV began to broadcast pictures, people began to respond."" **********Several relief officials said some potential donors had asked why new aid is needed, since relief supplies have been piling up on Somali docks in recent weeks amid the country's disorder. But Charles Planck, a spokesman for CARE, said that now that the military intervention has reopened distribution channels, huge quantities of food supplies will be needed for at least six months to prevent further starvation. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated this month that 4.5 million of the country's 6.5 million people need food aid. 3 American Agencies **********Before Somalia made headlines in July, only three American relief agencies were working there, along with a handful of European groups. The three were World Concern, a Seattle group; International Medical Corps, based in Los Angeles, and CARE. **********CARE, which has operated in Somalia for a decade, has 170 staff workers in the country. It has coordinated the unloading and warehousing of United Nations food in Mogadishu and handled the distribution of food airlifted into two Somali towns by the American military and the organization of convoys of food to other relief agencies, according to Mr. Planck. **********CARE officials have sought to emphasize their central role in the Somalia effort in a drive that has raised nearly $1 million since September, much of it recently. Among those giving money last week was an economics professor at Columbia University who wrote a $10,000 check to CARE. **********""I don't spend all my salary and Somalia is the part of the world where people are in the worst conditions now,"" the professor said. ""So that's why I did it."" Another donor gave $3,000 to CARE. **********""It's hard not to be generous when you see these pictures of people starving,"" she said. Both donors asked that their names be withheld. **********The International Committee of the Red Cross, based in Switzerland, has been directly feeding more Somalis than any other group, operating nearly 900 feeding centers. The American Red Cross has raised $2.4 million this year to support the International Committee's work. The money has paid for the operation of 42 of the International Committee's 900 feeding centers, according to John Thomas, an American Red Cross vice president. **********A smaller group that has been working in Somalia for about 10 years is World Concern, based in Seattle. The group's staff of 12 Americans and 165 Somalis has set up 75 feeding centers in and around Mogadishu and the southern port of Kismayu, said Fred Gregory, the group's director. **********Since the crisis reached the American public's attention this summer, eight American and several foreign relief agencies have approached World Concern with donations and requests to collaborate on Somalia projects, Mr. Gregory said. **********""This is a new experience to have people come to us and ask if they can help out, and I'm delighted that the world is finally responding,"" Mr. Gregory said. ""What is a sensitive issue, however, is the new players that come in and start acting like experts, especially the ones with high-profile P.R. efforts."" **********One group working to establish operations in Somalia is Food for the Hungry, based in Scottsdale, Ariz. It is still developing plans and has no permanent staff in Africa yet. **********A spokeswoman, Karen Randau, said the group had recently sent $600,000 worth of supplies to Somalia for distribution by other agencies. But after another relief agency challenged that figure, Food for the Hungry lowered the estimate to $450,000 and conceded that some of the supplies may have gone to feed Somali refugees in neighboring Kenya. New Drive Going Well **********Nonetheless, a new drive appears to be going well. Food for the Hungry has recently mailed out 50,000 solicitations on the Somali crisis, and Ms. Randau said donations were already 90 percent above what the group received during its major drive last year, which centered on the Kurds in northern Iraq. **********Another group that has recently moved into Somalia and is raising money is World Vision of Monrovia, Calif. The agency has not worked in Somalia since 1983, though it has been financing World Concern's Somalia work for four years. **********In September, World Vision opened six feeding centers in and around the Baidoa, and its staff of 7 Westerners and 193 Somalis is expanding, according to Mr. Newton. The group says it plans to spend $8 million in the country during the next five years. **********World Vision has bought extensive advertising time on television and in newspapers, according to Gary Roebbelen, World Vision's communications manager. Since August, the Somali effort has raised $4.3 million, he said. **********""We have to strike while the iron is hot, because when the crisis ends the donations will drop off,"" Mr. Roebbelen said. ""We really are pulling out all the stops on Somalia."""

Combined, the decisions by the two firms will eliminate more than 12 percent of Quotron's 60,000 terminals. **********Quotron, which was purchased by the Citicorp in 1986, now has only one national brokerage firm, Paine Webber Inc., on its client list, analysts said, a dearth of business that could well raise concerns about the company's future viability. **********""For Quotron to be a continuing force is almost impossible at this point,"" said Diana Finnegan, managing editor of Inside Market Data, an industry newsletter. ""This is the beginning of whatever the preliminary to death is."" **********The announcement by Dean Witter that it was turning to ILX Systems, a subsidary of the Thomson Information Publishing Group, to provide market data service for a new broker work station also had an impact on another Quotron competitor, Automatic Data Processing Inc., which also provided service to Dean Witter. But A.D.P.'s loss was partly offset by the fact that it won the Kidder account last week. **********A Quotron spokeswoman said the company was beginning to focus more on developing business with regional brokerage firms, adding that it was also expanding into new areas of technological development, including the development of trading technology for the foreign-exchange market. **********""We have been losing some on the national side, but we are offsetting that with growth in the regional accounts,"" said Roxanne Taylor, the spokeswoman. She said that in the last eight months Quotron had signed on 350 new regional accounts. She added that competition among the information-service companies had driven down profit margins for the national accounts, and that there was more money to be made with the regional firms.  Too Little and Late? **********But analysts questioned whether the strategy at Quotron, which has long been criticized for letting its technological edge slip to its competitors, is too little and too late. Indeed, one analyst said for Quotron to be able to commit more to the regional business it might have to turn to the deep pockets of its parent. **********""They really have nowhere else to go except the regionals,"" Ms. Finnegan said. ""With this, it seems entirely likely that Quotron will have to get a commitment from Citicorp to finance a marketing push into regional areas."" **********The Quotron purchase has been one of a number of black eyes for Citicorp in recent years. Since it was purchased, Quotron has not earned any profits. In the first quarter of this year, the company lost $12 million, and last October, Citicorp took a $400 million charge against earnings to write down its investment in the quote service. **********The loss of the Dean Witter business was especially hard, analysts said, because Quotron not only is an incumbent vendor, but was also widely believed within the industry to have submitted the lowest bid."

This Was Home.","Vyborg Journal; Finns Are Coming, Wistfully. This Was Home."," **********As he walks the crumbling steets of this ancient city, pursued at almost every turn by young Russians begging for handouts, peddling bottles of black-market vodka or selling religious icons, Per Erik Floman wrestles with the memories he left behind nearly 48 years ago. **********Here is the apartment where he was born, and the bank where his mother worked; there, the pond where he skated with friends, and the yellow church where his grandfather was the pastor. ""Ah, if you could have seen it then,"" said Mr. Floman, a retired 71-year-old businessman from Helsinki, pausing before the ruins of the old city hall. **********Before World War II, Vyborg was called Viipuri, and was Finland's second largest city, a thriving port and marketplace on the Karelian Isthmus, between Helsinki and St. Petersburg. **********Pounded in the winter war of 1939, the city and the surrounding province of Karelia were surrendered to the Red Army in 1944. Rather than live under Soviet rule, Mr. Floman and more than 400,000 other Finns left, nearly a tenth of Finland's entire population, fleeing westward in a vast exodus that left behind a province without a people. Pilgrimages Into the Past **********The cities and farms and houses they abandoned were later populated by thousands of Soviet men, women and children imported by Communist social planners from Russia and Ukraine and Kirghizia (now called Kyrgyzstan) to resettle the frontier west of Leningrad. **********Now, with the collapse of Soviet Communism, and a relaxation of tensions along the Russian-Finnish frontier, Mr. Floman is among a growing stream of Finns of his generation who are crossing the border, making pilgrimages into their past. Calling themselves citizens of the Karelian diaspora, they are trying to bring themselves, and their Government, to terms with what has been lost but cannot be forgotten. **********In the last year Karelian nationalist feeling has been on the boil in Finland, including demands that the Finnish Government open negotiations with Russia over the return of what is described as ""surrendered Karelia."" **********While the issue burns most brightly among those forced to flee, Karelia is deeply woven into Finland's national psyche, reflected in the emotional tones of Jean Sibelius's ""Karelian"" suite and the poetry of the ""Kalevula,"" Finland's national epic. **********Rauno Merio, a former commander of the Finnish Air Force and president of the Karelian Association, which represents more than 500 Karelian clubs and cultural organizations, compared Finland's loss of Karelia to Japan's longstanding dispute with Moscow over the Kurile Islands, which the Soviets seized in 1945. Greater Cooperation Planned **********""What we want to know is whether it is now possible to return old Karelia to Finland on political and economic grounds,"" Mr. Merio said. **********Under the terms of a new treaty signed with Russia, Prime Minister Esko Aho said, Finland intends to increase cooperation with Karelia, including direct investment. But like others, he says the time is not right to demand the return of the territory. **********""For sentimental reasons, the older generation feels we should get Karelia back from the Russians,"" said Max Jakobson, a writer and former Finnish delegate to the United Nations who was born in Vyborg. ""But from purely practical purposes, why?  Who would pay for it? And since there are no Finns there, what would we do with all those Russians?"" **********It is estimated there are 250,000 Russians in old Finnish Karelia, the youngest of whom are already the second generation to be born there. **********Among the Russians, there is some resentment of the new Finnish tourists, underscored by graffiti scrawled on a low brick wall near the harbor.  Partly in Finnish, partly in English, the legend reads, ""Finns go home."" Some Painful Changes **********For many Finns, the town has been changed over the last five decades in irrevocable, often painful ways. The old cemetery above the city has been abandoned and is overgrown, and many of the headstones have been broken or stolen. A statue of the town's Swedish founder has been pulled down, and centuries-old churches and guildhalls have been turned into metal shops or warehouses. **********Still, Finns have stepped up their donations of money and professional aid in recent months to help restore some of the old buildings. They have also helped to re-establish the Church of Peter and Paul, the old Lutheran parish on the City Commons that the Soviets had made into a dance hall. **********The Russians, too, have worked to heal some old wounds. In a park near the center of the city, where the old Communist leadership obliterated a Finnish war cemetery by burying the graves and headstones under layers of dirt and grass, a large wooden cross has now been put up, with a plate that bears the inscription, in Finnish, German, Swedish and Russian, ""Dedicated to the memory of all those buried in Vyborg."" **********""It is our land, no question about that,"" said Mr. Floman, who has been back to Vyborg nine times since he left in 1944, a Finnish Army officer falling back in the face of advancing Soviet troops. ""But now, I don't care so much who owns it, Russia or Finland. I just hope, together, we can make the city live in a happier way."""

The producers, in turn, asked the court to keep the rules in place, arguing that the networks would stifle competition if they were allowed to re-enter the business. **********The rules were first adopted in 1970, amid fears that ABC, CBS and NBC could use their dominance of the nation's prime-time television audience to demand unreasonable financial concessions from companies that produce television shows. **********The networks argue that the rules are now outdated, because their dominance has been sharply eroded by cable television and other new forms of entertainment, and that the rules now serve primarily to insulate Hollywood studios from competition. Hollywood Wants Rules **********Hollywood's big movie studios and most producers have adamantly fought to keep the rules in place, arguing that the networks still enjoy a stranglehold over their industry. **********The Federal Communications Commission was bitterly divided on the issue last year and voted, 3 to 2, for a compromise plan that relaxed the prohibition but left both sides unhappy. Both sides appealed the decision, with the networks arguing that the F.C.C. had not gone far enough and Hollywood forces arguing that it had gone too far. **********Two weeks ago, the appellate court struck down the regulations, saying that the F.C.C. had been inconsistent and illogical and had filled its decision with ""self-congratulatory rhetoric"" and ""boilerplate."" **********But the court went on to ask for comments on whether it should allow the agency to revert back to the earlier rules, which were even more restrictive, or dismiss those regulations as well. The court delayed the effective date of its ruling until Dec. 4, and is expected to issue a final ruling by that date."

Democrats in Congress say they are leery of approving the move unless the White House takes the lead on the issue. Electoral Considerations **********Officials of the I.M.F. attribute the delay to a desire by the White House and Congress not to offend the electorate by voting billions of dollars more in foreign aid when the economy is in recession. **********Officials of Russia and the other republics have appealed repeatedly for help from international agencies and the industrialized nations for their economy. I.M.F. officials and aid experts say that unless the additional funds are approved soon, the I.M.F.  and other agencies could face serious problems in planning a comprehensive aid program and providing the tens of billions of dollars in aid that the republics say they desperately need. Russia and several other republics have already requested membership in the expectation that they will get aid when they become members, which is expected in late April. **********The republics are expected to formally request billions of dollars in assistance from the fund after they join it, which officials say they might do in late April at the fund's spring meeting.  ""There is an undercurrent of distress about America's leadership on this,"" said one I.M.F. official. ""Our resources will be squeezed very seriously by the end of the year when the demand for financing by Russia and the republics hits the system."" **********I.M.F. officials say they have about $15 billion available for loans to nations in need. Russia alone is seeking about $6 billion for a fund to stabilize the ruble and $12 billion to help it finance crucial imports. Some economists say Ukraine and other republics will be seeking at least $10 billion more in aid. Many Western officials now say the increase in financing, which was planned in 1990, is inadequate because it was planned even before the Soviet Union collapsed and turned to the West for aid. **********Some officials and economists fear that with the cold war over, Washington's hesitation on the funds is a step back from America's international commitments even as Washington has sought to portray itself as a leader of the effort to help the former Soviet Union. **********""This, by itself, is not a huge signal of that, but combined with other concerns it is causing some nervousness,"" said Gregory A. Fossedal, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution who heads a study commission analyzing the I.M.F.'s operations.  Effect of New Hampshire Vote **********Members of Congress and many economists say that after President Bush's weak victory in the New Hampshire primary, it is less likely that the Administration will push hard for the financing increase, especially since many polls show that Americans believe that the President has paid too much attention to foreign affairs. **********""Unless the White House is prepared to put a lot of effort into it, it's not going to sail through Congress,"" said John Williamson, a senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics, a Washington policy research institute. ""I'm worried that New Hampshire will increase the Administration's reluctance to do anything that may displease the Republican right wing. I don't think the Bush Administration is showing much courage on this issue."" **********Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, noted that Republicans have accused Democrats of favoring foreign aid at the expense of domestic needs, a touchy issue in an election year. 'Shooting at Us' **********""The last time that foreign aid authorization was on the floor, the room was filled with Republican rhetoric attacking the Democratic foreign aid bill because it contained aid for the I.M.F.,"" he said. ""If the Republican Party thinks the Democrats in the House are going to carry the Administration's water on this issue while they are shooting at us, they must be smoking something that's illegal."" **********Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said he told the Administration last year ""that they ought to try to move this effort through."" He said, ""A substantive case can be made for a quota increase, but as a practical matter the Administration squandered or missed the opportunity last year to push it through."" **********Mr. Sarbanes, chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on international economic policy, said the fund increase was ""probably not going to go anywhere"" this year. He added that it would not go forward unless there was broad support from Republicans in Congress. Approval Is Doubted **********Two weeks ago, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman the Senate appropriations subcommittee in charge of I.M.F. financing, also said he did not see Congress approving the $12 billion contribution this year. **********Testifying before a House subcommittee on Feb. 5, Under Secretary of the Treasury David Mulford said of the I.M.F. financing increase that ""at some time, there will have to be a big push to get it done"" but he said it was ""very difficult"" to say when that might be. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has expressed support for the financing increase, and the official said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will soon also speak on its behalf.  'A Lot More Difficult' **********One Administration official said: ""The Administration still wants it passed, and wants it passed as soon as it can be. But it is clear that in an election year, this sort of issue is a lot more difficult."" **********Under I.M.F. rules, the additional $60 billion in funds will not take effect unless countries with 85 percent of the votes approve their contributions. Since the United States has 19 percent of the votes, its failure to approve its one-time $12 billion financing increase has blocked the overall increase. The current American stake in the I.M.F. is almost $24 billion out of a total of $120 billion. **********In June 1990, I.M.F. members agreed in principle to raise the group's total financing to $180 billion from $120 billion, but that agreement was contingent upon most members approving their portion of the overall increase. I.M.F. officials say the money nations give to the fund is an investment on which donors receive interest each year. **********The I.M.F. could allow the financing increase to take effect after June 30, with Washington's approval but not its participation, so long as members with 70 percent of the votes approve their contributions. According to I.M.F. officials, 110 nations, accounting for more than 70 percent of the votes, have already approved their contributions. Reluctance Among Members **********But I.M.F. officials say that the United States and other I.M.F. members are reluctant to see the financing increase go through without Washington's share. **********American officials say they are averse to a capital increase without Washington's joining in because that would reduce Washington's portion of the total financing as well as reducing its voting power at the fund to 14 percent from about 19 percent. This would mean that the United States would lose its veto over I.M.F. policy decisions because I.M.F. rules require 85 percent support for any important actions. **********The I.M.F. will not be providing all the financing needed by Russia and the other republics; the World Bank and aid from other nations will also help. But I.M.F. officials say the fund will face a liquidity squeeze without a financing increase, especially since poor African, Asian and Latin American countries are seeking more aid. The I.M.F. grants loans to help the developing world and former Communist countries shape up and rebuild their economies. Loans are granted only to member nations, and are usually made only after the nations agree to a program of economic changes approved by the fund."

Criticism of Lobbying Group **********But that hardly means the relationship is all harmony, especially after the criticism that the Prime Minister aimed in Washington at the mighty lobbying group for Israeli interests, the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as Aipac. **********At issue was the $10 billion package of American loan guarantees that Mr. Bush had refused to give to Mr. Shamir but offered with fanfare to Mr. Rabin last week because the Labor Government promises to scale back settlement-building in occupied territories, as the Administration wishes, and also because the President is fishing for Jewish votes in November. **********Aipac had lobbied hard for the guarantees in Congress, earning Presidential enmity in the process, and for their efforts the group's leaders heard uncommonly harsh words from Mr. Rabin after he took his leave of Mr. Bush.  Fights 'Lost in Advance' **********They had done more harm than good, waging battles ""that were lost in advance,"" he said. They should not pursue their own initiatives but rather take instructions from the Israeli Embassy in Washington. In a particularly stinging comment, he complained that they had failed ""to bring Israel one single cent."" **********When the Israeli press published leaked accounts of the attack a few days ago, Mr. Rabin's spokesman issued a mollifying statement that the Prime Minister ""attaches great value"" to Aipac and recognizes its need for independence. No real offense was meant, senior officials here insist. Mr. Rabin got a particular complaint off his chest, they say, and went on to have a businesslike meeting with Aipac on many issues, including how to get more favorable loan-guarantee terms from Congress than those agreed to by the President. **********Still, the tone of the Rabin remarks, delivered with characteristic gruffness and looks that could freeze mercury, raised eyebrows. Even Israeli newspapers, which are not always kind to American Jewish groups, complained that the Prime Minister had gone too far.  'Public Confrontation' Deplored **********It is not that he was wrong to assert his primacy over American Jewry in setting Israel's agenda with the United States Administration, editorial writers of all political stripes said. But ""the public confrontation with the Jewish lobby,"" the newspaper Haaretz argued, ""may weaken their strength and hurt their effectiveness in acting in Israel's interests."" **********Some Israeli commentators and representatives of American Jewish groups in Jerusalem say that Mr. Rabin may be out to settle scores with American groups he considers to have been too close to Mr. Shamir, including Aipac and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. **********Another popular theory is that Mr. Rabin fancies himself his own best adviser on the United States, having served as Israel's Ambassador there from 1968 to 1973, and therefore does not need the counsel of American Jews. If that is the case -- and the Prime Minister's associates insist it is not -- he is not much different from many Israelis. **********""Rabin is the tip of the iceberg,"" one American Jewish representative said. ""Most Israelis don't take American Jews seriously."""

But it did not once play the Kimigayo, Japan's unofficial anthem. The song is a paean to the Emperor, making it a symbol here of Japan's wartime oppression of Okinawa, when the islanders could be shot for speaking their own dialect. 'Used to Being Insulted' **********And while the national flag, the hinomaru, fluttered in its red and white glory all over Tokyo last Friday, it was conspicuously absent here, except for a single rising sun image above the stage. The three flagpoles in front of the convention center sat empty, bathed in the hard light of a breezy subtropical morning full of hope and frustration for the 1.2 million people of Japan's poorest prefecture. **********""Maybe it was insulting for them to have the ceremony in Tokyo, but as an Okinawan I'm used to being insulted,"" said Tatsuhiro Oshiro, one of the island's most respected novelists. ""It will make us stronger. We've accumulated a kind of wisdom from our hardships."" **********Masahide Ota, the prefecture's American-educated Governor, put the issue in more political, but no less plain-spoken terms. ""There would have been one ceremony if the national interests were the same as the local interests,"" he remarked. ""Unfortunately, that was not the case."" **********The history of the more than 60 islands that make up Okinawa is a story of a culture long caught between more powerful, competing powers. It was a kingdom trading actively with Asia for centuries, then stood in the awkward position from 1611 on of being vassal to both China and Japan. The ambiguity was clarified when the islands were forcibly annexed by Japan in 1879, beginning a period of economic exploitation and cultural intolerance. **********The Japanese, preaching homogeneity, looked down on the Okinawans and their dialect, while pressing them to assimilate. The religion of the island, a mix of animism and ancestor worship, was influenced by China, as was its music. Okinawa developed a highly esteemed textile industry, using plantain fiber rather than cotton or silk. A Different Viewpoint **********But Okinawa's economy lagged behind the mainland's, largely as a result of policies formulated in Tokyo. In short, the world looked much different from this easygoing, seaside city than it did from Japan's main islands. **********That was never more true than in 1972. In Tokyo, the reversion symbolized Japan's rehabilitation from the defeat of World War II and the beginning of a forward-looking era. But it came at a price, which Okinawa paid on Japan's behalf. Japan allowed the United States to keep its military bases here, a keystone in America's cold war strategy in Asia. **********Today, three-fourths of the American forces in Japan are on Okinawa, or more than 30,000 soldiers. The bases take up one-fifth of all the land on the main island here. **********Okinawan officials acknowledge that the bases have brought economic benefits, since rent is paid on the land and the bases employ about 8,000 local people. At one time they dominated the economy, but now tourism is the leading industry and much of the base land could be developed far more profitably for resorts or other projects. **********More important, the military sites are a nettlesome reminder that, as many here put it, the islands are occupied by a foreign power, sanctioned by Tokyo. 150,000 Civilians Killed **********American troops took Okinawa in the last campaign of the Pacific war. Nearly a third of the residents, or almost 150,000 people, were killed as the Japanese forces chose to retreat directly through populated areas. Hundreds more were forced to commit suicide by the defeated Japanese. More than 12,000 American troops and 107,000 Japanese were killed. **********Many here remember the American occupation as a period of benign neglect.

Posner of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, had forfeited the appearance of impartiality because as a law professor in 1977 he filed a legal brief for a client, CBS Inc., attacking restrictions that barred the networks from the $5 billion business of selling reruns to local broadcast stations and cable channels. **********On Nov. 5, Judge Posner wrote a unanimous decision on behalf of a three-judge panel, rejecting a 3-to-2 decision last year by the Federal Communications Commission to modify the old prohibitions but maintain many restrictions on the networks. The ruling sets the stage for granting the networks, including CBS, unrestrained access to the rerun market. **********At issue is the Financial Interest and Syndication Rule, which has been the subject of a two-decade political battle between the studios and ABC, NBCand CBS. **********First adopted in 1970, the rule was imposed amid fears that the three networks could use their dominance of the television audience to demand unreasonable financial concessions from studios and producers. **********Opponents of the rules contend that the networks now face formidable new competition for viewers from cable television, independent television stations and videocassette recorders. The networks have argued that the rules have become outdated and now merely protect Hollywood studios from greater competition. Brief Called 'Hypocritical' **********The new brief was filed today with the appellate court by the Coalition to Preserve the Financial Interest and Syndication Rule, an umbrella group of producers and independent television stations. **********Richard Cotton, general counsel for NBC, dismissed the petition as ""hypocritical,"" attacking the producers for not raising the issue until after the court ruled. The networks were preparing to file their own briefs with the court on Friday, arguing that the decision means the original 1970 rule must be dismissed along with last year's modifications. **********Even if Judge Posner were removed, legal experts suggested, the appellate ruling could still stand by a 2 to 0 vote. But the motion might preclude Judge Posner's involvement in any future hearings on the issue, such as when the F.C.C. submits a new justification for its decision."

Kravchuk of Ukraine declared today that he was suspending the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia because he had no guarantee that they were being destroyed. **********Mr. Kravchuk made the unexpected announcement at a news conference in Kiev marking his first 100 days in office, and a week before leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States are to gather for a meeting in the Ukrainian capital. **********""We ask the West to understand our Government,"" Mr. Kravchuk said. ""As long as there is no guarantee of full destruction, Ukraine will bear no responsibility."" **********He said there was a danger that the weapons ""may fall into the wrong hands."" He also noted that Ukraine's policy was that weapons transferred from its territory ""will never be used, will never make anybody stronger or more powerful than at present."" No Evidence Is Cited **********There was no immediate indication of specific factors behind the decision by Mr. Kravchuk, who cited no evidence that the weapons were not being destroyed. And there was no immediate reaction from Russia, whose President, Boris N. Yeltsin, is on vacation. **********Before Mr. Kravchuk's announcement, Ukraine had already transferred more than half its tactical weapons to Russia for destruction in accordance with treaties with the United States, and in keeping with Ukraine's stated intention of ridding its territory of all nuclear weapons by 1994. Nuclear warheads for intercontinental missiles based in Ukraine, but left under the joint control of the commonwealth, are also to be transferred to Russia. **********Mr. Kravchuk said he believed that Russia did not have sufficient capacity to destroy the weapons and that Ukraine had a right to its own weapons-dismantling plant. **********The Ukrainian leader also asserted that Russia was no longer allowing Ukraine to dispose of its nuclear wastes in Russia. And he suggested that his country could set up its own plants for destroying or reprocessing nuclear weapons near the Chernobyl atomic power station, which is already restricted and contaminated. **********Mr. Kravchuk made clear that he envisioned the possibility of Western assistance in setting up such a plant, which would help in the maintenance of the Chernobyl plant and provide employment for military-related industries in Ukraine. Tension on Military Issues **********Mr. Kravchuk's statements came against a background of deepening suspicions between Ukraine and Russia, much of them focused on the former Soviet military. The two republics have butted heads over the Black Sea fleet, over weapons stationed in Ukraine and over Ukraine's insistence on forming its own army. **********Behind the dispute is not only the power represented by the military but also the commercial value of the weapons. Both Russia and Ukraine have already embarked on sales of ships and other weapons abroad. **********Mr. Kravchuk's statements suggested several possible motives for his action. One was that he was really concerned that the Ukrainian weapons would end up in the wrong hands or would remain in Russia undestroyed. Another was that he wanted to send a signal before the Kiev summit meeting, at which the question of the army is expected to play a major role. **********There was also the possibility that Mr. Kravchuk had become wary of the situation in Russia and in the military. Moscow is now bracing for a congress of former Communists and others longing for the former Soviet Union, who are to convene on Tuesday. Officers of the former Soviet Army, for their part, have become increasingly militant in defending their jobs. **********There was no immediate indication of how the West would respond. But there is certain to be anxiety, since Mr. Kravchuk's move today represents just the sort of maneuvering with nuclear weapons that many in the West have feared."

New Negotiations Ruled Out **********The Foreign Ministers decided unanimously today not to reopen the so-called Maastricht Treaty on European unity for new negotiations, though some officials said that small changes could not be ruled out. The ministers agreed that the way would remain open for Denmark to take part in the European union that would be established under the treaty, according to a statement issued late this afternoon. **********Later, Prime Minister Poul Schluter said in Copenhagen that he would not rule out a new referendum, though he added that it would have to be ""on a different basis"" than the one on which the voters refused to ratify Tuesday by a vote of 50.7 percent against to 49.3 percent in favor. **********When Mr. Schluter and the other 11 European leaders signed the treaty in the Dutch city of Maastricht last December, they assumed that all countries would ratify it by next Jan. 1. Danes Given More Time **********But today, the Foreign Ministers decided that the Danes could have more time -- perhaps well into next year -- to work out their next steps. **********""It's a serious matter. It has to be tackled. But it doesn't need to be tackled in any pell-mell way,"" said the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd. **********Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish Foreign Minister, said he had told his colleagues it would probably take several months to figure out what to do. **********Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said: ""We must recognize that the referendum has exposed problems not only in Denmark but in other countries, including Germany. We have to do more to educate our people."" **********Opposition to the treaty has grown in Germany with the realization that a single currency would mean the end of the mark, Germany's stable currency. There are also growing voices in Germany for a larger role Community decisions. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressed unsuccessfully at Maastricht for greater powers for the elected European Parliament, to exercise more control over the unelected bureaucracy, the European Commission, in Brussels. **********Hostility to the Commission and its president, Jacques Delors of France, is also high in Britain, where 100 members of Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Party today supported a parliamentary motion calling for a rethinking of Government policy on the treaty. **********Mr. Major announced on Wednesday that Britain's ratification process would be temporarily suspended because of the Danish decision. **********The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, said today that community business would proceed normally at the summit meeting his Government will host in Lisbon later this month."

An Italian official called the operation ""the most important ever carried out in Italy and Europe against drug trafficking and money laundering."" **********By most accounts, the effect was to break up the complicated financial arrangements by which drug money was recycled back to the Colombian cartels as ""legitimate"" income. A Gateway to Europe **********The arrests -- 32 of them in Italy, by Italian accounts -- confirmed what had long been suspected here: that the Colombians wanted to use Italy and its organized crime gangs as a gateway to Europe. ""It is true that the Colombians have no difficulty at all getting cocaine to Italy,"" said Allesandro Pansa, a police investigator ""but they have more difficulty getting back the money they make from it."" **********The identity of Italian suspects corroborated the theory that, while all three of the main organized crime syndicates in Italy had a hand in the Colombian trade, the most significant was the Sicilian Corleonesi family headed by Salvatore (Toto) Riina, the reputed ""boss of all bosses"" of the Sicilian Mafia. **********""The Corleonesi offered the Colombians a lot of possibilities,"" Mr. Pansa said. ""They have told them they can launder any amount of money."" **********But of all the 32 Italians arrested, none were high ranking. And Italian investigators declined to say whether the crackdown had brought them any closer to arresting the killers of two top anti-Mafia crusaders, Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone. **********Both were killed by car bombs in Palermo, Sicily's capital. Mr. Falcone had been working on cases including the Colombian connection before his death on May 23. **********The investigations into the killing of the two illustrate the difficulties the police face from the complex planning of the Mafia and its oath of omerta, or enforced silence, which had apparently shielded all those involved in the two killings -- until this week. **********This week the authorities arrested Vincenzo Scarantino, a 27-year-old father of three from the Guadagna district of Palermo, whose detention showed just how much the police rely on a combination of legwork and chance breaks in the Mafia's armor for their rare glimpses into the killers' world. Shrapnel Offers a Clue **********According to investigators, Mr. Scarantino was only a small player in the plotting that led to the killing of Mr.  Borsellino on July 19 in Via d'Amelio in Palermo as he arrived for a Sunday visit with his mother. But through Mr.  Scarantino, and the blunders surrounding his reported part in the killing, the investigators said, they may be able to begin to unravel the line of command leading back to the bosses. **********Mr. Scarantino's job, investigators and press reports said, was to load explosives into a stolen Fiat 126. The car was then handed on to another, unidentified person who presumably installed the remote control device that triggered the bomb. **********The blast sent shrapnel flying 10 stories high. But as they sorted through the tiny pieces, investigators said, they discovered one tiny but important fragment: a sliver of the car's frame bearing an identification number. **********That led to the owner of the car, Pietrina Valenti, who had reported it stolen around the time Mr. Borsellino was killed. Until that point, her report of the theft and the bombing had not been linked by investigators. The First Break **********That was where the first break came. Mrs. Valenti was related to two of three men the police were investigating on separate rape and theft charges. And the investigation into those charges accidentally revealed that the men had stolen Mrs. Valenti's car from the repair shop where it had been garaged on the weekend of the Borsellino killing. **********When all these elements fell into place, said Arnaldo La Barbera, a plainclothes police investigator, the rape suspects admitted stealing the car and identified Mr. Scarantino as the person who had commissioned the theft, ostensibly on behalf of a friend. **********The remarkable mix of coincidence and blunder -- if the car thieves had not been accused of rape they would have avoided suspicion -- has led to the only known break in the murders of Mr. Borsellino or Mr. Falcone. The question is whether investigators will get any further in persuading Mr. Scarantino, or Mafia informers, to break the code of silence and identify other mafiosi. **********""Something is changing,"" said Interior Minister Nicola Mancino. ""It doesn't mean victory is near, but that we finally have efficient means to fight."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/19/business/mutual-funds-the-competing-money-markets.html,Carole Gould,1992-04-19,,891,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Mutual Funds; The Competing Money Markets,Mutual Funds; The Competing Money Markets," **********Until recently, when interest rates approached their lowest point in two decades, it was hard to go wrong in investing money that might be needed soon. Now, with rates in the basement, variations among investments can loom large, and savers who do not want to tie up their money for a long time have poured $39.3 billion this year into money market funds. **********Money market mutual funds -- diversified portfolios of Treasury bills and short-term securities issued by banks and corporations -- are offered by mutual fund companies and brokerage firms. Bank money market deposit accounts, sold by banks or savings and loan associations, were authorized by Congress in 1982 to allow them to compete with money funds. **********Bank money market deposit accounts can yield up to three percentage points less than money market funds because bankers make different investments than fund managers. In general, the spread between the two tends to grow when interest rates are rising and to shrink when rates are falling. Last week, bank money market deposit accounts yielded 3.61 percent, according to Bank Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla., compared with 3.73 for money funds, according to IBC/ Donoghue's Money Fund Report. **********With rates so close today, the main difference between the two types of investments is risk. Like all deposit accounts, bank money market deposit accounts are insured up to $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The accounts held $537.4 billion at the end of last year, according to Veribanc Inc., a bank-rating firm in Wakefield, Mass. **********Money market funds offer no insurance, but because their holdings are diversified and short term, losses would be minimal even if a commercial paper issuer defaulted on paper held by a fund. Compared with bank money accounts, ""there's more risk in funds, but not enough to worry about,"" said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. **********Then there is service. Most money market mutual funds offer checking, though many have monthly limits of 15 or 20 checks. By law, bank money account holders are limited to three checks a month, although unlimited withdrawals are allowed. **********Some people may confuse bank money market deposit accounts with bank-related money market mutual funds. Many banks are now selling funds, as demand for loans slackens and premiums for F.D.I.C. insurance escalate. Because of pressure on their profitability, ""many major banks have decided to move out of traditional bank instruments, turning to management of money funds, and mutual funds in general,"" said Gail J. Liberman, the editor of Bank Rate Monitor. **********Banks have been marketing their money funds aggressively, and their efforts are succeeding. While money flowed out of money market mutual funds over all for most of last year, the bank money funds had net inflows totaling $11.8 billion in 1991. Still, banks managed only about $40 billion of assets at the end of 1991, compared with $413.1 billion in money market mutual funds, Lipper Analytical Services reported. **********The money funds themselves are similar. The main difference is where you buy them. For amounts up to $10,000 or so, ""if you're happy with the services of your local bank, use it,"" said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. For larger amounts, small differences in yield can create significant differences in return, so ""I'd look for which is a better investment in terms of return."" **********In terms of tax status, there are three distinct types of money market funds, and the critical measure is yield on an after-tax basis. Last week, all taxable money funds yielded 3.73 percent, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The yields on tax-free money funds were 2.83 percent, and money funds that invest solely in United States Treasury securities were paying 3.72 percent. But the tax-free funds may actually yield more after taxes are paid, depending on your tax bracket and place of residence. **********Tax-free money funds invest in municipal debt, and their earnings are free from Federal income taxes. To find the after-tax yield, divide the actual yield by one minus your tax rate. For investors in the 28 percent bracket, the taxable equivalent yield for tax-free funds is 3.93 percent (2.83 divided by  [ 1-.28 ] ). For those in the 31 percent bracket, the tax-free fund yields 4.10 percent after tax. **********Then there are municipal funds, which can invest in ""private purpose"" issues whose earnings are subject to the alternative minimum tax, a flat tax intended to insure that wealthy taxpayers pay their fair share. For people who are not subject to the A.M.T., the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, for example, which was yielding 3.75 percent last week, effectively paid 5.21 percent for those in the 28 percent bracket. **********Funds that invest solely in Treasury securities are super safe and produce earnings free of state taxes. To figure the taxable equivalent yield for the state where you live, use the formula given earlier, substituting your state tax rate for the Federal rate. **********For example, Treasury-only funds yielded 3.72 percent last week on average. For New Yorkers in the highest state bracket, that translates into a 4.03 percent yield after state taxes are paid. New Jersey residents earn 4.00 percent; Connecticut residents slightly less, at 3.90 percent. Californians would pocket a 4.18 percent yield."

The two, Ernest Burrington and Lawrence Guest, are believed to have confronted Mr. Maxwell when they discovered that money was missing. **********Indeed, securities analysts and one of the company's bankers saw the changes as part of the preparation to put the company, one of Britain's leading newspaper publishers, back on a normal footing. Mirror's board hopes that trading in its shares will soon resume and that uncertainty about the company's ownership will be resolved. But it is unclear whether a British Government investigation of the company under Mr. Maxwell, which was announced last week, could cause a delay. **********Mirror Group has yet to release a financial report on how much money Mr. Maxwell siphoned from the company before his death on Nov. 5. It is reportedly negotiating with banks for financing. **********Trading in its shares has been suspended since Dec. 2, when the vast dimensions of the scandal began to become known. Mr. Maxwell is believed to have plundered more than $1.6 billion from his public companies and various pension funds. This deeply wounded Mirror Group. More than half of its group's shares are now thought to be held by the banks, which had been given them as collateral for the debts of Mr. Maxwell's private companies. Control of Mirror Group, though, rests with the court-appointed administrators for the private Maxwell companies. **********The banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that as far as he knew, the banks with shares had not forced the two executives to resign. The Financial Times reported today that the board had passed the changes by the administrators, who are partners at Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm. Chairman Since Dec. 3 **********Mr. Burrington, who is 65 years old, was named chairman on Dec. 3, after Robert Maxwell's son Ian stepped down less than a month after succeeding his late father. A longtime journalist and Mirror Group employee, Mr. Burrington had served as deputy chairman of Mirror Group since 1988 and was named joint managing director in 1991. He will continue to serve as a director. **********Lawrence K. Guest, the outgoing finance director, has served in that job since 1977. No replacement was announced. **********""They're preparing the ground by cutting the ties with the past,"" said the banker, whose institution holds Mirror Group shares. ""It's logical to go forward with a leadership completely unconnected with Maxwell."" **********The new chairman, Sir Robert A. Clark, has served as deputy chairman since last December. He joined the board of Mirror as an outside director shortly before it went public in the spring of 1991. A lawyer who had served as deputy chairman of TSB Group P.L.C., a large bank, and chairman of Hill Samuel Bank Ltd., a merchant bank, Sir Robert is a prominent figure in the British business community. Statement of Praise **********In a statement, Sir Robert praised Mr. Burrington's ""vital"" contribution, ""particularly since the death of Robert Maxwell."" He called Mr. Guest ""a most loyal and committed member of the company."" **********Mirror Group publishes The Daily Mirror, a leading tabloid, and its sister Scottish paper, The Daily Record, as well as three Sunday papers and two racing papers."

The battlefield is the heart of the International Business Machines Corporation's market: the data-processing centers of Corporate America. **********The Microsoft Corporation, which dominates the personal computer business, has invested $400 million and spent five years developing an operating system -- the software that controls computer operations -- that may make it a force in commercial computing and the fast-growing work station business. **********The program, the subject of industry chatter for more than two years, is known as NT, for new technology.  NT is scheduled to be given to outside software developers who write applications programs in July and, if all goes well, to be released commercially in early 1993. Microsoft's Hope **********Microsoft hopes NT will provide a framework for essential programs like those that perform payroll, accounting, inventory and other business computer applications. If Microsoft is right, success will come not only at the expense of I.B.M.'s latest version of its OS/2 operating system, which was released in March, but from its more expensive mainframe and minicomputer machines as well. **********At the core of the NT project is a team of almost 100 programmers in Redmond led by David Cutler, a software designer who many people believe is Microsoft's foremost weapon in its challenge to I.B.M. **********At Digital Equipment during the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Cutler was legendary as one of the nation's most prolific and successful software developers. There he engineered Digital's VMS software, the basis of Digital's successful attack on I.B.M. in business computing during the mid-1980's.  Frustration With Digital **********A protege of Gordon Bell, a leading computer designer, Mr. Cutler sought to distance himself from Digital's corporate politics after Mr. Bell left the company a decade ago. Still working for Digital, he moved a team to the Seattle area and began designing software and hardware around chips for reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. **********In 1988, Digital decided to build work stations based on a competing chip made by Mips Computer Systems Inc., leaving Mr. Cutler and his team frustrated. **********With little difficulty, William Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, was able to woo them from Digital. **********It was a good match. Mr. Cutler, 50 years old, who keeps his hair short and neatly trimmed, may not look like the young programmers, some of whom wear their shoulder-length hair in pony tails. But they all share the take-no-prisoners tradition at Microsoft. **********His current team includes Leif K. Pederson, NT Windows development manager; Lou Perazzoli, software engineering manager, portable systems; and David M. Thompson, development manager, portable systems. No Time for Interviews **********Mr. Cutler would not sit for a formal interview, preferring to spend time on his passion -- writing software. In contrast to many old hands in the industry who leave actual coding to a younger generation once they become managers, he has written the crucial kernel of his new program almost single-handedly. **********""He's one of the classic software engineers who has no formal computer science training,"" said Roger Heinen, a vice president in charge of Macintosh software at Apple Computer, who was Mr. Cutler's colleague for many years at Digital. ""He's an iconoclast and he has rough edges, but he hardly ever makes mistakes."" **********While NT is at least a half-year away from shipping, it has already attracted the attention of corporate customers, and Microsoft has prepared a group of 100 software ""evangelists"" to try to persuade companies that have written their programs for I.B.M. computers and Unix work stations to rewrite them for NT. **********""I've been extremely surprised by the number of large corporate customers that take NT seriously,"" said Patricia Seybold, president of the Patricia Seybold Group, an industry consulting firm in Boston. Falling Price of Hardware **********Increasingly in recent years, as computer hardware has fallen in price and become more of a commodity, operating systems have taken center stage in the industry wars. Mr. Gates has likened them to the railroads of the information age. His message is simple: The company that wins the coming 32-bit operating system war will control the computer industry. **********""NT represents the end of the dichotomy between what's a PC and what's a work station or a mainframe,"" Mr. Gates said. **********But positioning NT is a delicate challenge for Microsoft, which is trying to straddle the desktop and commercial markets. The company is anxious to avoid the fate that befell OS/2 when it was introduced by Microsoft and I.B.M. in 1986. Incompatible with existing MS-DOS software, the program was largely ignored by computer users. **********Now, Microsoft officials say NT will eventually be widely used as a desktop PC operating system, but they acknowledge that few desktop machines are powerful enough to run the program, which will require 8 megabytes of memory and 100 megabytes of hard disk space. **********So, the strategy is to reach far beyond desktop technology. The program is both scalable and portable -- industry jargon that means that it can handle computers based on not just one processor chip but clusters of several and that it can easily be modified to support many different types of computers. **********""NT is targeted at the core of I.B.M.'s business,"" said Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's executive vice president. **********Mr. Ballmer, a longtime Microsoft employee who attended Harvard with Mr. Gates, acknowledges that when NT is introduced it will at first be little more than a niche business. **********Yet, Microsoft's persistence and staying power are an established fact. Mr. Gates first introduced his Windows program in 1983. The program was generally ignored and did not become a best seller until nine years later, when Microsoft introduced it for the third time. System Shows Its Age **********NT is crucial to Microsoft's strategy because its 11-year-old MS-DOS program is showing its age. The software publisher is under pressure to respond to I.B.M.'s OS/2, which has a number of modern features -- most notably the ability to run several programs at once efficiently, known in the industry as multitasking. **********Many software executives expect the introduction of NT to be a painful process for Microsoft. They point to the high cost of I.B.M.'s agonizing difficulties in trying to ship a blemish-free version of OS/2 2.0. The program was delayed numerous times before it shipped in March. **********Competition among 32-bit operating systems is likely to be far more punishing than what Microsoft has experienced in the PC market, many executives say, and the company will have added difficulty because it will not be first to market. Crowded Playing Field **********In addition to I.B.M.'s OS/2, other high-powered operating systems are on the playing field. I.B.M. and Apple Computer have a joint venture called Taligent that is completing a radical new operating system called Pink.  Apple has its own System 7 for the Macintosh, and Sun Microsystems has Solaris. Unix Systems Laboratories and the Novell Corporation will announce a new version of Unix for PC's and work stations later this month. In addition, Next Inc. has its own version of Unix that in many ways is the technically most advanced operating system today. All have a lead on Microsoft and are serious about grabbing a share of the future operating-systems market. **********""Microsoft is coming in to a world that is already fragmented,"" said Richard Shaffer, editor of Computerletter, an industry newsletter published by Technologic Partners in New York. ""It's a disadvantage."" **********Microsoft had hoped to draw many of the competing operating systems together into a proposed consortium called the Advanced Computing Environment, or ACE. The idea was to marry both Intel and RISC chips, and NT and Unix operating systems into a single standard, but the effort collapsed earlier this year because of industry bickering. **********Microsoft says it will have access to Corporate America, where systems must be sold with sophisticated support and service, through its alliance with the Digital Equipment Corporation, which is planning on marrying the NT operating system with its new Alpha microprocessor chip, on which the company is betting heavily for future sales. **********But Digital, which built its business on David Cutler's VMS operating system in the 1980's, has stumbled badly in the last year, largely because it has sent its customers a confused message about what its future plans are and because its VAX minicomputers have lagged behind RISC systems in processing power. **********For its part I.B.M. professes to be unworried about the pending competition. ""We have evaluated NT, and what we have seen so far has not made the cut,"" said Lee Reiswig, the I.B.M. executive in charge of OS/2 development. **********From their former alliance the two companies have a software joint licensing arrangement, so I.B.M. has been able to review NT as it has been developed. Indeed, several I.B.M. software experts are still members of the NT team in Redmond. **********But that may soon end, and Microsoft executives have been quietly telling industry software developers that I.B.M. will be unable to follow future Windows advances after the summer of 1993, when the code-sharing agreement is scheduled to expire. **********Mr. Gates says that without the ability to offer Windows compatibility in the future, I.B.M. will be boxed in because it has been unable to persuade the software industry to write applications for OS/2. **********The final break in the relationship cannot come any too soon for Mr. Gates, who says that I.B.M. appears to be in disarray. **********""Nothing makes me madder than the notion of somebody taking my code and competing with me,"" he said."

To Cut Many Operator Jobs,COMPANY NEWS; New Technology at A.T.&T. To Cut Many Operator Jobs," **********A.T.& T. said yesterday that it planned to introduce technology that could replace up to one-third of its 18,000 long-distance operators by 1994. **********The announcement comes less than four weeks before A.T.& T. begins contract negotiations with the operators and other unionized workers. Their union, the Communications Workers of America, quickly branded the move an ""intimidation tactic,"" which A.T.& T. denied. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said it had developed the technology, known as voice recognition call processing, because more customers now direct-dial their long-distance calls, eliminating the need for an operator. Direct-dialing of many long-distance calls began when A.T.& T. installed large-capacity high-speed switching systems in the 1950's and 1960's, but it accelerated rapidly in the 1980's with the onset of competition. **********The new technology is intended to reduce labor costs at a time A.T.& T. is under increasing competitive pressures from other long-distance carriers, particularly MCI Communications and Sprint, but also by equipment makers that include Northern Telecom of Canada and Ericsson of Sweden. **********Using innovative software, the new technology will reduce the need for human operators even further by allowing computers to recognize a customer's responses to a series of computerized questions. **********A new algorithm, or sophisticated recipe of instructions, called word spotting, involves millions of calculations. It allows a caller to pause, stammer or even speak ungrammatical sentences without confusing the computer. A customer experiencing difficulty with a call can still ask for a human operator instead of the computer. **********Voice recognition, under development at A.T.& T. since 1985, eventually would handle many calls now assisted by human operators, including collect calls and those billed to third parties, like office and residential numbers. **********A.T.& T. said it planned to eliminate anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 operator jobs nationwide between now and 1994, as well as 200 to 400 management positions. That would entail the closing of 31 offices in 21 states. A.T.& T. operates 130 offices with about 100 to 140 operators each. **********The closings appear to be evenly distributed throughout the country, with the greatest number -- five -- in California, where three will be closed in Southern California and two in Northern California. Two offices in New York State will be closed, one in Syracuse, which has already been announced, and one in Brookhaven, L.I. Two offices have already been been closed, one in Glen Burnie, Md., and another in Howell, N.J. **********An A.T.& T. spokesman, Burke Stinson, said, ""The jobs are going, but not necessarily the people."" He said that where possible A.T.& T. would try to retrain personnel for nearby jobs. Possible jobs include international operator services, bilingual operator services, services for the hearing-impaired, ""800"" number directory assistance and telemarketing. **********Total labor costs for A.T.& T. operators were not immediately available from the company yesterday. But the union, the Communications Workers of America, said a long-distance operator could earn anywhere from $198.50 to $522 a week, or about $10,300 to $27,100 a year. Benefits could add anywhere from $3,800 to more than $10,000 a year. **********The union expressed outrage at the A.T.& T. announcement despite knowing of the field trials of the new technology since their onset last year. The union said it was surprised by the timing of the announcement and was angered by A.T.& T. managers informing workers of office closures. **********But Mr. Stinson, the A.T.& T. spokesman, said that the company's managers were responding to leaks from union officials and A.T.& T. operators about the job eliminations, and that managers wanted to inform workers before the news spread further."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/09/business/market-place-low-fat-problem-at-ben-jerry-s.html,Floyd Norris,1992-09-09,,926,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; Low-Fat Problem At Ben & Jerry's,Market Place; Low-Fat Problem At Ben & Jerry's," **********BEN & JERRY'S is, to say the least, an unconventional corporation. It brags of paying its suppliers more than market prices and of paying its executives less. Its annual report includes a ""social performance report"" dissecting how well it did in serving its community. **********But even as the company strives to sell 1.1 million new shares, to raise $30 million for a new plant, it is being bedeviled by Federal regulators who dispute its use of the term ""low fat"" for its new, and highly successful, line of frozen yogurt. **********Already the company has been forced to reformulate some products, at the risk of making them less tasty. More will have to be changed, and in at least one case the company will probably have to drop the ""low fat"" label. Just how much, if at all, sales will suffer as the company takes out fat remains to be seen. **********That dispute, simmering for nearly three months, was first disclosed by the company in the prospectus for the planned stock offering, which was announced last week. But the prospectus did not disclose the extent to which the company was being forced to reduce fat. In a telephone interview yesterday, Mary Kamm, director of quality control, said that in some cases the fat content would have to be cut in half. She expressed confidence that the product would still taste good. **********The company's highly advertised policy of restricting top pay to managers has also been relaxed and, it appears, quietly defined to exclude the largest part of one executive's compensation. **********Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. used to say that no boss got more than five times the compensation, including both pay and benefits, of the lowest-paid worker with at least one year at the company. Now the multiple is seven, and to stay in compliance, it chose to ignore the issuance of restricted stock last year in calculating the pay of its president, Charles Lacey. Alone among top officials, he was not present at the founding of the company, and is not sitting on a large quantity of stock acquired at bargain-basement prices. So last year the company gave him 5,000 shares, now worth about $150,000. His other pay, at the maximum allowed by the company's policy, is about $100,000 a year. **********A company spokesman, Alan F. Parker, declined to comment on Mr. Lacey's compensation. **********By any standard, Ben & Jerry's has been a success. It went public in 1985, using the highly unusual method of promoting its shares by advertising them on ice-cream cartons, at $4.33 a share, adjusted for two subsequent splits. Yesterday, the shares closed at $30.75, up $1, in Nasdaq trading. **********The company's ice cream costs more than nearly all others, but its bottom line shows no indication that recession bothered its customers. Nor does it seem to have been severely damaged by a decision to pay Vermont farmers more than the market price for dairy products, reflecting what the company called its determination to support family farmers. **********The company's expansion into ""light"" ice cream in 1990 did not do well, but it has successfully dropped that product and moved on to ""low fat"" frozen yogurt. **********On the packages of frozen yogurt, the company proclaims that ""we've cut back on the fat and calories, but you won't know it from the taste."" Compared with what, the Food and Drug Administration wanted to know, and Ms. Kamm said that claim was now being taken off the packages. **********Not, to be sure, that the products are exactly low in fat or in calories. Cherry Garcia frozen yogurt has 700 calories a pint, and 15 grams of fat. That is low compared with Cherry Garcia ice cream, where the figures are 1,000 and 64, but the yogurt is not likely to show up in weight-loss diets. **********To avoid losing the ""low fat"" label, Ms. Kamm said the company would have to get all its frozen yogurts down to 11.25 grams of fat a pint. She said some reformulations had been introduced, and others would follow. It appears that ""Coffee Almond Fudge"" frozen yogurt will have to lose two-thirds of its name, and be remarketed as the less sinful-sounding ""coffee"" frozen yogurt. And Heath Bar Crunch frozen yogurt may simply not be called low fat anymore. **********Thanks in large part to the success of the ""low fat"" frozen yogurt, Ben & Jerry's has seen its profits soar. In the first half of 1992, it reported profits of $3.5 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenues of $63.2 million. Profits were up 112 percent and sales 45 percent from a year earlier. **********But the prospectus for the new offering warns that the company's growth is sure to slow in the second half of 1992, and it says the company plans to step up hiring of support staff to help it cope with the increased sales. That is likely to depress profit margins, at least for a time. **********At yesterday's price, Ben & Jerry's stock is trading at 32 times its 12-month earnings, a multiple that discounts continued profit growth. As underwriters led by Tucker Anthony and Smith Barney market the proposed new offering, a big hurdle may be in convincing investors that the growth will not be slowed even as the company is forced to change its fastest-growing product in a way that is not likely to improve the taste."

They are marketing themselves as caring, pastoral institutions where cuddles and compassion are supplanting the sometimes cruel punishment of the past. **********Times and the economy have both changed, acknowledged David Jewell, the headmaster at Haileybury College in rural Hertfordshire about 20 miles north of London, a campus of elegant Victorian architecture that traces its roots to the beginning of the 19th century, when it was founded as a training academy for the East India Company. **********This fall, Mr. Jewell and the headmasters of some 200 other British public schools agreed at a meeting to mount a new marketing campaign to convince prospective parents that boarding schools are pleasant, convivial and caring places after all. What Manhood Means **********'Not so long ago, conformity and manliness and toughness were the virtues that we celebrated,"" said Mr. Jewell, whose outlook was shaped, in part, by some bleak memories of his own life as a public school student in Devon, where he recalls being beaten twice by older boys. ""Now we value nonconformity and independence of thought, and try to teach young men that real manhood involves tolerance, not aggression."" **********In Haileybury's great domed dining hall, beneath the framed portrait of Clement Atlee, a former Prime Minister and Haileybury ""Old Boy,"" as graduates are known, a table filled with 14- and 15-year-old boys agreed that it was so. ""No sir,"" they agreed, in near chorus, when asked whether they had suffered bullying or beatings from older pupils. **********Overall public school enrollment has risen to 608,000 -- about 7 percent of the total student population -- from 560,000 in 1985. But Dick Davison, the deputy director of the Independent Schools Information Service, said enrollment at boarding schools had been on a long-term decline, dropping from 125,000 in 1985 to 115,000 this year. Over the same period, the number of boarding schools has also fallen, from 1,040 to 979. **********But the drop has been sharper in the last two years, as families pinched by Britain's longest recession since the 1930's have turned to lower cost alternatives for educating their children. Annual tuition and boarding fees at first-rank public schools average about $17,000 a year. 'More Like Families' **********""The schools decided they had to do a better job of marketing, of reassuring parents they are more friendly places, more like families, with strong pastoral support systems,"" Mr. Davison said. ""The fact is, bullying and corporal punishment went out at most boarding schools more than a decade ago, but we just never got the word out."" **********The British public school has changed in other ways, too. Most of them now enroll young women, at least in the upper forms, which are equivalent to 11th and 12th grade in an American high school. At Haileybury, for example, a third of the upper form pupils are girls. **********In addition, there has been a marked trend in recent years away from boarding and toward day-schooling. About four of every five students attending private schools today are day students, a departure from the days when many upper class parents ritually packed their sons off to boarding school as soon as they turned 8 or 9. **********Over the years, the public school has loomed large in the British consciousness, partly as a result of a succession of popular books and stories set in boarding schools, and described recently by The Times of London as a kind of ""unique English Bildungsroman"" that helped inculcate among its young readers a shared set of distinctly English values. **********The heroes of such stories are invariably stout-hearted fellows, keen on athletics and defenders of the underdog, as they confront a succession of adolescent bullies and cheats who comprise a kind of permanent moral underclass. The Victims Organize **********The type was first described in ""Tom Brown's School Days,"" published in 1857 and telling the tale of young Squire Brown, sent off to Rugby School to become a ""brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishman, and a gentleman, and a Christian."" Along the way, he muddies himself on the playing fields and outwits Flashman, the callow school bully. **********In all of these novels, like life in the schools themselves, the premium was placed on the stiff upper lip. To cry or cringe or give in was, in the brutal lexicon of the public school set, to be ""wet,"" a stinging epithet. **********Such attitudes claimed victims, and three years ago several public school graduates went public with a support group called ""Boarding School Survivors,"" to serve men who now say their experience in public school left them scarred and hurt. **********In an answering echo, the schools now seem insistent on emphasizing their own softer feelings. Elizabeth Prichard, the first chairwoman of the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools, an organization that represents many boarding schools for elementary age children, said last month that schools must now put the emphasis on ""compassion, care and cuddle,"" rather than conformity. **********Mr. Jewell says he still believes that public schools have a role to play in building character and enforcing a ethical and moral code among his young charges, although he says it isn't as simple as it was in Tom Brown's days. **********""I may personally believe the air marshals and generals who won World War II were much better role models than the Sex Pistols,"" he said.  ""But after all, we do have to live in our own times, don't we?"""

But his conviction did not stop him from getting a license to open a bank in an eastern Polish city near what was then the Soviet border. **********When he was setting up the bank in 1990 in the city of Lublin, Mr. Bogatin asserts and Polish officials confirm, nobody asked questions about who he was or where the money came from. **********But when Mr. Bogatin's identity as a fugitive was unmasked last month by the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, his life as an foreign entrepreneur quickly unraveled. The newspaper article was followed by a run on the bank and a request for extradition from the United States that resulted in Mr. Bogatin's arrest last week. Would Be First Extradition **********If Mr. Bogatin, who is 46 years old, is extradited, it would be the first extradition ever between the United States and Poland, which signed an extradition treaty in 1927. United States State Department and Polish Justice Ministry officials said the case is under review. **********Mr. Bogatin's Polish attorney, Kazimierz Lojewski, filed an appeal of the extradition request at the Lublin prosecutor's office on Friday. The contents of the appeal are undisclosed. **********Mr. Bogatin's arrest was the most recent in a seemingly endless parade of economic scandals in Poland that have struck banks particularly hard and have touched many other business sectors, from car imports to travel agencies. **********Mr. Bogatin, who established the First Commercial Bank in Lublin in 1990, left the the United States in 1987 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and promising to pay New York and Federal tax authorities nearly $5 million, according to Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman in the New York State Attorney General's office. Evaded Gasoline Taxes **********Mr. Bogatin pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns to evade taxes owed on some 15 million gallons of gasoline his company distributed. A spokesman for Robert Abrams, the New York Attorney General, said then that Mr. Bogatin was part of a group of dishonest gas distributors that prosecutors believe operated under the direction of Michael Franzese, an admitted captain of the Colombo organized-crime family who was given a 10-year sentence for a Federal racketeering conviction in connection with the scheme. **********After the guilty plea in 1987, Mr. Bogatin was free on bail awaiting sentencing when he vanished from New York, forfeiting $500,000, Miss Connell said. She said he was to have been sentenced to up to eight years in prison. **********""We are pleased that he has been apprehended,"" Miss Connell said. ""We would like to see him extradited."" Only the State Department has the authority to request extradition of United States citizens; officials in Washington said the prospects for Mr. Bogatin's return to the United States looked promising. **********A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ""The Poles are cooperating fully on this. I'm quite sure the Poles want to get it out of their way. If everything goes well it shouldn't take more than a few months, maybe even weeks, to work out."" **********In Poland, Mr. Bogatin's bank, First Commercial, claims $100 million in deposits and is the first bank to receive permission to sell shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Polish banking officials say there are no indications that either Mr. Bogatin or his bank violated Polish law. **********When the news broke, thousands of depositors lined up in the cities where First Commercial has branch offices, withdrawing about $4.5 million out of its 14 branches, a bank spokesman said. **********Many later redeposited their money after Mr. Bogatin personally addressed the lines, promising higher interest rates for those who maintained their accounts at First Commercial, as well as a lottery offering cars and apartments for those who keep a minimum one-year deposit. **********The bank seems to have flourished by offering depositors above-market interest rates, but it is now likely to come under closer scrutiny from Polish banking officials."

Planning for the End of Life"," **********When Lisbeth Chapman's family gathered on Cape Cod to celebrate Thanksgiving and her father's 80th birthday last year, parents and daughter witnessed each other's signing of health care proxy forms, a document that appoints someone to make health care decisions for you if you are incapacitated. **********Ms. Chapman, 48, a public relations consultant in Needham, Mass., said it wasn't something they had planned far in advance. She was moved to draw up the documents because they are a pet project of one of her clients, Dee Lee, a financial planner in Harvard, Mass. Ms. Chapman's parents are the type who want to relieve their children of any potential for stress and discomfort. ""My mother's mother and my dad's dad both lived with the family for extended periods of time and they're very sensitive to these issues,"" she said. ""By the time we were finished, everyone else in the room was saying: 'We have to go home and do this, too.' "" **********Financial planners say that documents that appoint someone to make medical and financial decisions for you if you are unable to do so are as important as a traditional will. A durable power of attorney appoints someone to make financial decisions such as signing your tax return or selling your car. To allow someone to make health care decisions, you need a medical directive like a living will or medical power of attorney. **********Medical directives are not just for the elderly. Experts say everyone over the age of 18 should have one. ""My son turned 18 last year and he thought the rites of passage were to get an earring and buy a lottery ticket,"" Ms. Lee said. ""I told him about registering with Selective Service and signing a health care proxy."" **********Financial planners are getting involved in this area because these documents help you maintain control, Ms. Lee said. ""There's been a lot written about medical directives providing the right to die,"" she said. ""That's not quite right. They let you die with dignity."" Her grandmother died on a farm in Kansas with a dozen people around. ""My husband's grandmother died by herself in the hospital, shriveled up and attached to tubes,"" Ms. Lee said. ""That's the difference."" Approximately 80 percent of Americans die in institutions, according to Choice in Dying, a nonprofit group based in New York. **********A Federal law effective Dec. 1, 1991, called the Patient Self-Determination Act, requires hospitals and other health care providers to give adults information when they are admitted about their rights to accept or refuse medical treatment and to prepare a document that will authorize someone else to make decisions for them. **********Individuals have long had the right to refuse treatment, but until recently, it was not clear whether they retained the right when they became incapacitated, according to Peter J. Strauss, a partner at the New York law firm of Fink Weinberger and a specialist in elder care. ""The question was,"" he said, ""do you lose that right when you no longer have the ability to communicate because of incompetency or illness?"" **********In July 1990, the Supreme Court upheld a ruling that found that the state of Missouri was entitled to require ""clear and convincing evidence"" that Nancy Cruzan, who had been in a vegetative state since a 1983 automobile accident, would have wanted a feeding tube to be withdrawn under those circumstances. ""The Supreme Court said that you do not lose the right to refuse medical care when you become incapacitated,"" Mr. Strauss said. ""However, the states have the right to lay down reasonable rules to determine what your wishes are."" **********Under the new patients' rights law, those rules must be communicated to you. For example, New York state, like Missouri, requires ""clear and convincing evidence"" of the wishes of the patient, Mr. Strauss said. These wishes can be conveyed, in New York, with a health care declaration, or living will. It would also be prudent to prepare a medical power of attorney, designating a particular person to act as your agent. **********The living will drawn up by Mr. Strauss directs that life-prolonging medical treatments be discontinued if the patient is left ""unable to communicate with others meaningfully"" and ""there is no reasonable prospect of recovery."" It defines the medical treatments that should be discontinued, including ""nutrition and respiration by artificial means."" ""In other words, if I am in a coma or vegetative state, I do not want any treatment,"" Mr. Strauss said. **********But, Mr. Strauss points out, some people may want to specify that they would like any type of treatment that is available -- and that can be specified, too. ""It's just as important to spell that out,"" he said. ""This is a choice issue. It is not a pull-the-plug issue."" **********In some states, residents must be specific about the types of treatment they want. For example, ""in New Hampshire, you must specify that you do not want tube feeding,"" Ms. Lee said. According to Mr. Strauss, ""You should always spell out what to do about nutrition and hydration because it is so controversial and there are a lot of psychological feelings tied up with feeding and nutrition."" **********In many states, you can buy the necessary forms in a stationery store. You can also get them from a financial planner or from Choice in Dying. **********Choosing an agent to carry out your health care wishes is difficult for some people, Ms. Lee said. Ms. Chapman named her cousin, who is also executor of her will and guardian of her two children. She chose her cousin, she said, because ""I wanted a woman"" and ""I wanted someone who knew me really well; who knew what I mean by quality of life."" To Ms. Chapman, quality of life has to do with using her brain. ""If I can't communicate at all, that's it for me,"" she said.  FOCUSING ON THE PROBLEMS OF AGING **********Not so long ago, retirement planning and estate planning were the two final steps in a sound financial plan. Today, though, with longer life expectancies and continued medical breakthroughs, financial professionals see a need for a type of planning to help people deal with new issues of aging that come sometime between retirement and death. **********These might include long-term care insurance, dealing with Medicare and Medicaid laws and planning for continued personal control over your life even though you may be unable to make decisions yourself. **********For example, Oppenheimer & Company, the Wall Street firm, recently entered into an agreement with Fink Weinberger, a New York law firm, to offer a service they call Life Planning, which includes legal, financial and tax counseling. **********Many financial planners, too, focus on elder care. Dee Lee, a planner in Harvard, Mass., specializes in clients ""age 50 to 93,"" she says. Among other things, she provides bookkeeping and money management services to help clients remain at home."

Todd Jr. has a vastly different vision. **********To Mr. Todd, the chairman of the Birmingham Steel Corporation, these shuttered and unprofitable plants are opportunities that are waiting only for the right mix of capital and management. **********So Mr. Todd, 63 years old, has been buying aging or failing steel operations, one by one -- seven all together -- and resuscitating them. In the eight years of Birmingham Steel's existence, that strategy has taken his company's operations far beyond the suburban office tower here where he and his staff work. **********Birmingham Steel's purchases have ranged from mills in Seattle to plants in Illinois, all in the name of producing steel reinforcing bars used by the construction industry. And for the most part that strategy has led to shining successes, a testimony to what can be achieved in the emerging world of the steel mini-mill. **********A mini-mill is a company that makes steel by using electricity to melt scrap, rather than by starting with iron ore. Smaller than the giant steel companies, mini-mills generally are not unionized and often focus on one or two steel products rather than making all steel goods for all customers. **********Now, against a backdrop of subdued earnings during the nation's two-year economic slump and an increased investment in technology by other mini-mill companies, some steel experts say that for all Mr. Todd has accomplished, it is time for a fresh approach. **********""The main challenge for Birmingham Steel is to go beyond piecing together castoff mills and to move into being a quality producer using newer technologies,"" said John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants Inc. in Philadelphia. ""It has worked well so far, but how will it play in the coming decade?"" **********Discussions about Birmingham Steel often seem to invite comparisons with the Nucor Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., the nation's largest mini-mill company. Nucor has adopted new technology to produce sheet steel, the bread and butter of the big steel companies. **********Mr. Todd acknowledged that he would like to emulate Nucor's technological prowess -- someday -- but added that it would be at least several years before that could occur. **********""We feel we have to go where Nucor is,"" he said. ""We're looking at every approach being done in the world and deciding which one we should do."" **********Among the projects currently on the agenda is the construction of a mill near Phoenix. Scheduled for completion in 1994, the mill will make reinforcing steel for sale in the Southwest and Mexico. **********And Mr. Todd said he remained ever on the lookout for another acquisition. ""We do plan to make more acquisitions, and we think that right now is an attractive time to do that,"" he said. ""We are convinced that there continue to be opportunities in the mini-mill business. We think that mini-mills will account for 40 to 45 percent of the steel business in this country in the next decade or so, and we plan to have a big stake in that."" A Few Missteps **********But not all of Birmingham Steel's purchases have been successful. A plant in Norfolk, Va., bought in 1988, was mothballed earlier last year because it could not operate profitably. ""It took 16 hours to do the maintenance to run it for 8,"" Mr. Todd said, adding that the purchase was ""not one of our brilliant moves."" **********The company also closed a mill last year in California that it bought in 1987, citing the high rates for electricity. **********And like nearly all other steel companies, Birmingham Steel has been ravaged by the recession, which weakened the market for steel products and caused profits to thin in the last two years. **********After record earnings of $39 million in the 1989 fiscal year, Birmingham saw its profits decline, reporting a paltry $21,000 in net earnings for the fiscal year that ended last June 30. ""It was the most disappointing period in the company's history,"" Mr. Todd said. **********But while Mr. Todd, in an interview in his office here, acknowledged the hits and misses, he was quick to insist that his company was on solid footing and in the early stages of a rebound that would be robust, once the economy picked up. **********Birmingham Steel's performance compares quite favorably, Mr. Todd said, with the losses recorded by the big integrated steel companies and many mini-mill companies as well. **********While Birmingham Steel had net income of $3.5 million in the first three months of 1992, its fiscal third quarter, Mr. Todd noted that Bethlehem Steel lost $44.6 million and USX's steel division lost $13 million. Minimill competitors like Oregon Steel, New Jersey Steel, Bayou Steel and Roanoke Electric also fell short of Birmingham's earnings, he said. **********Many people who follow the steel industry say the success of Birmingham Steel is a testament to Mr. Todd's acquisition philosophy. Buying at bargain-basement prices, usually when operations are on the verge of being idled, Mr. Todd then tries to operate them at costs far below those of his competitors. Birmingham Steel's workers take 1.6 hours to produce a ton of steel, compared with the industry average of about 5. **********""Jim Todd is a very good operator and good businessman who has found opportunity where many did not think opportunity existed,"" said F. Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman and chief executive. ""Of course, his approach to the mini-mill industry is different from ours, but it seems to work for him."" 'We Were in the Steel Business' **********Mr. Todd, a native of West Virginia, is known among employees and industry executives for being particularly straightforward, as well as being driven by a desire to keep costs low. **********""He is an energetic guy who pushes harder for profits than most executives I've ever known,"" said Jerry L. Ledbetter, general manager of the company's plant in Jackson, Miss. **********For 25 years, after graduating from West Virginia University, Mr. Todd worked for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, serving in various sales and marketing positions. He left to work as vice president of marketing for the Atlas Powder Company, a manufacturer of explosives owned by the Tyler Corporation. **********In 1977, he became president of the United Affiliates Corporation, a subsidiary of the United Coal Company, and three years later, was named chairman and chief executive of the Birmingham Bolt Company, when it was acquired by United Affiliates. **********Birmingham Steel was put together in 1984, when AEA Investors Inc., a New York investment group, bought Birmingham Bolt. Birmingham Bolt ran two small steel operations -- in Birmingham and Kankakee, Ill. -- that made products for the company's roof manufacturing plants. **********""I soon realized that we were in the steel business and that's where our future would be,"" Mr. Todd said.  Low End, Nonunion **********The company bought Mississippi Steel in 1985 and went public later that year, renaming itself Birmingham Steel. Next came the acquisition of plants in Norfolk in 1986 and in Seattle later that year. In 1987, the company bought a mill in California and, last year, bought another steel plant in Seattle. **********The company's plan was to produce reinforcing bars, an item at the low end of steel product offerings, with a nonunion work force and low capital costs. The work force is paid on the basis of an incentive system linked directly to output and productivity. **********In the last 15 years, mini-mills have virtually taken away from the big steel producers the market for concrete-reinforcement bars used in highways and construction projects.  And, until the recession, Birmingham Steel's profits rolled in, as the company became the nation's largest producer of the reinforcement bars. **********""The company's track record, as far as profits go, has been quite good,"" said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group. ""The recession affected them, but not to the extent it affected some others in the industry. That's because Jim Todd stresses keeping costs down to a bare-bones level. He is known for that."" Not a Hero of the Steelworkers **********Mr. Todd is also known for speaking his mind, and at no time is he more blunt than when discussing unions. Birmingham Steel, like many mini-mill companies, is completely nonunion, and Mr. Todd hopes the company always will be. **********""We do not see any way that the union is interested in building the steel industry in the United States,"" he said. ""We simply cannot live with their work rules because they seem to be more interested in maintaining the status quo and so interested in protecting the older workers' pensions that they discriminate against younger workers."" **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Todd is not a hero to the leaders of the United Steelworkers of America. ""Mr. Todd is not fond of unions and isn't fond of the idea that the law gives them the choice to be unionized,"" said Richard H. Davis, interim director of the United Steelworkers' District 36, which covers four Southern states. ""He intrudes in employee decision-making on unionism. His attitude is terrible and not very progressive."" **********In fact, Mr. Todd was the object of derision from members of the United Steelworkers in Seattle, after Birmingham Steel bought the assets of a steel plant and replaced union members with nonunion employees from a nearby mill that Birmingham had previously closed. Cash to Invest **********The union critics aside, some steel experts question whether Birmingham Steel can prosper in an era in which the most successful mini-mills are expected to be those taking on new technology and making sheet steel for the automobile and appliance industries. **********A public offering earlier this year raised $63 million, and Mr. Todd said that he expected the company to generate $150 million in cash flow in the next fiscal year. That would give him the footing in cash and borrowing ability to invest in technology, particularly sheet steel production. **********""Some of our ideas work out well and some of them don't,"" Mr. Todd said. ""But we always feel we always have to keep trying something."""

""That reflects the usual pattern of short-term yields lagging the long-term numbers, which generally indicate the next trend."" **********It appears that the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday of a reduction in the reserve requirements of its member banks, from 12 to 10 percent on transaction acccounts, could be a way of easing credit conditions without having to cut the discount rate again, according to Mr. Heady. **********Among New York area commercial banks, the average money market account yields rose by a basis point, to 3.52 percent.

Bass said yesterday that it was seeking to present its $1.2 billion offer for Macmillan Inc. and Official Airline Guides to the creditors of the Maxwell Communication Corporation, even though that offer was officially rejected as inadequate by the British administrator and American examiner in the Maxwell bankruptcy. **********The Bass group has offered to pay $725 million cash and to assume all debt of Macmillan and Official Airline Guides to third parties. It was not immediately clear how much, if at all, the Bass group might raise its bid. **********And Price Waterhouse, the British administrator, was giving no indications of what was realistically acceptable. ""Obviously there is a price at which we would have to consider changing our strategy,"" Mark Homan, senior adminstrator for Price Waterhouse and Maxwell, said. Hard Choices **********The Bass group is being led by Keystone Inc. -- formerly the Robert Bass Group -- and Acadia Partners L.P., another Bass-controlled entity. It also includes Bain Capital; Bear, Stearns & Company and DLJ Merchant Banking. Maxwell Communication's bank creditors include Credit Lyonnais and Chase Manhattan. **********But even as the offer's terms were made public, it became apparent that the sale of the Maxwell properties would be a complex process, where every option has strong adversaries. **********Alan Jameson of Price Waterhouse said the Bass-led bid is ""so much at the bottom end of our expectations"" that the company plans to continue to try to sell Official Airline Guides and take Macmillan public. **********J. P. Morgan & Company, which is advising the administrator, has indicated it is looking for $700 million to $1.1 billion cash for the two American properties. **********But a person close to the Bass group said that those parameters were set several months ago and that the companies' performance had deteriorated since then. **********Moreover, this person said that the market for initial public offerings had weakened recently; that Macmillan had a particular problem because roughly half its operating earnings -- profits from its elementary and high school textbook division -- were part of a joint venture with McGraw-Hill, and that it was difficult to take public a company that does not control the majority of its assets. **********To some degree, the administrator appears limited in its choice of options. Several investment bankers familiar with Maxwell Communication said yesterday that the Bass-led group might have come in with a low bid because it was convinced that few buyers were willing to acquire all of Macmillan. The name most often rumored is Paramount Communications Inc., which already owns Simon & Schuster, a leading rival publisher. **********At the same time, selling Macmillan piecemeal would be very costly, since sales of individual assets would lead to high capital-gains taxes and deplete cash left to pay creditors. **********Several bankers speculated that David H. Shaffer, now president of Macmillan, would welcome a public offering because he could continue to run the company. Mr. Shaffer declined comment Monday night. **********As to a sale of Official Airlines Guides, the most widely rumored buyer is Reed International, but since that company already has a major stake in the business, several bankers wondered whether a purchase would raise antitrust issues."

They said Mr. Barzani's party was generally believed to have the widest overall support.

Etna or Go the Way of Pompeii," **********What do American marines aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean do as an encore to the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath?  For some, at least, they drop seven-ton concrete blocks from America's biggest military helicopters hovering 15 feet over molten lava on Mount Etna to save an Italian village from the volcano's wrath. **********""Everything is easier when no one is shooting at you,"" said Comdr. John Carpenter of the Navy, the air-operations officer at the United States Sigonella naval base at Catania near this Sicilian mountain village of 7,000 people threatened by the lava flow. **********""It's still a very challenging operation,"" said Maj. Jim Ross of the Marines, a 36-year-old gulf war veteran pilot who helped plug a hole in the lava flow the other day by swinging a concrete block back and forth below his C-53 helicopter to push other concrete blocks into the hole. ""It was like croquet,"" Commander Carpenter said. **********Still, in this battle between human ingenuity and military high-tech on one side and nature's caprice and the slow, brute flow of the lava on the other, there are no clear winners. **********""If it goes on like this,"" said Franco Barberi, Italy's chief Government volcanologist, ""no scientist, Rambo or marine will be able to resist it."" **********Indeed, this afternoon, in a vineyard and orchard on the outskirts of Zafferana Etnea, the lava flow was moving again, a malignant monster on a 100-yard front, 15-feet high, gray-black and inexorable. For moments it would seem to pause as its outer crust solidified. Then, with a clink and hiss and clattering, the hot lava within inched forward, shedding the crust before it, showing itself in places in molten-red seams that set trees alight. **********""I don't think anyone believes you can stop the flow that easily,"" said Lieut. Mark McCaffrey, a Navy spokesman at the Sigonella base. ""It's not quite as easy as shoving a cork in a champagne bottle."" **********The snow-capped Mount Etna, at 10,900 feet, is Europe's tallest and most active volcano, and it began to erupt in December. Dams were built to contain its lava where it usually settles in a high bowl near the snow-capped peak. **********But the dams broke and the lava began to flow. As its crust cooled and hardened, it created an insulated tunnel for the molten lava to flow through, curling down the valley that leads right through the middle of the village. As it moved thus, the tunnel was extended and the lava flowed farther down. **********At present, it stands at the village's edge, and is still moving. It has so far destroyed one house, whose owner had set a table with wine and bread to appease it. This afternoon, in half an hour, it burned a fruit tree in its last bloom, and moved on. **********Almost two weeks ago, Italian volcanologists, who had used explosives to try to divert the flow, asked the United States to help. So, apart from the C-53 helicopters at Sigonella base, a helicopter squadron from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit also arrived from the aircraft carrier Inchon with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. **********Just about every pilot in the unit, Major Ross said, had flown either in the war to evict Iraq from Kuwait or the subsequent operation to protect Iraq's Kurds. Some Marine and Navy pilots had flown in other operations to take American diplomats to safety from civil conflicts in Somalia and Liberia. 'It Was Too Late' **********By comparison, said Major Ross, Operation Volcano Buster, as the Marines called this deployment -- a logo they painted on the sides of their helicopters -- was ""not life or death."" But it was nonetheless precarious. **********The tactic to halt the flow in the joint Italian-American operation this week was for Italian units to use explosives to blow a hole in the lava tunnel 6,000 feet up Mount Etna, high above this village. Then, the American helicopter carried the huge concrete blocks into position around the hole and knocked them in. On Tuesday evening, the maneuver filled the hole with 92 tons of concrete and rubble that seemed to block the flow. **********The main problem was the size of the eruption. Since Dec. 15, Mount Etna has disgorged 120 million cubic yards of lava, and it is still spiting out the stuff high on its flanks. So, after a brief pause, the lava started to move again, and the Italian Air Force is now planning to deploy its own Chinook heavy transport helicopters to repeat the American maneuver. It is not clear, thus, whether the American helicopters will fly again. **********That was not much consolation for Rosaria Russo, 54, whose vineyard and fruit trees lie in the lava's path in the steeped, wooded valley that leads down Mount Etna and on through Zafferana Etnea. **********""The Americans did something,"" she said, ""but it was too late."" **********""The Italian Government should have thought about it before, instead they thought only about the elections,"" she said, referring to the national vote on April 5 and 6. **********""Now it's too late,"" she said. **********""But they're our fields,"" said a man in a faded khaki hat, his skin bronze beneath a silver stubble, as the lava tramped over vines not yet in leaf. **********Someone jabbed a stick into the ground, a few feet before the face of the lava, and on the stick they pinned a picture of three saints revered in these parts: St. Philadelphia, St. Alfio and St. Cirino. The lava, though, didn't seem to notice."

Later, Israeli military authorities dismissed many of the local officials, including the mayors of El Bireh, Ramallah and Nablus, and suspended further voting. They contended that the balloting had not been democratic, but instead represented ""elections held under terrorism, intimidation, bribery."" **********Now, General Rothschild, carrying out an initiative offered several months ago by Defense Minister Moshe Arens, said the Government is acting in response to quieter conditions in the territories, after more than four years of the Palesintian uprising."

This rate is well above normal for the carrier, especially if it is to be maintained for days or weeks. **********A decision on whether to scale back the patrols hinges on whether Iraqi planes breach the 32d parallel, the northern border of the air zone established by the United States and some gulf war allies to protect the Shiite Muslims of southern Iraq. Eventually, the flights may become sporadic, like the intermittent patrols over the Kurdish region in Iraq's north. **********The Baghdad Government continued to issue statements condemning the air operation today but did not talk of any specific military response. **********All the pilots returned to the Independence tonight without sighting an Iraqi plane. Nor did they detect any other opposition, like the locking of radar on their aircraft, although Iraqi radar scanned the skies. **********The Pentagon said American fighters and surveillance planes flew over every major Iraqi airfield south of the 32d parallel. Air Force jets based in Saudi Arabia and fighters from Britain and France are also taking part in the patrols. **********""They know we're out there,"" Comdr. Don Watkins said today as he returned in his A-6 Intruder bomber. ""They're looking at us, they're watching,"" he said, citing indications from his radar-detection equipment. **********Despite the lack of Iraqi resistance, the officers and crew of the Independence began to pace themselves for the long haul. Deck hands scurry around the ship's flat top as the planes come and go, working 18 hours at a stretch before collapsing into narrow bunks for six hours of rest. **********Eleven decks below, in the boiler room, firemen are on watch for four-hour stints but don't think of themselves as especially lucky. It's doubtful that anyone could stand the 110-degree heat longer than that. **********As for the pilots, some fly twice a day -- for two, four, even six hours. Sometimes there is a four-hour break between flights, sometimes eight. **********""It's somewhat higher than we are used to flying,"" Capt. Arthur N. Langston, commander of the air group, said of the frequency of the takeoffs. ""The thing we have to watch is crew rest, maintenance-personnel rest, being able to sustain this operation for a long period of time. Sustaining this kind of operation for a long period of time takes a lot of management."" **********Reporters aboard the Independence are forbidden from writing about future operations, specifics of the rules of engagement -- the circumstances under which a pilot can use his weapons, for example -- or from including certain other classified information they might obtain by observation. Censorship by Military **********The journalists' reports are reviewed by officers before they are transmitted. This procedure has caused little conflict so far. **********Not all the planes that take off are armed. About half the Intruders that went aloft today were carrying fuel for other aircraft. Even in the oil-producing Persian Gulf region, fuel supplies must be closely managed. **********An A-6 Intruder can be rigged with one fuel tank under its belly and two under each wing. An S-3 Viking, usually used for long-range surveillance, can also serve as a flying gas station. **********""If we lose a tanker hop,"" or refueling flight, ""that's going to stop a guy from going over the beach"" and into Iraqi airspace, said Comdr. Jamie Kelly, head of the ship's A-6 squadron. **********Today, though, every takeoff planned was accomplished, the carrier's skipper, Capt. Carter B. Refo, said. Noting the intense pace, he warned his crew not to give in to the dangerous mixture of exhaustion and exhilaration. **********""Remember when you are feeling high and euphoric like that, people do dumb things and people get hurt,"" he said.                    --------------------       U.S. Planes Drop Leaflets **********WASHINGTON, Aug. 28 (AP) -- A Pentagon spokesman said today that American planes were dropping leaflets in southern Iraq warning Baghdad's forces against entering the air zone. **********The spokesman, Bob Hall, said the Arabic-language leaflets were of two kinds. One said, in essence, ""Don't fly or you'll be shot down,"" he said. The other, aimed at radar operators, warns them not to ""point them at us or try to acquire us, or you'll suffer the consequences."" **********Mr. Hall said another concern, that Iraqi aircraft might provoke confrontations by flying just north of the 32d parallel, had so far not materialized. **********""They had some flights north, but I don't think any just north of the line,"" he said. **********A similar air-exclusion zone was imposed over the northern region of Iraq immediately after the gulf war ended, to protect the Kurds there from military reprisals by Baghdad. Iraq has not tried to challenge that flight ban. **********Baghdad, however, has condemned the current air-exclusion zone as an act of aggression intended to partition the country."

That's what comes from playing music on the street, he said. **********For 25 years, Mr. Matyukov was a cellist in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and he did fine for himself, he says, playing for the local symphony orchestra and opera, and teaching on the side. **********Then 14 months ago he joined the 350,000 emigres from former Soviet territory who have flowed this way since 1989, only to find that Israel needs one more 52-year-old cellist about as much as it needs another fight with the United States. So now he takes his cello and a small folding chair to Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv, playing up to seven hours a day, sometimes for only a few shekels. **********The acoustics, as one might imagine, are nothing to shout about, Mr. Matyukov said. The other day, he had to play so hard to be heard over the traffic that he sprained his wrist. 'We Don't Eat' **********No, he said, it isn't easy. ""If there are not a lot of nice people on the street,"" he said in broken Hebrew, ""we don't eat."" **********In Israel's large cities, the streets are alive with the sound of music, provided by Soviet immigrants on a scale that this country has never before experienced. About 11,000 of the new arrivals say they are artists, and 60 percent of this group list themselves as musicians. A running joke is that if a Russian comes off the plane and he is not carrying a violin case, it can only mean he's a piano player. **********What to do with them all is hardly a joke, though, because there is steady work for only the few hundred who are unquestionably top-rate or who perhaps know how to pull a few non-musical strings. **********Even assuming the Government was doing a stellar job in trying to absorb them -- and there is little danger of its ever being accused of that -- Israelis find themselves stuck with the hopeless question of how many violinists can squeeze into a postage-stamp country with a population half that of Moscow. **********The proportion of musicians among the new immigrants, roughly 2 percent, is several times that to be found in the general Israeli population, although it is said not to be out of line with occupation patterns among Jews in the former Soviet Union. **********A similar quandary holds true for the nearly 40,000 former Soviet doctors, dentists, engineers and architects who have arrived in the last two years. One Government goal is to channel newcomers into growth fields -- turning oil engineers into computer specialists, for instance. But teaching an old oboist new tricks, especially after he has invested years in professional studies, is not so easy. **********""A musician does not like to throw it all out the window -- it's like denying your previous life,"" said Daniel Fradkin, principal violinist for the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and himself an emigre from the Soviet Union 19 years ago. **********While it is too early to tell exactly how the Russians and others may change cultural life here, they have already created a new pool of concert- and theater-goers that delights Israelis who fret that interest in such pursuits is declining. They also pump new life into music schools. **********""They are saving us,"" said Esther Narkiss, director of the Conservatory of the Jerusalem Rubin Academy of Music and Dance. In the last two years, her prestigious school has taken on 100 of the newcomers, who now account for 25 percent of the student body. **********Although the Government is widely criticized for not doing nearly enough, it has not been sitting on its hands. **********It sponsors arts projects. The Ministry of Absorption, after testing musicians to see who it considers the most gifted, pays wages for a year to a chosen few. The Jewish Agency helps out by paying for instruments, and the Ministry of Education and Culture picks up salaries in some cases after Absorption Ministry money runs out. **********In Jerusalem, the Israel Museum hires newcomers for weekly concerts and special events. Around the country, established orchestras have taken on Soviet players, and new Soviet-only groups have formed in large cities and even in smaller ones like Rehovot, Ranaana and Rishon le Zion, all near Tel Aviv. The uncontestably talented are busy, if not always well paid. **********Still, thousands of unemployed and despairing musicians remain out there, many playing for time on the streets. ""Three or four years ago, we could have helped even the mediocre,"" said Galina Zaltsman, an Absorption Ministry official. ""Now we have to concentrate only on the best. It's a brutal business, but we don't have the resources."" **********And so the frustrations mount, especially among those who know they are far from mediocre. **********Vladimir Bakk says he won prizes through 20 years with the Moscow Philharmonic, but after 21 months here he still has no regular employment and finds his life ""unendurable."" For Mark Mirotin, a 50-year-old conductor from Russia, Israel became so bleak that in January he hanged himself. **********""Russians don't know what it is not to work,"" said Moti Schmit, a Russian-born leader of the Jerusalem Symphony, who came here in 1970. ""They feel like they don't exist. You can see the death in their eyes."" **********Many try teaching. But there were so many taking that route that salaries have dropped to $3 or $4 an hour, so low that one experienced teacher in Jerusalem decided she can make more money as a cleaning woman. **********Even on the street, there is a talent glut, and the competition sometimes gets rough. **********One recent afternoon outside the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv, a native Israeli named Yotam was playing his violin when four Russian trumpet players told him that he was ruining their act. If he showed up there again, they warned, they would kill him. **********Yotam says he decided to take no chances. He got his act together and took it to Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem."

The price for the machine, which will be available in the United States before Christmas, undercuts the price for the competing digital compact cassette machine developed by Philips and Matsushita, to be priced at about $1,050 when it goes on sale in Japan in September. **********In a related announcement, Philips' Polygram division said yesterday that it would sell its digital compact cassettes to music retailers at the same prices as its compact disks when the new system is introduced this fall. Sony said it had not yet released its pricing strategy for its mini-disks, but said yesterday that its prices would be close to those for CD's. **********Industry analysts said the pricing plans were important because they would help determine which of the two technologies gained the quickest acceptance among consumers. Paul Gluckman, managing editor of Audio Week, an industry newsletter, predicted the two formats would get off to a slow start, in part because their head-to-head competition might result in a wait-and-see attitude among many consumers. **********""Both formats may cancel the publicity value of the other,"" he said. **********Each format promises to let consumers make recordings in a digital format that approaches the sound quality of compact disks. But each approach says it offers the consumer different advantages. **********The digital compact cassette is, in effect, a digital version of the conventional audio cassette tape. Matsushita and Philips are promoting the fact that consumers will be able to play existing audio tapes on the newer machines. **********But Sony says its mini-disk will appeal to consumers because it uses increasingly popular compact disk technology. It also allows listeners to quickly skip over tracks they do not want to hear. **********""Both these formats are under the magnifying glass like no other new product,"" Mr. Gluckman said. **********Both systems will enable owners to make recordings of compact disks, although the copies are of somewhat lower quality than those made by digital audio tapes. Digital audio tapes have foundered, however, because record companies have been reluctant to issue digitally recorded tapes, which they feared would lead to widespread pirating. **********Polygram also said that the tenor Luciano Pavarotti, as well as the rock band U2, would be among the first recording artists to have their music released on digital compact cassettes."

Moreover, the rise occurred only in the Midwest, with starts edging down in the South and West and falling 7 percent in the Northeast. **********Still, the figures were seen as further improvement in the only sector besides exports that contributed to the small increase in gross domestic product during the final three months of 1991. **********""The trend is definitely positive,"" commented David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. He noted that while starts remained at less than two-thirds of their recent-year peak of 1.8 million in 1986, the 1991 record was one of steady improvement. Of the last 12 months, starts rose in eight and were steady in two, with declines only in March and September. **********Today's Commerce Department report on permits issued for future construction was solidly positive, up 6 percent with virtually all the improvement in single-family houses, which have more impact than multifamily units on the economy at large. Sizable increases were posted in both the Northeast and the Midwest, while the South eked out a small gain. Permits were essentially unchanged in the West. **********Some builders, it appeared, obtained permits last month that they failed to use, perhaps because of bad weather. **********Although the number of permits issued is a component of the Government's index of leading indicators that tend to move ahead of the economy as a whole, builders frequently start single-family homes in the same month they acquire the needed permits. Multifamily housing, on the other hand, generally requires long-run plans. **********Analysts also pointed to considerable other evidence that housing is increasingly buoyant, aided by sharp reductions in interest rates that moved as low as about 8 1/4 percent for 30-year conventional mortgages before rebounding in recent weeks to about 8 3/4 percent. Ranks of Customers **********Sales of both new and existing homes are taking wing, mortgage applications are climbing similarly, contract cancellation rates have dropped and real estate agents in many parts of the country see swelling ranks of potential customers. **********An agent in the Maryland suburbs of Washington espressed amazement on Sunday about how many for-sale signs had suddenly sprouted in the neighborhood where she was conducting an open house, apparently reflecting a belief that buyers are once again to be found. **********On Tuesday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported in its quarterly survey of real estate trends that housing improved substantially from late October to late January while the market for commercial properties remained depressed. **********""Field reports showing rebounding housing activity outnumbered negative assessments by better than a four-to-one margin,"" William R. Watson, director of the agency's research division, said. The F.D.I.C.'s composite index for both residential and commercial real estate climbed to 60 last month from 57 in October. Large Buildings Gain **********Today's report on housing starts showed single-family starts last month at a pace of 974,000, compared with 965,000 in December while dwellings in two- to four-unit structures eased to 31,000 from 44,000. Large buildings, with five or more dwellings, contained 162,000 new units at an annual rate, up from 97,000 in December and 145,000 in November. **********Geographically, overall starts were at a rate of 459,000 in the South, 324,000 in the Midwest, 250,000 in the West and 134,000 in the Northeast. Permits, which totaled 1,118,000, were 430,000 in the South, 285,000 in the Midwest, 267,000 in the West and 136,000 in the Northeast. **********Actual starts, without seasonal adjustment or annualization, amounted to 72,500 last month, compared with 52,500 in January 1991. **********The department also reported that shipments of mobile homes, which lag a month, rose 3 percent in December to a rate of 176,000. For the year, shipments dropped 9 percent, to 170,900."

David L. Hrdlicka, an Air Force pilot, was shot down in an F-105D over Laos. He walked away from the crash, and into oblivion. **********There is evidence he survived: The Communist Pathet Lao who apparently captured him took pictures. One of them appeared in the Soviet newspaper Pravda in Moscow and a Vietnamese daily in Hanoi; another was later displayed in a Lao museum. His arrest was announced on the radio. The Pathet Lao also broadcast a tape recording purportedly of the American pilot asking for pardon and release. List Presented to Hanoi **********In Washington, Captain Hrdlicka was registered as a prisoner of war, an early entry on a list that would contain hundreds by January 1973, when Hanoi and the Nixon Administration signed a peace agreement. American forces began to withdraw from Vietnam, and prisoners began returning home. **********Captain Hrdlicka was not among the 591 United States servicemen returned by Hanoi in Operation Homecoming. Like Pfc. Jon Sparks, ambushed in central Vietnam; Lieut. Ronald W. Dodge, who ejected from an aircraft over North Vietnam, and dozens of other servicemen and a few civilians in official custody, Captain Hrdlicka became a ""discrepancy case."" **********His name was placed on a selected but by no means comprehensive list of 82 servicemen who inexplicably did not return, to be presented to Hanoi a few months after the Paris peace treaty by Henry A. Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon's national security adviser and later Secretary of State. The Vietnamese never responded to requests for information. **********Now, in the blizzard of documents circulating here as the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs tries to narrow and identify the number of Americans who may have been left behind in Indochina when American forces were withdrawn, that 1973 list, declassified for the first time this week, has become one more piece in a still unfinished puzzle. **********In hearings this week, top officials of the Nixon Administration have sparred over what was known in 1973 about the missing, reflecting confusion and controversy. None of the officials, including Mr. Kissinger, the chief negotiator with the Vietnamese, and two former Secretaries of Defense, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, were able to say categorically that no Americans had been left behind -- or ""kept"" behind by Communist governments, in Mr. Kissinger's preferred terminology. **********What was in dispute is whether anyone could confirm that American prisoners were alive in captivity when United States withdrew. Hanoi had denied access to its prisons to the International Committee of the Red Cross. **********Separate investigations conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Senate Select Committee indicate that there are still between 100 and 200 discrepancy cases awaiting attention by Hanoi or the Laotian Government, nearly 20 years after the Paris peace accord. But the two lists while similar in length -- 133 for the Select Committee, 135 for the Pentagon -- are not the same; only about 40 names appear on both. **********When Operation Homecoming began in early 1973, the United States listed 1,929 servicemen as P.O.W.-M.I.A. Some 1,100 more were classified as K.I.A.-B.N.R. -- killed in action, body not recovered. All people lost in covert operations were apparently on those lists, including 150-200 whose places of death were falsified to hide their presence in Cambodia or Laos, where Americans were not supposed to be. **********Officials of the Nixon Administration have said again and again this week that these figures do not mean there were large numbers -- if any -- of live prisoners identifiable absolutely by name and location when American forces were withdrawn, only that there were a significant number known to have survived a crash or capture. Hanoi has consistently maintained it held no American prisoners after 1973. **********Nearly all officials involved with the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue are certain that no Americans have survived. Many family members believe otherwise. **********Officially, the United States still lists 2,266 Americans as unaccounted for in Indochina, more than half cases of unrecovered bodies. Of the remainder, the Defense Department says Hanoi could help explain at least 80-100 of its 135 extant discrepancy cases. **********What officials are looking for in these cases is not living Americans but explanations of what happened to the people who did not come home. **********Some cases have been closed by Hanoi. The remains of Lieutenant Dodge, whom Vietnamese officials denied knowledge of in 1973, were later returned without explanation. His story has become a symbol of the mysterious behavior of Vietnam on this issue, an attitude that has helped immeasurably to foster beliefs that Americans were killed in contravention of international conventions, consigned to secret prisons or sent to Moscow or Beijing. **********Leo Hrdlicka said in an interview today that he has been given information by former intelligence officials that has led him to believe that his brother David was sent to the Soviet Union, although both Moscow and Hanoi deny this. **********The case of Private Sparks, ambushed with his platoon on June 17, 1969, in what was still South Vietnam, remains under active investigation by the Pentagon. Private Sparks was reported captured; a 1970 letter confirmed this, officials say. The soldier was nevertheless declared dead in 1979 because there had been no new information. It was unexpectedly reopened in 1989 after reports of sightings of an American who fit his profile."

Perkins, the United States representative, challenged the status of the new country before the General Assembly, saying it should be required to apply for membership and be held to the same standards as other applicants. **********Since then, American diplomats have been talking to foreign ministries around the world, urging them to join in challenging the new Yugoslavia's right to replace the old Yugoslavia, not only in the United Nations but also in various international bodies. Most recently, the United States challenged the right of the Federated Republic of Yugoslavia to take part in the Earth Summit. 'Never Happened Before' **********Diplomats said the legal steps to challenge Yugoslavia's membership in the organization were unclear. **********""It's never happened before,"" an official said. One possibility being considered was a review of the rump country's qualifications for membership at the time of the next General Assembly in September. The Security Council's credentials committee routinely examines each member's credentials before the General Assembly opens, the official said. Presumably, Yugoslavia could be asked to reapply at that time. **********If the United Nations accepted the American position on the legitimacy of the new Yugoslavia, that might prompt other organizations like the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Monetary Fund to bar the country as well.

Rexene, a petrochemical company based in Dallas, would use the cash to repay its $403 million of notes outstanding, which went into default last fall. **********Texas Olefins' proposal is the third outside offer received by Rexene since it filed for bankruptcy protection.

In this case, the organisms are a line of fungus called Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizal, or VAM, that attach to the roots of most plants and form silk-like threads. The fungus draws carbon from the plants, but in return its threads act like tiny pipettes that extend the plant's root system and allow it to draw up more nutrients. **********The patent is based on accelerating the invasion of the fungi and is based on research by Dr. Gene Safir, a professor of plant biology. Dr. Safir and his colleagues isolated and synthesized a chemical produced by the host plants that stimulates the fungi to invade and multiply. In effect, Dr. Safir said, the synthetic compound fools the fungus into thinking that a thousand roots are present when there are actually only a few. Rhizotech Inc., a start-up company in Hopewell, N.J., has acquired an option to license the technology from Michigan State. Patents 5,085,682 and 5,002,603 were issued to Dr. Safir and to Muralee Nair, professor of horticulture at Michigan State, and Dr. Jose Siqueira, a soil scientist in Brazil."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/03/business/company-news-new-credit-card-from-ge-to-offer-merchant-coupons.html,Michael Quint,1992-09-03,,672,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,New Credit Card From G.E. To Offer Merchant Coupons,COMPANY NEWS; New Credit Card From G.E. To Offer Merchant Coupons," **********The GE Capital Corporation introduced a new credit card yesterday that offers discount coupons and rebates from 24 large companies, including Kmart, Macy's, Northwest Airlines, Sprint and Hertz. **********At a time when competition in the credit card industry is intensifying as banks reduce interest rates and cut annual fees, GE Capital, a unit of the General Electric Company, and its merchant partners are offering a card that is not as cheap as many others, but which offers sizable benefits to those who use it. **********By offering rebates, the new card, which is a Mastercard called the GE Reward card, is competing with the Discover card of Sears, Roebuck & Company. The Discover card pays card holders a rebate of 1 percent of their purchases once they have charged $1,500 in a year and has no annual fee.  Rates Linked to Prime **********The GE Reward card will have a $25 annual fee and a 25-day grace period in which no interest will be charged on purchases if the previous month's bill was paid in full. The interest rate for charges of most customers will be set at 12.4 percentage points above the prime rate, which is now 6 percent. Customers with the best credit standing will be charged 8.9 percentage points above prime. **********The new card can be used like any Mastercard for purchases at stores or for cash loans at banks or automatic teller machines. It will not replace the existing credit cards at any of the merchants in the program or any of the 65 million credit cards GE Capital processes for more than 300 merchants. Montgomery Ward, the large retailer partly owned by General Electric, is not participating in the program. **********The new GE Capital card offers three kinds of rebates. All customers, regardless of how often they use their cards, will receive every three months a $10 certificate from each of 20 of the merchants in the program good for purchases of their products. **********Another rebate will come from GE Capital, which will issue a $10 check, good at any participating store, for every $500 charged on the card, no matter where the charges occurred. In addition, card holders will receive extra rebates on purchases of General Electric appliances and purchases from three of the affiliated merchants: HBO, Cinemax and Sprint.  Big Customer Base **********Gary C. Wendt, chairman of GE Capital, said the new card would be advertised widely but was not likely to have an expensive national television campaign. **********""The key for us,"" he said, ""is that we already have 65 million credit card accounts and we are a low-cost producer."" The company said it would use direct mail and telephone solicitation to reach customers. **********For the bank financing card holders' purchases, the Monogram Bank subsidiary of G.E., the card is a way to expand at a time when the credit card business is becoming more competitive and new customers are hard to find. The Monogram Bank is already one of the 15 largest issuers of Mastercard and Visa cards. **********For companies offering discounts through GE Reward, the card is a way to stimulate sales and build loyalty. **********Michael Goldstein, head of Toys ""R"" Us Inc., a participant in the program, said that the card ""satisfies the American consumer's desire to buy at a discount."" He noted that the rebate checks to be provided by merchants and GE Capital could be used to buy any item, including those on sale.  Plans for Other Cards **********David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a Santa Monica, Calif., newsletter on the credit card industry, noted that many other merchants and manufacturers were planning links to credit cards. **********He said that later this year the General Motors Corporation would announce a credit card to be issued by the Household Bank that will feature 5 percent discounts on new General Motors cars. He said the GTE Corporation planned to introduce a card issued by the Associates Corporation of North America, a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company."

So it was not clear precisely how the new Israeli attitudes might be put into practice. **********This round of talks is expected to last for a full month, with meetings four days a week. As in the past, Israeli negotiators will meet separately with Syrians, Lebanese and a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians. Upbeat in Briefings **********The Arabs were upbeat in their assessment of today's talks, held at the State Department. This was remarkable because in talks just seven months ago, the Syrians and Israelis used briefings to shower insults on each other. **********After today's meeting, Bushra Kanafani, spokeswoman for the Syrian negotiators, said: ""Our delegation heard today a different tone from the Israeli delegation, a different approach and style, and the atmosphere was reasonable and constructive. The Israeli delegation affirmed that the new Government of Israel is committed to a comprehensive settlement on all fronts."" **********Ms. Kanafani said that use of the word comprehensive was something new. ""Previously,"" she said, ""the word comprehensive was very irritating"" to the Israeli negotiators, but today they used it ""without being pushed."" **********The Jordanian spokesman, Marwan Muasher, gave an equally favorable review of today's talks, including the agenda presented to the Jordanians by the Israelis. ""Both in theme and in spirit,"" he said, ""the agenda did contain some positive developments that were a definite change from the attitudes and the agendas that were presented to us earlier."" **********Ms. Kanafani and Mr. Muasher said they hoped the Israelis' new tone would be translated into more conciliatory Israeli positions, but neither they nor the Israelis would give details of the Israeli proposals. **********The Israelis would not confirm reports that they were willing to discuss territorial concessions in the Golan Heights, taken from Syria in 1967 and annexed by Israel in 1981. United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, adopted in 1967, calls on Israel to trade land for peace. But Israel's last Government, led by Yitzhak Shamir and the right-wing Likud Party, insisted that the resolution did not require return of the Golan Heights. **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took office in July after winning a resounding national victory over the Likud Party in in June. He has redefined Israeli priorities and promised to increase the pace of peace negotiations. **********Ms. Kanafani, the Syrian spokeswoman, explained that when she said the Israelis displayed a different tone and approach today, she meant that they appeared to be ""committed to Resolution 242 as a term of reference for the peace process."" **********""Previously,"" she said, ""we used to struggle and fight so that we will discuss 242. Now the road is paved toward the discussions, and this is a different situation."" **********""We do hope that the reasonable and constructive tone will be translated into reasonable and constructive positions,"" Ms. Kanafani added, ""when we come to the issues of substance."" She cautioned against excessive optimism, but said the Syrians responded to the Israelis ""in the same constructive way they addressed us."" **********Israel's delegation for the talks with Syria has a new chairman: Itamar Rabinovich, a Middle Eastern history scholar known to be more dovish than his predecessor, Yossi Ben-Aharon. **********Ms. Kanafani said, ""Today we were faced with a different tone that indicates seriousness"" among the Israelis. She quoted Mr. Rabinovich as saying: ""Yes, there is a new Government, there is a new policy, and let us sit and talk businesslike, not wasting time."" **********Israel's chief negotiator, Elyakim Rubinstein, met today with Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the head of the Palestinian delegation. But they did not have detailed discussions because some of the Palestinian negotiators were delayed by a dispute with Israel. When they meet on Tuesday, Israeli negotiators are expected to sketch a proposal for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. **********The timetable, as described by Mr. Rabin, could be brisk: agreement by Dec. 1 on logistical arrangements for elections in the occupied territories; agreement by Feb. 1, 1993, on the functions and power of an autonomous Palestinian authority; actual elections in April or May 1993. Proposals for Autonomy **********Under the Israeli proposal, Palestinians would vote for ""an administrative council,"" with control over day-to-day affairs like agriculture, education, transportation, courts and prisons for nonpolitical crimes. But the Palestinians want a 180-member legislative council, or parliament, that would take over virtually all powers now exercised the Israeli military government. **********Today's sessions were the first since James A. Baker 3d stepped down as Secretary of State to become White House chief of staff. **********Mr. Muasher, the Jordanian spokesman, said: ""Secretary Baker will be missed because he had a big role to play in the peace process. We understand, however, that he is going to still be involved in the process and will follow events from his new position as chief of staff."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/26/business/a-clash-between-dell-and-an-analyst.html,Kenneth Gilpin,1992-11-26,,1035,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,A Clash Between Dell and an Analyst,A Clash Between Dell and an Analyst," **********Securities analysts, Wall Street's version of the Fourth Estate, are often cast in an adversarial role with the companies and industries they cover. **********But it is rare that a relationship between an analyst and a company boils over the way the one between David R. Korus and the Dell Computer Corporation has. **********Mr. Korus, a 31-year-old senior vice president and technology analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, startled Wall Street last Friday when he questioned whether Dell's accounting treatment of foreign currency trading had inflated profits earlier this year at the fast-growing computer maker.  Clipping a High Flier **********The negative report, made during a conference call with Kidder's clients, came a day after Dell's stock jumped when the company reported soaring third-quarter sales and profits. Moreover, it came only two weeks before the personal computer maker planned to raise $150 million by selling four million shares of common stock. **********The comment's effect was to knock down Dell's stock price a total of $5 on Friday and Monday in heavy over-the-counter trading. **********The claims were hotly disputed later on Friday by Dell's chairman and chief executive, Michael S. Dell, in a telephone conference call with securities analysts. **********Words were apparently not enough for Dell, however, and on Monday the company said it had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to review trading patterns in its stock from last Thursday on. Dell also said it was contemplating legal action against Mr. Korus and Kidder, Peabody.  Support From His Peers **********Mr. Korus did not return several telephone calls to his office Tuesday and yesterday, seeking comment. **********But colleagues at rival Wall Street firms said yesterday that they found it difficult to believe Mr. Korus did anything wrong. And they added that an analyst's ability to scrutinize a company should not be restrained by the threat of lawsuits. **********""The more cynical we are, the better we perform,"" said Charles R. Wolf, a vice president in equity research at the First Boston Corporation. ""There has to be a healthy degree of cynicism, because very few companies will say they are doing poorly. But you can't live without these companies either. It makes for a very difficult relationship."" **********For its part, Dell, based in Austin, Tex., asserts that Mr. Korus's report, a result of a two-month investigation, bears no resemblance to objective, thorough analysis. Indeed, company officials openly questioned his motives and they are preparing a point-by-point response to the questions he raised. **********""I think the tactics and motives he has displayed are distinctly different from others who follow our company,"" said Donald D. Collis, head of investor relations at Dell. **********Roger Rydell, a public relations manager at Dell, said in a separate interview that Mr. Korus's clients ""include a lot of hedge funds who might not be displeased if the stock went down."" **********Hedge funds often engage in the practice of selling stock ""short"" in the belief that its price will fall. In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares on the hope of replacing them later with shares purchased at a lower price. Considered a Star Analyst **********Investors tend to discount analysts whose opinions do not count. But Mr. Korus, who joined Kidder nine years ago as a research assistant after graduating from the University of Michigan, is one of the firm's stars. His is a voice the Street listens to. **********For the last two years, he has been named to Institutional Investor magazine's All-America analyst team in information technology and personal computers. Many firms give huge bonuses and raises to analysts who make that team. **********In its October issue, Institutional Investor said Mr. Korus was ""aggressive about putting clients into big winners and pulling them out of big losers; he was successful with Compaq in 1991 and with Dell this year."" **********Helen Platt, a Kidder spokeswoman, said Mr. Korus was ""consistently one of the top three analysts in our research department."" **********Despite such acclaim, Kidder was unable to provide either a picture of Mr. Korus or a copy of his resume.  Was Accurate About Compaq **********Last year, when many of his peers were writing glowing reports on Compaq Computer, Mr. Korus was issuing negative reports, saying that the company's personal computers were overpriced relative to the competition and that the earnings of the company would collapse when it did cut prices. **********""He took a strong negative position on Compaq last year initially, and was right, for basically the right reasons,"" said Eugene G. Glazer, a senior vice president and technology analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. **********""I believe he is wrong in his position on Dell, a company we are very bullish on,"" Mr. Glazer said. ""But he did not arrive at his conclusion frivolously."" **********Indeed, Mr. Korus's work is seen by his peers as being encyclopedically thorough. **********""Dave stands out in the group as a real digger,"" said Mr. Wolf, a fellow member of Institutional Investor's All-America team. ""Of all the people in the industry we cover, I think he goes to greater lengths than any in focusing on due diligence.""  Dell Disagrees **********That view is not shared at Dell. **********Mr. Collis said Mr. Korus had ""written very little on Dell,"" and had not talked to the company in more than 18 months before he began to research the report he issued last Friday. **********In fact, when he did begin his research, ""he only talked to us about foreign exchange,"" Mr. Collis said. ""He has not tried to get close to the fundamentals of our business."" **********Mr. Glazer at Dean Witter said he had a ""general recollection"" that Mr. Korus has been less than positive about Dell's prospects for some time. For an analyst searching for evidence to shore up that position, examining Dell's foreign exchange operations made sense, he added. **********No matter how strong the message, however, the power of an analyst's report is usually fleeting. For now at least, the shock waves that Mr. Korus's report sent through the market on Friday and Monday seem to have run their course. Yesterday, Dell's shares rose 75 cents in over-the-counter trading, to $36.25. In the last two days, the stock has recovered by nearly $3 a share, and is not far from its 52-week high of $39.25 -- reached last Thursday, the day before Mr. Korus's controversial phone call."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/02/business/company-news-new-system-lets-computer-identify-pictures-and-images.html,John Holusha,1992-12-02,,785,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,New System Lets Computer Identify Pictures and Images,COMPANY NEWS; New System Lets Computer Identify Pictures and Images," **********New technology that may help solve one of the thorniest problems in computer science -- teaching machines to recognize pictures -- was announced yesterday by officials of the David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J. **********The center, a laboratory owned by SRI International, a research organization based in Menlo Park, Calif., said the new development, which it calls Smart Sensing, would allow the processing of pictures thousands of times faster than existing technology. **********This could lead to such advances as self-guided robots and cars that could recognize obstacles in their path and steer clear of them; security systems in which doors would open only if an authorized person's face was recognized, and the ability to rapidly search through huge libraries of video information. **********To market the technology, Sarnoff, which typically performs research under contract, is taking the unusual step of establishing a commercial spinoff company, called Sensar Inc. Sensar, with temporary headquarters near Sarnoff's Princeton operation, will decide how to package the technology, which includes computer chips and associated software. **********""We are going to make a business out of this,"" said Curtis R. Carlson, vice president in charge of Sarnoff's information systems division. ""It does things on a personal computer that used to require a supercomputer."" **********Takeo Kanade, a professor in Carnegie Mellon University's robotics laboratory, is aware of the Sarnoff technology, which has been under development for more than a decade. He said the Sarnoff work was ""very important."" **********Integrating images with text and numbers is considered vital to the development of multimedia systems, which may eventually merge desktop computers with television sets. But there has been a problem: translating a picture into the 1's and 0's of computer code requires vastly more data than are required for storing words on a computer. While a page of text can be represented by 2,000 to 3,000 bytes of computer data, for example, a single still frame of a color video requires about 750,000 bytes -- or only slightly less information than the entire text of ""Moby Dick."" **********And with full-motion video, where the picture is changing hundreds of times a second, the amount of data escalates enormously. A television station transmits a terabyte, or 1,000 billion bytes, of information each day, Sarnoff researchers said. **********To cope with this flood of information, researchers at Sarnoff, which was the research arm of the RCA Corporation until the General Electric Company acquired RCA in 1986, have devised ways to ignore most of the data. **********""Much like the human visual system, Smart Sensing selectively sorts through vast amounts of information in any visual scene, then isolates key characteristics such as movement, shapes, colors, letters and face patterns,"" the center said in a statement. **********Mr. Carlson said, ""The point is to back away and get perspective -- to look at the forest rather than each of the trees."" A more rudimentary form of the system was first developed for the military to help helicopter crews distinguish incoming missiles from background information, he said. **********Professor Kanade of Carnegie Mellon described the Sarnoff development as particularly important because it would permit rapid searches of picture data bases. But he said some flaws remained in the process. Eliminating Verbal Descriptions **********Currently, devices that employ the power of computers to store video pictures are greatly limited in their ability to sort and retrieve the images. Texts can be found by searching for a few key words, but images must be described in great detail, with a considerable likelihood that the verbal descriptions will miss crucial detail in any one image. **********Sarnoff researchers say their system will enable image-based searches without the need for detailed descriptions that use words. For example, instead of entering a verbal description of a ship when asking a system to look for pictures of ships, the Smart Sensing system would let the computer view the silhouette of a sample ship. It could then be asked to search the data base for similar images of ships. **********But Professor Kanade said such a system would recognize only images of ships at roughly the same orientation as the example. ""If it were to see a bow view of the same ship, it would not recognize it as the same as the side view,"" he said **********Sarnoff officials said they established Sensar as a free-standing subsidiary to speed the commercialization of the computer-vision technology, rather than licensing it or forming a joint venture with a manufacturing company. They said Sensar was still developing its business plan, but that its products would most likely be a part of more complex systems, like self-guided vehicles."

American officials said the Iraqi Air Force was flying patrols today. A senior Pentagon official, who insisted on not being identified, said that there had been Iraqi violations of the flight ban in the southern zone since the MIG was shot down, but that allied planes were not in a position to shoot when they occurred. **********Before the air battle, there had been a gradual reduction of American aircraft in the Persian Gulf region, which may have emboldened the Iraqis to test the American ban on flights south of the 32d parallel in southern Iraq. A carrier had been shifted from the gulf to the coast of Somalia at the request of the United States Central Command, and some Air Force planes had also been withdrawn from the region. **********As a result, American warplanes were not patrolling the skies over Iraq at all times. Iraqi planes may have ventured south of the 32d parallel when American planes were not in the vicinity, according to Iraqi communications intercepted by American intelligence. **********But after Sunday's confrontation, the American military commander who is overseeing enforcement of the flight ban from Riyadh, Maj. Gen. James F. Record of the Air Force, has sought to augment his force, and allied planes are again conducting round-the-clock patrols, according to military officials. **********According to Pentagon officials, a squadron of F-18's and a squadron of F-14's took off from the carrier Kitty Hawk and landed today at the sprawling air base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where the Air Force F-16 and F-15 fighters are based. Each Navy squadron has nine planes. **********Meanwhile, the Kitty Hawk is steaming from the coast of Somalia to the Persian Gulf, carrying other Navy planes. It is expected to reach the gulf by Thursday Eastern time, or Friday Riyadh time, a Pentagon official said. **********The Air Force has sent additional KC-10 tanker planes to Saudi Arabia to help refuel the Navy planes, Pentagon officials said. A Pentagon official said an additional Rivet Joint RC-135 plane that monitor communications and electronic emissions from enemy radars systems had been sent to Saudi Arabia.  No Saudi Acknowledgement **********In deference to the Saudis, who have not acknowledged that American, British and French aircraft are operating from Saudi bases, the deployments of American planes to the Saudi kingdom were not announced. **********The American action came as United Nations officials said they had reached an agreement with Baghdad that would allow the resumption of relief supplies to the Kurds in northern Iraq. Those shipments were suspended when Iraq began pulling United Nations drivers from the relief trucks and blowing up the vehicles. **********Jan Eliasson, the United Nations Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Assistance, said in an interview that he had reached an understanding with Nizar Hamdoun, Iraq's delegate to the organization, under which the United Nations would put armed guards on the trucks. Mr. Eliasson said some arrangements still needed to be worked out but added that he expected the relief supplies to resume in a matter of days. **********The decision to deploy the Navy planes to a land base in Saudi Arabia is highly unusual in terms of military doctrine. Without the spare parts and maintenance equipment on the Kitty Hawk, the Navy planes will be be able to sustain operations for only a short period, said Norman Polmar, an expert on naval forces. **********A Pentagon official familiar with the classified reports of Sunday's air battle offered new details of the engagement. He said the the American F-16 had shot at the Iraqi plane at range of three miles, adding that the engagement took place at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Afterward, the pilots observed smoke rising from the wreckage of the MIG-25. **********The F-16's use of the Amraam radar-guided missile, also known at the AIM-120, was a first.

Japanese officials have given New Delhi similar warnings. Indian publications say Russia has also told India to rethink its opposition to arms control.  An Area of Danger **********India's reluctance to sign the 1968 treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons has given neighboring Pakistan a longstanding excuse to refuse also, making South Asia the last major area where there is no prospect for progress in nuclear arms control. **********Pakistan, which is now under an American aid embargo because of its nuclear program, acknowledged last week for the first time that it is capable of producing bombs. India set off a nuclear explosion in 1974 and is thought by arms experts to have produced enough plutonium in unsafeguarded reactors for 100 to 200 weapons. **********Both India's nuclear program and concern over human-rights violations in India, are likely to be raised in Congress this year. They are already being discussed in British and European Parliamentary committees. India's hopes for aid and investment could be affected, European diplomats say. **********Stephen Philip Cohen, co-director of the University of Illinois program in arms control and international security, and a former member of the State Department's policy planning staff, advocates linking India's request for a permanent seat on an expanded United Nations Security Council with greater cooperation on nuclear controls. Regional Talks Sought **********Since last June, Pakistan and the United States have been trying to manuever India into agreeing to regional talks on nuclear weapons. When Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, with American backing, first proposed a five-nation conference involving his own country, India, China and what was then the Soviet Union, India rejected the idea with scorn. But second thoughts followed, as prominent Indians began to ask if an uncooperative attitude at this juncture might not be damaging to Indian interests. **********""At least they are listening now,"" a senior Bush Administration offficial said recently, acknowledging that India's new isolation in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union was beginning to be felt in New Delhi. **********Another Administration official said the strongest argument for pressing India now was that New Delhi was out of line in an age of ""competitive disarmament,"" when former Soviet republics were abandoning arsenals and nations like North Korea and Argentina were signing inspection agreements. China also says it will sign the accord on the spread of nuclear arms. **********""We have the best chance we've ever had to move the Indians, and moving the Indians is indispensible to progress on proliferation,"" said Gary Milhollin, a University of Wisconsin law professor and director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.  Diversion Through Romania **********It took more than five years of investigations, and the collapse of the Ceausescu Government in Romania, for Norway to find what it considers indisputable evidence that Romania diverted to India about 14 tons of heavy water, a spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry said Monday. **********""For the first time we have solid proof -- real evidence -- because we have been allowed to investigate directly in Romania in the Ceausescu archives with the help of the Romanian police,"" Bjorn Blokhus, the spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Oslo. ""The findings are quite impressive. The documents show that the destination was India, and the address to which the shipment was sent."" **********Last week, Norway confronted the Indians with its new evidence, Mr. Blokhus said. **********""We sent them the material and asked for comments from them,"" he said. On Friday, India at first said it had never received shipments of Norwegian heavy water, but later agreed to examine the Norwegian documents. **********The 1986 shipment was the second the Norwegians say was sent to India in defiance of Norwegian agreements. The first, diverted through a German company in 1983, involved about 17 tons of heavy water. **********Experts say that the two shipments diverted from Norway were only part of the substantial tonnage of heavy water India bought ""under the table"" in the 1980's, much of it from China and the Soviet Union. Moscow also openly sold safeguarded heavy water to India, which apparently went to reactors that are open to inspection. **********""India had made well over a ton of unsafeguarded plutonium by 1990,"" Mr. Milhollin said in an interview Monday."

While the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced at midday today that a basic agreement had been reached, American officials were not yet confirming that. There was still considerable contention over the wording of the final agreement, and many key details have not yet been disclosed. Unimpressed Executives **********The auto executives who accompanied Mr. Bush have been unimpressed by a blitz of concessions and new import-purchase plans announced in recent days and they spent much of Wednesday warning the Japanese that failing to lower the trade deficit quickly would bring a hail of protectionist legislation from Congress. **********But the Japanese, speaking in direct tones that seemed as unusual on the streets of Tokyo as the official convoy of American-made limousines and Jeeps rolling through the city, argued that General Motors, Ford and Chrysler must fundamentally rethink the way they design and build cars. Most important, they must invest heavily in the Japanese market -- catering to Japanese consumers, even if that means opening plants here while they close them at home. **********Japan has reportedly offered to buy about $19 billion in auto parts in the 1994 fiscal year, more than double this year's level. And Japanese car makers said they would try to sell about 19,000 cars made by the Big Three. While this would more than double sales, it is equivalent to only about four days of Japanese exports to the United States. **********Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said, ""there are several areas of agreement, and several areas still being discussed,"" and he referred to the talks as ""hard-fought battles."" **********Some American executives expressed exasperation. ""The words 'patience' and 'we have to study' have run their course,"" said Maurice R. Greenberg, the chairman of American International Group, a New York-based insurance company. **********The official negotiations have been devoted almost exclusively to the auto issues, but trade in computers, paper, glass and other products has come up. **********Tokyo itself is full of symbolic gestures, from the Pontiac Grand Am that has replaced a Nissan in the lobby of Narita airport, to Barbara Bush hugging a red General Motors sports car at the Mitsukoshi department store. **********""Isn't it beautiful?"" Mrs. Bush said. ""I'd feel very young in this."" **********Symbolism aside, though, the Japanese and the American auto makers seem unable to move beyond the basic chicken-and-egg problem. **********Repeatedly Wednesday, the American auto makers said they would not invest heavily here until the market was more open and their sales rose sharply. The Japanese say sales will not rise until the Americans spend heavily on distribution networks and factories. **********Yet none of the Big Three said that they planned to build in Japan the kind of plants the Japanese have built in the United States, even with the new tax incentives and other programs that Japan has announced. **********""It would be nice to have factories here,"" Lee A. Iaccoca, the head of the Chrysler Corporation, said on Wednesday before a lunch with top officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. ""But you go where you are wanted."" He said he had no plans for big new Japanese operations. **********The chairman of General Motors, Robert Stempel, who the previous night had harshly criticized Japan's closed distribution system, on Wednesday dismissed the idea of following the lead of Mercedes-Benz and BMW and building marketing outlets here soon. **********As the day wore on, it was clear that nerves on both sides were growing frayed. At the luncheon, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher dispensed with bland toasts to tell his hosts that their assurances that the market was opening were not enough. **********""We need specific results,"" someone at the luncheon, which was closed to the press, quoted Mr. Mosbacher as saying. ""And we need them now."" **********The Japanese seemed to enjoy noting that the Americans, while professing to be ardent advocates of free trade, were seeking guaranteed market shares and purchasing commitments. **********""We operate on the principle of a free market,"" Noboru Hatakeyama, the Deputy Minister of International Trade and Industry who is heading the auto talks for Japan, told reporters. But Japan was being asked, he said, to come up with ""concrete figures"" for sales with no regard to consumer demand. ""Isn't that the same thing as managed trade?"" he asked. Auto Makers' Proposals **********The most specific proposals on Wednesday came not from the Government but from the Japanese auto makers themselves. Toyota, for example, increased its target for American car parts, saying that it would buy $4.6 billion of American components in the fiscal year beginning in April 1994, including $1 billion in imports to its Japanese plants. In the last fiscal year it bought $2.6 billion in American-made parts."

Wade Jr., conceded under Mr. Cook's fierce cross-examination that during a two-and-a-half year inquiry involving dozens of lawyers and agents, no one ever searched the bank's headquarters in Rome, requested the minutes of the bank's board meetings where all high-level decisions were made or even visited Rome to interview key witnesses there. Instead, Mr. Wade said, Federal investigators in Atlanta were prevented by the Justice Department in Washington from traveling to Rome and Istanbul to pursue leads in the investigation. **********In pressing his case in a sentencing hearing this week, Mr. Cook used classified documents from the State Department and the Federal Reserve Bank to show that during the same period, the Italian Government was lobbying Washington to play down the Rome bank's possible involvement in the complicated bank fraud, one of the bigest in American history. **********Mr. Cook is trying to refute the Government's contention that his client, Christopher P. Drogoul, the 43-year-old former manager of the bank's Atlanta ofice, made the loans on his own in exchange for $2.5 million in bribes. **********In defending the Government's investigation, Gerrilyn Brill, the Acting United States Attorney, objected to Mr. Cook's line of questioning, reminding the judge that this was not a trial, but a sentencing hearing. **********""The Government is not on trial here,"" she said. ""Our investigation is not on trial here."" **********She reminded that judge that Mr. Drogoul could have chosen to go to trial to defend himself but instead pled guilty to charges that he defrauded the Rome bank. **********But United States District Court Judge Marvin Shoob, who is poised to sentence Mr. Drogoul next week, today gave his first public indication that he may be swayed by Mr. Cook's arguments. He said he might be lenient if the lawyer can convince him that the United States Government and bank officials in Rome knew about the scheme and did nothing about it. Displeasure With Washington **********His position today contrasted with a statement he made in a hearing in July in which he said that he could be lenient only if Mr. Drogoul had fully cooperated with Government investigators. **********Such a move by the judge is the strongest signal he could send to Washington registering his displeasure with the way the Government has handled the case. He has expressed disappointed that the Justice Department did not recommend the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate possible criminality by the Bush Administration in its conduct of the Iraq policy. **********From the time Federal investigators raided the Atlanta bank in August 1989 until Mr. Drogoul, two other local bank employees and four senior Iraqi officials were indicted in February 1991, the scandal was a major irritant in relations between Washington and Rome. The Rome bank is almost wholly owned by the Italian Government and its top directors are political appointees who enjoy the status of senior Government officials. **********When the bank scandal broke, the bank's management was unwilling to let American investigators rifle through records at the bank headquarters, which is coincidentally across the street from the American Embassy on the Via Veneto. Instead, the Italians cooperated with the investigation by allowing bank officials to travel to Atlanta for questioning and to send prosecutors the documents they requested. **********The United States Attorney's office in Atlanta asked in January 1990 to travel to Rome and Istanbul to pursue the case, according to its letter to the Justice Department, but ""a planned trip to Italy by criminal investigators was put off because of BNL asserted concerns regarding the Italian press,"" according to a Federal Reserve Bank memo the next month read by Mr. Cook. Another Fed memo that month said the trip to Turkey ""was put off at the request"" of Dick Thornburgh, who was then Attorney General."

Wright, the network's president, told a group of investment counselors on Friday. **********Changes in the television business climate -- including the high cost of sports rights fees and the advertising slump -- will make it very unprofitable to be the No. 1 network through 1993, Mr. Wright said in a speech to the Private Placement Conference in New York. NBC had been the highest-rated network for six straight years. **********Mr. Wright implied that a top-rated network was likely to face continuing losses until its current contracts with the most important sports rights holders, including Major League Baseball and the National Football League, expired next year. Ascension of CBS **********All three networks agree that CBS will replace NBC as the highest-rated network this television season, largely because of strong ratings for its sports programs, including the World Series, the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics. **********CBS spent about $2.2 billion for the rights to these sporting events. But those high prices are the primary reason that CBS is expected to report losses of more than $400 million for 1991. **********Mr. Wright has said NBC will also report an unspecified loss for 1991, though far less than CBS's. Analysts have estimated NBC's loss at $50 million to $60 million. NBC's biggest losses have come from its four-year N.F.L. contract, for which the network paid more than $700 million. It also paid more than $400 million for the rights to the Summer Olympics. A Simple Message **********Joseph Rutledge, the vice president of corporate communications for NBC, said Mr. Wright's message to the investment group was simple: **********""He said that the business is decidedly different from what it was 20 years ago. The high costs of sports rights fees means that during this period being No. 1 means losing an enormous amount of money."" **********Mr. Rutledge said Mr. Wright had pointed out to the investment group that ""those CBS 'We're No. 1' buttons will bring them several hundred million dollars in losses over the next couple of years."" **********CBS executives have said the network's ascension from third place to first in the ratings has been an enormously significant achievement that will bring the network financial success in the near future. Opposite Position **********Mr. Wright's position is just the opposite, Mr. Rutledge said. The NBC president's message to the investors, Mr. Rutledge said, was that ""in this environment, we'd prefer to make money even if that means coming in further back in the pack."" **********Mr. Rutledge added, ""Bob said that you've simply got to be smart enough to recognize that, at least for these few years, the smart position is not necessarily No. 1, but wherever you need to be to make money."" **********Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, told reporters at a news conference in Los Angeles earlier this month that the network was unlikely to bid on Major League Baseball in 1993 unless the price came down significantly and that NBC ""won't be in football"" unless the next N.F.L. contract is ""risk free"" for the network. **********The four-year baseball rights alone cost CBS about $1 billion, and NBC, CBS and ABC spent a total of more than $2.5 billion for the N.F.L. rights. Cutting Costs in Sports **********Mr. Ebersol said that his sports division was making a profit on its contract with the National Basketball Association, but that it was still losing money even though it had cut as many other costs as possible. **********""We've gone from 186 employees in sports three years ago down to 112,"" he said. ""But the bottom line is 91 percent of our costs are sports rights. If they don't come down, we get out."""

The ads, which begin running today, appear as Elle's chief competitors, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, are cranking up their own hoopla machinery. **********Vogue, a Conde Nast publication, is commemorating its 100th anniversary with a special April issue. Harper's Bazaar, published by Hearst Magazines, is bringing in a new editor in chief as well as planning to mark its 125th anniversary later this year. At age 3, Mirabella, the fourth magazine in the crowded, contentious field, is too young for an anniversary party, but is celebrating winning a National Magazine Award last week for general excellence. **********""We would raise our voice even if the noise were not out there,"" Gail S. Stone, Elle's vice president and publisher of almost five months, said in an interview last week at Hachette's office in midtown Manhattan. ""We have a lot to say."" **********Among the points Ms. Stone is seeking to impress upon the advertising community about the French magazine's American edition are its circulation strength -- the rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, recently rose 6.1 percent, to 875,000 -- and its ability to attract advertisers in categories like automobiles, liquor and food. **********David Pecker, president and chief operating officer at Hachette, said the $2 million to be spent on Elle in the next nine months was the most ever devoted to a single Hachette magazine campaign. **********The 15 ads and posters are the creation of the mischievous minds at Lois U.S.A. The three-word theme typifies the agency's penchant for short, snappy, somewhat unsophisticated slogans for media clients: ""Make time for Time"" for Time magazine; ""In your face"" for ESPN, the sports cable television network, and ""I want my MTV"" for that music video cable network. **********""You want people not only to remember it, but to have fun with it,"" said George Lois, the agency's chairman and chief executive in New York. ""You can get away with 'Go to Elle' because it's a French, sassy, hip magazine. I don't think you could do anything that naughty for Mirabella or Vogue."" **********Ms. Stone agreed. ""Most successful advertising is somewhat tongue-in-cheek,"" she said. ""So when Lois came up with the idea, we thought it was right on target. We want everybody to 'go to Elle' with their advertising."" **********To achieve that goal, the campaign involves advertisers in an unusual manner. Companies that already buy ad pages in Elle, like the makers of Nike athletic footwear and Guess jeans, are lending Lois images from their own advertisements. **********For instance, one Elle ad uses a photograph from a Guess ad, featuring a Marilyn Monroe look-alike; the headline reads, ""Guess who went to Elle."" Another reprints six Absolut vodka ads, created by TBWA Advertising in New York, with the headline ""One more . . . for the Absolut Elle of it!"" **********Like the other fashion magazines, Elle's advertising sales have suffered during the recession. Last year, ad pages fell 23.3 percent from 1990, the second-largest decline in the category after a 26.3 percent plunge at Harper's Bazaar. And for the first six months of this year -- Elle's issues are closed through June -- ad pages dropped 14 percent from the comparable period in 1991, Ms. Stone said. **********The print ads are scheduled to run in publications like Advertising Age, The Chicago Tribune, Inside Media, The New York Times, W and The Wall Street Journal. Beginning next month, the posters will appear on bus shelters and telephone kiosks and at airports and newsstands."

A Philips spokesman said the move would not result in any additional one-time charges against earnings. About 480 of the jobs will be cut in Montreal, where Philips plans to curtail production of PC's. The rest will be in plants and offices in the Netherlands.

In the last year the United Nations has dispatched substantial forces to Cambodia and the Balkans, and a peacekeeping mission in Mozambique would raise to 13 the number of such operations under way. **********In a report to the Security Council, the Secretary General recommended that ""very substantial resources"" should be made available, ""especially on the military side,"" to help Mozambique carry out an agreement ending 14 years of civil war. President Joaquim Chissano's Government negotiated the accord last fall with the Renamo resistance movement. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali gave no estimate of the cost of the force, which he recommended should have 7,000 soldiers and more than 1,200 civilian electoral and administrative officers. But officials said the cost would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. **********The force would also increase the number of deployed United Nations troops, from more than 50,000 to 60,000, and increase the annual peacekeeping budget, which is expected to total $2.6 billion this year. That sum is almost a third of all the money the United Nations has spent on peacekeeping since 1948. **********A Mozambique operation thus seems certain to worsen the financial crisis that the United Nations is facing because of the continuing refusals of many countries, including the United States and Russia, to pay their full shares of its costs. At the end of last month member countries owed a total of $642.5 million in unpaid dues for past and present peacekeeping operations, with the United States $290 million in the red and the Russian federation $115.4 million. Adding arrears to the regular budget, the United Nations is owed $1.2 billion by its members, with the United States and the Russian federation at $410 million each. Protection of Corridors **********The Mozambique force would oversee the demobilization of the armed forces of both factions, the organization of free and fair elections and the eventual formation of an army that would include soldiers from both factions. The force would also take over the protection of the four vital transportation corridors across Mozambique to landlocked countries in Central Africa.  Malawian and Zimbabwean troops now guard the routes. **********Officially, the elections are supposed to be held within a year of the signing of the accord last October. But Mr. Boutros-Ghali made clear today that he would not proceed until both sides had fully complied with the military aspects of the accord and could not thus challenge the outcome with force."

American officials reason that better antitrust enforcement will reduce collusive relationships among Japanese companies that tend to exclude foreigners, allowing all companies to compete on their merits. That could provide a more general approach to opening Japan's market, rather than hammering away at restrictions industry by industry. Threat of Prosecution **********To that end, the Justice Department said in the spring that it would consider prosecuting foreign companies for practices that hurt American exporters. While the Justice Department insisted it was not aiming at any particular country, the announcement sent a wave of fear through Japanese businesses. **********The United States is also pressing the Japanese Government to strengthen its own antitrust regulations and to energize its Fair Trade Commission, the historically weak agency that is charged with enforcing laws on business competition. **********At the request of the United States, for instance, the commission is surveying the practices of four industries that Washington thinks should be more open to foreign imports -- paper, glass, automobiles and auto parts. **********The effort to get Japan to change its own regulations on competition is part of the Structural Impediments Initiative, a continuing process in which Japan and the United States are telling each other how to reform their economies. Negotiators for the two nations are meeting in Tokyo this week to review the progress of the program. **********In some ways, the antitrust issue is an illustration of the difficulties the program might have in bringing about fundamental change in Japan.  Many experts, both here and in the United States, say Washington expects too much from its antitrust strategy. For one thing, they say the Fair Trade Commission will never turn from a lamb into a lion that is able to challenge established business practices. **********In addition, they say some of the practices that American companies complain about -- like the interlocking relationships between Japanese manufacturers and their suppliers, known as keiretsu -- are probably legal anyway. If a company like Toyota wants to buy parts from a trusted supplier, even if it means forsaking a less expensive foreign supplier, that is Toyota's prerogative. **********""Most of the difficulties that foreign companies are encountering in Japan are not really a violation of anti-monopoly law,"" said Mitsuo Matsushita, a professor of law at the University of Tokyo. Doubts on Strategy **********Some experts go even further and say the strategy could backfire and make life harder for American companies here. **********""If you strengthen Japanese antitrust enforcement, theoretically at least, you're making the market even more competitive,"" said John O. Haley, professor of law and East Asian studies at the University of Washington. **********In industries like automobiles and electronics, he said, the problem for American companies is not monopolistic practices but the intense competition among Japanese companies, which makes those companies extremely efficient. Clamping down on price-fixing, as in the case of the food-wrap manufacturers, will only lead to lower prices, making it harder for foreign companies to enter the market, he said. **********American officials acknowledge that no American company is likely to benefit directly from successful prosecution of the food-wrap case. But they hope the trial will send a signal to companies engaged in other collusive practices. **********Executives complain, for instance, that manufacturers often put pressure on their distributors not to carry products made by other manufacturers, which makes it hard for foreign companies to break into the market. A Glass Maker's Complaint **********""We cannot just go to a glass distributor in Japan and say, 'We can offer you a high-quality product at a lower price,' "" said Peter Young, director of international business for Guardian Industries, a glass manufacturer in Northville, Mich. ""They won't even talk to us."" **********Depending on the situation, such tactics by manufacturers could be antitrust violations. Bid-rigging on public-works projects, which many American executives say is common in Japan, is another potential violation. **********As an example of what they hope to see, American officials point to an action taken by the Fair Trade Commission in the early 1980's to break up a Japanese cartel that controlled the imports of soda ash, which is used in making glass. Since then, the American share of Japan's soda ash market has risen to more than 20 percent from 2 percent. **********Forged during the American occupation after World War II, Japan's basic anti-monopoly law is similar in principle to American antitrust law. But a tradition of strong antitrust enforcement has been lacking. Lawsuits Rarely Succeed **********Only once, for instance, has a private lawsuit succeeded under the anti-monopoly law, and even that decision is being appealed, Professor Matsushita of Tokyo University said. **********There are also numerous exemptions to the basic law: more than 200 cartels are legal, and the businessses in them, like beauty salons and barbershops, can agree among themselves on minimum prices. Retailers are prohibited from discounting books, compact disks and some drugs and cosmetics. And, severe restrictions have been placed on the ability of companies to offer discount coupons, contests and prizes. **********Even when there are no legal exceptions, enforcement and fines have been weak and collusion quietly accepted. The maximum penalty for a criminal antitrust violation is about $40,000 here, compared with $10 million in the United States. **********In the food-wrap case, for instance, the eight defendants do not deny that they collaborated to raise prices. Rather, some of the companies are complaining that they have been unfairly singled out for prosecution as a gesture to the United States. **********""The companies involved can't help but think, 'Why only us?',"" an attorney for one of the defendants said in an interview. He reeled off several industries -- cement, construction, printing ink -- in which violations appeared to be more serious but which were settled through administrative penalties, without criminal charges. A Special Industry **********Some Americans agree that the food-wrap manufacturers were an easy target compared with the construction industry, which is a major contributor to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. ""Anytime the Fair Trade Commission treads on someone powerful, they get trampled on and beaten back,"" said a former American trade negotiator. **********That was shown recently in the case of 66 construction companies in Saitama Prefecture, near Tokyo, which met in what was called the Saturday Club to apportion bids among themselves. The trade commission said it would have been too difficult under Japanese law to file criminal charges. Instead, the companies were forbidden to bid on projects for a month and were required to have all their employees -- more than 100,000 people in all -- sign pledges that they would not violate the law in the future. **********Makoto Kurita, a Fair Trade Commission official, said the agency had taken significant steps since the United States began asking three years ago for such measures as part of the Structural Impediments Initiative. **********The number of enforcement actions has risen to 30 in 1991 from 7 in 1989, administrative penalties for participating in cartels have been raised and rules have been issued concerning the relationships between manufacturers and distributors. Further steps are planned to raise criminal penalties and to phase out the legal cartels."

Perhaps the most notorious is a two-page ad from 1989 showing a white infant nursing at a black woman's breast. Though that ad appeared in Europe, it did not run in American publications because of concerns over how it might be interpreted. (Those concerns are still prevalent; the ad will run only in issues of Rolling Stone sent to subscribers, while copies sold on newsstands will carry another ad in its place.) **********Running throughout the section is an essay written by the filmmaker Spike Lee, on whose behalf Benetton donated $50,000 to the United Negro College Fund Malcolm X Scholarship.

New Generation of Jumbos **********A four-engine plane with double-deck seating would resemble Boeing's 747 more than the tri-jet design of McDonnell Douglas's current MD-11 jumbo jet. It is unclear whether the new design would be more expensive to develop and build than the previously announced tri-jet design. **********A larger plane could give McDonnell Douglas a headstart in the design and manufacture of an expected new generation of super-jumbo planes that would be able to carry 600 passengers or more on long flights. Both Boeing and Airbus are exploring super-jumbo projects. **********A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, John Thom, said late Friday that the company was discussing a number of alternative designs with potential customers for the MD-12. He declined to identify the alternative designs. He said a final decision on the design could be made within the next month or two. **********""We have said we are looking at alternatives, and we have talked to potential airline customers to get their input,"" Mr. Thom said. ""We are still looking at the alternatives."" **********Choosing a design for the MD-12 that would be competitive with Boeing and Airbus in the late 1990's and serve as the basis for the design of the new super-jumbos is essential for McDonnell Douglas's survival. McDonnell Douglas, long the No. 2 to Boeing in commercial aircraft, has been overtaken in recent years by Airbus Industrie, which receives financial help from the Governments of France, Germany, Britain and Spain. **********Word of the possible new design comes at a time when McDonnell Douglas is already working to hold together a proposed deal to sell 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation for $2 billion. The deal was structured to allow McDonnell Douglas to pay off some debt and finance development of the MD-12, which is expected to cost $4 billion. **********But there has been political opposition to the deal both in Taiwan and in the United States, and Taiwan Aerospace, which is partly owned by the Government of Taiwan, said recently that it might buy only 25 percent of the McDonnell Douglas operation. McDonnell Douglas has been talking to aerospace companies in other Asian nations to sell as much as 49 percent of its jetliner business, which is based in Long Beach, Calif. **********A four-engine MD-12 would probably be more costly for airlines to operate than a three-engine plane because it would burn more fuel. But it could have the advantage of greater range and greater capacity. Subcontract Awarded **********McDonnell Douglas has not formally made a decision to build the MD-12, saying it is still gauging the interest of airlines. But the company has given every indication that a decision should come soon. Earlier this month, it conditionally awarded the first subcontract on the MD-12 to Parker Bertea, a small California company that helps make flaps and other control surfaces for the plane. **********McDonnell Douglas is also in the final stages of choosing a site for the final assembly of the MD-12. It will select among nine cities in the United States. The company has ruled out building the plane in Long Beach, where it currently makes the MD-11 and the MD-80 jetliners and the Air Force's C-17 transport."

""In this way I understand our assistance to your country on its path to Europe."" **********President Havel, responding at a news conference, said politely that ""as quickly as Czechoslovakia is able to open to Europe, and as quickly as we are able to adjust our legal system to Europe, in that measure will it become possible for any European, Germans included, if they want to live in our country, work in our country, and invest here, to come here."" **********For much of last year, both countries were pushing hard for a formal treaty that would set relations on a friendly footing. After the war, Germans who for generations inhabited the Sudetenland region of western Czechoslovakia were forcibly expelled, and their property seized and much of it nationalized when the Communists came to power here in 1948. **********On Wednesday, the chairman of the League of Expelled Sudeten Germans, Franz Neubauer, accused Prague of ""systematically auctioning off"" former German property to Czechs and Slovaks as part of its campaign to privatize businesses and property. **********The issue is sensitive for Mr. Kohl because descendants of the Sudeten Germans live in large numbers in south German states like Baden-Wurttemberg, where the Chancellor's Christian Democratic Party faces an uphill struggle in elections this spring."

""One thing that's important in these results is that fixed expenses look pretty good,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential Securities. Those expenses that did jump in the period were in areas that brokerage firms can quickly cut if times get bad, Mr. Eckenfelder pointed out. Merrill Lynch & Company, for example, increased advertising and market development spending by 36 percent, ""but if business slows down, you can pull back on that,"" he said. **********The firms are making long-term bets on the retail brokerage business, analysts said. ""There was an important comment from all the companies, which is that they seem to be actively recruiting retail brokers,"" said John Keefe of Keefe Worldwide Information Services. ""It's money well spent because the long-term prospects are very solid for the retail business."" **********Charles Vincent of Provident National Bank in Philadelphia said that Merrill and the competition stood to gain from demographic trends. ""The population is getting older, and when they get older, they get concerned about kids' education and retirement,"" he said. ""They're gonna turn more and more to sophisticated providers of investment services."" **********Retail brokers may not reap the gains in the area they have most chosen as a target, however, Mr. Keefe said. ""Paine Webber and Merrill talked about wrap fee accounts as sort of the salvation of the industry, and I'm yet to be sold on it,"" he said, referring to retail accounts that are charged a single fee each year for all their brokerage services. Mr. Keefe said it might turn out that while brokerage houses indeed profited from individual investors' increasing needs for investment advice, those investors might not opt for expensive wrap accounts to the degree the firms are hoping. **********Analysts were not rushing to recommend brokerage firm stocks despite the day's favorable news. As a group, brokerage stocks soared 109 percent in 1991, said Perrin Long of the First of Michigan Corporation. Despite a 15 percent pullback in prices earlier this year, the stocks do not yet look attractive to short-term investors, he said. **********More patient long-term holders of brokerage shares might not be taking on as much risk, though, Mr. Long and others said. ""The fact there was an upward bias in their stock prices today suggests there aren't a lot of sellers out there,"" Mr. Eckenfelder said. Indeed, investors bid up brokerage firm shares along with those of the overall market. Merrill Lynch & Company posted an 87.5-cent gain, to $52.375; Paine Webber rose 25 cents, to $22.375, and the Primerica Corporation, parent of Smith Barney & Company, was up $1.75, to $40.875. **********Following are the details of the companies' earnings results: Merrill Lynch **********Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, said that earnings rose 23.5 percent, to a record $227.7 million, or $1.98 a share, in the quarter ended June 30, up from $184.3 million, or $1.58 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenues were up 10 percent, the brokerage firm said, aided by a 27 percent increase in investment banking business. Paine Webber **********Paine Webber said profits were up 35.5 percent in the second quarter, helped by a large increase in its market share in government, mortgage and corporate bond business. Its asset management business was also a key factor; revenues there gained 21 percent over the second quarter of 1991. In all, the company earned $45.8 million, or 93 cents a share, in the second quarter, up from $33.8 million, or 70 cents a share, in the 1991 period. Primerica **********Primerica said earnings had risen 28.3 percent, to $1.36 a share, in the second quarter, and cited a 15 percent increase in investment banking revenues as a factor in the gains. Like Paine Webber, Smith Barney enjoyed a healthy increase in fees from asset management in the period. Primerica's $150.5 million in earnings were up from $117.3 million in the second quarter of 1991. Its Smith Barney brokerage arm enjoyed after-tax income of $42.4 million, up 13 percent from 1991's $37.4 million."

The implication, which could not be confirmed today, was they had agreed to oust the company's board, including the chairman, Peter Laister, who only took office on Dec. 3. **********Details were sketchy since only sections of the accord were discussed here in court and no copy was made public. But according to those sections, the only board member who would retain any significant power at Maxwell Communication would apparently be David Shaffer. And even he would retain power only over subsidiaries, not the parent. **********An American, Mr. Shaffer is managing director of Maxwell Communication and president of its American book publishing subsidiary, Macmillan Inc. The United States examiner and British administrators have agreed to retain him at the helm of the two main American subsidiaries, Macmillan and Official Airline Guides. **********In an interview, Simon Scott, a spokesman for the British administrators, confirmed that this interpretation of the accord was accurate. ""We're pleased with the accord,"" he said. **********The English judge approved the pact drawn up by Richard Gitlin, the United States examiner, and the British administrators appointed from the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. But the deal still requires the approval of Tina Brozman, the United States bankruptcy judge. It is expected to be presented to her on Friday. **********It was unclear today whether Maxwell Communication's board would try to challenge the accord. Attempts to obtain a response were unsuccessful. **********In a surprise move on Dec. 16 that angered Maxwell Communication's bankers, the company's board took the highly unusual step of filing in New York for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The board argued that it was entitled to do so because even though the company was incorporated in Britain, the vast majority of its assets were in the United States. **********Maxwell Communication later applied for the British equivalent of bankruptcy protection here, but stressed that the filing was subordinate to the one in the United States. **********The bankruptcy filing stemmed from the collapse of the global Maxwell publishing empire after Robert Maxwell died on Nov. 5. Mr. Maxwell is estimated to have drained at least $1.4 billion from Maxwell Communication, Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. and company pension funds in an attempt to rescue his private companies. **********One of the British administrators later said he thought Maxwell Communication was the first British company to have filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. The board's motive was to retain control of Maxwell Communication and thus have a bigger say in the creation of a plan to pay off creditors and bring the company out of bankruptcy. Mr. Laister and Mr. Shaffer said the board also felt that United States law would give it a better chance of keeping most of the company intact. **********Under British law, the court-appointed administrators have almost total say over running a bankrupt company and deciding whether to keep or sell assets. Creditors also typically have more influence than they would under Chapter 11. **********Of the more than $:1.5 billion, or $2.8 billion, owed to all creditors, 43 banks are owed about $:1.24 billion, or roughly $2.3 billion."

Smiles on Refugees' Faces **********In the Skenderija sports hall, where medal ceremonies were held for the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, officials of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees worked with local relief agencies to distribute French military ration packs to about 1,500 Muslim refugees. **********Trucks also delivered eight tons of long-life milk and medical supplies to the Kosevo hospital complex, where many of the sick and wounded from the three-month siege are being treated. **********The smiles on the faces of the refugees were a testament to the relief felt around the city at the breakthrough achieved by the United Nations officials in taking control of Sarajevo airport from Serbian nationalist forces. **********But after the four French military aircraft that flew in on Monday and Tuesday, there were no new relief flights today and only a trickle of flights, at best, was expected before security arrangements at the airport are improved, possibly this weekend. **********The United Nations military force at the Butmir airfield on the southwest outskirts of Sarajevo needs to be built up to the point where a credible defense can be mounted against possible attempts to disrupt the airlift. **********Today, the skeleton crew of about 30 officers and technical personnel who took over the airport on Monday were strengthened by the arrival of nearly 170 French marines, 120 of them on four French military planes and nearly 50 others in the United Nations weekly overland convoy from Belgrade, the Serbian capital. **********Full control of the airport and its perimeter will only be possible when an 850-member Canadian armored battalion arrives from Croatia, where the battalion was involved in a separate United Nations peacekeeping exercise related to last year's Croatian war.  200-Mile Journey **********But the Canadians' 200-mile journey, in a convoy of 300 vehicles that include 80 tracked personnel carriers, has been repeatedly interrupted by local warlords in northern Bosnia, and the Canadian convoy was still five hours away from Sarajevo when it halted tonight. **********Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, the United Nations commander in Sarajevo, said arrangements had been worked out with the Bosnian Government for the Canadian soldiers to take a route across backroads that will take them around some of the barricades put up by rival Serbian and Croatian militia groups. **********The fact that the operation has gone as far as it has, with four flights carrying 38 tons having made it into the airport since Monday, is due largely to the personal initiative of President Francois Mitterrand of France and his Health Minister, Bernard Kouchner, who visited here on Sunday. **********But to some, including senior officials of the Bush Administration and of several other European governments, the French initiatives have had an air of scene-stealing. For months before Mr. Mitterrand's visit here, France had resisted sanctions against Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia for its role in the killing here. More recently Paris vacillated, along with other European nations, in assessing what to do. **********One senior United Nations official put it succinctly as the French food packs were distributed today.

And Wrong, Too.","Mutual Funds; The Time Is Right. And Wrong, Too."," **********The recent volatility in the stock market creates a prime opportunity for investors who use a strategy known as market timing. But profits don't always follow. **********Such investors buy and sell stocks or mutual funds frequently, sometimes even daily, based on an array of technical factors like trading volume, economic data and stock-price movements. And in a market moving sharply up and down, the frequent trader has more of a chance for sharp gains -- or losses. **********But when the dust settles after all those trades, market timers do not seem to do any better than others with different systems for beating the market. Peter Lynch, arguably the best mutual fund manager ever, condemns market timing as unworkable. Even if timers bet correctly, constant shifts between stocks and cash generate hefty tax bills that reduce returns. **********Still, the believers are passionate. Today there are six mutual funds that rely on market timing to manage their investments and several more designed for people who use market timing on their own. In addition, some newsletters tell investors when to buy and sell shares of mainstream funds -- those that do not use timing. **********For funds that rely on market timing, these have been tough times. In spite of all the volatility, the funds as a group have performed dismally. Only one of the three funds in existence for five years, the Righttime Blue Chip Fund, beat the stock fund average. And of six with three-year track records, only Righttime beat the average. **********Perhaps more telling are the two funds that shut their doors last year. The Monitrend Value Fund lost 0.5 percent a year for the five years ended April 30, 1991, when it finally died. That compares with a 9.4 percent rise for all stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., mutual fund researchers in Chicago. (In its last three years, Monitrend squeaked out 0.7 percent annually.) **********Another victim was the Lowry Market Timing Fund. Lowry rose 6.5 percent a year for the five years ended July 31, 1991, when it shut down. It rose 7.6 percent a year in its last three years. **********Most mutual funds, of course -- those that do not use timing -- are based on long-term investing, and the industry has had a love-hate relationship with market timers. On one hand, how can a fund turn away any investors? On the other, timers, with quick moves in and out, disrupt a fund's workings. **********Things reached a crisis in late 1990, when Fidelity and Stein Roe, whose funds were being bought heavily by timers, refused to take further money from those it had identified as timers. Besides facing excessive brokerage costs, the funds had been hurt because of the hurried trading, especially in the less liquid market for smaller stocks. They were forced to hold a lot of cash to accommodate the huge outflows. **********Since then, ""there has been a trend to tightening the screws on market timers,"" said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, a newsletter. More and more funds are limiting the number of trades investors can make in one year or levying redemption fees on short-term traders. **********A small part of the industry, though, has decided to accommodate timers. ""Most people have visions of market timers as mom-and-pop shops that manage $10,000 out of Kansas,"" said Stanley Egener, president of Neuberger & Berman Management, in New York City. ""But today, more and more institutions are relying on market timing."" **********Indeed, professional timers manage roughly $10 billion, up from $4 billion in 1985, said Pat Owen Michel, president of the Society of Asset Allocators and Fund Timers, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. **********To get a chunk of the growing market, in December Mr. Egener set up the Professional Timers Fund. The fund has a cash portfolio, as well as a growth portfolio managed by Mark Goldstein, who runs the Manhattan Fund. It is open only to professional money managers, who are linked by computer to Neuberger & Berman's system; the minimum account size is $10,000. In March, the Boston Company set up its Asset Managers Equity Fund, a quasi-index fund used mostly by timers, with a $100,000 minimum. **********Ordinary investors can use the Rushmore Nova Fund, sponsored by the Rushmore Group in Bethesda, Md. It is a no-load growth fund with a ""beta"" of 1.5, meaning that if the market rises 1 percent, the fund should rise 1.5 percent; if the market drops 1 percent, the fund loses 1.5 percent. For the year ended Sept. 30, Nova lost 3.4 percent, compared with an 8.3 percent average rise for all stock funds, Morningstar said. **********You might ask how the market timers' frequent trading affects after-tax returns. None of 10 market-timing investment newsletters that have been around for 10 years or more beat a buy-and-hold position -- using the Vanguard Index Trust 500 as a proxy -- after taxes are accounted for, according to a study by Mark Hulbert, editor of Hulbert's Financial Digest. **********The Vanguard fund returned 13.5 percent a year in the decade ended Dec. 31, 1991, compared with 12.9 percent for top-performing Market Logic and 6.2 percent for the loser, Professional Tape Reader's mutual fund timing advice. On average, the 10 letters returned 9.57 percent after tax."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/10/business/the-media-business-newsprint-makers-troubles-may-haunt-papers-one-day.html,Alex Jones,1992-08-10,,919,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Newsprint Makers' Troubles May Haunt Papers One Day,THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Newsprint Makers' Troubles May Haunt Papers One Day," **********THE newsprint business has rarely, if ever, seen worse days. There is a glut of newsprint available for sale, but the demand from newspapers is tepid because of the recession. This huge imbalance in supply and demand has been the status quo for more than two years. **********""It's an unmitigated disaster,"" said George B. Adler, an analyst specializing in paper companies at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********Indeed, the newsprint business is so bad that newspapers are extremely concerned about the financial health of newsprint manufacturers, even though they have previously shown no mercy in demanding ever-larger discounts as newsprint supply far outstripped demand. **********With leading newsprint companies like Abitibi-Price Inc. and Bowater Inc. losing money, the fear among some newspapers is that by pressing for the lowest possible prices, they may have created a monster that is preparing to attack them. **********This theory is that prices have dropped so low that newsprint companies will demand staggering increases as soon as they can get away with it. Though advertising remains generally flat, many newspapers expect a slowly improving economy to increase advertising in the next year or two. And as newspapers run more advertising, in turn, their demand for newsprint increases. **********Newspapers have come to depend on low newsprint prices in the last two years, as the recession has eroded their profits. **********If newsprint prices were to skyrocket, the prospective gains from improved advertising could be virtually wiped out at all papers, and some weaker papers -- especially the smaller dailies in Chicago, Houston, New York, Denver and other cities with newspaper competition -- could even be forced out of business. **********In these cities, the smaller papers already make little if any profit and would probably get less new advertising in an improving economy than the dominant papers. As such, surging newsprint costs would wound the weaker papers much more than the dominant papers. **********Nonetheless, there is little evidence that such concerns have encouraged newspapers to pay more than the market will bear for newsprint. **********For instance, earlier this year, a number of newsprint companies announced that the price of newsprint would increase on Aug. 1. **********The current list price for a metric ton of newsprint is $685, but newspapers actually get an average discount of about 40 percent off the list price. The Aug. 1 increase, in effect, was intended to reduce the discount to 35 percent, which would have increased the price by about $35 a ton. **********But as Aug. 1 approached, word rippled through the newspaper industry that the newsprint manufacturers were not going to be able to make the new price stick, because there was so much excess newsprint available. **********""I've got a nagging intuition that there is way too much newsprint out there to make this thing happen,"" said Homer E. Taylor, vice president of supply for Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Miami Herald and one of the largest consumers of newsprint. **********Essentially, the economics of producing newsprint make such gluts very difficult to avoid. **********Building newsprint mills is very expensive. But once the mill is operating, the cost to the company of producing each ton of newsprint is very small. The newsprint companies need cash to pay for the cost of building the mills, so they produce as much paper as they can and then sell it for whatever the market will bear. **********And now, what the market will bear is so low that even highly efficient operations like Bowater cannot sell paper for more than it costs to make and deliver it. **********In the first two quarters of this year, Bowater, the nation's largest newsprint manufacturer, reported an overall operating loss for the first time since the company went public in 1984. Though the company makes a profit from products like the coated paper used for magazines, the loss from newsprint dragged the whole operation into the red. **********""The industry cannot continue to operate as it has in a money-losing situation,"" said David G. McMaster, president of Bowater. **********Of course, the older and more remote mills, like some of those in Canada, could simply stop producing paper, thus bringing supply and demand more into equilibrium. **********But the social costs of such a Darwinian solution in lost jobs and shattered communities has prompted the Canadian Government to step in and save newsprint mills that might otherwise stop production. **********For instance, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and The New York Times Company jointly operated a newsprint mill at Spruce Falls in Ontario, about 500 miles north of Toronto. Because it had been unprofitable for years, the owners decided to stop operating it and in December gave it to the employees. **********Through loans from the former owners and subsidies from the Canadian Government, the plant is now producing almost as much newsprint as before. **********To make the burden on newsprint manufacturers even greater, they are under mounting pressure from newspapers and state and local governments to produce newsprint from recycled used newspapers. **********Such recycled newsprint must be turned back into pulp, which requires a de-inking process. **********And the capital cost of building such de-inking plants must be born by the newsprint manufacturers, just when they have the least amount of capital to spend."

Refugees Occupy Beer's Fabled Field,Munich Journal; Last Straw? Refugees Occupy Beer's Fabled Field," **********An open field on the edge of Munich where the fabled Oktoberfest is held each year has been turned into a temporary village for foreign asylum-seekers and is now a symbol of the intense national debate over how Germany should deal with its rising refugee population. **********The field, called Theresa's Meadow, has been hallowed ground for Bavarians for more than 150 years. Hordes of beer drinkers converge here each year for the Oktoberfest, a two-week orgy of drinking, partying and reveling in all things German. But for the last two months, it has been home to several hundred refugees. **********""In December we were getting 100 per week, and now it's up to 250,"" Mayor Georg Kronawitter of Munich said in a recent interview. ""We have 6,800 asylum-seekers in Munich, and the number is increasing by 1,000 per month. This can't go on. We can't handle it.""  Curbs on Immigration **********""Munich is a social flashpoint,"" Mr. Kronawitter said. ""We have 10,000 local people who can't afford places to live, and we're taking care of 7,000 refugees from the Yugoslavia war. Rents are very high, and the demand for apartments is intense. Every hole is full."" **********Like many other German cities, Munich has reached what local politicians say is a breaking point. Pressure on the German Government is growing steadily, and the asylum question has begun to dominate the nation's political agenda. **********Mayor Kronawitter's recent appeals for a new German policy toward refugees represent a break with leaders of his left-leaning Social Democratic Party, which officially opposes any such changes. But several prominent Social Democrats have rallied to his defense. **********Conservative politicians, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, have long been urging that Germany's Constitution be revised to tighten restrictions on immigration. The Bavarian Premier, Max Streibl, said recently that Germany was becoming a haven for ""economic parasites"" from around the world, and blamed ""socialist ideologues"" in the German Government for blocking new laws to restrict them. **********Germany now attracts 60 percent of all asylum-seekers coming to Western Europe. More than 250,000 arrived last year, and the Government spent $2.5 billion to feed, clothe, house and care for them. The largest groups came from Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey, but others were fleeing lands as diverse as Cuba, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Iran and the former Soviet Union. **********Their numbers are continuing to rise, and at the current rate, at least 350,000 will arrive this year. **********""The problem is becoming so great that the politicians are going to have to do something,"" said Herbert Dietz, a Munich social worker who helps supervise refugees here. ""We haven't had much violence against foreigners in Bavaria yet, but there have been terrible attacks in other parts of Germany. It's only a matter of time until we have an incident, and then it could spiral out of control within 24 hours."" **********Germany's Constitution guarantees anyone who is a victim of political persecution the right to asylum. Arriving refugees know that, and when they present themselves at border posts, they declare themselves to be victims of oppression in their homelands. Immigration officers are then required to admit them. **********It takes months or years for judges to determine the validity of each asylum claim. In that time, the refugees are entitled to aid that in most cases allows them to live far better than they could at home. **********Under existing law, it is virtually impossible for any foreigner who is not politically persecuted to obtain permission to live in Germany. Foreigners who come here simply because they want to start better lives have no hope of being allowed to stay. **********A growing number of politicians, including Mayor Kronawitter, favor establishing a quota system under which a limited number of economic refugees would be admitted to Germany each year. **********Those suggestions have thus far been strenuously resisted by Chancellor Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union. They are seeking a crackdown on all asylum-seekers, with quick resolution of their claims. **********But given the intense poverty of many third-world countries and the continuing convulsions in eastern Europe, it is doubtful that any legal measures will stop the flow of refugees into Germany.  'I Would Be in Danger' **********""Simply changing our laws is not going to have much effect,"" Heribert Prantl, a commentator, wrote in the Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung. ""People have to understand that the movement of refugees cannot be stopped by pushing a button."" **********In recent weeks, the German press has published accounts of asylum-seekers who have been found cheating the system by applying for aid in more than one city. Authorities in several cities have recently issued calls for registered asylum-seekers to appear in person on a single day so their identities can be checked, and have found that from 3 to 25 percent of those registered fail to appear. **********At Theresa's Meadow in Munich, more than 100 refugees are living in cramped containers. In interviews, several insisted they were genuine political refugees. **********""I worked for the national election commission in Nigeria,"" said one who gave his name as Fred. ""Police were after me because I was protesting the falsification of election results. I would be in danger if I was sent home."" **********""The word has gotten around that Germany is the place to go,"" Mr. Dietz said. ""Everyone recognizes that 80 to 90 percent of the refugees who come here are not really fleeing from persecution. The question is how to determine which ones are telling the truth, and then deciding what to do with the others. **********""One thing is sure. The ones living at Theresa's Meadow have to be gone within a few months, because the Oktoberfest must go on."""

Portrait of a Killer **********The case has attracted attention not only because of the quantity and horror of the crimes, which spread terror among the city's parents, but also because the stymied Rostov police turned to psychiatrists to help divine the killer's signature, which varied little from victim to victim. **********He found his victims usually at bus stops and talked them into following him to wooded areas, in broad daylight. His weapons were a knife, his hands and his teeth, and after 30 minutes of pathological frenzy a blinded, torn and sexually mutilated corpse would be added to a growing list. **********One psychiatrist, Aleksandr Bukhanovsky, studied the pattern to create a detailed psychological portrait of a humiliated, scarred, self-pitying, middle-aged and impotent man, a portrait that proved remarkably accurate when Citizen Ch. was finally arrested on Nov. 20, 1990. More Than 53 Victims **********It was only then that the full scope became known. Most of the vicious killings were was in Rostov, but the attacker had also killed in Leningrad, Moscow and five other cities from Ukraine to Uzbekistan. **********Rostov is one of the most important cities in the southern part of Russia, near the Sea of Azov, and has been a major center of military production for years. It is also the home of the Don Cossacks, a kind of professional military class. **********The police are certain there are more victims, but 53 is all they can prove with certainty. **********In the United States, the serial killer with the highest number of confirmed victims is generally believed to be Donald Harvey, a former nurse's aide serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to 37 murders in Ohio and Kentucky. Most of the killings occurred in hospitals where he worked in 1986 and 1987. Preying on Drifters **********Here, the known victims were 11 boys and 42 girls and young women, most of them drifters whose absence was never reported. How he managed to persuade them to follow him still bedevils detectives and intrigues psychiatrists. **********Gangly, rumpled, bespectacled, carrying a tattered briefcase or shoulder bag, he attracted no attention among passers-by. As he later told the police, he would walk up to a youth and mutter something about how crowded the bus stop was, that he would walk either to his car or to his summer cabin across the river, neither of which existed. He would off-handedly suggest that the victim come along. **********Fifty-three young people trudged after him, sometimes for more than a mile, until abruptly he would pounce. **********""He said he never intended to kill, that he never thought of what he was doing,"" said Viktor V. Burakov, chief of the section for serious sexual crimes in the Rostov criminal investigation bureau, who led the detective work from the first crime. ""He said he didn't know why they followed him. He said maybe it was because he was a social outcast, just as they were. To some extent it was true. Seventy percent of the victims were drifters."" Mistakes and Close Calls **********A nurse said: ""We were all aware of it. Many parents would walk their children from school, and we'd always be edgy if the kids were late coming back."" **********There was another victim. In 1978, after a girl was slain, the police picked up a convicted murderer-rapist who had been released from prison on probation and was near the site of the crime without an alibi. He was convicted and executed. Citizen Ch. later claimed that crime as his first. **********The killings resumed in 1982 and in 1984 they reached epidemic proportions. Eight bodies were found in August 1984 alone. **********It was also in 1984 that the police made their second grievous mistake -- they picked up Citizen Ch. near the site of a killing and held him for three months. But he was released when his blood type failed to match that found on victims. The police still cannot explain the discrepancy. **********The police operation grew into one of the biggest in the Soviet Union. Fifty-five officers and experts worked full-time on the case and as many as 400 policemen were used in many stakeouts. Mr. Burakov showed a file cabinet with more than 25,000 names of potential suspects. **********The huge dragnet helped solve 95 unrelated murders and more than 300 criminals were caught in a variety of other crimes. But the serial killings continued. **********""I felt he was mocking us, killing children under our very noses,"" Mr. Burakov said. **********Those were still days when the press was fully controlled, and the true scope of the killings was never reported. But word of a monster-killer was all over the city of one million -- the police held special briefings at schools and workplaces and occasionally appealed for information through the press, and the rumor mills worked overtime. **********The pressure became ""hellish,"" Mr. Burakov said, sitting in a small corner office still piled high with files and photos of the case. The case came to dominate his life and his health deteriorated. He worked almost without vacations or days off, often sleeping two, three hours a night. Gay Men Identified **********In 1986 he was hospitalized with insomnia and chest pains. **********Mr. Burakov's initial appeal to psychiatrists drew many hypotheses, often conflicting. They said the killer was young and strong, or homosexual, or a member of a Satanic cult, or a doctor, or more than one person. One result was that thousands of gay men were painstakingly identified in a state where homosexuality is still illegal. Twenty-five were imprisoned, most for soliciting minors. **********It was Mr. Bukhanovsky, a specialist in sexual pathology who was among the first Soviet psychiatrists to work with transsexuals, who eventually came closest to describing the person who was arrested in the killings. Pursuer Meets His Quarry **********He postulated a middle-aged man with an especially cruel childhood, a terrible inferiority complex and serious sexual problems, heterosexual, possibly married, who had probably been a teacher. **********He proved very close, though Citizen Ch. was finally captured less through the portrait than through painstaking detective work. Following the pattern of killings, the police staked out many potential murder sites and tried to steer the killer to more remote regions where he might stand out more clearly. It worked: after one killing, witnesses recalled seeing a boy following a lanky, middle-aged man with glasses. **********The break came on Nov. 6, 1990, when Citizen Ch. was identified at a spot where a victim was found soon after. A videotape of the arrest four days later shows him quietly submitting as detectives handcuff him. With his huge glasses, his sparse and tousled hair and his crooked posture, he appears meek and passive as the police book him and a doctor examines him. **********Mr. Burakov, who had so often lain awake imagining what the monster would look like, said he felt nothing when he finally saw him. **********""I looked at him and I said, my God, is this what I lost eight years for?"" he said. Teacher and Active Communist **********For nine days after his arrest, Citizen Ch. would admit to nothing. Mr. Burakov called in Mr. Bukhanovsky to help, and when the psychiatrist read his portrait to the suspect, Citizen Ch. began to confess. **********He was 42 when he committed the first killing, he had learned as a child that an older brother was kidnapped and cannibalized during the great famine in Ukraine in the early 1930's, his father was a German prisoner-of-war who was treated as a traitor when he returned. He was often mocked and humiliated, and his early encounters with women were disastrous. But with time he married and had two children. **********He had worked as a teacher and later as a supply clerk in a factory, and he had been an active Communist Party member. **********""I gave myself to my work, my studies, my family, my children, my grandchildren, and there was nothing else in my life,"" he wrote in a biographic essay written for Mr. Bukhanovsky in a scrawled hand. ""But when I found myself in a different setting, I became a different person, uncontrollable, as if some evil force controlled me against my will and I could not resist."" **********Mr. Bukhanovsky said, ""He feels no remorse for his victims, only pity for himself."" **********Citizen Ch. is currently in a K.G.B. isolation cell awaiting the start of the trial. A psychiatric board found him capable of standing trial and it is likely he will be sentenced to death. His wife and children, who insist he has been framed, have changed their names and residence."

On a busy day, volume can top a trillion dollars. **********That is a lot of money. And as last week proved, the combined power of all of these traders can overwhelm the power of governments, even when all of Europe is trying to act in concert. The events provided a bitter reminder to central bankers and finance ministers that the power of Governments to control economies and currencies has eroded. Failing by Trying Too Hard **********The changes have been gradual, and by no means do they show that governments have lost all economic influence. But when governments try to accomplish too many things, such as Britain's effort to both prop up its currency and stimulate its economy, they can fail to do either. Britain has now decided it will try to grow, regardless of whether that weakens the pound. **********It was forced to make the decision only after the pound fell, reflecting the fact that when the overwhelming majority of traders decide, whether for safety or for profit, that they want to move into one group of currencies and out of another, the financial reserves that countries keep available for currency-support operations can quickly be overwhelmed. **********""The central bankers and the ministers of finance have been very good at opening economies, and that in turn has limited their control over events,"" said David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers. ""The day-to-day flows can swamp their ability to control things."" **********Those flows come about through direct trading of currencies, and through a myriad of other related products, known by such names as currency swaps and currency forward contracts. They can be traded on exchanges, but most of the action is done over the telephone, in markets that are little regulated and for which few accurate figures are available. The important point is that they make it possible, virtually instantaneously, for money managers and corporations to move into and out of currencies based on short-term trading considerations. **********Normally, such trading balances itself. But in times of stress, central banks can find themselves as the only willing buyers of a particular currency if governments are unwilling to let that currency decline further. That is what happened in recent weeks in Europe, where most countries had vowed to keep currencies within fairly narrow trading bands relative to each other. By the time the central banks gave in, Germany had spent $40 billion in defending the currency alignment, and other central banks had spent billions more. **********A generation ago, in the late 1960's, countries with currencies under attack by speculators could and did resort to capital controls, making it harder to move money into or out of the country in question. Now, such actions by major industrial countries are almost unthinkable, and are seldom even mentioned. **********""Governments have lost that power to control capital, and they probably have lost it forever,"" said David C. Roche, a global strategist for Morgan Stanley in London. Like many economists, he thinks the power of global markets has grown at the expense of governments. **********""National governments no longer control their own economies, the way they arguably did 30 years ago,"" said David A. Wyss, the chief financial economist of DRI/McGraw Hill. Channeling Floods of Cash **********The shrinking of power reflects choices by governments, like the widespread financial deregulation of the 1970's and 1980's, and technological innovations that made it far easier for speculators and investors to send billions or even trillions of dollars flowing around the world almost instantaneously, in search of quick profits. **********""That is the difference from 30 or 40 years ago, the extraordinary movement of capital over a short period of time,"" said Henry Kaufman, an economist who gained fame more than 20 years ago as an interest-rate forecaster for Salomon, and who now runs his own firm. ""This makes life far more difficult for regulators."" **********The reduction of power can be overstated. Governments retain tremendous influence over economies, especially when the major governments can agree to coordinate actions. They have options both in fiscal policy -- raising or lowering government spending and taxes -- and in monetary policy, by influencing interest rates. **********But, as C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, noted, ""If governments try to do inconsistent things, such as maintaining an exchange rate and not having policies that back up that rate, then the exchange rates get knocked off."" **********That can take a sustained period, however, and to Mr. Bergsten the delay indicates that governments retain a lot of power over exchange rates, market forces notwithstanding. The tensions within the European system were evident for quite some time, as governments pursued widely variant fiscal and monetary policies but nonetheless tried to keep exchange rates steady. The system broke only last week. **********The European effort to fix currency rates within Western Europe was designed to provide the advantages of reliable and predictable exchange rates as companies do business across national borders. But trying to maintain that system -- especially as pressures grew in the last two years, with Britain entering a long recession and Germany loosening its fiscal policy to pay for German reunification -- reduced the flexibility of monetary policies in the various countries. **********Germany felt it needed a tight money policy, to fight inflation stemming from its loose fiscal policy. Britain, meanwhile, needed a looser monetary policy to stimulate recovery, but found itself unable to have one. Yesterday, having given up on efforts to support the pound, Britain was able to reduce interest rates. **********In some ways, the crisis that broke last week was reminiscent of numerous crises of the 1960's. Then, the Bretton Woods system, which since World War II had tried to fix currency rates, was feeling the strains and was careering to its eventual breakup in 1971. **********In the 60's, however, such countries as Britain and the United States were able to clamp controls on capital leaving their countries. In the end, those controls did not enable the governments to preserve overvalued currencies, but they did delay the devaluations and provide time for economies to adjust. **********Officials in those days had to intervene in currency markets, buying the currency that was under attack, but those markets were not nearly as large as they are now and could not put as much pressure on governments that wished to preserve currency values. Shipping Money Overseas **********Since then, however, the international flows of capital have grown drastically, and currency trading volumes are at many times the level needed to finance trade and investment. Where it was once unusual for investors to have a big part of their assets overseas, now it is common. **********Moreover, much of the increase in overseas investing has come in only the last several years. At the end of 1985, American mutual funds that invested largely in foreign bonds and currencies had only $64 million in assets. By the end of 1988, that figure had zoomed to $3 billion. Now it is more than $30 billion. **********A large part of that new money was invested in European countries, like Italy, Spain and Britain, with relatively high interest rates. This month, as those currencies seemed to be in danger of sliding, fund managers rushed to hedge their positions in the currency market, helping to overwhelm the European central banks efforts to support their currencies. **********The United States, over the last decade, has been quite willing to accept the fact that market forces will move the dollar's exchange rate, even as the nation pursues its own domestic policies. The combination of loose fiscal policies and tight monetary policies of the early 1980's helped to drive the dollar up; the more recent lowering of interest rates has depressed the American currency."

The reports said the Bush Administration had also amassed evidence pointing to a broad pattern of Israeli transfers of American weapons technology to South Africa, Chile, Ethiopia and other countries.  'We Have Nothing to Hide' **********In all instances, Israeli officials insist that the charges are baseless. **********""We have nothing to hide here,"" an official said. The visiting Americans, who are investigating only the allegations involving Patriot missiles, will be able to visit any place they wish, he said, and ""they will have full cooperation to look for whatever they want."" **********The recent news reports, which many officials here denounce as being part of an orchestrated campaign of Israel-bashing by the Administration, have contributed to a slide in relations between the two countries that have reached perhaps their lowest point in decades. **********At a Cabinet meeting today, Defense Minister Moshe Arens reported on a visit he made to Washington last week, and according to officials who heard him, he said his discussions with the Americans had done nothing to improve the situation. **********Among the issues dividing the two countries is Israel's request for $10 billion in United States loan guarantees and President Bush's refusal to provide them unless Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir gives up his insistence on building Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********In all but clinical terms, the search for aid is at a dead end. Senior officials here are divided among themselves about whether it is better to withdraw the request or to let it sit indefinitely in Washington, awaiting possible mood changes after national elections that will be held in both countries this year. Some had expected a formal Cabinet decision to drop the loan guarantees, but no action was taken for now.  Shamir Urges Restraint **********Mr. Shamir was quoted by the Israeli radio as telling his ministers that it was important for Israel to act with restraint. Nonetheless, anti-American feelings are running high in some circles of the dominant Likud Party. One Likud member of Parliament, David Magen, denounced what he called the Administration's ""cruel and false accusations,"" calling them hostile acts whose aim was to undermine Israel. **********In response, Foreign Minister David Levy said the country had to prevent relations with Washington from deteriorating more than they already had. **********On the allegations of improper technology transfers, Mr. Arens and other senior officials acknowledge that Israel in the past has given American-originated weaponry to other countries, but they insist that it was always with the permission of the United States. When Washington said no, they did nothing, they say. **********For years the Israelis have sold what military experts estimate to be billions of dollars in arms to the Chinese. But military specialists here generally agree with Government officials who reject the Patriot charges as a ""joke."" **********The Israelis argue that it would be absurd, perhaps even suicidal, for them to give China technology that might improve the efficiency of missiles that the Chinese have been trying to sell to some of Israel's hostile Arab neighbors."

Officials say that it falls short of some American goals in the negotiation and that the Bush Administration has not yet decided whether to accept it. **********But many diplomats involved in the talks said today that they expected the United States to go along in the end, particularly as President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia expressed their ""conviction"" that such a chemical-weapons ban ""can be completed by the end of August"" in the statement issued after their June 17 White House talks. **********Completion of the treaty this summer would also enable President Bush to say he has now fulfilled his earlier promises to rid the world of chemical weapons during the run-up to the next Presidential election. **********Last month the chief United States negotiator, Stephen J.

Harris, a chemical-weapons expert with the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based research group. **********If the United States accepts the new text, diplomats say, the chances are good that most of the negotiating partners will endorse it at a ceremony in Geneva in August, before sending it for approval by the United Nations General Assembly in September. The treaty would then be opened for formal signature at another ceremony in Paris at the end of this year or early next. **********The treaty will not take effect until 65 countries have signed and ratified it. But that should happen fairly quickly, since the 50 members of the Conference on Cooperation and Security in Europe are already committed to accepting any chemical weapons ban agreed at Geneva. **********The real difficulty, some diplomats say, is whether Middle East countries suspected of having such weapons, including Egypt, Syria and Iran, will agree to give them up without an agreement by Israel to renounce nuclear weapons. **********The draft treaty bans the possession or production of poison gases and other chemical weapons. It provides for the destruction of all existing stocks over a 10-year period and creates a new international agency, situated in the Hague, that will regularly inspect chemical plants across the world and conduct challenge inspections against suspected covert weapon sites. **********But at American insistence, the draft ban incorporates significantly weaker verification provisions than those first envisaged by President Bush, who when he began the negotiations as Vice President in 1984, said any treaty should allow inspections ""any time, any place and with no right of refusal."" **********Currently the only countries that have admitted possessing significant quantities of chemical weapons are Russia, which says it has a stockpile of about 40,000 tons, and the United States with about 25,000 tons. But many other third-world countries are suspected of having stocks. **********Last year, as cold-war tensions faded, the Bush Administration threw the chemical-weapon negotiations into confusion by deciding to give a higher priority to protecting American secrets against foreign prying than in assuring its ability to detect Soviet cheating. **********To the irritation of its Western partners who generally favored a more intrusive inspection system, the United States suddenly demanded significant restrictions on a government's right to impose challenge inspections in the territory of another state. **********After months of wrangling, the new draft text provides for a more restricted inspection system than originally foreseen."

To solve the cycle of famine, relief officials say, the displaced people must be wooed back to their homes with visible promises of safety and food. **********To achieve that goal, relief officials said the troops would have to work with their agencies to deliver food to villages in the countryside. **********""There was a system in place, but now the marines are here and we have to create a new system,"" said William Bergquist, field coordinator for Catholic Relief Services, which distributes food biweekly to about 110,000 people in neighboring villages and plans to continue to do so whether or not it receives a military escort. ""We came away from our meeting very confident it would be an easy operation."" Christmas Carol Taught **********On their first day, the marines took up positions at the airport, digging foxholes amid the scrub brush under intermittent downpours. The only contact they had with the people of Baidoa was at the airport gate, where hundreds of children gathered to stare and were quickly taught to sing ""Jingle Bells"" by a marine on guard. **********The truck of food brought to the orphanage was escorted by 10 armed jeeps and two light armored vehicles and immediately was snarled in a traffic jam in the middle of town. At the orphanage, one of the marines kissed a baby as dozens of photographers and cameramen zoomed in. **********""We think it's a show of force and that's very deliberate,"" said Col. Gregory Newbold, who is in charge of the operation, as he shook hands with little children. ""There are people that don't want us here. It's deterrence."""

Cutbacks; Auto Maker Posts Deficit Of $2.5 Billion,The G.M. Cutbacks; Auto Maker Posts Deficit Of $2.5 Billion," **********Closing the books on its worst year in history, the General Motors Corporation today reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.5 billion, a record quarterly loss for the company. The deficit reflected a one-time pretax charge to income of $2.8 billion to close 21 plants over the next several years. **********Excluding all extraordinary charges, the auto maker's loss for the fourth quarter was $519.8 million, on revenues of $33.6 billion. That represents a significant improvement from the fourth quarter of 1990, when G.M. posted a $1.62 billion loss on revenues of $29.9 billion after war in the Persian Gulf shattered consumer confidence and dried up auto sales. **********G.M.'s profits have improved since the fourth quarter of 1990, one-time charges aside, in part because of cost-cutting and strong performances by the company's subsidiaries. **********G.M. was the last of the Big Three auto makers to report its fourth-quarter and 1991 earnings. The Chrysler Corporation showed a $97 million profit in the final quarter and a loss for the year of $795 million. The Ford Motor Company posted a fourth-quarter loss of $475.7 million and a yearly loss of $2.25 billion. **********Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, said he expected quarterly earnings to improve. ""We are committed to substantially re-sizing G.M.'s North American operations in order to achieve full competitiveness as quickly as possible,"" he said. Biggest Corporate Loss **********The fourth-quarter loss brought G.M.'s 1991 loss to $4.45 billion -- the biggest in American corporate history -- compared with $1.98 billion in 1990. Revenues fell to $123.05 billion, from $124.7 billion in 1990. **********Mr. Stempel said that G.M.'s North American automotive operations were responsible for all the losses, though he did not break out a separate figure. Analysts estimated the North American losses at roughly $7.5 billion, excluding one-time charges. **********""There are no major surprises here,"" said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. **********G.M.'s stock fell 62.5 cents in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $37.75. **********Auto sales remained at recessionary levels throughout most of the year, weighed down by weak consumer confidence. Costly customer rebates and other incentives also drained G.M. cash, averaging about $1,000 a car, according to many analysts. Mr. Stempel also cited costly labor expenses as a burden on its finances. **********Sales of G.M. cars internationally earned $2.1 billion in 1991, helped by strong sales in Europe and Mexico. **********G.M.'s three major subsidiary operations, Electronic Data Systems. GM Hughes and G.M.A.C., posted strong financial results. Data Systems **********E.D.S., a computer services company based in Dallas, posted the best quarter in its history, with net income rising to $155.9 million, or 33 cents a share, from $133.4 million a year ago, or 28 cents a share. Revenues rose 24 percent, to $2.09 billion from $1.68 billion. **********The company registered a rise in annual revenues of $7.1 billion for 1991 compared with $6.1 billion for 1990. Net income last year rose 10 percent, to $547.5 million, or $1.14 a share, from $496.9 million, or $1.04 a share, in 1990. A change resulting from a new accounting standard lowered net income from $563 million for the year. **********Last year was also the first since G.M. acquired E.D.S. in 1984 that revenues from sources outside the auto maker exceeded revenues derived from business with the parent. **********G.M.'s class E shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $56.75, unchanged. GM Hughes **********GM Hughes, which includes Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics, also posted record revenues and earnings in the final quarter. It earned $224.6 million, or 64 cents a share, on revenues of $3.1 billion, compared with earnings of $158.4 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenues of $2.9 billion in 1990. **********For the year, GM Hughes earned $435.5 million, or $1.39 a share, on revenues of $11.5 billion, down from earnings of $577.2 million, or $1.82 a share, on revenues of $11.7 billion in 1990. **********The company attributed the declines to an 8 percent drop in General Motors' North American vehicle production and a decline in the worldwide aircraft flight simulator market. **********G.M.'s class H stock rose $1.125, to $19.375. G.M.A.C. **********Net earnings of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation for the fourth quarter were $102 million, down from $259 million for the period a year earlier, but net income for all of 1991 was $1.37 billion, a 15 percent increase over 1990 earnings of $1.19 billion. **********The 1991 earnings, showing the results of G.M.A.C.'s financing, insurance and mortgage operations, reflect the addition of $332 million that resulted from a change in accounting standards. A special wholesale loss provision recorded in the fourth quarter also amounted to $171 million after taxes. Excluding these provisions, net income totaled $1.21 billion, the second-highest earnings in G.M.A.C. history. **********The total cost of borrowed funds in the United States averaged 7.66 percent in 1991 compared with 8.57 percent in 1990."

In Germany, prominent politicians have begun using unusually blunt language to condemn the refugee policies of allied governments.  German Minister 'Furious' **********Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel introduced a resolution at a meeting of European Community foreign ministers this month that would have committed each of the 12 member countries to accept more refugees from the Balkans. His motion failed on a 6-to-6 vote, and Mr. Kinkel said afterward he was ""undiplomatically furious."" **********""This has to be a central issue at the refugee conference in Geneva,"" Mr. Kinkel said in an interview with the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. ""All E.C. nations must do their part by accepting refugees. That is what the citizens of these nations want. The governments must follow suit."" **********Members of the German Parliament from all parties have joined in criticizing the governments of neighboring countries.  Kohl Makes Public Appeal **********""It is hardhearted and unfriendly for countries like England, France or the Benelux nations to refuse to take refugees,"" said Olaf Feldmann of the centrist Free Democratic party. ""Their attitude shows that the European solidarity we hear so much about is really an empty farce."" **********On Friday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl took the unusual step of publicly appealing to the leaders of all European Community nations to open their borders to Balkan refugees. **********""I consider it extremely important that all European Community member states accept refugees from the former Yugoslavia for a limited time,"" Mr. Kohl wrote in a letter made public by his office. ""The task before us cannot be done if only a few members of the community participate."" **********The conference in Geneva, which is to open on Wednesday, was convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata. She has been urging European leaders to accept more Balkan refugees. **********""Little Malawi, a barren African country with eight million inhabitants, sheltered nearly one million people during the war in Mozambique,"" Mrs. Ogata wrote in an article published on the front page of Die Zeit, Germany's leading intellectual weekly. ""Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, has opened its doors to 300,000 people who have fled from Burma. Does Europe have less to share than these countries?""  2 Million Displaced by War **********As many as two million or more citizens of Balkan republics have been displaced by the fighting that broke out there last year, but most remain inside the borders of the former Yugoslavia. **********Of the 425,000 who have managed to flee beyond those borders, Germany has accepted more than 200,000. Austria and Hungary have taken more than 50,000 each, Sweden nearly 45,000, and Switzerland about 17,500. **********But according to a list issued today by the United Nations refugee commission, other European countries lag far behind. France and Britain have accepted fewer than 1,200 refugees each. Belgium and Finland have taken fewer than 1,000, Spain has admitted 120 and Greece has accepted 7. **********British officials have said they believe refugees should be housed as near to their country of origin as possible. They say Britain is too distant.  French Suggest Safe Havens **********In France, military officers have suggested creating safe havens for refugees within the former Yugoslavia, similar to those established to protect Kurds in northern Iraq. They say this would make it unnecessary for citizens to flee the Balkan region. **********Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France has strongly rejected criticism of his Government's policy. ""I am furious about the statements that some 'sympathetic souls' are making on this subject,"" Mr. Dumas said in an interview with France-Soir on Friday. **********Germany was slow to begin accepting refugees from the Balkans, with officials arguing that the country was already being overrun by asylum-seekers from around the world. But great public momentum has built in recent months, and there is widespread support for accepting the refugees here. **********When more than 5,000 Bosnian refugees arrived in German cities on Sunday, local citizens converged on train stations to welcome them with flowers and give them packages of food and clothing. Some have offered to accept refugees in their homes. **********Public pressure is moving some governments to act. Luxembourg has expressed a willingness to accept more refugees, and Denmark said today that it would accept 1,000 in addition to the 1,600 already there."

Officials from the United States, which has been wary of providing blanket assurances, and officials from Germany and other European countries, who have been urging a larger American role, will likely focus on the urgent problem of getting food, fuel and medical assistance to the hungry Russians this winter.  Long-Term Issues **********But their economic advisers are apt to zero in on the far more controversial issue of longer-term economic aid. Aid, other than the humanitarian variety, was not in the cards until recently because the Government of Mikhail S. Gorbachev was neither democratically elected nor committed to a rapid transition to a market economy. **********On one side of the debate are mostly conservative economists, including Charles Wolf, the dean of the Rand Graduate School; Judy Shelton, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and once President Reagan's chief economic adviser.  Emphasis on Private Help **********This camp favors sending technical advisers, opening Western markets to exports of the new commonwealth of republics and helping the Russians dismantle their nuclear arsenal. But they maintain that virtually all the resources for restructuring and rebuilding the Russian economy should come from private foreign investors and from scaling back the former Soviet military. **********""Private loans are the way to go, said Allan Meltzer at Carnegie Mellon University. ""People with a stake in the system will make it work."" **********Mr. Wolf, of Rand, said, ""Government-to-government aid is a political transaction, not a market transaction."" **********On the other side are mostly followers of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, who pleaded for Western aid to Germany after World War I. They include Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, who is the top Western economic adviser to the Government of Boris N. Yeltsin and the architect of reforms in Poland; Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist of the World Bank; Prof. Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who preceded Mr. Summers at the World Bank, and Robert D. Hormats, an international economist who is a vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs. **********This group argues that as much as $30 billion in financial assistance a year for several years may be needed to sustain Russia and other republics that pursue an I.M.F.-approved program to end the current financial crisis and to ""privatize, marketize and monetize"" their economies. The aid would cover nonessential imports and a fund to support the value of the ruble. **********Such aid, the economists say, is a bargain compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars that the United States and other Western countries have been spending each year on the military against the perceived Soviet threat. **********""The Russians have made a well-conceived start on the process of reform that is worthy of moral and financial support,"" said Mr. Summers of the World Bank. ""Neither a debt deal nor provision of food relief are likely to assist in the task of stabilization and structural reform."" **********The Bush Administration, which has opened the door to multilateral financial assistance by sanctioning membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for Russia and five other republics, has not made any bilateral aid commitments beyond $1.8 billion in food credits to be used in the next few months.  Divergent Views **********The current debate reflects sharply divergent views of economic development, the role of government and the efficacy of foreign aid. **********The conservatives, by and large, believe that the basic problem is not lack of resources in Russia but the absence of basic institutions -- property rights, a commercial code, sound money -- without which markets cannot function. They maintain that money from abroad would be wasted, stolen or, even worse, dampen the spontaneous growth of the private sector by bolstering the old bureaucracy. They cite as an example Africa, which after 30 years of foreign aid is far poorer. **********The liberals, on the other hand, believe that aid can buy confidence and time for reforms to work. They point to Korea in the 50's, Europe after World War II and Mexico at the start of the 90's as examples of how foreign aid -- tied to strict conditions -- can play a vital and positive economic role. **********""The Marshall Plan did not rebuild Europe,"" said Bradford deLong, an economic historian at Harvard University. ""It worked because it pushed European governments toward policies that turned out to be very good for economic growth, such as free trade and private enterprise.""  Role for Government **********The liberals also believe that government has a vital role to play in the former Soviet Union, namely in stabilizing an economy engulfed by hyperinflation, falling production and collapsing trade between republics. They argue that it is naive to expect Western institutions to take root in a collapsing economy. **********Mr. Meltzer, Mr. Feldstein and other critics of largesse argue that Russia could raise plenty of cash for imports by selling some of its oil or mineral assets. Mr. Wolf also believes that official statistics, which do not measure the underground economy, are inflating the degree of economic distress. **********Aid supporters doubt that asset sales could be organized quickly enough. ""Russia has the resources to undertake economic reforms without external help,"" said Andrei Vavilov, a deputy to Yegor Gaidar, the head of the Yeltsin economic team. ""But the reforms would be much more painful."" **********The point of sending money, Mr. Sachs of Harvard has emphasized repeatedly, is to buy time for reformers by easing the squeeze on living standards and instilling foreign confidence in the reforms. **********But some think the aid would be wasted. ""Giving the Russians money is a dreadful mistake,"" said Marshall Goldman, a Soviet expert on the faculty at Wellesley College. ""This is not a dormant market system like Poland. We should not provide money until they have made major institutional changes."" **********Proponents of aid argue that such pessimism amounts to a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""If this Government fails, there's absolutely no guarantee that we would be left with anything that we'd want to support,"" said Mr. Fischer of M.I.T. ""This Government needs our help."" **********Besides, argues Mr. Summers of the World Bank, Russia's long-term growth potential is brighter than most people think. Relative to its low per-capita income -- half of Korea's and about the same as Mexico's -- Russia has a well-educated work force and lots of natural resources. **********""The experience of Russian workers who get jobs immediately in Poland despite high unemployment there demonstrates that the work force is highly motivated,"" Mr. Summers said. **********The biggest worry, though, is that aid will actually retard reform by giving struggling governments an easy way out. **********""Even though the revolution of 1989 is two years old, the investment climate in Eastern Europe is by no means auspicious,"" said Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute. He notes, for example, that despite $10 billion in outside funds for Eastern Europe, the selloff of large and medium state companies has been painfully slow. **********Sending the Russian Government lots of money could ease the pressure to downsize the military, argues Mr. Feldstein, the former Reagan adviser. ""The idea of giving our former enemies aid without asking them to lay down their arms is a mistake, "" he said. ""The number of armies has increased dramatically and the military risks have gone up."" **********Advocates of aid respond by pointing out that aid would be tied to strict conditions that, if unmet, would mean a cutoff in funds. ""There are all kinds of ways of doing it,"" said Anne Krueger, a development economist at Duke University and a former World Bank chief economist. ""It has been done. It's not that hard."" **********Indeed, an I.M.F. team, which has been in Moscow since last Tuesday, is scheduled to issue a preliminary report around Jan. 25. **********""At this point, no comprehensive stabilization and structural adjustment package has been negotiated,"" said one World Bank official, who spoke on the condition of not being named. **********If the Yeltsin Government survives, and if the I.M.F. can hammer out an agreement with Mr. Yeltsin's economists with some chance of success, some loans will almost certainly be made, though not perhaps they will not be as generous as the Russians are hoping, officials at the World Bank and the I.M.F. said. **********""There's a high risk in providing assistance that the assistance will be wasted, but it's probably worth the gamble,"" said Mr. Hormats of Goldman, Sachs, expressing perhaps better than anyone else who was interviewed what many are thinking."

In addition, intelligence experts say, small revolutionary cells have been detected both in La Paz and in drug-trafficking areas in the Chapare jungle south of here. The Border Leaks **********Shining Path activity was first seen here about two years ago, Bolivian officials say, but has increased markedly in recent months. **********""We know they are here,"" said Julian Ramirez, administrator of the Ulla Ulla region. ""They can cross into Bolivia at any time because there is no control of the border. They send their spies over and they ask questions about how many police and army are here, what kinds of weapons they have."" **********It is difficult to determine the precise strategy of the Shining Path in Bolivia. Intelligence experts in La Paz say it would be far more useful to the Shining Path to continue using Bolivia as a refuge, rather than take on a new military opponent. **********But the pattern here is similar to the organization's beginnings in Ayacucho, in southern Peru, where the reclusive founder, Abimael Guzman, a former philosophy professor, worked quietly for years building a core group of followers. Only when he had established a reliable nucleus of leaders and trained fighters did the Shining Path begin to mount violent attacks. **********In the 12 years of civil war since the first attack in Peru, more than 23,000 people have been killed and Peru has almost been paralyzed, with the Shining Path dominating large parts of the countryside and many of the shantytowns surrounding Lima. The Government of President Alberto K. Fujimori seems almost powerless to stop its activity, even after Mr. Fujimori suspended constitutional rule in April in an effort to impose order. **********The Shining Path promotes a Maoist belief in the complete destruction of the corrupt state followed by the rebuilding of an essentially agrarian economy led by the indigenous groups that for the last 500 years have been kept at the bottom rungs of Andean society. Many fear that a Shining Path takeover of Peru would result in a blood bath directed at the educated ruling class of Spanish background. **********The doctrine of the Shining Path frequently mentions the export of its revolution, and it may have decided that the Indian-dominated culture of Bolivia is an integral part of the forces it believes it has harnessed in Peru. **********""There's a strong argument to be made that Bolivia is a natural extension for Sendero,"" said a United States Government official who insisted on anonymity. ""They are appealing to people of the same race in both countries. And in both countries you have a tremendous gap between rich whites and the very poor Indians."" The Fear Mounts **********Security experts also say that the group may want to tap the lucrative drug trade in Bolivia to finance its activities, just as it has in Peru. Bolivia is the second-largest producer of coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine. The Shining Path obtains other financing from pockets of supporters in Europe and the United States. **********Many of the 1,800 people who live in poverty on this vast, windswept pampas, 15,000 feet up in the Andes, have seen guerrillas in their towns and say they have received threats that Ulla Ulla and its military outpost will be attacked. **********Their anxiety became even more acute in July when guerrillas killed 10 Peruvian soldiers a short distance from the Bolivian border. **********Intelligence experts say a small number of Shining Path sympathizers are operating in La Paz, mostly trying to work with local rebel groups like the Guerrilla Army of Tupac Katari. **********In response, Bolivia is cooperating with Peru to limit the flow of Peruvians into Bolivia. Although entry across the largely unpatrolled border remains virtually unrestricted, Peruvians now need a good conduct card to travel in Bolivia. Those without such documents are turned over to the Peruvian border police. **********Apparently in retaliation for this increased cooperation, the Shining Path detonated a car bomb outside the Bolivian Embassy in Lima in July, destroying most of the building. **********""We have to take the blowing up of the embassy as a message,"" said Lieut. Col. Victor Sapiencia Ochavez, the Bolivian Army commander for the district around Ulla Ulla. ""Sendero is constantly infiltrating, trying to extend its tentacles. They don't like it when we stop them."" **********Perhaps the most difficult task for Bolivia is control of its 700-mile border with Peru, including passage across Lake Titicaca. In the Ulla Ulla region the only natural obstacle to entry is a tiny river. **********Moreover, for several years Lima has declared the Puno region on its side of the river an emergency ""red zone"" where the normal rule of law is suspended. In practice, in this and many other such zones, there is little police or army presence and control of large areas is effectively ceded to the guerrillas, who are not even pursued by the military. The Police Walk **********Bolivian police and civic officials in Ulla Ulla say the guerrilla organization has stepped up its activity in recent months. **********""We have very few arms here,"" said Sgt. Damaso Villasante of the police, ""three revolvers, a rifle and an automatic weapon, and very little ammunition. We don't have police vehicles nor bicycles. We get rides in trucks when they come by or else we go by foot or burro."" **********Several recent incidents have heightened fears among villagers. **********On July 31, a truck carrying nine Peruvian soldiers and an army captain was ambushed while returning from the Chejepampa market on the border. The attack, by Shining Path members, took place almost in sight of the border. All 10 Peruvians were killed. Afterward the Peruvian military bolstered its presence on its side of the border to more than 100 troops.i **********Two days later, residents of Hichocollo, three miles north of here, reported eight armed men watching their village from a nearby hill. Fearing that an attack by the Shining Path was imminent, the two policemen in the town and almost all the townspeople fled. That night, villagers said, members of the Shining Path lit a sky flare, entered the town and interrogated the only remaining villager, telling him they planned to attack Ulla Ulla. **********Particularly worrisome is a vow by the Shining Path to avenge the death of a member killed by Bolivian soldiers in August 1990 during a struggle over a weapon. The guerrilla, Oscar Benito, was buried in Ulla Ulla, 60 feet from the military barracks. **********Mr. Ramirez, the regional administrator, said a Peruvian who he believed was a member of the Shining Path had told him that the guerrillas would recover the remains of their comrade and that ""they would not kill 40, not 60, but 100 Bolivians for every Shining Path member who died."" **********The two army barracks in the region have a total of about 50 soldiers and only two light trucks. Officers admit that their best defense is the local population, mostly Aymara Indians, who immediately tell the military when they see strangers. **********During a recent visit to the Chejepampa market, where Bolivians and Peruvians were selling everything from oranges and colorful woven cloth to Japanese stereo equipment and televisions, most turned away when asked about El Sendero Luminoso. **********One money changer became visibly tense and spoke only to the side: ""No one will say anything to you about them because people are afraid. But we know who they are. We know the difference between someone who belongs here and someone who doesn't. We're watching them."""

W. de Klerk ventured into this bitter black township today in a show of concern for victims of a massacre on Wednesday, but was chased away by angry residents, leaving behind an ugly mood that soon exploded into more violence. **********About 90 minutes after Mr. de Klerk's motorcade fled before residents blaming him for the Wednesday violence, police officers fired assault rifles into a hostile crowd in a skirmish over the body of a man shot by the police a short time earlier. The number of casualties was not immediately known. **********Mr. de Klerk's visit, the first by a South African President to one of the country's many scenes of black bloodshed, was intended to repair the deteriorating credibility of the Government as it tries to negotiate a peaceful transition from apartheid to a nonracial state. More Volatile Than Before **********Instead, the day left the black townships more volatile than before, and widened the gulf between the white Government and the African National Congress, the foremost representative of blacks in the talks on South African's future. **********A television cameraman who filmed the shooting today said at least 15 people fell under fire, but he could not say whether any were killed. The police said later that their rifles had been loaded with birdshot and rubber bullets. **********In the Wednesday night assault, at least 40 people, many of them women and children, were shot, stabbed or hacked to death. Witnesses contend that the assault was carried out from a nearby hostel by Zulu supporters of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party who were working in league with the South African police. The official count has grown as wounded victims have died in the hospital. **********The African National Congress has long accused the police of instigating township violence and of helping Inkatha in a campaign to destabilize the black opposition movement. 'Go Away, Go Away!' **********A stone-faced Mr. de Klerk stared out of the back window of his silver-gray BMW as his motorcade crawled under heavy police escort down Bakoena Street, which divides Boipatong's tiny brick bungalows from the corrugated sheds of the Slovo Park squatter camp. **********""To hell with de Klerk -- go away, go away!"" chanted a throng of several hundred people, kept back from Mr. de Klerk's caravan by guards on foot carrying machine guns. **********His car stopped at one point in the midst of Wednesday's killing zone, and security men pushed back the crowd as if the President was preparing to get out. But after surveying the surging, shouting crowd, and perhaps noticing that some teen-agers were clutching rocks, Mr. de Klerk and his entourage sped out of the township as police vehicles moved in to cut off the crowd. **********As they chased the President's entourage down the dusty streets and out of the township, young men in the crowd shouted, ""Shoot! Shoot!"" and the anti-colonial slogan of the militant Pan-Africanist Congress: ""One settler! One bullet!"" **********Mr. de Klerk was untouched during his 15-minute visit, but the South African Press Association later said that one member of his entourage, the local parliamentary representative, Koos Van Der Merwe, had been struck on the head by a rock when he stepped out of his car. The Police Version **********After the President's departure, police armored vehicles roared through the seething township in a show of strength, while firebrands from the Pan-Africanist Congress, a smaller and less compromising rival to the African National Congress, rallied the young crowd. **********According to police accounts, the subsequent violence began when they shot down a township resident seen chasing another with a machete. The police and residents began quarreling over custody of the body, and the argument rapidly intensified. **********Siphiwo Ralo, a cameraman for CBS television, said police officers fired a rifle round into the ground, then knelt in a line and began firing their assault rifles at random into the crowd. **********The police said they opened fire using birdshot and rubber bullets after one of their men was shot in the hand.  Pan-Africanist Congress leaders who were present charged that at least three people were killed by the gunfire. **********The Boipatong massacre curdled Mr. de Klerk's already souring relations with the African National Congress. The congress today issued a statement condemning his visit as ""a cynical public relations exercise."" **********Mr. de Klerk had made rare visits to black townships before today and had generally been well received. But in Boipatong he saw little but the angry crowds and the backs of his security men. **********Presidential aides said he had planned to meet with families of Wednesday's victims and to hold a news conference in the township, but these plans were dropped when security men saw the mood of the crowd. **********At a news conference in the police station at nearby Vereeniging immediately after his visit, Mr. de Klerk said he was shocked at his treatment and charged that the rebuff had been a ""very efficiently planned."" **********Asked about charges of police complicity in the massacre, Mr. de Klerk said: ""I reject that allegation with utter contempt. If any evidence comes to the fore, we will act."" Police Search Hostel **********This morning, police officers searched the Kwamadala Hostel, a steelworkers' residence and stronghold of Zulu-based Inkatha in Vanderbijlpark, which Boipatong residents contend was the staging area for the massacre. Police officers said they had taken statements and confiscated a number of so-called traditional weapons, like spears and clubs. No arrests were made. **********Residents of Boipatong say about 200 warriors from the hostel, which is less than a mile away, swept through the township, hacking and shooting their victims while police supervised and assisted. **********The police have strongly denied playing a role in the massacre, but have yet to give an account of their own activities in the township that night. Inkatha leaders have denied sanctioning the massacre, although they did not rule out the possibility that rogue members of the party were involved. **********A judicial commission on violence headed by Supreme Court Justice Richard Goldstone, a forum widely respected by rival black factions as well as whites, has promised at least a preliminary inquiry into the massacre. The commission's involvement appeared to raise hopes of a credible explanation of the massacre, which could reduce tensions and allow the talks on the country's future to progress."

The heavily armored divisions protecting the old Soviet northern flank have not withdrawn as they have in Central Europe. **********But in all other ways, the cold war seems as dead here as anywhere and security in the Nordic countries facing the old empire to the east is being defined increasingly in nonmilitary terms, like environmental security, economic and social stability in Russia and the improvement of Arctic trade. And if anything, these new security challenges are no less daunting than the old and familiar ones. **********A half-hour's drive from here into Russia, a traveler comes upon one of the symbols of the new definition of security: the hellish sight of a towering, three-stack nickel smelter, one of the largest in the world, which belches out more sulphur dioxide than all sources combined in Norway. The sulphuric acid rain that descends from the factory's triple plumes has turned thousands of acres of Norwegian and Russian woods into wasteland. **********Other factors are also making Norwegian politicians look nervously across the border. For example, Russian politicians visiting Oslo have told Norwegian cabinet ministers that Russian officers cannot feed their wives and children. These politicians have asked Norway's military unions to lend humanitarian aid in hopes this will quell the resentment that is building against Moscow's economic reforms. **********On the environmental front, Norway, Finland and Sweden are in the process of deciding whether the environmental security of the region demands that they help finance part of the cleanup necessary to prevent the nickel plant from doing more damage. **********Farther east are two more sites of constant concern in Norway: two former Soviet nuclear power reactors that have been producing steam for electricity for more than 20 years. Norway's Government is constantly concerned about their safety, and not only because reindeer meat in certain Norwegian mountain ranges is still off limits because of radioactivity from the Chernobyl cloud that passed over Norway in 1986. **********Shutting down these plants would cut power to the 1.2 million military men and civilians in northwest Russia who cannot survive the winters there without a stable power supply. This situation raises not only purely humanitarian concerns but also fears of a wave of immigration to Norway. **********Last month Russian officials acknowledged that the former Soviet navy and ice-breaking fleet dumped much of its radioactive waste in shallow Arctic seas that are part of the region's bountiful fishing grounds. A team of scientists will spend this summer trying to assess the damage. Threats to Norway **********Beyond threats to the environment, Norwegian officials assert the major economic and social dislocations that loom across the border pose threats to stability that are equally significant. **********In a month, one of the largest components of the former Soviet military will begin the largest reduction in forces in three decades and almost no one is willing to predict the social and economic consequences for northwest Russia. **********Norway's Foreign Minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, convened a meeting last month in Tromso of Russian and Norwegian municipal officials in the region to promote a local common market and to build bridges across four decades of suspicion and military orientation. **********""If the day comes when hundreds of thousands of Russian refugees come across our border, it will not be a problem of Norway,"" he warned, ""but a crisis for Europe and the rest of the world."" **********Ivan I. Menshikov, who is President Boris N. Yeltsin's personal political representative in Murmansk, a three hour drive from here, is predicting that tens of thousands of Russian officers involuntarily discharged from the military will hit the local economy beginning June 1 without jobs, apartments or adequate pensions and the situation will get, as he said, ""ugly."" **********How this could affect Norway remains mostly a matter of dark speculation. **********""We do not know the socioeconomic situation of the Russian military in the north, and we have three concerns,"" Defense Minister Johan Joergan Holst said in an interview in Oslo. ""The first is pure humanitarian. We don't want women and children going hungry. The second is, we don't want a restive Russian military, and third, we want to build a long-term relationship with the Russian military in a way that will help keep the military out of politics."" **********To add to Russia's difficulties, Mr. Menshikov, a former colonel in the Soviet Army, said that the military leadership that has long dominated the northern region was undermining Mr. Yeltsin's reform process. In Oslo one day not long ago, the Russian member of Parliament who represents the northern military region, Leonid B. Gurevich, said he feared instability in the officer ranks this summer. ""Some of them have told me directly, 'We spit on your reforms,' "" he said. **********The prospect that the military force reductions in Russia could bring political chaos on Norway's northern border has touched off a debate in Oslo over the Russian politicians' request for aid from this NATO country's military unions for Russian military families.  Undecided on Aid **********So far, Norway's top military officer, Adm. Torolf Rein, has replied that Moscow should stop flying its war planes and testing its ballistic missiles if it needs more money for food. **********Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland remains undecided about the aid proposal because, she said in an interview, she is uncertain of its impact on Russia's military establishment and whether it would help or hurt the forces of democracy. **********People here understand that the cold war is over but many among the four million Norwegians remember the destruction wrought by Germany when it overran Norway in World War II. **********""We are afraid,"" said Ragnar Toender, harbormaster in Bodo, a city that was leveled by German bombing and from which U-2 spy planes were flown against the Soviet Union in the 1950's. **********""We are afraid that something will happen, like Russia going to war with Ukraine and then NATO will have to go to war,"" he said, ""The Russians have atomic bombs and rockets and they have old atomic power stations, and we are afraid of them because we still cannot eat reindeer meat from the mountains that were contaminated by Chernobyl."" **********Sixty percent of Russia's submarine-based strategic nuclear forces are based on the Kola Peninsula. In 1990, more bombers came from Hungary to the northern bases with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. The first Soviet aircraft carrier steamed out of the Black Sea and joined the northern fleet last winter. **********But even with a modest buildup, there are overwhelming signs of contraction. **********On the streets of Murmansk, Russian officers are ambivalent about reform but proud of their military legacy. The plan to shrink the former northern fleet by 40 percent over the next three years comes none too soon for those already clamoring to get out. **********The new commander of the northern fleet, Vice Adm. Oleg Yerofeyev, told the local press that in reducing the fleet by a third, he will deactivate 25 to 30 warships. But his biggest problem will be the transition in personnel. Some Can't Leave **********Many officers in the northern fleet are frustrated that their service has not delivered them a future. ""I personally cannot leave the armed forces because I have no place to live,"" said Senior Lieut. Vasily Belov, 26, rushing down the street last week in a gray trenchcoat and white scarf. ""If I had a place to live, I would leave. I would like to have a second child but I can't afford one now."" **********Building a new economy in northwest Russia is perhaps the most daunting of the challenges facing the civil authorities in Murmansk and in Moscow. The road between northern Norway and Murmansk is carrying 10 times the traffic it did a year ago. Trading companies are bringing in Western goods and taking Russian fish, timber and ore in payment. **********But the Russian Arctic zone is a creature of the Soviet state, and it will take more than barter trade to transform it. The largest enterprises have been the Soviet military, fishing industry, mining and timber industries and shipping. Fishing, mining and timber will continue to prosper and reap hard currency for the region and for Moscow. But other industries seem doomed. **********The big submarine construction yard at Severodvinsk has just begun to study conversion, but no one in Norway believes that any private enterprise could support the work force of 120,000 that used to be there."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/18/business/credit-markets-bonds-fall-as-convention-opens.html,Jonathan Fuerbringer,1992-08-18,,1265,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bonds Fall as Convention Opens,CREDIT MARKETS; Bonds Fall as Convention Opens," **********The bond market fell yesterday as investors waited to see what kind of economic program the Republicans would outline at their convention in Houston. **********But the pause in the market, with the resulting rise in yields, has not discouraged big borrowers from continuing to lower their interest costs by recalling old debt at higher rates and issuing new notes or bonds at much lower rates. Even with the decline yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond is still lower than it was in Janaury. **********The Tennessee Valley Authority made such a move yesterday, issuing $700 million in new 30-year bonds that together with earlier refinancings has lowered the utility's annual borrowing costs by $200 million. **********After comments by James A. Baker 3d, the incoming chief of staff, helped undermine the bond market on Thursday, traders said they were paying more attention to the impact of the election, especially during this convention week. There has been talk of President Bush proposing some kind of tax cut to help stimulate the economy, a proposal that has some investors worried because it could signal a rise in the record Federal budget deficit. **********Analysts said that the decline in bond and note prices, which saw the 30-year bond down almost half a point, was also a continuation of the correction after a rally in the bond market that pushed up prices and reduced yields on the 30-year bond to five-and-a-half-year lows. Eyes on Meeting of the Fed **********Eyes were also on the meeting this week of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which could cut short-term interest rates again soon. Some analysts do not expect the committee to act during the Republican convention. But there is a growing feeling that the Fed, given the steady diet or recent sluggish economic data, will act again by the fall. **********It is, however, hard to gauge what the Fed will do. And it is almost equally hard to keep track of the feelings in the market about whether the Fed will ease again or not. Lately a new Fed easing, like the half of a percentage point reduction in the Federal funds rate and the discount rate on July 2,, has been greeted by conclusions that it would be the last cut the Fed would make. Then as new economic data came out showing the the economy was still barely growing, the mood among traders and investors would swing back toward the belief that the Fed would have to act again. **********""We're likely to have one more easing, if just for political and psychological reasons,"" said Thomas Synnott, chief economist at the U.S. Trust Company of New York. ""But I don't think it will help very much,"" he added, because he expects only a quarter of a percentage point cut in the target Federal funds rate, which is now at 3.25 percent. **********In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.25 percent, 30-year bond was offered at 98 25/32, down 15/32 to yield 7.35 percent, compared with 7.31 percent on Friday. **********The 6.375 percent 10-year note was off 7/32, to yield 6.52 percent, compared with 6.5 percent at the end of last week. But the 5.5 percent five-year note was unchanged to yield 5.49 percent. **********In the weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the discount rate fell for the second consecutive week, a reflection of the growing expectation of another easing by the Fed. The average discount rate for the three-month bill of 3.10 percent was the lowest since Feb. 14, 1972. And the average yield of 3.18 percent for the six-month bill was the lowest since July 1, 1963. **********In the municipal market prices were off sharply and yields rose. the average yield of The Bond Buyer Index of major municipal securities was up to 6.22 percent from 6.20 percent. One executive at a firm involved in the municipal market said that the prices were falling because a lot of Wall Street firms had bought much of the new municipal issues in recent weeks and were having trouble moving them on to retail or institutional investors. ""These have to be priced more attractively,"" he said, especially because there is another $4 billion to $5 billion of new municipal issues expected this week. Concern Over Situation in Iraq **********In the Treasury market, some traders said there was also concern yesterday that the United States would have to take some retaliatory action against Iraq, which could lead to a jump in oil prices. President Bush, in an interview on the Cable News Network, said, as he has many times recently, that he would not let President Saddam Hussein of Iraq renege on agreements involving the destruction of the country's major weapons of war. **********""I think he's just trying to thumb his nose at the rest of the world and he's not going to get away with it,"" the President said. **********But traders thought the convention and just the need for a market correction had more to do with the decline yesterday. **********If one thinks about it, it seems a little odd that investors and dealers are just now focusing on the Republican National Convention in Houston and the effect any economic stimulus program might have on the economy and the bond market. **********Analysts and investors have known for a long time that the convention was this week and that a sluggish economy would prompt an economic stimulus program by the Democrats, if the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton, wins, and possibly by the Republicans. **********Although this is the case, in the bond market, as in other markets, like foreign exchange, the focus of investors tends at times to be single minded. And until Mr. Baker spoke last week the focus was on slow economic growth, low inflation and the growing conviciton that both these eoconomic developments were so positive for the bond market that they would push the yield on the 30-year bond as low as 7 percent by the end of the year. **********Now, after the rally paused last week, the attention of investors has been distracted enough to make them worry about the convention and what it might tell them. **********But that does not mean the rally cannot resume again if the news is not bad. In fact, the bond rally of July paused during the Democratic Naitonal Convention because of the surge of Mr. Clinton in the polls. But it resumed the next week, even as Mr. Clinton's popularity seemed to grow. **********Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures)                        3-Mo.

Bo has known baseball, and vows to know it again. And, of course, Bo knows advertising. Now, CBS is audaciously trying to convince viewers that Bo also knows enough about television to serve as a sort of critic. **********""Bo Knows Shows"" is the theme of what CBS executives say is their first on-the-air promotional campaign featuring a celebrity spokesman who endorses the network's programming. The campaign, which will be introduced with teaser commercials tomorrow, stars Bo Jackson, the professional athlete who has been sidelined in his dual-sport career by a serious hip injury. **********The commercials, which will run on CBS through the fall, will begin in earnest on Tuesday, during CBS's telecast of the 1992 baseball All-Star Game. They are the latest in a flock of ads from the television networks to sell their series in the same manner that television advertisers sell soup, soap and soft drinks. **********CBS, which during the 1991-92 season leaped from third to first place in prime-time ratings, has been the most aggressive in adapting the tactics of packaged-goods marketing to broadcasting. **********""Part of what we're selling is not CBS, but an attitude of leadership,"" George F. Schweitzer, senior vice president of CBS marketing and communications, said yesterday during an interview at CBS's headquarters in midtown Manhattan. ""And promotion plays a big role in that."" **********He added: ""We have a saying, 'You are what you air.' People watch programs, not networks. But networks do have personalities."" **********Joseph Abruzzese, senior vice president of network sales, said the campaign would enable CBS to tap into consumers' avid interest in Mr. Jackson's comeback attempts. **********""People want to see him succeed,"" he said. And in advertising and media, as in sports, nothing succeeds like success. **********In its humorous tone and fast-paced style, the CBS campaign is evocative of, and derived from, Mr. Jackson's award-winning ""Bo Knows"" advertising for Nike Inc., created by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. CBS sought, and received, the blessings of Nike and Wieden to follow in their footsteps; they even lent CBS Joe Pytka, the director of many of Nike's best-known spots. Nike and Wieden also approved a commercial in the ""Bo Knows"" style, starring Mr. Jackson, that Ogilvy & Mather Direct in New York created in 1990 for A.T.& T. **********Such authorized homages are a shrewd strategy, according to Brian T. Murphy, editor and publisher of The Sports Marketing Letter in Westport, Conn. **********""Nike has a big investment in Bo,"" he said, ""so they have a real interest in trying to get value out of that relationship."" **********Mr. Murphy believes Mr. Jackson is ""still a star"" in terms of endorsements, despite his inactivity. **********""The potential is still there,"" he added. ""And one thing that must be remembered is that if he makes a comeback, and he excels, that would be one of the greatest comeback stories in the history of sports. **********""And that would make him torridly hot."" **********Torrid was an apt word for Mr. Jackson's ad career, which had soared since he appeared in his first ""Bo knows"" Nike commercial in 1989. He then divided his ad work between Nike and other marketers like A.T.& T. and Pepsi-Cola. **********After Mr. Jackson was injured playing football for the Los Angeles Raiders last year, there was speculation that his career as an endorser would be over. Instead, he has remained in the spotlight, in large part because of a hilarious Nike commercial last summer about his rehabilitation regimen to recover from his injury. **********That premise is also used by CBS. If Mr. Jackson is not playing sports, what is he doing? Working out in a bid to return to the Chicago White Sox -- and watching television. **********""It'll be quite a while before Bo can hit or run or field like he used to,"" Mr. Jackson says in a teaser spot, using his characteristic third-person references to himself. **********Holding up a sign that says, ""Watch the All-Star Game on CBS,"" he adds, ""But Bo can still pitch."" **********The funniest of the spots shows Mr. Jackson in his training room, doing one-armed push-ups as ""60 Minutes"" plays on a giant television set. **********""Bo loves working out during '60 Minutes,' "" he says. ""When the show's over, Bo knows it's time to do push-ups with his other arm."" **********The arrangement between CBS and Nike to use Mr. Jackson has no quid pro quo involving advertising, Mr. Abruzzese said, adding that CBS ""already has a big share of their sports advertising."" **********Indeed, Mr. Jackson's CBS spots will share air time during the All-Star Game with Wieden's latest ""Bo Knows"" commercial for Nike. Called ""Bo's Hip,"" it will contrast his active life with that of a typical viewer. **********""What are you and your good hip doing right now?"" the spot asks. The answer: ""Watching commercials."""

Pressure From Two Sides **********The Prime Minister found himself caught between rebels within his own party, who are calling on the Government to abandon the treaty entirely, and demands from other European governments not to delay the ratification of the treaty. The Dutch even suggested that Britain was deliberately stalling. **********British officials expressed doubt today that Britain could ratify the treaty before the end of the year. It now awaits action in Parliament, and a senior Government official said he was uncertain whether the treaty would pass if put to a vote today. **********The 12 leaders of the European Community are due to gather on Oct. 16, presumably in London, to discuss where the unification process is headed next, in the wake of last weekend's wafer-thin ratification by French voters. Mr. Major is now serving as president of the community, a post that revolves among the member states every six months. **********Mr. Major defused some criticism of his economic policy when the Government moved on Tuesday to lower the base interest rate by one percentage point, to 9 percent. Backbench members of Parliament in his Conservative Party as well as the opposition Labor Party pushed for the reduction, to help an economic recovery. **********Still, key Labor Party critics will argue on Thursday that the Government betrayed Britain last week by doing what it vowed it never would do: remove the British currency from the European monetary system and let it fall in value. Trouble Within His Own Party **********Mr. Major also faced trouble over his economic policy from skeptics of closer European integration within his own party, who want him to pledge to keep Britain out of the European monetary system permanently. The Government has said it remains committed to the currency system, which sets upper and lower limits for the value of all European currencies, and will return the pound to it when Britain feels it is in its interest to do so. **********Sir Teddy Taylor, a Conservative member of Parliament, today called the system ""a dead duck"" and called on Mr. Major to pledge on Thursday never to have anything further to do with any fixed exchange rate mechanism. **********Senior officials said the Government's new economic policy would rely on lower interest rates and sharply reduced public spending in an effort to jump-start the economy without increasing inflation. **********In the discussion over unification, a senior British official today ruled out any renegotiation of the treaty. But he said Britain would urge European leaders to talk about agreeing to some sort of additional declaration or protocol that would enable the treaty ""to be more democratic and less interfering, and to take more account of national interests."" **********Prime Minister Poul Schluter of Denmark, who will meet with Mr. Major here next week, says his Government would consider putting the treaty up for a second referendum in Denmark, but only if the European Community agreed to exempt it from key points, including the provision for a common currency. **********Mr. Major received a lift of sorts from the Labor Party today, when its leadership voted to oppose any move to force a referendum among the British people, similar to the ballots in Denmark and France. **********Some members of the Labor Party, as well as Conservative critics, have been pushing the Government to put the treaty before the people, rather than confine the debate to Parliament."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/07/business/company-news-continental-plan-to-end-bankruptcy.html,Agis Salpukas,1992-02-07,,660,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Continental Plan to End Bankruptcy,COMPANY NEWS; Continental Plan to End Bankruptcy," **********Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan yesterday in which its major unsecured creditors agreed to reduce the carrier's debt and interest costs sharply. In return, the creditors would get stock, making them owners of the airline. **********If the plan is approved by the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., analysts say, it will greatly help the company survive the current slump and fare cutting in the airline business and enable it to become profitable in a recovery. **********""This gives them the best chance at wiping the slate clean and starting over,"" said Helane Becker, the airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers. Has Remained Competitive **********Continental filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in December 1990. But passengers and travel agents continued to support the airline after the filing, and the carrier also maintained a good cash position by selling assets. **********The Continental plan is similar to one filed by Trans World Airlines last week. T.W.A.'s unsecured creditors agreed to reduce the carrier's debt by $1 billion in exchange for stock, and bondholders accepted much lower interest rates. **********Under the Continental agreement, long-term debt would be reduced by about 70 percent, to $1.7 billion from $5.8 billion. This would help cut the airline's annual interest costs by $270 million. **********It is expected that current stockholders will get nothing, which was what the airline had said for the last year. Continental stock closed at 43.75 cents the American Stock Exchange yesterday, off 56.25 cents. **********In such situations. unsecured creditors often have little choice but to accept stock for debt because forcing an airline like Continental to liquidate can throw hundreds of planes and other assets on the market at a time when there is small demand for them. **********One significant uncertainty remains. Continental has not reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which has about $700 million in claims involving insufficient financing of the pension plan for Continental's defunct Eastern Airlines. When Eastern liquidated in January 1990, Continental was forced to take over the obligations. Its Second Bankruptcy **********This is the second time that Continental has sought to reorganize under Chapter 11. In 1986, Frank Lorenzo, then the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation -- the forerunner of Continental Airlines Holdings -- put the carrier under Chapter 11, repudiated union contracts and cut costs and salaries. The airline was able to become profitable again, but it ran into trouble when it absorbed the failing People Express and lost support from business travelers because of service problems. **********Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, continues to have problems attracting business travelers, who make up only about 25 percent of its passengers compared with about 50 percent for other big carriers. **********Robert R. Ferguson 3d, vice chairman and chief executive of Continental, said that he was encouraged by a recent increase in traffic and that the bookings for the next several months seemed encouraging as well. **********Under the plan, the company will keep its 43,000 employees and its present level of flights. **********There have been talks about a possible merger with T.W.A., but they are at an early stage. The plan is not dependent on a merger and is meant to make the carrier workable as an independent airline without outside investment. **********Kevin Murphy, the airline analyst for Morgan Stanley, said that of the three airlines now under Chapter 11 -- America West, T.W.A. and Continental -- Continental had the best chance to reorganize. He said that the airline was large enough to compete and had strong hubs in Newark and Houston, where the parent company is based. **********The major creditors of the airline are bondholders who would take the largest loss in exchanging their debt for stock. There are 56,000 prepetition proofs of claim, totaling $4.3 billion, that would be converted to equity."

'A Pre-emptory Move' **********""This was a pre-emptory move that Halliburton had to make to keep up with the competition,"" said Bill Mankivsky, portfolio manager for a Fidelity mutual fund that invests in oilfield service companies. **********Like other drillers, Halliburton has had weak earnings the last two years, mainly because of faltering drilling rates. Through Sept. 30 its profits this year have fallen 34.5 percent, to $55.2 million. It is No. 2 in sales after Schlumberger, with nearly $3 billion in its energy services group. **********The Dallas-based company has slashed its oilfield services work force in the United States by 5,000 in the last year, to 15,000, and recently announced plans to auction its insurance services group, which had more than $500 million in revenue last year. **********James Crandell, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Halliburton's bid for Smith's directional drilling unit underscored the move by oilfield service concerns to provide total drilling packages to their big customers, the major oil companies. Numbers Restricted **********Big Oil has restricted the number of suppliers for drilling services to cut costs, and this has provided new opportunities to oilfield services companies that could provide a one-stop shopping and operation service, like Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. **********Smith's directional drilling unit has appealing technology in precision drilling and in evaluating geological formations surrounding a well during the drilling process, said James L. Carroll, a drilling industry analyst at Paine Webber Inc. **********Precision drilling, known in the industry as measurement while drilling, is especially important for wells drilled at angles or horizontally through an oil-and-gas field. The techniques are used frequently in exploring and producing from platforms in offshore fields. **********Of the 914 rigs operating last week in the United States, 87 were drilling angled, or directional, wells and 45 were horizontal wells, according to Baker Hughes. **********For Smith, the sale of the directional drilling unit will pare annual sales of $400 million by roughly 40 percent. Mr. Crandell said pressures for more consolidation in the drilling industry could force the company to sell its small down-hole tools and services unit within a year and perhaps even its drill-bit unit, which ranks No. 2 among global suppliers, after Baker Hughes. But Loren Carroll, Smith's executive vice president, said in an interview that his company expected to prosper in both markets. **********Halliburton's share price fell 37.5 cents today, to $28.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Smith International's shares rose 50 cents, to $8.50, with 1.5 million shares traded."

Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates chains like Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's and Lazarus, posted a 6.6 percent rise at stores open at least one year, a closely watched indicator of retail performance. Mervyn's, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation that sells moderately priced clothing, saw comparable-store sales climb 11 percent. 'Some Broad-Based Strengths' **********And Sears, Roebuck & Company and Circuit City Stores Inc. reported strong sales of consumer electronics and appliances, big-ticket durable items that are of little interest to shoppers in a weak economy. **********""You're seeing some broad-based strengths in the numbers,"" said Margo McGlade, a retail analyst at Paine Webber. ""But it's hard to know whether you should read anything into it. We haven't seen a pickup in auto sales and consumer confidence, and that makes me somewhat skeptical of projecting on the basis of September sales."" **********Those stores that have consistently raised sales throughout the recession had another strong month, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reporting a 12 percent rise at stores open at least one year and Gap Inc. ratcheting up an 11 percent increase. Gap cautioned, however, that heavy promotions were partly responsible. **********Paine Webber's index of the sales performance of 20 large retail chains rose 7 percent in September, compared with 4.5 percent in August. A similar index of 15 retailers compiled by Salomon Brothers jumped 7.5 percent last month, compared with a 4.6 percent increase for August. But analysts cautioned that the results were misleading because of aberrations in the calendar. 'We Continue to Move Sideways' **********Retailers reported somewhat disappointing sales for August because shoppers were waiting for Labor Day promotions. But averaging August and September results together, most retailers sold about as much merchandise as they expected to sell, analysts said. **********""I think when you look at the two months' sales combined, you see we continue to move sideways,"" said Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities. For example, in the combined August-September period, Federated's comparable-store sales grew 4.9 percent, and Dayton Hudson's were up 3 percent. **********Mr. Hood said the weak California economy would keep a lid on sales growth for many retailers with a presence there, preventing comparable-store sales from growing much more than 4 percent this year. Other analysts are slightly more optimistic, projecting an increase of 5 to 5.5 percent for the year. **********Analysts differ on how the holiday sales season, when retailers make the largest portion of their annual profits, is shaping up. Some believe that tight inventories, controlled expenses and virtually nonexistent inflation -- translating into favorable accounting adjustments -- will enable retail companies to generate higher profits in the fourth quarter. **********""Consumer spending will not be ebullient at Christmas, but for the first time in four years, retailers will have good profits then,"" said Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon. **********Kimberly Walin, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers , said the stronger sales momentum in September has continued into the first week of this month. ""What will happen is still anyone's guess,"" she said. ""But if August and September tend to be strong, you typically don't get a weak Christmas."" **********So far, most retailers have avoided the excessive price-cutting that has eroded profits over the last several years. The cooler weather in September caused shoppers to buy their winter wardrobes a little earlier, which means merchants may take fewer markdowns in October. Retailers' Sales Outlined  By The Associated Press **********Following are the domestic September sales reported by some of the nation's largest retailers. The data compare the current year's sales with those of the previous year. **********Sales include those from stores open at least a year and overall sales.

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/06/world/serbian-guns-resume-heavy-shelling-of-sarajevo.html,John Burns,1992-10-06,,920,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Serbian Guns Resume Heavy Shelling of Sarajevo,Serbian Guns Resume Heavy Shelling of Sarajevo," **********Six months to the day after Serbian nationalist forces began their war for Sarajevo, the city exploded today with one of the most intense Serbian bombardments of the siege. **********At least 21 people were killed and scores injured as volley after volley of tank fire hit civilian neighborhoods. The bombardments set several high-rise buildings on fire and prompted residents to hurl their belongings over the balconies of blazing apartments in an effort to save their property. **********One of the buildings hit by incendiary shells was the seven-story headquarters of Elektroprivreda, the utility that has struggled, in vain in recent weeks, to keep at least some electricity flowing to the city. The utility's offices were gutted in a blaze that lasted most of the day and consumed virtually all the utility's records. Another building that was hit by several tank shells and set afire, but not so seriously damaged, was the Holiday Inn, which has been the city's principal hotel since it was built for the Winter Olympic Games held in Sarajevo in 1984. **********After intensive attacks last month, Serbian forces, who surround the city from mountainside gun positions, had relented somewhat, shelling with sufficient frequency to maintain anxiety in the streets but withholding the barrages that kept the city terrorized through much of September. **********The lull ended abruptly shortly after dawn today, when dozens of guns opened up on neighborhoods where most families were still in bed. **********The heaviest fire was concentrated on Hrasno, in the geographic center of the city, immediately beneath Serbian tank, artillery and anti-aircraft guns dug in on the hillsides of Vraca, an adjacent neighborhood that is a principal Serbian salient into the city. Most of Sarajevo is held by the Muslim-led forces of the Bosnian Government. Apartments Are Targets **********At some points in Hrasno, the Serbian heavy guns are barely 500 yards from high-rise apartment buildings. Today, the guns opened up directly on the high-rises, setting fire to three 20-story buildings in the neighborhood of Pero Kosorica square, a grassy playground area. The upper floors burned fiercely for hours, and flames were still leaping into the night sky more than 12 hours after the attacks began.  Saving Personal Belongings **********As high winds fanned the flames, residents in several apartments could be seen dashing to their balconies and throwing bundles of clothes, and in at least one case armfuls of books, over the railings. Several times, the clothing snagged on lower balconies and caught fire before being blown back into the air by the wind. **********With no electricity to drive the pumps that maintain water pressure in the city's mains, and only enough power from their diesel-powered pumps to run hoses to the fifth floor of the buildings, Sarajevo's fire department was powerless to douse the flames on the higher floors. **********In the streets below, Bosnian infantry forces could be seen dashing from building to building in what their commander said was a battle to keep Serbs from pushing further into the city. **********The commander, Mario Frimel, said the fighting was the worst the Hrasno neighborhood had seen in the war. **********""We have five civilians lying dead out there,"" he said of Pero Kosorica square, ""but we can't get to them because of the snipers."" **********Clinics in the neighborhood said that they had received 9 dead and 21 wounded by midafternoon, all of them civilians and most of them victims of tank and sniper fire. The Kosevo Hospital, the city's largest, reported seven dead by mid-afternoon, and said that they had received many dead or wounded civilians and it had reports of many others who had been killed in neighborhoods that ambulances could not reach. **********One middle-aged man in a torn suit was rushed into the hospital's trauma clinic with a gaping wound in his back from a sniper bullet, but doctors promptly told orderlies to wheel him across the street to the morgue. **********The attacks came as Serbian leaders, who launched the Sarajevo siege on April 5, and officials of the Geneva-based peace conference discussed proposals that would ""demilitarize"" the city before winter. Wide differences between the Serbian leaders and the Bosnian Government have snagged the proposals, and most people in Sarajevo say any reprieve from the siege here is unlikely. **********Many Sarajevans say that the Serbs' purpose in alternately pounding the city, then relenting, is to foster terror by reminding people that they can never be sure of returning safely from a trip to the corner for bread. **********One view is that Serbs still hope to cut the city in half by driving down from the southern side of the Miljacka River and joining up with forces from the hills to the north. Hrasno is one of the few footholds the city's defenders possess on the southern side of the river. **********Another view is that the Serbs hope to take over the city through a combination of bombardments and the stranglehold of winter. **********Officials of the electrical utility sounded almost resigned over the destruction of their headquarters. The officials had been meeting in the building daily, making plans to repair transmission lines that the Serbs have put out of action. **********""It is hopeless,"" one utility official said tonight, after watching as the utility's headquarters burned. ""Before, we had no power, but we had the building, and we could talk. Now, we don't even have the building."""

A generation of acronym-loving Pentagon planners knew it best as COSVN. A Commercial Emphasis **********In a demonstration of how much has changed in Vietnam since the war, the museum will be dedicated more to commerce than to Communism. **********The Vietnamese Government, which has come to understand the value of hard-currency tourism, intends to charge a visitor's fee and to turn a profit from the museum, which will be a day trip from the old southern capital of Saigon, now known officially as Ho Chi Minh City, about 75 miles southeast of here. **********""The entrance fee has not yet been determined, but whatever it is, we think visitors from all over the world, including America, will want to come see this place,"" said Capt. Nguyen Tan Khanh, a border policeman who is the local military commander. ""This will always be a place of victory, a symbol for all Vietnamese to be proud of."" **********In the minds of many American commanders, COSVN was imagined to be a sort of mini-Pentagon, with its own vast bureaucracy that worked in elaborate, heavily fortified war rooms where the guerrilla war in the south was planned in collaboration with the North Vietnamese Army. **********If the restored structures look anything like the originals, the truth is that the base was only a few small, open-air huts with packed-dirt floors that were connected to one another by several hundred yards of cramped underground tunnels. The tunnels were intentionally made narrow to prevent the possibility that big-framed American soldiers might squeeze through. **********""The tunnels were meant to protect our leaders from the bomb blasts,"" Captain Khanh said. ""The Americans did try to find this place."" He pointed to a weed-covered fish pond, perhaps 25 feet wide and a stone's throw from several huts, that was created from the crater of an American bomb dropped here in the late 1960's. **********One hut served as the Vietcong's central command room and it was said to have been furnished during the war with only a single long wooden table. The Vietnamese discarded the historic table years ago ""because it was in bad condition and useless,"" Captain Khanh said. **********The location is a densely wooded area in the Vietnamese province of Tay Ninh, two miles from the border with Cambodia, a site that allowed the Vietcong leaders to flee across the border to the relative safety of Cambodia when American forces approached. **********Captain Khanh, who serves as the museum's unofficial historian, said the Vietcong used the compound from the mid-1960's to 1969, when they moved the base to Cambodia in response to American bombing. In 1972, the Vietcong returned to Tay Ninh and remained here until the fall of Saigon three years later, he said. **********""It was a very secret place,"" Truong Quangson, a provincial official in Tay Ninh who served with the Vietcong during the war. ""We knew the headquarters were in the province, but we did not know exactly where. There were only a few local guides who knew the way through the jungle to here."" **********To prevent enemy soldiers stumbling on to the base and living to tell about it, the huts were ringed by booby traps and dirt pits. At the bottom of the pits were bamboo spikes designed to impale anyone who fell in. **********Many of the Vietcong's leaders now serve in senior posts in the central Vietnamese Government, including Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. The hut that served as his home and office here has been rebuilt, and Mr. Kiet has visited several times and told young soldiers of the hardships of the war years. **********""This was not a comfortable place to be, then or now,"" said Captain Khanh. **********The Vietcong leaders, he said, were plagued by malaria and dysentery. They slept in hammocks strung between bamboo poles in the huts, but that did not always prevent poisonous jungle snakes from dropping down on victims from the thatched roof. ""And if the snake didn't kill you, you killed the snake,"" Captain Khanh explained. ""For the Vietcong soldiers, snake meat was a very important food."""

In the last 11 months, the United States Navy has pulled 12,000 men and women out of Subic in what it says is the largest withdrawal in naval history.What Once Was **********The Subic base, 42 miles north of Manila and the largest United States base overseas, served as a major repair and supply site, where an experienced cadre of Philippine workers was always available at wages considerably less than those paid in Hawaii or California. **********The naval base and the Subic Bay Naval Air Station, together with Clark Air Force Base nearby, were centers of United States military operations during the wars in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. **********But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, security concerns have lessened and more attention is being paid to economic and other regional issues. **********""We look ahead to an era where economic relations and new forms of military cooperation -- cooperation without the bases -- characterize United States-Philippine relations,"" the American Ambassador, Richard H. Solomon, said during the ceremony.Spain, U.S., Japan, U.S. **********Since the United States took over the Philippines from Spain after a brief war at the turn of the century, the bases formed the core of United States relations with its first colony. Through the years, that relationship has been a tangled one. **********After the Philippines gained its independence after World War II, during which the islands were occupied by Japan until recovered by United States forces, Manila and Washington signed treaties allowing continued use of the bases. Then, last year, the Philippine legislature rejected the latest renewal. **********Increasingly nationalistic Filipinos view the base as a colonial relic and say American servicemen have left only a legacy of social problems, including abandoned Amerasian children and thousands of women who have lost their jobs in the entertainment industry in Olongapo, just outside the base. **********But other Filipinos, including the Mayor of Olongapo, Richard Gordon, see the abandoned base as a key to the country's long-delayed economic recovery. He wants to convert the base into a free-trade zone for foreign investors.'New Framework' **********President Fidel V. Ramos sought to put the relationship on a more even keel. He assured the United States in his speech that ""we have a continuing community of strategic and economic interests"" based on a ""new framework for Philippine-American relations,"" including trade and a common commitment to democracy. **********Mr. Ramos also stressed the social problems caused by the troops and appealed to the ""Americans' sense of civil responsibility"" to address these problems. **********The Rev. Shay Cullen, an Irish priest and a tireless critic of the base who has worked in Olongapo for 25 years, said, ""The Americans are leaving behind a legacy of child and woman abuse and a totally empty economy."" **********The once-garish honky-tonk town is now quiet and empty. In the past year, 30,000 Filipino workers at the base have been laid off and thousands more who made a living from the bars, restaurants and souvenir shops in Olongapo lost their jobs.Promoting a Leftover Base **********Mayor Gordon says the city's salvation lies in the $8-billion complex the Americans left behind. This includes an airport with a 9,000-foot runway and the remnants of a comfortable life -- 1,800 bungalows, riding stables, a golf course, even a tortilla factory. **********But despite tax and other incentives, foreign investors have been cautious. So far Mr. Gordon, who has been put in charge of converting the base, has found a company to operate a 400-room hotel and to convert the officers' club to a Chinese restaurant. A telecommunications company is also to set up shop soon. **********The people of Olongapo turned up in their Sunday best at the turnover ceremony. Later, as the last remaining marines boarded the helicopter carrier, which will take them to Okinawa, busloads of weeping women turned up at the pier, waving frantic goodbyes and blowing kisses.'The Party's Over' **********""I don't want to leave,"" Pfc.

Baker 3d and his principal aides had been disappointed with the lack of success of earlier United States efforts to influence events in Yugoslavia. **********""Bush feels the same way,"" a second official familiar with Yugoslav affairs said of the President. **********Reiterating the United States' condemnation of ""the perpetrators of violence in Bosnia on all sides"" for the 10th time in as many working days, Margaret D.

""Everyone will continue to try."" But she said she was unaware of any major ""or even, to be honest with you, minor overall policy review.""  Fighting Increases **********On April 7, President Bush declared that the United States was recognizing the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. The Administration hoped this would help end the fighting there, especially the battles in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Serbian forces had seized large chunks of territory. **********Instead, the fighting increased, and a week later Mr. Baker proposed suspending Serbia from the 51-member Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, issuing a sharp protest to the Belgrade authorities, dispatching a senior assistant to Bosnia and Herzegovina to report on the situation and arranging six Air Force flights of emergency relief supplies there. **********With assaults on Bosnia and Herzegovina by Serbian forces, including the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army, continuing, Mr. Baker took the initiative again on April 20, calling West European allies to propose the joint breaking of diplomatic relations with Belgrade. Only Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, voiced approval. Other officials in the Administration questioned the wisdom of such a radical move. **********At that point, Mr. Baker's resolve began to sag, said Administration officials familiar with the evolution of policy on Yugoslavia. **********""Secretary Baker has decided to disengage from the issue,"" a high-ranking official said. ""There is simply no solution. But there is a high level of frustration."" **********Although fighting is continuing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States chose not to press for the suspension of Serbia from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at its meeting in Helsinki last Wednesday, Administration officials said. The only action taken at the meeting was to admit Bosnia and Herzegovina as a new member. **********This is the second time in 10 months that Mr. Baker has plunged into the Yugoslav crisis and then withdrawn. Last June he visited Belgrade and conferred with all of the leaders of what were then the six federative republics of Yugoslavia, as well as its federal leadership. **********He left believing he had extracted commitments from each not to take steps that might cause an outbreak of civil war. Five days later, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from the Yugoslav federation and fighting broke out. Mr. Baker then decided that the United States should step back and permit the European Community to take the lead in trying to solve the Yugoslav crisis. **********But a senior American diplomat contended recently that ""there is no international institution with sufficient powers to deal with Yugoslavia."" **********Another high-ranking Administration official said, ""There is no policy on Yugoslavia now, other than to follow the lead of the European Community."" **********But the 12-member community is split over how forcefully to deal with Serbia and over how to deal at all with the newly independent republic of Macedonia, which Greece opposes."

H. Macy & Company has told its suppliers and their financial advisers that it expects to report positive cash flow for its fourth quarter ended July 31, reversing the results of the two previous quarters. **********Although Macy will not issue financial statements for the fourth quarter or for July until the end of October, it disclosed information about its liquidity and its cash flow projections in a report to agencies that monitor retailers' credit as well as to garment industry financiers and some suppliers. **********The company said its efforts to control expenses and inventory and maintain gross-profit margins had helped counter the effects of straitened economic conditions in regions of the country where its stores were concentrated. A Promising Sign **********""Higher unemployment and weaker consumer confidence, particularly in the company's strongest market areas of San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, continued to depress the sales performance of Macy's stores in July,"" Diane Price Baker, Macy's senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in the report Friday. **********Despite depressed sales, Ms. Baker said, Macy's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortizationwould enable the retailer to satisfy the requirements of the debtor-in-possession financing package that was arranged when Macy filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 27. Debtor-in-possession financing gives companies that file under the bankruptcy laws a line of credit to pay for continuing operations. **********Suppliers said Macy's ability to generate some positive cash flow despite weakened sales performance was encouraging. ""I think it signals that they've spent some time getting their inventories into shape, and now there's a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Ltd., a fashion apparel manufacturer that ships its goods to Macy. ""Are they out of the woods yet? Who knows, but it's a first good sign."" **********Mr. Konheim said the report would also help assuage concerns about Macy management's ability to stabilize the company's business. Conservative Fall Strategy **********In its monthly financial report to the Federal bankruptcy court, Macy's has detailed losses that have raised eyebrows on Seventh Avenue. Macy reported an operating loss of $32.9 million in June, plus interest expenses and restructuring charges that brought its total loss for the month to $64.7 million. **********The extent of the losses, which have been running at about $1 million a day, has caused some in the garment industry to wonder whether Macy would meet financing requirements. **********As of Aug. 1, Macy's had access to $76.1 million in cash and $509.2 million of its debtor-in-possession financing. Ms. Baker said the company would start borrowing from its working capital this month to buy fall and holiday merchandise. **********She said Macy's fall sales plan was conservative, taking account of the stagnant economy and a program to reduce promotions and markdowns."

Hurwitz, a controversial Houston entrepreneur, in exchange for a majority stake in the company. **********Executives familiar with Continental's attempt to reorganize under bankruptcy laws -- and who spoke only on condition that they not be identified -- said that Continental was also close to reaching an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation over $700 million in underfunded pension liabilities it inherited from Eastern Airlines, once its sister company under its former parent, the Texas Air Corporation. **********They also said that the carrier had reached a settlement with a court-appointed examiner over financial damage Eastern may have suffered in transactions with Texas Air. **********With the settlements, Continental, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on Dec. 3, 1990, could put to rest lingering liabilities from the legacy of Frank Lorenzo, who controlled both Eastern and Continental through Texas Air. **********And with the capital from Mr. Hurwitz, Continental could strengthen the chances that its debt-reorganization plan will be approved by its creditors and the bankruptcy court. Cure for Continental **********""There has never been anything wrong with Continental that a good balance sheet could not cure,"" said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley. ""It is very competitive. It has a very good route structure with strategic hubs placed throughout the United States. Its service has been improving."" **********Mr. Hurwitz, a 52-year-old Texan, is the chairman of Maxxam Inc., a Houston-based conglomerate that has made several acquisitions over the years. **********As collateral for the investment, Continental would put up Air Micronesia, its Pacific operations, to guaratee $150 million of the $350 million investment. The rest would be backed by other Continental assets. **********The agreement for Continential, which was reached between a group of investors led by Mr. Hurwitz and the airline, calls for the Maxxam group to receive $325 million in secured notes, 65 million shares of class B common stock and warrants to purchase 130 million shares of class A common stock. **********The unsecured creditors will receive 60 million class A shares and other groups could get up to 15 million class A shares. **********The Maxxam group would control about 72 percent of the airline. **********Continental said that the unsecured creditors committee had advised the two groups that it would support approval of the agreement in bankruptcy court. **********Continental is the nation's fifth- largest airline, employing about 43,500 workers, and has a fleet of 431 planes. **********Mr. Hurwitz said in a statement that ""as an investment, Continental has a number of fundamental strengths: good routes, competitive costs, strong management and a dedicated team of employees."" **********He added, ""And a key for us is the fact that Continental is Houston-based."" **********Continental's president, Robert R. Ferguson 3d, said in a statement that ""this transaction will provide the financial resources that will allow Continental to implement a highly specific business plan targeting consistent improvements in profitability and service quality."" **********Maxxam's major holdings are the Kaiser Aluminum Corporation, which was acquired in 1988 for $1.5 billion, and the Pacific Lumber Company, which was acquired in 1986 for $873 million. Kaiser accounted for 89 percent of Maxxam's revenue in 1991 and 79 percent of its operating income. Hurwitz-controlled companies employ 12,000 workers. **********But Maxxam has accumulated $1.5 billion in debt from acquisitions and other operations. For example, $754 million of the purchase price of Pacific Lumber was financed with junk bonds through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. **********To service his debt, Mr. Hurwitz has sought to maximize the cash flow at his companies. This has drawn criticism from environmentalists, who said that the cutting of redwood trees had been accelerated to increase cash flow at Pacific Lumber.  Shareholders of companies Mr. Hurwitz has acquired have also charged that he paid too little for them. Critics and Supporters **********Critics contend that Mr. Hurwitz takes over companies and squeezes out cash to finance his next acquisition. Supporters, however, say that investors who own Maxxam stock have done well. **********The company's rate of growth has been rapid, averaging about 23 percent a year in the last decade, with sales going from $155.5 million, to $2.2 billion. Maxxam stock traded as low as $10 a share in 1987. Yesterday, Maxxam closed at $31.375 on the American Stock Exchange, up 12.5 cents. **********Continental has been negotiating for months with Mr. Hurwitz to buy a stake. Many industry analysts and executives, including Mr. Ferguson, Continental's president, have said that the airline would have difficulty surviving without help from an outside investor. Newark a Big Hub **********One of Continental's largest hubs is at Newark International Airport, where it has become one of the largest carriers and employers in the New York metropolitan area. **********If Continental emerges from bankruptcy, it would be the second time it has done so. The first time it entered bankruptcy was in 1983 under Mr. Lorenzo, who then slashed wages and fares and and rebuilt the carrier, mostly with nonunion workers. The airline emerged from bankruptcy three years later with its creditors being repaid 100 cents on the dollar. **********But Mr. Lorenzo appeared to have overreached in his acquisition of Eastern in 1986, and that failure has damaged Continental, which was on its way to recovery when its huge debt load and rising fuel prices forced it into a second bankruptcy. **********One of the legacies from Eastern was a report prepared by David Shapiro, the examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court overseeing Eastern's bankruptcy filing. It concluded that in numerous transactions between the two companies, Eastern was shortchanged by Texas Air. The report found, for example, that Texas Air bought assets like System One, a computer reservation operation, from Eastern at a price far below market value. **********A person familiar with the current attempt by Continental to reorganize said that an agreement had been filed in bankruptcy court over how to resolve the issues raised by Mr. Shapiro. Eastern, which shut down its operations in January 1991, is going through the last stages of liquidation."

Lyons, director of marketing communications at Waterford Crystal Inc., which is the Burberry of candy dishes. **********Waterford is one of a number of purveyors of premium products that is revamping its advertising to reflect the altered realities of a marketplace shifting from conspicuous consumption to prudent purchasing. **********A new campaign for Audi automobiles, by DDB Needham Worldwide, even engages in what might be called 80's-bashing, in a campaign that carries the exhortatory theme ""Welcome to the 90's."" **********""If the 90's are a time of getting more for your money,"" a print advertisement begins, ""the new Audi 90 is ideally suited for the times."" **********The ad promises: ""Slip behind the wheel of the sporty new Audi 90, and you'll leave the excesses of the 80's, and just about everything else, behind."" **********At Waterford, the attitude in its advertising in the 80's was "" 'Stock the china closet,' "" Ms. Lyons said in an interview during a recent visit to her company's new agency, Altschiller Reitzfeld in New York, which replaced Ammirati & Puris on the estimated $3 million account. **********""For the 90's,"" she added, ""it's 'Use what's in the china closet.' "" **********So in a print campaign being introduced in September issues of a lengthy list of magazines, the maker of glassware and giftware shows its products being manhandled, womanhandled and -- in a couple of precedent-shattering, if not crystal-shattering, ads -- even childhandled. **********""The notion of using a child with Waterford is very important,"" said Rosalind Greene, senior vice president and associate creative director at Altschiller Reitzfeld, because it was meant to contrast with ""a notion of 'don't touch' that is very bad news."" **********David Altschiller, the agency's chairman and chief executive, derided a ""pretentious kind of advertising"" popular in the 80's. Referring to the rampant appeal to status-seeking, he said, ""The more things tended to cost, the more focus there was on the 'them' instead of on the 'you.' "" **********He labeled that ""faux Ogilvy,"" a corruption of the elegantly understated copy written by the legendary adman David Ogilvy. **********Mr. Ogilvy, who penned paeans to the quiet ride of a Rolls-Royce, might recognize elements of a new national campaign for Mercedes-Benz of North America being introduced this week by Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, which, along with the Martin Agency, its sibling shop in Richmond, replaced McCaffrey & McCall on the estimated $120 million account in February. **********The campaign carries the theme ""Sacrifice nothing,"" replacing the imported luxury car line's long-time superlative-laden slogan, ""Engineered like no other car in the world."" **********During an interview Friday at Scali's office in midtown Manhattan, John B. Adams Jr., president at the Martin Agency, defended the new theme against criticism that it resounds with an oh-so-80's haughtiness. **********""If you look at what will go on in product category after category through the 90's,"" he said, ""you will see consumers becoming pretty darn demanding, fed up with products that don't last or endure."" **********""So if there's an assertiveness to the line,"" he added, ""it's on behalf of the consumer and where we absolutely think the consumer is."" **********In one of the new Mercedes television commercials, a woman puts down a pervasive 80's attitude. ""Now I don't drive a Mercedes to impress my friends,"" she says, describing how an accident she once saw persuaded her to buy the car for safety reasons. **********In another spot and in print ads, a very un-80's concern -- an auto's resale value -- is emphasized. ""Mercedes-Benz outperforms all other cars someplace more grueling than the Autobahn,"" one headline says amid classified car-for-sale ads torn from newspapers. **********""It's the right time to chart a different direction here,"" said Michael J. Jackson, executive vice president at Mercedes-Benz, who joined Mr. Adams and Scali executives for the interview. **********The Mercedes campaign will appear in 48 magazines, including some small niche titles like Opera News and Polo, which Philippe Defechereux, executive vice president and group account director at Scali, called ""sliver bullets."" Print ads will also run in national and financial publications like Barron's. **********The commercials will appear on broadcast and cable television networks, including an innovative 15-month agreement under which Mercedes will become the exclusive automotive sponsor on the Bravo cable network. **********The spots will run often on cable networks that carry inordinate amounts of World War II documentaries -- one, Arts & Entertainment, is nicknamed in the industry ""the Hitler Channel"" for its penchant for wartime programming. So, Mercedes will, under a longstanding corporate policy, ask for assurances that its commercials do not appear during those programs."

Customers include banks, real estate developers and others anxious about financing, building or buying property that might be near environmentally risky sites. **********His company attracted the attention of Dun & Bradstreet, the huge business information company, which bought a noncontrolling interest in E.D.R. in September 1991. Starting this month, Dun & Bradstreet is marketing some of E.D.R.'s services to the financial and insurance markets. **********Mr. Cashman, 56 years old, first became interested in environmental matters through politics. He was Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut from 1972 to 1974 and later went to work in the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. **********After leaving the E.P.A., Mr. Cashman put his expertise to work in a company he formed, BCA Inc. It had no shortage of work in painstakingly searching files to identify waste sites at the request of banks concerned about possible liabilities that might come with buildings or land used as security for loans. **********""Banks foreclosed and then found themselves in the position where they, with deep pockets, had to clean up property, and the cost was far in excess of the value of the collateral,"" Mr. Cashman recalled. **********He sold BCA in 1990 to start E.D.R. At first it had only one product, Haz-Zip, which lists toxic sites by zip code. ""But you can imagine the problems with a zip code report,"" said Mr. Cashman. ""You could have a target property on the boundary of a zip code and have a site next door and not know it."" **********E.D.R. acquired Toxicheck, a Michigan-based company, in September 1991 and with it gained technology that allowed E.D.R. to offer more accurate and detailed reports and maps. **********Although many small companies act as environmental consultants, Vista, a California-based company, is the only other leading national contender in the field. For now, E.D.R.'s revenues are growing 40 to 50 percent a month, according to Mr. Cashman, and the links with Dun & Bradstreetshould help in finding additional business."

He has been steadily marking off a course on Europe that diverges from Mrs. Thatcher's almost as sharply as on domestic policy issues like her per-capita poll tax, which he scrapped soon after he succeeded her in November 1990. **********Having won a new term in last month's general elections, Mr. Major thinks Mrs. Thatcher has had her say, according to his aides, and that it's time for Britain to move on from her by now well-known views. **********""The Prime Minister wants us to be at the heart of Europe,"" one aide at 10 Downing Street said. The most powerful symbol of this was the Government's decision to allow Queen Elizabeth II to address the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, last Tuesday. Mrs. Thatcher, who said Friday that the European Parliament was often irrelevant, never allowed the monarch to address it during her more than 10 years as Prime Minister. **********Mr. Major has been anxious to prove that he is his own man on Europe as well as in domestic policy. He, too, wants to see Europe evolve more as a confederation than as a federal union, but he seems to favor closer cooperation than Mrs. Thatcher does. **********The Queen's speech, approved as a policy document by Mr. Major's Government, was far more conciliatory in tone than Mrs. Thatcher's remarks. ""We are all trying to preserve the rich diversity of European countries because, if that diversity is suppressed, we shall weaken Europe, not strengthen it,"" the Queen said. ""Differences of style and opinion are insignificant against the background of the proven commitment of Europeans today to reconciliation and democracy."" **********Mr. Major tried to assure the House of Commons on Tuesday that the sovereignty of Britain's Parliament was ""not up for grabs"" in Europe. **********But, as The Economist magazine noted this week, Mr. Major has showed no sign of wanting to stop the process of making more and more British decisions in common with his neighbors; Mrs. Thatcher always did. **********As one of Mr. Major's aides pointed out, the so-called ""Euroskeptic"" Conservative ranks in the House of Commons are thinner these days. Not only Mrs. Thatcher but some of the other staunch proponents of British independence are gone, including Mrs. Thatcher's close friend, Sir Norman Tebbit, who also did not run for re-election last month. **********But the issue still arouses passion. Some of the remaining hard-line opponents of European union discussed strategy for next week's ratification debate over dinner at the Carlton Club, a Conservative stronghold, this week and said Mrs. Thatcher had expressed their views about the European union treaty negotiated at Maastricht, the Netherlands, last December. **********Though the Government's majority in the House of Commons was reduced to 20 seats in the recent election, Mr. Major was not afraid that the ratification bill would fail, an aide said. The opposition Labor Party, divided by a leadership struggle after its defeat by the Tories, decided to ask its M.P.'s to abstain rather than vote against it."

Eventually, they could be the means toward fulfilling the Information Age's ""multimedia"" promise of simultaneously transmitting data, voice and video over a single communications circuit. **********Adoption of the data-transfer methods by the large local telephone companies follows announcements of similar plans earlier this year by long-distance carriers like A.T.& T., MCI, Sprint and the British company BT. **********Businesses, hospitals and universities will be able to use the techniques to send complex packages of data -- like computer-aided designs of automobiles or magnetic-resonance images of medical patients -- in seconds, instead of hours. **********Frame relay and its faster cousin, switched multimegabit service, extend the power and range of what are called local-area networks, communities of computers within a building or business park that can quickly share data. The frame-relay and switched services can make transmitting a computer file across the country as fast and easy as sending it down the hall. **********The companies making the announcements yesterday were: Ameritech; Bell Atlantic; BellSouth; Cincinnati Bell; GTE; Nynex; Pacific Bell; Southern New England Telephone; Southwestern Bell Telephone, and U S West. **********The frame-relay deployment is to begin this summer in Detroit for Ameritech and will continue until next summer in certain cities for U S West. The switched multimegabit service will be introduced first by GTE in Los Angeles this summer, and will continue to be introduced in various parts of the country through the second half of next year when Southern New England Telephone intends to begin offering it in Connecticut. **********Both of the techniques have already been offered on a trial basis by some local telephone companies, and as special-order business services between selected locations by several long-distance carriers.  How They Work **********The techniques are based on digital technology, which changes such information as voice conversations, pictures and novels into the numbers that computers can handle. **********A current digital telecommunications format known as X.25 transfers data at a rate of 56,000 bits, or binary digits, a second. At that speed, ""Moby Dick,"" a 12-million-bit novel, can be transmitted in less than 4 minutes. **********But frame relay is much faster, operating at 1.54 million bits a second; ""Moby Dick"" sails through a network in less than 8 seconds. Switched multimegabit is faster still, operating at up to 34 million bits a second and capable of transmitting ""Moby Dick"" in a third of a second. **********All three methods -- X.25, frame relay and switched multimegabit -- work on a principle known as packet switching that moves mountains of data over telephone lines, which were designed for the low-capacity steady stream of voice conversations. Packet switching moves bursts of information by breaking the data into smaller units, or packets, for transmission and then putting the units back together at the receiving end."

In his acceptance speech, Mr. Berri promised to strive for the restoration of national unity shaken by the elections. **********""Let bygones be bygones,"" said Mr. Berri, a 54-year-old lawyer. ""This Parliament does not mean victory for one section of the Lebanese people against the other. Lebanon cannot survive without unity."" **********But in an outburst not likely to sit well with Christian factions suspicious of the new Muslim-dominated Parliament, Mr. Berri's supporters celebrated his victory by taking to the streets of Beirut and firing their assault rifles in the air in violation of a two-year ban on carrying firearms in public. **********Mr. Berri was the leading candidate for the post, which is reserved for a Shiite Muslim under a 43-year-old agreement. But the composition of the new Parliament reflects some profound changes that have emerged after Lebanon's 15-year civil war, and the seating of the new body is a milestone in a new political order in which the Christians, once the center of power but now fractured and outnumbered by the Muslims, appear to be the losers. **********The Arab League-sponsored 1990 agreement that ended the civil war reserved equal numbers of parliamentary seats for Muslims and Christians, ending the six-to-five ratio in favor of the Christians that was written into the country's 1943 constitution. The Maronite Catholics, Lebanon's largest Christian group, have retained the presidency and command of the army, but many of the President's powers were shifted to the Cabinet, headed as before by a Sunni Muslim Prime Minister. **********In an effort to forestall these changes, many Christian groups, including the powerful Phalangist Party, called for a boycott of the parliamentary elections, which took place between Aug. 23 and Oct. 11. The Christian boycott cost the new Parliament some legitimacy, but it failed to produce a cancellation of the vote, and the Christians elected to fill their apportioned 64 seats ran with the backing of Muslim groups or as independents. None of the Christian legislators has formal ties to the Phalangists. **********Shiite deputies have already served notice that they intend to introduce legislation that would eliminate the old system under which senior Government jobs are distributed along religious lines. If carried out, the move would strip the Christians of their remaining political privileges. **********Adding to the pressure on the Christians, Syria's influence, exercised through the 35,000 troops who control two-thirds of Lebanese territory, has also increased since the end of the civil war. President Elias Hrawi has Syrian backing and a scrutiny of political affiliations of the new legislators has shown that two-thirds are generally thought to favor cooperation with Syria. **********""The Christians have been squeezed between Damascus and the Shiite majority,"" a political analyst said. ""The new Parliament is an established fact and the Christians cannot change the situation."" **********With 1.2 million people, the Shiites are now the largest group in Lebanon, which has a population of less than three million. **********""The majority of Christians feel let down and vanquished,"" the pro-Syrian daily As Safir commented, adding that they can only blame themselves because ""they have isolated themselves by rejecting the polls."" **********The 1990 accord provided that Syrian troops pull back to the Bekaa region in eastern Lebanon on the second anniversary of the old Lebanese Parliament's acceptance of the pact. The anniversary fell on Sept. 22, but the Syrians insisted that the redeployment be discussed by a new Lebanese Government. The Beirut daily An Nahar said Damascus felt other reforms contained in the 1990 pact should be realized first, particularly the rescinding of the system of apportioning senior Government posts."

The drug is sold as Centoxin overseas. The companies did not specify how much the royalties would be, but Centocor said they would amount to less than the 40 percent of net sales sought by Xoma, which makes a competing drug called E-5. **********The companies also agreed to forgo all future litigation regarding each other's patents on these drugs. **********Wall Street reacted guardedly, reflecting the long string of negative developments and doubts about whether either drug will ever receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Xoma closed today up $1, to $14.25, which is a far cry from its 52-week high of $26.25, and Centocor was up 25 cents, to $15, in over-the-counter trading; the stock was as high as $60.25 in the last 52 weeks. **********Nevertheless, both companies portrayed the settlement as a positive development, which would eliminate both a drain on capital and a distraction of management's time. **********""We're focusing now on the development of our full line of products,"" said Steven Mendell, Xoma's chairman. ""That's the real plus."" **********Michael Wall, Centocor's chairman, said that investors were understandably skeptical. ""We need two or three more positives and people will begin to believe that we do what we say we will do,"" he said. ""Things go down faster than they go up in this dream industry."" **********So far the F.D.A. has refused to approve either Xoma's or Centocor's flagship drugs. In June, the F.D.A. found that the results of two trials of Xoma's drug did not support approval. In April, the agency found the results of Centocor's first trial insufficient to approve the drug. Centocor has begun a second trial. **********The settlement covers an April 1990 lawsuit filed by Xoma against Centocor in United States District Court in San Francisco, which subsequently led to a favorable ruling for Xoma. The settlement also covers a United States International Trade Commission proceeding, and a countersuit by Centocor in Federal court in Delaware. **********Both Xoma's and Centocor's drugs try to treat a sometimes fatal type of bacterial infection that occurs in surgery patients or those who suffer from severe burns or wounds. Septic shock strikes about 200,000 Americans a year, killing about half of them. **********""It's still unclear whether either product works,"" said Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Even if they do work, large sales are not likely because more effective, second-generation drugs will probably come to market within a year of one of these getting approval, he said."

Witnesses said buildings in Arak were set ablaze by 2,000 to 3,000 protesters, and a local ambulance driver said today that at least seven people suffered gunshot wounds and that about 200 were arrested. **********Reacting to a call by provincial authorities to abandon their makeshift dwellings or witness their possessions razed by bulldozers, Arak residents took to the streets. **********The witnesses said the boy was killed when he was struck by a motor vehicle. Accounts differed over whether it was a Government vehicle, but residents said that the killing was the catalyst for widespread looting and burning of municipal buildings, banks, and assaults on police officers, some of whom were forcibly disarmed and lined up to walk in front of the marching crowds as a shield against the troops. **********The Government held off on its plans to raze the squatter slum, and the unrest ebbed by Friday morning. But the ambulance driver said the situation remained tense, with security checks still in place along roads to the city and on its main thoroughfares. **********The press, which is subject to Government censorship, largely ignored the incident, with one hard-line newspaper making only an oblique reference to ""incidents in Arak."" **********Arak, with a population of about a million and a half, is the second-largest industrial city in Iran, with petrochemical and machine-workshop industries that employ hundreds of thousands of semiskilled and unskilled workers. Those laborers have not benefitted from the large-scale redistribution of land undertaken by the Islamic Government after the overthrow of the Shah. **********The clashes in Arak took place less than two months after hundreds of slum dwellers in Khorramabad, in the southwestern province of Luristan, were forcibly evicted when municipal crews leveled their homes. **********The squatters find validation in the decrees of some Islamic scholars, which define ownership ""by working and cultivating the land."" But the issue of land ownership coupled with the growing appetite of local governments for reclaiming property on which the so-called oppressed made their homes seem likely to lead to more violent confrontations across the country."

Sematech, based in Austin, Tex., has a budget of about $200 million a year, half provided by the Defense Department and half by its member companies, which until now numbered 14. **********LSI Logic, whose speciality is customized microelectronic circuits, has struggled with tight profit margins. It is expected to report revenue of about $700 million for 1991, but a profit of only about $7 million -- an amount roughly equal to the dues it would owe Sematech under the consortium's formula of assessing member companies 1 percent of their revenues. **********In keeping with Sematech's bylaws, LSI Logic had notified the consortium more than two years ago that it might withdraw from the group. Industry executives say that another member, Micron Technology Inc., a Boise, Idaho, maker of memory chips, also gave the two-year notice required for withdrawal and may soon leave the group. A Micron spokesman would not comment. **********A third member, the Harris Corporation, a diversified electronics company based in Melbourne, Fla., is also said to be considering dropping out of Sematech. John Conn, vice president and general manager of manufacturing at Harris's semiconductor division, confirmed that the company had given notice. But he said Harris was committed to remaining a member for at least another year and hoped to work with Sematech to craft programs that would be beneficial to the company. **********William J. Spencer, president of Sematech, said in a recent interview that it would be natural to expect one or two members to drop out, but that such moves would not affect the consortium's ability to secure financing for another five years. He said Sematech was already talking to three companies that might become new members.  An Internal Split **********The decision by LSI, which is based in Milpitas, Calif., reflects a split that some industry executives said existed within Sematech between smaller companies, such as LSI, and some larger members, like I.B.M. **********When it was created in 1987, Sematech's aim was to enhance the ability of American companies to compete with the Japanese in the mass manufacturing of computer chips. But midway through its life, much of the focus shifted to helping American producers of wafer steppers, etchers and other equipment used in making chips. **********Sematech officials argued that if these American equipment producers went out of business, the American chip manufacturers would be totally dependent on Japanese equipment suppliers and would be at a competitive disadvantage. The shift in emphasis was also supported by some of the larger member companies that were already ahead of Sematech in mass manufacturing and therefore saw little benefit from the original program. But the move disappointed some smaller chip makers, such as LSI, which hoped Sematech would develop more manufacturing techniques they could use directly.  Group Still Seen as Worthwhile **********""The idea of becoming venture capitalists to the equipment industry is what caused the beginning of the breakaway,"" George D. Wells, president of LSI Logic, said in an interview. ""That isn't something we feel is a top priority in terms of our spending."" He added, however, that he thought Sematech was still a worthwhile endeavor for the nation. **********Mr. Wells also cited pressure on LSI's revenue and profits, although he declined to discuss specific numbers. **********Some Sematech critics, particularly T. J. Rodgers, president of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation of San Jose, Calif., have previously complained that the dues structure of Sematech virtually excludes small companies like his. LSI was one of the smaller members, as is Micron Technology and the semiconductor division of Harris. **********Executives of several other members, including Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Advanced Micro Devices, have said in recent interviews that the consortium has been a success and that they will maintain their memberships."

Getting the Right Help From a Professional"," **********If you are like one of every two people who file a tax return, you go to someone for help -- because of laziness, a busy schedule or the need for expert advice. You figure that a preparer will save time, money and worry. In most cases, you would be right. But sometimes a preparer winds up costing plenty of all three. **********The problem is that all tax preparers are not created equal. Almost anyone can hang out a shingle, regardless of training or experience. In fact, only two states -- Oregon and California -- have qualifying guidelines. **********The end result? ""It is more than likely that one in five preparers is incompetent,"" said Sanford Rosenthal, a San Diego accountant who has served as an adviser to the Internal Revenue Service. **********Preparers range from attorneys and accountants to ""largely seasonal employees: homemakers, retirees, others with full-time jobs,"" said Allen Prahl of the National Association of Tax Practitioners, an industry group based in Appleton, Wis. Many of the part-timers -- and some of the professionals -- may only spend a couple of weeks a year studying the tax law. **********And don't count on the I.R.S. to weed out all the bad ones. Putting a preparer out of business requires a long, costly legal battle. **********Nonetheless, taxpayers can do plenty to protect themselves. Some tips follow for finding the many competent preparers who are out there. **********Don't wait until April 14. **********When Bob Black's combine burned three years ago, he received $4,800 in insurance. ""My accountant was in such a hurry,"" said the Ceresco, Neb., farmer, ""that he declared the amount twice: once as ordinary gain, and once as capital gain."" Because the combine had been depreciated, the insurance reimbursement was reportable as income -- but, of course, only once. **********For a variety of reasons, Mr. Black changed accountants and the mistake was caught before the return was filed. ""I know the mistake had to do with him hurrying,"" he said. ""I should have gone in earlier."" **********Indeed, your best chance for getting quality service is early in the process -- certainly no later than now -- before your preparer is overwhelmed with a huge stack of returns. **********""If you want a high comfort level -- to spend some time talking with your preparer -- you're better off going early,"" said Thomas M. Bloch, president of H & R Block Inc., the nation's biggest tax preparation service, which is based in Kansas City, Mo. **********Do some market research. **********First, figure out what kind of service you need. If your return is complicated, you may need the highest-priced help: certified public accountants, lawyers and enrolled agents. Enrolled agents are experts certified by the Treasury Department to represent clients before the I.R.S. **********If your return is relatively simple, you may get by with a less-costly individual preparer or tax chain. Many chains, including Block, require their preparers to take a tax course. And some, also including Block, have preparers double check the efforts of their colleagues. **********""One way of figuring out a good match,"" said Alice Nicholson, an enrolled agent in Arvada, Colo., ""is to get a reference from someone who works in the same field as you do."" Ask about the fee structure. **********""I'd be suspicious if I went to a preparer,"" said Marjorie Joder, an accountant in Naples, Fla., ""and he didn't want to look over my old return before deciding how long and how much it would cost to do this year."" **********The range of fees is dramatic, from $15 or so for the simplest of returns to hundreds or even thousands of dollars for the most complicated. Find out if you will be charged by the number of forms used, by an hourly rate or by a lump sum. And never hire a preparer who bases a fee on the amount of your refund: not only is this illegal, it's bad business. Chances are the preparer will take risky deductions that won't stand up. **********Shop around. **********Last year, Christine Kolasa, who works in a bank in Buffalo, went to H & R Block because she wanted a ""rapid refund"" to pay a bill for her son's college. The refund -- an advance on the money that the I.R.S. owes a taxpayer -- is offered by some chains for a fee, technically a high-interest short-term loan. **********""Not being familiar with the changes in the tax law, I had a whole bunch of questions,"" she said. ""With each question, the response was 'I don't know.' "" So out came the reference books. Throughout the interview, the preparer answered incoming calls and talked to other clients. **********""If I had listened to her,"" said Ms. Kolasa, ""I would have overpaid my FICA, missed my mortgage tax as a deduction, sent my refund to the wrong bank and more."" Near the end of the meeting, Ms. Kolasa finally found out that she wasn't even eligible for a rapid refund from Block, which does not advance amounts exceeding $3,300. **********Eventually, she said, Block apologized and refunded her fee of $114. Steve Mosher, manager of the Buffalo district office of Block, said in a recent interview that he was unfamiliar with the details of the case but confirmed that Block had apologized to Ms. Kolasa and returned her fee. ""Mistakes do happen,"" he added. **********For her part, Ms. Kolasa said, ""Next time, I'm going to check out the qualifications of a preparer before I start a working relationship."" **********Indeed, it's not a bad idea to talk over the telephone with at least three preparers before hiring one. When in doubt, go in for a visit. **********Ask how long the preparer has been in the business and about educational qualifications. It's best not to gamble with a preparer who has less than five years of experience. **********And make sure you feel comfortable with the preparer. ""Many tax deductions are missed in the interview between preparer and client,"" said Larry Gray, an accountant in Rolla, Mo. Feel ill at ease and you'll have a harder time relaying important information. **********Prepare for the preparer. **********Sooner or later, all preparers get a client who walks in with a year's worth of receipts jammed into a paper bag. That happened last year to Susan Dawson of Alexandria, Va., whose client was self-employed. **********""Before we could even get to doing the taxes,"" said Ms. Dawson, ""we had to reconstruct his business."" And that nearly doubled the cost of preparing the return. What's more, because the process was rushed, a very important deduction was initially overlooked. **********Don't be a bystander. **********""Even the most qualified preparer can't do a good job,"" said Ms. Joder, the Naples preparer, ""if the consumer is not open and candid; the preparer can't read minds."" **********Buy one of the popular books on tax preparation. Read newspaper and magazine articles on the latest changes in tax law. **********Get a second opinion if big bucks are at stake. **********When the company that Bill Klinkenberg of Lincoln, Neb., worked for was sold, he cashed in his profit-sharing plan, which held $100,000. His tax preparer recommended that he keep out $20,000 for taxes. So Mr. Klinkenberg took the rest and paid off bills, went on trips with his wife, bought a new car and refurbished his house. But when his accountant finished his taxes that year, the vacation was over. ""He told me that I owed $47,000,"" said Mr. Klinkenberg. That forced him to borrow heavily, which put added strains on his marriage, he said, and helped lead to his divorce. **********Bad enough, but ""a year later, when I went to another accountant, I found I didn't owe nearly that much money,"" said Mr. Klinkenberg. ""After talking with my new accountant, I wouldn't have even cashed in my profit-sharing plan."" **********Hire for the long haul. **********Chances are you won't be audited, but if you are, or if you get a notice of delinquency, it's good to know that you'll be helped or represented by your preparer. **********""What happens if your tax preparer works only three months a year and is gone when you need him or her most?"" said Ruth Zemek of the Better Business Bureau in Phoenix. **********Although C.P.A.'s, lawyers and enrolled agents are the only people who can represent you legally before the I.R.S., other types of preparers can ""assist"" you: basically, this means giving you moral support and helping you explain your return. Ask your preparer if this service is provided year round, and if it costs extra. **********Also ask if your preparer will reimburse you for mistakes that result in penalties and interest. **********Review every line of your return. **********Hiring a tax preparer may make filing easier, but it does not take you off the hook. Ask for explanations if you don't understand how your preparer arrived at a figure. **********Remember that you are responsible for the return once you sign it. That means never fill out a return in pencil. And never sign a blank return for your preparer's convenience, even if you are up against the filing deadline. That's like signing a blank check."

A small but growing number of top advertising executives want to be a part of it -- New York, New York. **********For the last decade, executives who could make it there have been making it, well, somewhere else, like Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle. Now, though, some of the industry's best-known and most-respected names are moving to New York from other parts of the country. **********By no means has the outflow from New York been stanched, as evidenced by the continued departures to points west by executives from agencies like McCann-Erickson New York and Young & Rubicam New York. Even so, the countertrend became noteworthy recently when three major moves were disclosed within the period of a few weeks: *********** Charlotte Beers, the former chief executive of Tatham/RSCG in Chicago, who became chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. *********** Andy Berlin, who left Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein in San Francisco, where he had been a principal and managing director, to become president of DDB Needham New York, the New York office of DDB Needham Worldwide. *********** Dan Reid, who left Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, where he had been executive vice president of client services and new-business director, to become president and chief operating officer of McCaffrey & McCall Advertising. **********""I have always said that great creative acts can occur anywhere,"" said Keith Reinhard, chairman and chief executive at DDB Needham, who helped hire Mr. Berlin. **********Still, Mr. Reinhard, a former Chicagoan, added, ""it is impossible to imagine any place in the world more stimulating to a creative person than New York City."" **********Mr. Reid echoed Mr. Reinhard, asserting that ""New York does not have a lock on creativity."" Yet, he said, ""New York was, and remains, the anchor of the business, in terms of sheer mass."" **********Mr. Reid, who while he worked for Burnett traveled extensively to advertising capitals overseas, added, ""Nothing compares to the depth and breadth of the New York experience."" **********Any re-emergence of New York as an ad center must be viewed against a long period of loss, if not outright decline. **********""There's no question that there was a huge flux of business out of New York,"" said O. Burtch Drake, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. **********One telling statistic was that during the 1980's, only 3 of the 10 shops chosen by Advertising Age as ""agency of the year"" for their creative output were based in New York. And when creativity goes, billings follow: The trade publication's annual agency report for 1991 found that New York, with $24.1 billion in billings, had lost its traditional first-place ranking among the world's ad centers to Tokyo, at $24.5 billion. **********New York's share of billings among members of the Four A's, as the agency industry trade association is known, declined to about 38 percent in 1990, the last year for which figures are available, from 45.8 percent in 1980. **********Yet just try telling all that to Mr. Berlin. **********For Mr. Berlin, who grew up in Philadelphia, New York has been a lure, he recalled, since the days when ""I used to listen to WABC instead of WIBG because I thought Cousin Brucie played better rock 'n' roll."" He was referring to the AM radio stations that dominated those cities in the 1960's and to Bruce (Cousin Brucie) Morrow, the leading disk jockey at WABC in New York. **********""I still see a lot of energy there that does not exist anyplace else in the United States,"" Mr. Berlin added. **********As for New York's perceived perils, careerwise and otherwise, he said: ""Yes, I think New York is frightening.

Job,Harris Gets $1.7 Billion F.A.A. Job," **********The Federal Aviation Administration selected the Harris Corporation today to produce a $1.7 billion air traffic control system to be installed nationwide over the next 14 years. **********Harris was selected over American Telephone and Telegraph Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of the giant phone company, because its prototype performed better during trials this summer, agency officials said. **********The equipment, known as the Voice Switching and Control System, both links air traffic controllers to each other by telephone and handles radio calls between controllers and pilots. It will replace aging, leased equipment now in service, and is meant to increase substantially the efficiency and reliability of the air traffic control system, the F.A.A. said. Improvements Are Costly **********The contract is an important development in the aviation agency's modernization program. But it carries an immense cost. The communications switching system, which is running about eight years behind its original schedule, was originally projected to cost $258 million. **********Both contractors have developed prototypes, and both had difficulties meeting the aviation agency's exacting demands. The standards included reliability rates equivalent to being out of service, on average, for just four seconds a year. **********""This is the centerpiece of the communications system from the controllers to the pilots, so it is important that it be reliable,"" said John A. Burt, the F.A.A.'s executive director for system development. Embarrassing Failures **********The agency's communications and computer systems have had a series of embarrassing failures in recent years, including episodes like the six-hour breakdown of long-distance phone service in New York that halted air traffic into and out of the major airports in September. **********The computerized switching system now being purchased will be installed at air traffic control centers, linking up to 430 work stations each. Twenty-five of them will be bought in the first four years, with an option for 24 more. **********Mr. Burt said Harris ""had proven through tests on the prototype model that they met all of our technical requirements."" **********During the development period, the two companies found that they could not use off-the-shelf components and software, as they had initially promised. **********In just the last year, the price went up more than 50 percent, after both prototypes failed contractor tests and a final choice had to be delayed. **********And the first operational system will not be in service until 1994, forcing the agency to consider an interim system in the meantime to avoid delays in other, related air-traffic-control systems. For example, I.B.M. is installing a complex set of air-traffic-control computers that cost up to $3.5 billion. They cannot deliver the improvements that are intended until the voice communication system is also installed. **********But Mr. Burt said he believed that the Harris system would be delivered in time to avoid any need for an interim system. **********The F.A.A. expects to spend just $97 million on the system in the first year, when a full-fledged system will be installed and tested once more at the agency's technical center at Atlantic City. **********So far, the two contractors have spent about $400 million to develop the prototypes -- work that was originally supposed to cost $67 million. **********The increasing costs have been typical of large projects carried out by the aviation agency, which is expected to spend some $31 billion on modernization of the air-traffic-control system by the year 2000. That estimate, according to the General Accounting Office, increased by $4 billion between 1990 and 1991. **********And the agency is facing a big increase in research-and-development expenses as it moves toward an eventual network of satellite-based communications and navigation equipment."

The first is a one-time charge to reflect the application of these changes to prior years, a so-called catch-up charge. The second is the annual impact of the accounting change on after-tax operating profits in the year of adoption. **********Pepsi estimated the catch-up charge to cover retiree health benefits at $575 million before taxes. The after-tax charge was estimated at $357 million, or 44 cents a share. **********The catch-up charge for the change in income tax accounting is estimated to be $400 million to $550 million after taxes, or 49 cents to 68 cents a share, the company said. **********In a statement, Pepsi said the size of the income tax charge was ""principally related"" to a big increase in intangible assets arising from the large number of acquisitions the company made in recent years. **********In terms of its operating results for 1992, Pepsi said the change in accounting for retirees would cut its net income by 4 cents a share. But that reduction will be partly offset by the change in income tax accounting, which will add 2 cents a share this year. **********Even though the accounting changes were expected, some analysts said they were surprised the amounts involved were so large. And the restructuring charge raised some eyebrows. Nevertheless, the news did not alter any opinions about the company's prospects. **********""We didn't know anything about the domestic beverage restructuring,"" said Roy D. Burrus, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. ""The only place they could be downsizing domestically is in their bottling business."" **********Joseph Doyle, an analyst who follows Pepsi for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said: ""They are also going to be laying people off overseas, probably in both beverages and snack foods. From my perspective, this will benefit future earnings by a few cents a share for each of the next few years."" **********The announcement had little noticeable impact on investors. The price of Pepsi shares slipped 25 cents yesterday, to $40.75, on the New York Stock Exchange."

Johnny Carson's Classy Exit"," **********Time and again, chief executives have battled with their boards, their shareholders, their likely successors and the public in an effort to stay in office. Like performers and artists, they seek immortality through their work. **********Many chief executives do leave gracefully, but many others have to be carried out, feet first -- either through a palace coup, like the one that removed Edwin Land of Polaroid, or through death in office, as was the case for Occidental Petroleum's Armand Hammer. **********In fact, one of the best recent models for a business leader's departure came from television: Johnny Carson's handling of his departure last month from the Tonight Show after 30 years. He taught five key lessons: *********** Mr. Carson timed his exit brilliantly. His audience had peaked, competition had cut ratings 43 percent since 1978 and advertising rates had fallen as well. But he was still king of late-night television. And rather than becoming a despot or a has-been, Mr. Carson reviewed his rich portfolio of triumphs on the air and quit while still ahead. **********""Everything comes to an end, nothing lasts forever,"" he told his audience. ""Thirty years is enough. It's time to get out while you're still working on top of your game, while you're still working well."" **********Too many business leaders cling shamelessly to their thrones, young dragon-slayers who have in later life become dragons themselves. **********Lee Iacocca stayed around when his brilliant revival of Chrysler became imperiled, despite attractive offers elsewhere. Only when the board insisted did Mr. Iacocca designate a successor. *********** Mr. Carson insured the development of a successor. Instead of fearing that a protege would eclipse him, he displayed a mentor's pride. He invited many possible successors, including David Brenner, Joan Rivers, David Letterman and Jay Leno, to serve as guest hosts. By announcing his retirement date and unambiguously accepting Mr. Leno as his replacement a year in advance, he generously shared the stage with his heir. **********Hundreds of corporate chiefs, on the other hand, show a dread of becoming lame ducks, of going from ""Who's Who"" to ""Who's that?"" The recent board room squabble over the Time Warner succession was a predictable product of uncertainty over just when and how power would be transferred within an unstable leadership troika. At William Paley's CBS and Juan Trippe's Pan Am, visionaries set out to sabotage their successors. *********** Mr. Carson shared the credit for his triumphs with his loyal assistants. He saved his final broadcast to display his appreciation for 30 years of unrivaled show business stability. He showcased his announcer, Ed McMahon, and his bandleader, Doc Severinsen, and acknowledged his longtime producer, Fred DeCordova, as well as the program's writers and technicians. Then he took them all to his house for a party. **********Many chief executives depart in a way that suggests they have come to believe the myths about them, that they are larger than their institutions. Inventors and entrepreneurs provide some of the worst examples: Thomas Edison and Henry Ford sparred with colleagues who contributed to their achievements and hoped to share the glory. *********** Mr. Carson deftly rode the tidal wave of emotion that accompanied his exit. He understood how attached his viewers had become and allowed for the release of this emotion by making himself available for brief interviews, by sharing his own losses (displaying the photography of his late son, Rick), and by choking back tears when Bette Midler sang him a farewell tribute. **********Contrast the departing leaders who allow their devoted followers no catharsis. They escape in the dark of night to avoid bereaved loyalists or bathe themselves in self-pity on the White House lawn, crying out against the injustice that drove them from command. *********** Mr. Carson looked to the future. He built continuity by tenderly recalling the past while enthusiastically welcoming what was to come. During the last weeks of his show, he revisited his old friends, alive and deceased, by showing video scrapbooks and hosting return appearances by Milton Berle, Bob Hope and George Burns. At the close, however, Mr. Carson invited Bette Midler and Robin Williams as his guests, demonstrating his faith in a newer generation. **********Samuel Goldwyn, the movie mogul, may have advised leaving the delivery of messages to Western Union, but Mr. Carson showed that the entertainment world can indeed teach some lasting lessons. Corporate chiefs have become celebrities themselves, with compensation and prominence to match. They should take some tips on handling stardom, and passing it on, from old pros like Johnny Carson."

Yeltsin of Russia told Congress in June would help guarantee the success of his efforts to nourish democratic and economic reform. **********Overcoming intense election year opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who said it was wrong to help Russia when Americans were in need, the House followed the Senate in approving $1.2 billion in bilateral aid and a $12 billion increase in the American commitment to the International Monetary Fund, which will finance loans to Russia and other nations. **********The vote was 255 to 164, with 161 Democrats and 94 Republicans in favor and 95 Democrats, 68 Republicans and an independent opposed. **********The majority included Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, the only member of the House who was here to vote for $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey on May 9, 1947, at the beginning of more than four decades of foreign aid intended to curb Soviet influence. **********Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, compared today's action to the 1948 adoption of the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe. He said the vote ""may well be as important a vote as any of us will ever cast."" **********He said the rise of Hitler, the concentration camps and World War II might have been averted if the United States had been more helpful to the Weimar Republic in the late 1920's. With that in mind, he said, anyone who voted against this bill was in effect ""willing to risk the collapse of democracy in Russia and stand to one side and do nothing about it."" **********There were intense arguments against the bill, especially from members of the House's black caucus. Representative Barbara-Rose Collins, Democrat of Michigan, said: ""Our cities are hurting. We must learn how to take care of America first. Our cities are hurting."" **********Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, called domestic aid ""measly"" in comparison with what was being done for Russia. Democrats Rally Support **********But Democratic leaders rallied the support to pass the bill by arguing that the Bush Administration was likely to approve further help to the nation's cities and highway system. And they joined in arguments that this was the critical moment to help Mr. Yeltsin. **********Several lawmakers cited a letter from the nation's four living former Presidents -- Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan -- backing the measure. **********Saying their Administrations had been ""united in the struggle against Communism,"" they wrote: ""We now have the opportunity, so fervently pursued for generations, to guarantee a peaceful transition to democracy. America must respond to this challenge, as we have so many times before, through leadership of an international coalition to secure the success of reform in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union."" **********Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, also compared today's vote to the vote on the Marshall Plan. He said, ""None of us may cast the giant shadows of the architects of the Marshall Plan, but the nature of our role, and the significance of our decision, is no less momentous."" **********He said lawmakers had a duty to explain the necessity of this vote to their constituents. ""We must compel them to see a future where American exports, American jobs, American profits and American incomes -- our very economic security -- will be protected, just as we acted to protect our military security in the cold war by approving the Marshall Plan,"" he said.  '30,000 Nuclear Weapons' **********Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, said today's vote ""will help determine the shape of the world for the next century."" He said: ""Yeltsin and the reformers have a great test. They need our help. We cannot live safe and free if there is turmoil and upheaval in a land that possesses 30,000 nuclear weapons."" **********Republican support was expected to be stronger, as the minority followed Mr. Bush's appeals and advice from its leaders, like Mr. Gingrich and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader. **********Mr. Michel told the House: ""We have a chance to shape the world. Let's make it a world in which 45 years of sacrifice are rewarded, in which the promise of democracy becomes a reality in the former Soviet Union."" The Opposing Views **********Opposition came a variety of perspectives. Representative John Kyl, Republican of Arizona, for example, wanted a guarantee that Russian troops would leave the Baltic states and Representative Mel Hancock, Republican of Missouri said, ""We must start looking after America first."" **********The most concerted attacks, however, came from the Congressional Black Caucus. In the debate on the procedures for considering the bill, Ms. Waters said she would vote against them because they did not permit an amendment to provide loan guarantees to American cities. But she was holding a news conference when the vote came, and it passed without discernible dissent. **********The increased commitment to the International Monetary Fund is part of a larger effort to increase its capital by about $60 billion. No precise share of that has been allotted to Russia and the former Soviet republics, but they are expected to get the biggest share. **********On Wednesday the I.M.F. announced a $1.04 billion loan to Russia, and today the World Bank announced a $600 million loan to Russia to pay for imports to improve health, food supply, transport, oil production and private business. **********The provisions concerning the International Monetary Fund do not involve direct United States spending. **********The measure approved today included none of the conditions various House members sought to add to it, ranging from attempts to force the removal of troops from the Baltic states to an end of Russian aid to Cuba. Separate Legislation Needed **********It provides authority to spend $1.2 billion to aid Russia and other former Soviet republics. Those funds have to be appropriated under separate legislation. Some of those measures have already been passed in the House and should have smooth sailing in the Senate. **********The biggest chunk, $790 million, would go to help dismantle nuclear weapons. And $417 million more would be for direct aid to help Russia build its democratic system and its economy. **********The measure also authorizes the use of $3 billion in existing American credits to support a fund to stabilize the ruble."

Scott Fitzgerald once proclaimed. Perhaps so, but a growing number of marketers apparently hope that there are at least second acts for American brands. **********Increasingly, consumer product companies are restaging or reintroducing brands that are familiar to consumers but have had lagging sales. The companies realize that brand franchises are becoming too important to abandon and that they continue to grow in value, as demonstrated by the prices paid in recent transactions involving the Martini & Rossi spirits brands and RJR Nabisco's cold cereals. **********Bolstering that belief is the skyrocketing cost of persuading consumers to try new brands. Gillette, for instance, is expected to spend $33 million to advertise a line of men's toiletries it plans to introduce today. **********Among examples of brands seeking second acts: Oldsmobile, which unexpectedly announced a review on its account, at Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago since 1967; Anacin pain reliever, with new commercials urging ""rediscover Anacin,"" by McCann-Erickson New York, and the Breck hair-care line, restyled as ""a healthy indulgence for your hair"" in commercials by Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss Advertising in New York. **********Two of the more intriguing rescue efforts are being undertaken for disparate products: Johnnie Walker Scotch, which will be touted as ""richer in taste"" in advertising by Avrett, Free & Ginsberg in New York, and the Trivial Pursuit board game, which will be sold via humorous celebrity endorsements in a campaign by Grey Advertising in New York. **********The Johnnie Walker ads are the first by Avrett since it won the brand's $7 million to $10 million account last November from Smith/ Greenland Inc. in New York, the 14-year incumbent. **********The centerpiece of the print advertisements and outdoor posters will be a product-oriented pitch, using active verbs like ""enjoy"" and ""savor,"" focusing on the ""richness"" of Johnnie Walker Red. That will replace the people-oriented imagery that has appeared since 1988 under the theme ""Good taste is always an asset."" **********Research among consumers found ""richness to be a very key concept,"" said Thomas James, Avrett's executive vice president and director of account services, among ""first-time and infrequent Scotch drinkers, as well as among Johnnie Walker Red drinkers."" **********He was pleased, he added, that in tests the campaign ""scored higher with younger drinkers than with older,"" and drew ""a response stronger among infrequent users than frequent users."" Those are encouraging signs for a brand whose case shipments fell 18.2 percent last year, to 900,000 from 1.1 million in 1990. **********To underscore the determination of Johnnie Walker Red's importer, the Schieffelin & Somerset Company in New York, to reverse its slump, more than $6 million will be spent from early next month, when the campaign starts, through the end of the year, said Toby Dunn, senior vice president and management supervisor at Avrett. **********For Hasbro Inc. in New York, which markets Trivial Pursuit, the challenge is to reawaken interest in a 10-year-old game that enjoyed phenomenal success but became, as one of Fitzgerald's contemporaries, Cole Porter, put it, too hot not to cool down. **********""Nothing was being done to bring in new users,"" said Al Carosi, senior vice president of marketing at Hasbro's Parker Brothers division, ""like the 25-year-olds who were 15 in its peak years. I'd be amazed if they have a Trivial Pursuit game."" **********So in television commercials that begin this week, celebrities who mean something to younger game-players, like the New York Knicks basketball star Patrick Ewing and the model Elle Macpherson, appear among celebrities from the game's heyday. One of them is DeForest Kelley, who, when asked a question about the heart, sputters in character as the irascible Dr. McCoy of ""Star Trek"": ""How should I know? I'm an actor, not a doctor!"" **********All the fast-paced spots end with the tagline ""Is anyone    not    playing this game?"" Spending on the campaign, which runs through the crucial Christmas shopping season, will be in the range of $3 million to $5 million, Mr. Carosi added, placing it among this year's most ambitious board-game efforts. **********Robert Sorcher, senior vice president and group creative director at Grey, said: ""We're looking to create some real heat around this game, to keep it going as a brand so it doesn't become something that fades away."" **********Yet the danger in trying to revive fading brands is that they just might be fading for a reason. Perhaps consumers perceive them as old-fashioned, irrelevant or lacking in innovation. **********As a result, some marketers are hedging their bets. As Oldsmobile, founded in 1897, reviews its account, its parent, the General Motors Corporation, is continuing to develop its Saturn brand for buyers who might not have otherwise considered a G. M. product."

Tisch, CBS's chairman, attributed the poor performance to problems at the CBS Television network, including a large loss from sports programming during the year and additional losses from other programming. **********CBS reported a profit of $9.4 million, or 61 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1991, compared with a loss of $156 million a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent, to $937.4 million, from $919.7 million in the 1990 quarter.  Full-Year Results **********For the full year, the company said it lost $85.8 million, in contrast to a profit of $110.8 million, or $4.30 a share, in 1990. Sales fell 7 percent, to $3.03 billion, from $3.26 billion in 1990. **********For the fourth quarter of 1991 the company said, operating income totaled $6.8 million. In the 1990 quarter, CBS had an operating loss of $329.5 million, including a writeoff of $282 million related to its contracts with Major League Baseball. CBS said the contracts did not affect its fourth-quarter results because losses from them had already been written off. **********In the quarter, net sales for the network, the television stations and the radio stations rose. In addition, the World Series ran for seven games last year, compared with four games in 1990, thus providing an increase in sports advertising revenue. **********David Londoner, a media industry analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Company, said the CBS results had been anticipated by Wall Street. CBS's stock rose $1.25 yesterday, to $144.875, amid a broad rally on the New York Stock Exchange. Studio Acquisition **********CBS also announced that it would acquire the 50 percent stake that it does not already own in the CBS/ MTM Company, a television production studio. CBS said it would pay $27 million to TVS Entertainment for the stake. CBS exercised a right of first refusal that canceled a deal for the stake by the Walt Disney Company. **********Mr. Londoner said CBS posted a loss last year because it recognized that its baseball and football contracts would lose money into 1993 and 1994. The network decided to write off the anticipated losses in the third quarter of 1991. **********CBS said it recorded pretax losses of $322 million ($195.5 million after taxes) in 1991 and $282 million ($171.2 million after taxes) in 1990 related to its baseball and football television contracts. It said the company did not expect any profits or losses related to these contracts in 1992. **********Mr. Tisch said that for the full year, sales dropped 8 percent at the company's television stations and 2 percent at its radio divisions. Operating profits at both units fell as well, although Mr. Tisch did not say by how much. **********He attributed the overall declines to the recession, which has depressed advertising, and to the increasing amount of commercial time available as broadcast and cable networks offer more sports programming. **********The Persian Gulf war also depressed sales of network commercial time early in 1991. **********Loews Corporation **********The Loews Corporation, which is controlled by the Tisch family, also reported earnings yesterday. It said its fourth-quarter net income had more than doubled, to $272.3 million, or $4.04 share, from $116.8 million, or $1.66 a share, in the 1990 quarter. Revenues increased 10 percent, to $3.6 billion, from $3.28 billion. **********For the year, net income jumped 12.4 percent, to $903.3 million, or $13.14 a share, from $804.6 million, or $11.01 a share. Revenues were $13.62 billion, up 7.8 percent from $12.64 billion. Earnings per share increased in part because of the company's purchase of 2.60 million common shares during 1991.

""But there are still big ifs. They have to prove that this is easily producible."" 'War and Peace' on a Pin's Head **********In a Murray Hill, N.J., laboratory the team of scientists achieved storage densities as high as 45 billion bits of information per inch, they said. **********If that much information were in the form of recorded music, it would take a disk the size of a quarter eight days to play it all. If it took the form of compressed high-density television programming, a palm-sized disk could hold 17 hours' worth. **********For the more literary minded, the researchers said that their technique would make it possible to store two copies of ""War and Peace"" in an area about the size of the head of a pin. **********The data-storage densities said to have been reached by the Bell Labs team far exceed other experimental developments in United States and Japanese labs. In 1989, for example, researchers at I.B.M. laboratories in California said they had developed experimental magnetic disks that were capable of densities up to one billion bits per inch. And using conventional optical storage technology, researchers at Hitachi have achieved densities of about two billion bits per inch. **********The data-storage technique is based on a spinoff from work the Bell Labs scientists conducted in an innovative new optical microscope technology called near-field scanning optical microscopy, which has yielded advances in viewing small objects like living cells. **********The new storage approach is also similar to existing magnetic-optical storage systems that work by using a laser to change the polarity of tiny magnetic spots on a rotating disk. The polarity of a spot, corresponding to the north or south pole of a magnet, can be translated into the ones and zeroes of all digital information. **********But instead of using a lens to focus the laser -- as is done with current compact disk technology -- the researchers have achieved a vastly smaller spot size by stretching a fiber-optic cable until it breaks, leaving a microscopically fine tip. By shining a beam of laser light through the fiber-optic tip, the scientists have been able to write data on spots as small as 60 nanometers -- about 1,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. A $40 Billion Industry **********The Bell Laboratories scientists said they believed it would be relatively simple to commercialize the new technology because it could take advantage of two powerful commercial technologies: magnetic disk drives and scanning tunneling electron microscopes. **********""Data storage is potentially a big win because it's a $40 billion industry,"" said Eric Betzig, a Bell Laboratories physicist who leads a development team at the laboratory. **********Yet to be proven, however, is whether information can be quickly and accurately read from a disk based on the new technology. Because the data is so densely packed, it is harder to read -- just as the agate type in a newspaper's stock-market tables takes longer for the human eye to sort out than the front-page headlines. **********So far the researchers have been able to read the data at about 10,000 bits a second, far slower than conventional magnetic disks, which can read and write millions of bits of information a second. **********But Mr. Betzig said he believed that by adapting existing storage technologies it would be relatively simple to obtain higher reading and writing speeds. He also hinted that the researchers were experimenting with storage retrieval systems that did not use rotating disks, in contrast to current methods. Competitive Edge Seen for U.S. **********The Bell Laboratories work could help American companies regain the advantage against Japan in the market for optical memory systems, Mr. Porter, the consultant, said. **********To date, most commercial development of optical-storage technology has been performed in Japan. And Japanese companies have been the only ones to exploit consumer applications for the technology in products like audio compact disks and CD-ROM disks that can be read -- but not rewritten -- on a personal computer. **********The research could also lead to new interest in optical-storage technology in general. Despite great potential, the computer market for optical storage systems has largely been restricted to specialized archival applications because the technology has not been able to match the speed of magnetic storage."

The suspect, described as a 26-year-old second lieutenant in the special paramilitary forces, is said to have acted alone or to have been part of a conspiracy, depending on the source of information. **********Gen. Larbi Belkheir, Algeria's Interior Minister, said in a newspaper interview published today that the killer was part of a presidential guard detail under army command. His explanation appeared in part to be an effort to distance himself from any security lapse that allowed the slaying to be carried out on June 29 in the eastern city of Annaba. **********But accounts in newspapers controlled by other factions of the bickering Algerian Cabinet said that several people were involved in the killing and that some have been arrested. 2 Bursts of Fire **********General Belkheir said that Mr. Boudiaf, President of the Supreme State Council, was shot in the back with two machine gun bursts after a grenade was thrown beneath the rostrum. He said the suspect had maintained under questioning that he was not a member of any party but that he ""leans in an Islamic direction."" **********The general told the daily Al Hayat that the suspect belonged to a security force that received training in special operations and that he was arrested by colleagues as he tried to flee the scene. **********According to another account that appeared in some newspapers here, at least two men were implicated in the assassination. One was shot and killed and the other was chased down and arrested, those papers reported. **********Another version says that as many as 12 guards were arrested, including some commanders. **********The Government has chosen so far to show only an edited film of the killing on television and has said nothing definitive to confirm or deny the rumors. **********The lack of candor has contributed to a disaffection with the country's military-backed leadership, which allowed free parliamentary elections last December but then replaced the Cabinet, canceled the vote and cracked down on the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front when it appeared to be on its way to winning a majority in Parliament. **********The Government announced that five policemen were ambushed and killed today, part of a continuing battle between security forces and armed fundamentalist militants since the crackdown on the movement began five months ago. **********More than 100 security personnel, including policemen, soldiers, and special security forces, have been killed in the fighting, and at least as many fundamentalists are believed to have lost their lives.

The Americans said they blocked the attempt this week. **********A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries denied the American accusation, saying there was never any attempt to undermine the accord. ""It's very strange for anyone to criticize us that way,"" added Minoru Suzuki, a senior staff member at the ministry. **********Whoever is right, the disagreement, which came to light today, offered another indication of the subtle nature of trade disputes with Japan and the powerful role of anonymous bureaucrats in managing the Japanese economy. It was also yet another reflection of rising tensions over trade generally. A Triumph in 1988 **********At the center of the latest dispute was a 1988 agreement in which Japan promised under American pressure to drop its quotas on foreign imports of beef and oranges. That agreement was one of the early triumphs of American trade negotiators. **********Although tariffs, which are only being phased out, are still in effect, beef prices have started to fall, and on Monday Japan's leading economic newspaper, The Japan Economic Journal, reported that low-level bureaucrats had begun issuing ""guidance"" to leading trading companies to reduce imports of beef. The tiny article caused Americans to cry foul. **********A spokesman for the United States Embassy, William Morgan, said an American inquiry found that ""some lower-level bureaucrats in the ministry did approach several beef importers and try to jawbone them into reducing the quantity of imports."" 'Small Isolated Incident' **********He said that the trading companies had ignored the request, but that when the embassy raised the issue at senior levels in the ministry, senior officials were unaware of what had happened and promised it would cease. ""We're satisfied this was a small isolated incident and that it does not reflect ministry policy,"" Mr. Morgan said. ""We consider the issue to be closed."" **********Officials at the Agriculture Ministry charge heatedly that such talk is unfair. They said they never issued any direct ""guidance"" to any importers to curb imports of American or other foreign beef. Rather they merely ""commented"" to the importers on the market situation for beef. **********""We are in a position to know the supply and demand situation of the market,"" said Mr. Suzuki, who is a staff officer in the meat and eggs division of the ministry. ""If asked, we would tell anybody that it's clear that the market is in an oversupply situation right now."" A Comment or a Command **********He added: ""We are entitled to comment that if the price of beef continues to fall, everybody will be unhappy, and to say that it is important to balance imports with demand. It's just a comment that cannot be enforced. We certainly can comment in such a situation."" **********Mr. Suzuki said he and his colleagues were incensed that anyone would interpret such ""comments"" as an attempt by the ministry to suppress imports. **********Many analysts of the economic scene in Japan say ministries rarely give hard and fast directives, but usually convey their opinions through informal ""guidance"" or ""comments. **********A senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said recently that Japan would never tell automobile companies to comply with ceilings on exports, but that the ministry ""monitors"" whether such ceilings are adhered to. **********Asked what was meant by ""monitor,"" this official paused and said, ""It means: We watch!"" And with that he widened his eyes, leaped forward and raised both arms as if in attack, conveying the view that ""watching"" in Japan is often as good as enforcing when a ministry is considered all powerful."

The official said that only one general officer was known to have been purged. **********The additional information about the purge was circulated as Bush Administration officials offered conflicting public assessments of the reported effort to topple Mr. Hussein. On Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in a television interview that he gave some credence to the intelligence reports of a coup attempt. **********The State Department took an agnostic stance today on whether there had even been a coup attempt, suggesting that reports might be genuine or merely a story put out by Mr. Hussein to justify a crackdown against officers of questionable loyalty, to discourage future uprisings and demonstrate that he is in command. **********""Something appears to have happened in Iraq, but we are not sure what,"" the department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said. **********""What I can say is that Saddam and his regime are unpopular, and periodically there are reports of coup attempts, which do not surprise us,"" she added.

I think it's one more indicator of the fact that his base inside Iraq is shrinking and that he is in big trouble -- that in fact he's been enormously unsuccessful as the leader of Iraq. He doesn't control the north, where the Kurds are. He's got troubles in the south. He's got a reduced political base inside Iraq."" Different Interpretations Cited **********Bush Administration officials sought to play down the differences between the Defense and State Department assessments, arguing that the intelligence information was open to differing interpretations. **********Pentagon officials continued to argue that the intelligence findings point to a coup attempt that was stopped before it presented a serious threat to Mr. Hussein. **********According to one intelligence report, the attempt began early in the evening of June 29, and involved officers from a Republican Guard brigade in Taji, an industrial area northwest of Baghdad, as well as Iraqi officers in Baghdad who were plotting to kill Mr. Hussein. **********There are accounts of exchanges of gunfire, but the Iraqi brigade apparently never moved out of its compound, according to the reports. Hussein Springs a Trap **********The senior Pentagon official said that, after the failed coup, elements of the military and the security forces in Baghdad and in the northern city of Kirkuk engaged in factional fighting from June 30 to July 2. **********The official said that the coup attempt appears to have been detected by the security forces in its early stages and allowed to develop for a while so that the Government could determine who was involved before cracking down. The Pentagon official said the coup ""never had a chance."" **********Military experts say Mr. Hussein has long prepared for a possible military-supported coup. During the eight-year war with Iran, he moved brigades every 30 days to prevent plots. **********This reflected his calculation that officers at corps and division level were necessarily loyal, obligated to him for their position and benefits, and that the major threat to his rule came from the lieutenant colonels and colonels at brigade and battalion level."

Two scholars of finance say they have disproved the theory, common among investors, that stocks more volatile than the market as a whole are the best performers. **********Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, business professors at the University of Chicago, traced the performance of thousands of stocks over 50 years but found no link between relative volatility and long-term returns. The many investors who try to beat the market by buying widely swinging issues are misguided, they say. **********The importance of ""beta,"" the investment community's term for a stock's volatility relative to the market, has long been under challenge. But it is still closely watched by analysts, and business students are still taught that they can earn higher returns by buying stocks whose swings are wider than the market's. **********""The fact is,"" Professor Fama said in a recent telephone interview, ""beta as the sole variable explaining returns on stocks is dead."" **********Some still favor relatively volatile stocks, among them William F. Sharpe, a retired Stanford University professor who won the 1990 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for theories based on beta. ""It is a remarkable set of empirical results about what happened in the past,"" he said of the University of Chicago study. ""But I am not willing to make investment decisions based on the theory that there is no relationship between beta, properly measured, and expected returns."" **********If Professors Fama and French are right, however, the impact could be far reaching. Some highly volatile groups of stocks that have enjoyed wide followings -- airlines, for example -- could lose a portion of their appeal if beta-believing investors side with the professors. **********Additionally, many executives of publicly held companies have taken the view that if their own company's stock is more volatile than the market as a whole, any project they invest in -- from a lowly piece of new equipment to a huge joint venture -- must generate an extra high return to compensate investors for swings in the stock's price and earnings. The professors' work could force many companies to rethink the way they approach capital spending, finance scholars say. **********Finally, many publicly held utilities have used beta to justify rate requests. They figure the returns that investors demand, given their companies' betas, and develop rate structures that allow them to earn these returns. But recognizing that their low betas tend to argue against large rate increases, a growing number of utilities had already turned to other approaches. More will probably do so if the research of Professors Fama and French gains currency. **********And if investors decide to quit following betas, other theories of market behavior are likely to gain influence. ""What we are really taking about is opening the floodgates to a whole new generation of research into what truly drives stock prices,"" said Anthony B. Sanders, an Ohio State University professor of finance who is currently a visiting professor at the University of Chicago. ""Once you hammer a model like the old one closed, you generate all sorts of additional academic interest."" **********Professor Fama has already won worldwide recognition for his efficient-markets theory -- the notion that because investors all have essentially the same information it is impossible to consistently earn returns greater than those justified by the risks. **********Professor Sharpe used Professor Fama's theory as an assumption to develop the capital-asset pricing model, which links returns to risk, as measured by beta. **********Professor Sharpe says that a diversified portfolio can reduce the risks peculiar to individual companies -- that General Motors stock, for example, will be hurt by a strike. Investors, therefore, earn no rewards for bearing this risk, according to the Sharpe theory. **********But investors do earn higher returns for bearing the other type of risk, known as market risk, Professor Sharpe says. This risk, which remains even after an investor diversifies, depends on how much an individual stock is dragged up or down by the market as a whole. Stocks like that of the biotechnology company Genentech, which have betas of more than 1.0, are more volatile than the market, while stocks like that of the power company Consolidated Edison, which have betas of less than 1.0, are calmer than the market. **********To calculate market risk, or beta, finance professionals compare changes in the prices of individual stocks with changes in market indicators like the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index. Professor Sharpe and his followers say that in general, the higher a stock's beta, or volatility relative to the market, the greater its long-term returns. **********Professors Fama and French disagree. Their paper, just published by the University of Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices, says that long-term returns depend not on beta, but on company size and price-to-book ratios. Smaller companies, as measured by the market value of their shares, and those with low prices relative to their book values have in fact outperformed the market, they say. **********The professors theorize that investors view smaller companies as more vulnerable to economic downturns and therefore demand higher returns. They also say that low price-to-book ratios typically reflect financial problems, another reason for investors to demand higher returns. **********Professors Fama and French are by no means the first to fire an intellectual salvo at the capital-asset pricing model. Since Professor Sharpe developed the model in the early 1960's, a broad array of rival theories has emerged to explain stock price movements: the January effect, which says that stocks usually gain at the beginning of the year, to the weekend effect, which says stocks generally perform poorly on Mondays. Most recently, the arbitrage pricing theory says that stocks are driven by powerful economywide forces like unanticipated inflation and spikes in interest rates. **********But finance experts say that Professors Fama and French have presented the most conclusive evidence against beta. **********""What they have proven fairly rigorously is what other academics have been talking about for some time,"" said Richard Roll, a finance professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, who with others developed the arbitrage pricing theory."

Software For Manufacturers,Technology; 'What If . . .' Software For Manufacturers," **********COMPAQ Computer was about to phase out one of its personal computer models in 1990 when someone realized it had underestimated demand. Enter Cal Monteith, Compaq's manager of master scheduling and production control in Houston. Could he build 10,000 more PC's? In the past, such unexpected requests would have forced Mr. Monteith to rely mostly on gut instinct. Were there enough parts and plant capacity to handle the sudden change? **********This time, however, Mr. Monteith had powerful software from an obscure Canadian company, Carp Systems International. **********""We could see that we couldn't do it"" for lack of parts, Mr. Monteith said. ""But the Carp tool let us see down to the piece-part what we'd need and when we'd need it to build the 10,000 systems."" Compaq was able to fire off orders for the right parts and the company ended up building 30,000 more PC's -- on time, with little fuss. ""We added $6 million to the bottom line in net revenues,"" Mr. Monteith said. **********Factory managers have never had the means to easily calculate the impact of unexpected orders or design changes on production. There are an estimated 100,000 software systems installed in the United States that serve a whole range of manufacturing needs, including tracking purchasing, inventory, sales, production scheduling and more. But processing all this data keeps corporate mainframes humming 24 hours a day and leaves virtually no opportunity for manufacturing engineers to perform timely ""what if"" calculations to adjust for sudden changes. **********Product delays, overstocked inventories and huge cost overruns were the result. **********Carp software allows a manufacturer to quickly search its huge data bases, isolate the relevant data (customer orders, inventory or plant capacity) and do calculations that quickly adjust for variables, much as a spreadsheet program does. For example, if marketing wants 1,000 new widgets by the end of the month, how many new parts must be ordered by what day in order to fill that order? Calculations that would take 24 hours or more on the mainframe can pop up in minutes using the Carp software. **********""For the past 15 years, manufacturers haven't had very much information about what is really going on,"" said Alice Greene, an analyst with Industry Directions in Newburyport, Mass. ""Today, with the speed with which markets change, it makes it very difficult to run a business when you can't plan for it. Inevitably you'll run out of material when you need it most, miss delivery dates, have too many people working when you don't need them. There's been no way to see what you need to plan for."" **********Carp, based in Kanata, Ontario, has sold its software, called the Advanced Planning System, to such giants as Northern Telecom, John Deere, I.B.M., Sikorsky Aircraft and Trane, as well as Compaq. Its reviews seem almost seems too good to be true. **********Pitney Bowes, the $3.3 billion business equipment giant, wanted to overhaul its entire manufacturing process. With the Carp software, it simulated the proposed changes.  The consultant leading the project, John O'Connell, said the Carp software, run on a desktop computer, yielded calculations in minutes that would have taken 24 hours or more on the mainframe. **********For example, what would be the impact of changing order policies across the board at Pitney Bowes? ""We do our ordering based on having supply to cover 30 days worth of demand,"" Mr. O'Connell said. ""But we're trying to reduce inventory, so we ask: 'What if we cut that in half? What would be the impact? What would we save?' I can get an answer to that in five minutes."" **********""This information has always been in the system,"" Mr. O'Connell added. ""There was just no way to get at it."" **********In the wake of Hurricane Andrew, Trane's Unitary Products division in Fort Smith, Ark., was able to determine that it could quickly ship 114 five-ton air-conditioning systems for small businesses to south Florida, weeks or months ahead of the competition, without disrupting any of its previous customer commitments. Using the Carp software, Trane determined immediately how quickly it could build the needed units and what impact that would have on the rest of the company's manufacturing process. **********""The processing time to get the same information used to be measured in tens of hours,"" said Arthur Hess, manager of production control and manufacturing systems at Trane. ""Now it's less than 10 minutes. We had to see it work ourselves to believe something magical wasn't being done."" **********Sikorsky Aircraft, the $2 billion helicopter maker in Stratford, Conn., has used the software for three years to help halve its inventory and double sales, said John Sawyer, project manager in manufacturing. **********Since the 1960's, industry has depended on ""manufacturing resources planning"" software, known as MRP II and made by hundreds of vendors, to account for inventories and coordinate manufacturing plans. A typical MRP II software installation might include purchasing, general ledger, master production scheduling, planning and more. **********Because of the huge volume of data involved, these MRP II packages reside on large mainframe computers. And, in order to do simulation or ""what if"" type queries, a company must shut down all the other MRP II capabilities and devote the mainframe to the one task. Not surprisingly, companies have been loathe to do so. Factory managers have therefore had no way to calculate the impact of sudden new orders or design changes on production. **********What Carp Systems does is send its engineers to a company where they recreate a model of the data stored in MRP II and move it to an I.B.M. or Hewlett-Packard work station. Then the Carp software, using a sophisticated algorithm, can quickly do its searches for the relevant data. **********The software, in development since the company was founded in 1984, became available on a popular commercial computer, I.B.M.'s RS6000, in 1990. It remains complex -- and, at anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million -- expensive. Carp, which estimates revenues of $7 million this year, also has some competition. Two years ago, Monenco, a Canadian engineering firm based in Ottawa, introduced its FastMRP, also a simulation tool for manufacturing that runs on personal computers. Martin Horne, product manager for Monenco, says FastMRP costs far less than Carp's product. But Ted Rybeck, an analyst with Advanced Manufacturing Research in Cambridge, Mass., said FastMRP is less powerful and has significantly fewer features. **********JAMES MANION, president and chief executive of Carp, with United States headquarters in Lexington, Mass., said his company is seeking alliances with all of the major suppliers of MRP II software. These include I.B.M., ASK Computer, Andersen Consulting and Datalogix. The plan is to license its software to them and let them provide the product to their own customers. **********Mr. Rybeck applauded the Carp product, but he cautioned that it is not a panacea for all of manufacturing's ills. Data extracted from a company's mainframe may be out of date or wrong, he said, meaning ""you're just doing the wrong thing faster."" **********Mr. Rybeck said that he expected MRP II makers to build their own versions of the Carp software, but also said that it will take three years or so before such products emerge."

In many ways, it is really about the Crimean Peninsula itself, which is now poised for a referendum on its independence from Ukraine, and about Sevastopol, a navy town of faded elegance that dates to the reign of Catherine the Great. **********Ukraine's claim to the fleet is territorial: the Crimea has been part of Ukraine since 1954, when it was removed from the jurisdiction of the Russian republic and handed it over to Kiev, partly as a matter of administrative convenience. **********Russia's claim is historical, and for many of the Russians who live here and make up 70 percent of the city's population of 400,000, it is still deeply emotional. Sevastopol is where the Russian empire finally realized its dream of a southern port, while the Black Sea Fleet, led by a series of distinguished Russian admirals, became the agent of that key military objective. Yalta and Other Places **********Beyond Sevastopol's jagged bays lies the rest of Crimea, with its stunning coastline, the resort city of Yalta, and other places beloved by Russian writers from Pushkin to Chekhov and by government leaders from Nicholas II to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********As long as the Soviet Union existed, Russian mourning for the Crimea was muted. Even now, the Russian Government has refrained from staking any overt claims to the peninsula, although there have been rumblings from some of the more nationalist-minded deputies in Parliament. **********But the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, with the Unified Command of the Commonwealth Armed Forces, has insisted that most of the Black Sea Fleet be considered an integral part of the commonwealth's strategic forces, with control held in Moscow. **********In Kiev, pressure continues to mount for control of virtually the entire fleet, or at least that part based on Ukrainian territory. According to figures cited recently in the Russian news media, the Black Sea Fleet, smallest of the four principal fleets that made up the Soviet Navy, has 3 aircraft carriers, 6 missile cruisers, 30 submarines, 235 combat planes and helicopters and scores of support ships. Official figures are still classified. The Issue of Loyalty Oaths **********Ukraine first put the issue of the fleet to the test in January with an order that its officers and sailors join in a loyalty oath to the new and independent Ukrainian state. The fleet's commander, Adm. Ivan Kasatonov, later retaliated by administering oaths of loyalty to the commonwealth. **********The tug of war over loyalty oaths has continued, although both sides agree that the outcome is largely meaningless. Ultimately, the fate of the fleet is inexorably tied to the fate of the commonwealth, a political conundrum that no one seems able to solve, in the face of the rapid unraveling along national lines. Just this week, the Black Sea Fleet commanders received another claim, this one from a Georgian officer who asserted that the fleet's ships based in the Georgian town of Poti belonged to Georgia. **********Andrei L. Lazebnikov, chief of the fleet's press center, noting that 91 percent of the fleet's officers and sailors had sworn allegiance to the commonwealth, accused Ukrainian officers of waging an underground campaign to win sailors over to Kiev's side. He said about 10 Urkainian officers had been demoted as a result of such activity. **********""We are not against a Ukrainian oath, or a Ukrainian fleet,"" he said. ""It can be resolved, but in a civilized manner. On one military objective, on one ship, you cannot have one crew, with one-half swearing loyalty here, the other half there."" A Symbol of Protest **********Ukrainian officers say that the Ukrainian loyalty oaths, which they say have been taken by hundreds of officers and sailors, are a way of protesting the high-handed ""repression"" carried out by the fleet's commanders. **********""The process is spontaneous,"" said Capt. Third Class Aleksandr Plashashnikov, who is head of the Sevastopol Union of Ukrainian officers. ""People are taking the oath because they consider the fleet to be Ukrainian."" **********Sailors and officers say the contest for their loyalties has sapped morale, pitting Ukrainians against Russians in ways that no one was prepared for. **********""We don't fight, but we argue,"" said a 20-year-old senior sailor from Moscow, who was taking a walk through town with a Ukrainian shipmate. **********Two other servicemen, sweltering in their heavy wool coats on a warm spring day as they stopped at a cafe, confirmed the split along national lines. **********""The fleet is Ukrainian,"" said Taras Nemish, an 18-year-old sailor from western Ukraine. ""It should be Ukrainian and it will be."" **********His friend, Aleksandr Danilov, a 19-year-old Russian from Volgograd, disagreed. ""It should be a common fleet, as it was,"" he said. ""Let it stay that way."" Officers' Worst Fear **********For many career navy officers, from Admiral Kasatonov on down, the most dreaded solution, and the most likely one, is a division of the fleet. **********In the meantime, negotiations between military experts over dividing the fleet have come to a dead end. The issue was not even discussed at the recent meeting of heads of the commonwealth's 11 member states in Kiev, where many had hoped for a top-level decision on what most agree has become a political, rather than a military, issue. **********Many expect a turning point later this year when only Ukrainians will serve on Ukrainian territory, under new laws adopted by the constituent members of the commonwealth. **********Ukrainian officers trace the stalemate to Russia, which they see as promoting its own interests, under the camouflage of the commonwealth. The map on the wall at the fleet's press center would seem to bear out the Ukrainians' suspicions that Russians, who make up a majority of the officer corps, are not reconciled to a Ukrainian Crimea. On the large pink expanse of what was once the Soviet Union, someone penciled in the borders of the new Ukrainian state -- leaving out the Crimea. **********Indecision over the future of the fleet has cast a shadow over Sevastopol, with its old-fashioned downtown, classical colonnades, and hilly, tree-lined streets kept clean by brigades of sailors whose smart black uniforms help give the city its spiffy look. **********The city is still closed to foreigners and even nonresidents, except those granted special permission by Kiev, in accordance with local military authorities. City officials say it will be opened soon, but only after the resolution of a severe water shortage that now limits usage to three hours a day. **********Earlier this year, Sevastopol found itself short of funds, withheld by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet because of uncertainty over the fleet, Mayor Ivan F. Yermakov said. Those subsidies were later restored, but Mr. Yermakov said, ""As long as the issue of the fleet is unresolved, tensions remain in the city. **********""We cannot be indifferent to it since all the people here, in one way or another, are connected to the fleet,"" said Mr. Yermakov, a Byelorussian by nationality. ""I would prefer that the fleet remain together, in one single base. But mainly I am a supporter of a decision. The commonwealth is a state without a flag, and any fleet has to have a flag."" Governed by Kiev **********To the outrage of some residents, the Ukrainian Government recently resurrected Sevastopol's special status as city ruled directly by Kiev, as it was by Moscow under Catherine the Great and in the early Soviet era. Mr. Yermakov was named special representative to the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, making the Mayor answerable to Kiev, not to the local City Council or the regional Crimean government in Simferopol. **********These moves were protested this week by a small group of demonstrators carrying banners that declared Sevastopol to be a ""city of the Crimea, not a suburb of Kiev."" The Republican Movement of Crimea, which led the drive for next month's referendum on Crimean independence, asserts that Mr. Kravchuk's aim is to divide Sevastopol from the rest of the Crimea, as a way of insuring his claim to the Black Sea Fleet. **********As in Sevastopol, a large swath of territory that makes up 10 percent of the peninsula, ethnic Russians are the majority in the Crimea. In recent years, the region's ethnic mosaic has been made even more intricate by the return of some 166,000 Crimean Tatars to their homeland, after decades spent in Central Asia where they had been deported by Stalin after World War II. **********Like the loyalty oaths, the referendum is not likely to resolve anything. Ukraine is sure not to let the Crimea, which has the status of an autonomous region, break away entirely. **********Aleksandr Podolny, who heads the local chapter of the Ukrainian national movement Rukh, said the referendum was just the latest phase of an anti-Ukrainian campaign in the Crimea. An ardent defender of Ukrainian sovereignty, Mr. Podolny rejects the view that Sevastopol's glorious past belongs to Russia. ""That is a myth,"" he said. **********Another Rukh supporter added, ""Sevastopol was part of an empire, and now that empire has collapsed."""

Several hundred of them were forced back into Iraq at the end of December, according to the State Department and independent human rights and refugee organizations. **********The Saudi Government has told representatives of international agencies that it deplores the decision to return the Iraqis forcibly, which was apparently made at a local level, and that it would investigate and punish those responsible. The Saudis have also agreed to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to open an office in Riyadh and station representatives in two refugee camps, a spokeswoman for the organization said. **********Human rights organizations remain concerned, however, because of reports that refugees may have been coerced or tortured into signing ""voluntary"" repatriation papers and that some of the Iraqis may have been arrested or executed by the Iraqi authorities after being returned. The refugees are predominantly Shiite Muslims, suspect in both predominantly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and in the Sunni-dominated Iraqi Government. **********""The fundamental basis for modern refugee protection is the prohibition against returning an individual to a place where he or she may experience persecution,"" the New York-based Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights wrote in a letter to Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Minister. **********In another letter to Prince Saud, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, said, ""The situation has given rise to great concern over those persons returned against their will and the risk they face from exposure to extrajudicial measures, disproportionate punishment or inhuman and degrading treatment."" **********There are differences in reports about the numbers of Iraqis returned involuntarily. The State Department human rights report for 1991 says ""perhaps as many as 283"" Iraqis were sent back, in contravention of Saudi promises to treat humanely Iraqi prisoners from the Persian Gulf war and civilian refugees from southern Iraq. Some human rights groups, without firm evidence, believe that the numbers are much higher. **********According to the State Department, Saudi refugee camps hold about 22,000 Iraqi civilians, mostly from a Shiite area of southern Iraq that tried unsuccessfully to rebel against President Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of the gulf war. In addition, 13,000 to 14,000 Iraqi prisoners of war, reclassified as refugees after they declined to be returned to Iraq, are also held in the Saudi camps. **********The camps are considered exceptionally well maintianed and provisioned, according to international relief organizations whose representatives have visited the sites, although the Saudis have not joined international refugee conventions. **********But the predominantly Shiite refugees are treated with some hostility in Saudi Arabia, while being denied access to resettlement in third countries, refugee organizations say. **********Aziz Abu-Hamad, senior researcher at Middle East Watch, a human rights organization based in New York, said the Iraqi refugees in Saudi Arabia are exposed to ""religious indoctrination and abuse"" by Sunni clergymen who are especially intolerant of Shiites. He said books are distributed calling their beliefs a ""blasphemy."" **********Mr. Abu-Hamad also said in an interview Thursday that there have been confirmed incidents of violence in the refugee camps and that Iraqis have been killed. He said the Saudi Government had disciplined guards for opening fire."

There is no independent way to verify their authenticity, and it is too early to determine how many cases of missing servicemen might be resolved with the pictures. **********Although one Vietnamese official is said to have passed along the photographs, Government and private analysts are convinced that they could not have been removed from military archives in Vietnam without the tacit compliance of higher-ranking officials, possibly in the Ministry of Defense, who wanted to put an end to the long-running dispute that has blocked United States diplomatic recognition, trade and investment. **********Members of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A Affairs were told about the photographs in closed briefings in September and October. But reports about the pictures, showing Americans who died in military action or were killed by their Vietnamese captors, began to surface only in recent days as a high-level Presidential delegation made a quick trip to Hanoi to discuss the new evidence. Praise From President **********The Bush Administration praised Hanoi for its candor in declaring on Monday that it would open its archives to search for information requested by Washington. Officials also know, however, that critical information has been coming out for several months. **********An American analyst called the joint statement issued Monday in Hanoi a ""fig leaf"" offered to the Vietnamese by John W. Vessey Jr., the retired Army general who serves as President Bush's special envoy to Hanoi on this issue. General Vessey returned tonight from Vietnam and is expected to brief President Bush on Thursday. **********Mr. Vessey's hurriedly assembled delegation included Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam and now a member of the Select Committee; Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth M. Quinn, the State Department's representative on the issue; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Alan C. Ptak, and Ann Mills Griffiths, director of the National League of Families. **********A member of Senator McCain's staff said today that P.O.W.-M.I.A family members would be told Wednesday about the results of the Hanoi talks. Research on Vietnamese **********According to accounts supplied by officials and analysts here and in Southeast Asia, the first breach in the wall of security Hanoi has maintained on information regarding Americans was made early this year by an American researching the Vietnamese Army. **********While studying Government archives, the American -- who has been identified by several people but is not being named because it has not been possible to reach him -- began to photograph artifacts like dog tags found in a military collection and gave the photos to the Pentagon. **********Several months later, a large number of photographs was made available to Americans by a Vietnamese official at another documentation center. **********In September, Defense Department officials briefed the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee, John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, on the new material. The full committee was told about the photographs earlier this month by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Were Archives Extensive? **********American officials who have worked on the issue most closely say Hanoi maintained extensive archives about American prisoners and the American bodies recovered. Vietnam's repeated denials that it had such information frustrated the officials, who were under constant criticism and pressure from families of missing servicemen. **********The United States, which has had a office in Hanoi since the summer of 1991 to work on the cases of 2,265 Americans still unaccounted for, also has 50 or more people scattered around Vietnam at certain times checking ""live sighting"" reports. **********For more than a decade, Vietnamese ministries have demonstrated a wide range of attitudes toward cooperating with Washington on the issue, with hard-liners in the Interior Ministry the most negative and Foreign Ministry officials the most accommodating. **********The military has often been a mystery, taking unpredictable or inconsistent stands. But in September, Le Duc Anh, a maverick general with a reputation for solving problems, became President of Vietnam under a sweeping Government reorganization. **********""I suspect he just weighed in on this,"" said Douglas Pike, a historian of the Vietnamese Army and director of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley. **********""Anh is a key figure,"" Mr. Pike said. ""He is the czar on dealing with China, and maybe this extends to other foreign policy issues. He's in an ideal position as a military leader to fix the M.I.A. problem."" **********At the same time, he said, the President ""is known in Hanoi as Mr. Security."" For those who may worry that relaxation of relations with Washington will bring a blowup on the order of Tiananmen Square or Moscow in 1991, ""Anh is the guy who will see it will not happen."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/business/insurer-has-big-investor-metropolitan.html,Eric Berg,1992-01-21,,793,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Insurer Has Big Investor: Metropolitan,Insurer Has Big Investor: Metropolitan," **********The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has agreed to buy half of the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, a move that should greatly ease the concerns of the 100,000 policyholders in limbo since insurance regulators seized Executive Life and its sister company in California last spring. **********Details of the agreement were disclosed yesterday by people working on the deal, who insisted on anonymity. **********The policyholders own Executive Life of New York life insurance policies and ordinary annuities, which begin payment after a person retires. Under a plan that New York State Insurance Department officials are scheduled to detail at a midday news conference today, the Executive Life policies and annuities would be exchanged for similar Metropolitan Life policies and annuities. **********To finance those obligations, Metropolitan Life would receive from Executive Life cash and cash equivalents like Treasury bills worth $1.5 billion. Because Metropolitan Life would receive sufficient assets to settle the annuity and life insurance obligations, the transaction should insure that the 100,000 policyholders are paid in full. **********The only question is when these policy and annuity holders can once again cash in their policies, which are currently frozen. The transaction is subject to approval by the New York State Supreme Court judge overseeing the rehabilitation of Executive Life of New York, and that process that could take from six to nine months. **********Nonetheless, one of the people involved in the negotiations insisted that the holders of life insurance and ordinary annuities ""will end up with 100 cents on the dollar."" **********The fate of an additional 18,000 Executive Life of New York customers remains uncertain, however. That is because Metropolitan Life has agreed to perform only the bookkeeping for their accounts but not to assume the liabilities. So any losses suffered on the investments backing these accounts would have to be made up by a party other than Metropolitan Life. **********The investments, a significant percentage of which are junk bonds, constitute the half of Executive Life of New York that Metropolitan Life, the nation's No. 2 life insurer, after Prudential, is not acquiring. **********It was losses on junk bonds and subsequent heavy withdrawals by policyholders that prompted the respective regulators in New York and California to seize Executive Life of New York last spring and the larger California company, the Executive Life Insurance Company, both subsidiaries of the bankrupt First Executive Corporation of Los Angeles. **********Most of the 18,000 people whose situations remain unclear are holders of so-called single-premium-immediate annuities. ""Structured settlements,"" as these annuities are more commonly called, are purchased by doctors, dentists and other health-care professionals to pay legal obligations to patients in negligence lawsuit settlements. Thus, if an insurer like Executive Life of New York that sells structured settlements reports investment losses or, worse, is liquidated, the recipients of structured-settlement payments can suffer. **********A Metropolitan Life spokesman, Charles Sahner, declined to comment on the agreement, which was reported in The Wall Street Journal yesterday. Kevin Foley, the New York State official who has been managing the rehabilitation of Executive Life of New York, also declined to comment. **********But the people working on the deal said Mr. Foley had no choice but to devote $1.5 billion of Executive Life's $3 billion in assets to resolving the cases of the 100,000 holders of life insurance and ordinary annuities. That, they explained, was because, unlike the 18,000 people receiving structured settlements, the annuity and life-insurance holders will have the option to cash out. The cash and cash-equivalent assets of Executive Life of New York had to be used to back these highly liquid obligations. **********The approach also has the advantage of being riskless from Metropolitan Life's perspective. Because the insurance giant is receiving only cash and cash equivalents, there is virtually no risk of its losing money on the deal. **********Nonetheless, the people working on the deal said Mr. Foley would not have gone forward if he had not believed the assets of Executive Life were sufficient to meet the structured settlement obligations. Unlike John Garamendi, the California insurance commissioner, who engineered a sale of the California subsidiary's junk bond portfolio, Mr. Foley opted to hold Executive Life of New York's junk bonds. The net result is that the New York company last year received close to $200 million in interest from the bonds. **********Additionally, Metropolitan Life agreed to pay New York State about $60 million for the life insurance and annuity business. **********With help from his financial adviser, the First Boston Corporation, Mr. Foley is understood to have considered numerous plans under which various junk bonds held by Executive Life of New York were either redeemed or went into default."

Terms of the Deal **********Under the deal, which was announced Thursday, each company will own 50 percent of the new business. Stockholders of each of the companies will receive shares in the newly formed enterprise. **********Both companies have extensive holdings in the United States. Reed owns Cahners Publishing, and Reed publications, which number more than 70, include Variety and Modern Bride. Elsevier is a leading publisher of scientific journals in the United States and abroad. **********Analysts say that with the prices of American media properties depressed, continued expansion in the United States is likely.

""We want good, sound, long-run businesses."" **********He added, referring to businesses that do not depend on advertising revenues, that ""both of us place a higher value on businesses that are less cyclical.""  Mixed Sources of Revenue **********Reed owns many publications that depend on both subscription and advertising revenues, like Modern Bride. Mr. Davis said 40 percent of Reed's revenue came from advertising. **********""I would buy Variety again,"" he said. ""It has the subscription revenue and newsstand sales revenues. But Martindale-Hubbell, that we can put on CD and on line, is the sort of business we are even more keen on."" Martindale-Hubbell Inc. publishes a law directory that provides biographical information and ratings on more than 800,000 lawyers; the service is also available to computer users. **********Besides possible acquisitions in the United States, the companies are also interested in exploring deals in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. **********Despite the worldwide economic weakness, the two companies are forecasting a 24 percent increase in profits for this calender year. **********Reed had 1991 profits of $243 million on sales of $2.84 billion, while Elsevier had profits of $217 million on sales of $1.34 billion. The higher profit margins of Elsevier reflect its ownership of publications that are less heavily dependent on advertising than are those of its rivals."

But in the last decade or so, as American economic fortunes have declined relative to powerhouse nations like Germany and Japan, criticism has grown especially intense from the business sector. **********Employers complain that young Americans arrive at the workplace bereft of the academic and social skills needed for jobs and without the ability to adapt as external forces inevitably reshape employers' needs. **********The problem, say two experts, lies not, as critics more typically say, with irrelevant feel-good classes on ethnic diversity and patty-cake academics. In fact, argue Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, and Ray Marshall, Labor Secretary in the Carter Administration and now a professor of economics and public affairs at the University of Texas, schools do in some sense prepare children for the demands the workplace puts on them. The irony, they argue in their new book, ""Thinking for a Living: Education and the Wealth of Nations"" (Basic Books), is that many jobs now don't require much more than an eighth-grade education. If American corporations continue to organize the workplace as they do now, even that number is likely to decline. **********Industry, they argue, has organized itself according to the scientific principles of management developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor, in which a middle stratum of well-educated managers micromanaged the work of line employees, whose tasks were broken down into their least complicated constituent parts. One result: mass production, American style, which delivered to the world reasonably priced, medium-quality consumer goods. The system provided the force that catapulted the United States into its recent role as a dominant economic force. **********That system treats front-line workers -- the people who make the goods and deliver the services -- as interchangeable parts responsible for uncomplicated, repetitive tasks. As everyone who has watched jobs flow offshore recently knows, saving jobs depends on forcing wages down. And as wages go, so goes the American standard of living. The country can no longer depend on medium-wage, low-skill jobs to power the economy. It needs high-wage, high-skill jobs. **********For that, the United States also needs what it has never had: an educational system that coordinates the social needs of the country with its economic needs. Part of the problem is that the critique of the schools comes more from the so-called cultural elite than it does from the grass roots. **********Research cited in the book indicates many Americans think that the education system as a whole is in crisis -- but that their own schools are fine. Those attitudes, say the authors, come from their experience as parents. Either their kids are getting the same curriculum, hence the same jobs, as the parents got. Or, their kids are still getting into Harvard and Yale. **********Those standards, such as they are, are the wrong ones, argue the authors, who believe American standards should be pegged to the achievements of students in competitor industrialized nations, not to historical standards in the United States. Japanese enter the workforce directly from high school, with the level of education provided in the United States by many four-year colleges. **********THE United States, on the other hand, has a high dropout rate, about which it does little; no apprenticeship system analogous to one in Germany that funnels young people into crafts and trades; no organized system of preparing college-educated students for work, a failing that casts many of them adrift for years before they settle into ""real"" careers, and most damningly, a tolerance for the spectacle -- virtually unique in the industrialized West -- of more than a quarter of its children living in poverty. **********The authors have a plan. They would establish, for example, a vertically integrated system of local and national boards, advised by educators, business people, politicians and policy makers, that would coordinate standards in the schools and the demands of the labor market. **********The question, as they acknowledge, is whether any political leader has the fortitude to tell the truth about what needs to be done and whether Americans have the will to listen. According to the authors, we must. BUILDING A UTOPIAN CONSENSUS **********When Ray Marshall began serving as Labor Secretary in the Carter Administration he had a fairly typical assessment of the American economy. ""I thought it was the greatest system on earth,"" he said. But his experience, especially with young people in job training programs, persuaded him that an economy based on low-wage mass production would stagnate. ""The only way we can improve income is to work harder,"" he said. In the late 1970's, ""it became clear that we were working harder and standing still."" **********After he left office, Mr. Marshall, an economist, stayed interested in training and education issues. He served on the advisory council of the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, where in the mid-80's he met its director, Marc Tucker. **********Parts of the remedy the two authors propose for the malaise they describe seem utopian. The price would be billions of dollars and require a nearly unimaginable level of integration and cooperation among interests -- business, education, government -- that traditionally view each other skeptically. But Mr. Marshall says the National Center on Education and the Economy has raised money to start building a private-sector consensus on educational standards that might later be brought to government. Mr. Tucker points out that some of what they propose is not far from gaining acceptance. Improved product quality, for example, a crucial element in raising the quality of jobs, is high on the agenda of many companies. As for the rest of the Tucker-Marshall program, Mr. Tucker says: ""The longer the country is faced with economic stagnation, and remedies are tried and don't work, well, people will warm up."""

Many hoped the revisions would prevent recurring gas gluts like those that have depressed prices and raised producers' debt burdens in recent winters. Fear Price Fixing **********But the giant oil companies, which produce more than a third of the Texas gas, contended that the changes gave state regulators powers that could tempt them to restrict gas output illegally in a bid to raise prices. **********Texas, the nation's largest gas producer, shipped 27 percent of the nation's gas supplies in 1990. Last month, lawmakers in Oklahoma, which produces 12 percent of the nation's supplies, adopted tighter gas-production controls. **********Lena Guerrero, chairwoman of the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, declared before a crowded hearing room today in Austin that the Texas regulators were not scheming with other gas-producing states in the Southwest to devise an OPEC-style cartel to raise gas prices for consuming states, notably in the Northeast, the Midwest and California. **********""Any attempt by the commission to do so would violate state and Federal law, and I wouldn't be a part of it,"" Ms. Guerrero said. ""The commission will never create an artificial shortage of natural gas."" **********Ms. Guerrero, a former Texas state representative and protegee of Gov. Ann Richards, could decide in 60 days to adopt another, more contentious rule that would give commissioners direct power to control supplies by restricting gas output across the state. **********Ms. Guerrero delayed a vote on the issue today after another commissioner, Bob Krueger, said the additional change would be illegal and would stir the wrath of Congress and Federal agencies. **********Mr. Krueger, a former Democratic Congressman, said he had supported eliminating price controls on the natural gas industry, which Congress approved in 1978. **********The commission now estimates monthly demand from its own historical data and production records of 2,700 separate Texas gas fields. The changes adopted today allow gas producers to estimate how much gas they will sell and end the practice of relying on pipeline companies to estimate how much they will buy. **********Producers have complained for years that pipeline companies regularly overstate their demand, causing too much gas to reach the market and artificially lowering prices. **********The new Texas rules will set production limits yearly, instead of monthly. The change is intended to give producers the choice to restrict or increase gas sales each month as long as the yearly volume is within limits, known as ""allowables."" **********In the first nine months of 1991, the amount of gas produced from Texas wells and established with pipeline company estimates for demand exceeded actual sales by nearly 18 percent, according to the commission. Warning From Congressmen **********Two powerful Congressmen, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, told Mr. Krueger in an April 16 letter that the Texas Railroad Commission was dangerously close to restricting gas supplies in some of its policy considerations. **********Kathleen E. Magruder, a government affairs manager for the ARCO Oil and Gas Company, a big gas producer, predicted there would be only small cutbacks in Texas gas output because of the rule changes, which will take effect as early as July. **********""But the perception of the people we're trying to sell our gas to is that the state is willing to monkey with the system to fit the needs of anyone but the consumer,"" she said. **********But T. Boone Pickens, whose independent company, Mesa Inc., was weakened by years of low gas prices, said the new rules would allow independent producers to stop production from wells when gas prices slump instead of being forced to produce regardless of price, as many are now. **********He said Texas gas would remain less expensive, more abundant and more reliable than imported oil."

Fifty other wineries, including the Sebastiani Vineyards of Sonoma, Calif., have resigned from the Wine Institute since it became a voluntary organization two years ago, but industry consultants predict a broad exodus following the departure of Mr. Mondavi. **********Officials of many smaller wineries said they felt that the institute's policies and practices were too closely dictated by its largest member, the E.& J. Gallo Winery of Modesto, Calif., and not responsive to their needs or wishes. Reconciliation Effort Fails **********The Mondavi letter of resignation was mailed last week and will be the subject of a meeting of the institute's board on Tuesday. Mr. Mondavi, and his sons, Michael and Timothy, the winery's co-chief executives, were all said to be out of the country and unavailable for comment. But Harvey Posert, the winery's spokesman, confirmed that the letter of resignation had been sent. **********He said efforts to reconcile longstanding differences of opinion on the Institute's policies had failed, even though Michael Mondavi served as the institute's chairman in 1988. **********Mr. Posert said that over the ast 10 years Robert Mondavi had been asking that the Wine Institute ""pay more attention to basic educational programs about wine."" **********""They have never moved ahead on that at all,"" he said. Despite paying over $300,000 a year in dues to the Institute, ""we've had to set up our own governent-relations program,"" he said. The Direr View **********John DeLuca, the Wine Institute's president, said he had agreed with Robert Mondavi not to discuss the resignation until after the board meeting on Tuesday. The issues involved ""are much more complex than it appears on the face of it,"" he said. Mr. DeLuca said that while some wineries had left the institute, some had rejoined and others were joining for the first time. **********But others took a much direr view of the consequences. Mr. Mondavi and his sons have led a group within the institute's membership that argued for active promotion of wine as a healthful part of a gracious life. Until very recently, however, the institute chose to play a more defensive role against anti-alcohol forces. **********Mr. Mondavi has attributed this policy to Ernest Gallo, who he said feared product liability suits. The Gallos have never commented publicly on the matter but have urged Mr. Mondavi not to resign. **********""This could well be the death of the Wine Institute as know it,"" said Paul Gillette, publisher of The Wine Investor, an industry newsletter."

Germany Counters U.S. Stance **********Not long after the Secretary General spoke, Germany announced that it would counter the position of the United States and sign a treaty to protect the world's biological riches, one of the twin pillars of the summit meeting. Canada made the same announcement on Monday, and there were reports that Britain was preparing to do so as well. Britain has had strong reservations about some aspects of the treaty, but Prime Minister John Major was said to be under strong pressure from environmentalists at home. **********The German and Canadian announcements and a British decision to follow suit could be the first steps in isolating the United States on the issue. **********The biodiversity treaty gained another important supporter today when India announced that it would sign. It also said it would support the other pact to be signed here, one aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases. **********India was a leader of the developing countries in negotiations on both treaties, and there had been doubts about whether it would sign since it has not yet signed an international accord on protection of the earth's protective ozone layer. **********The Indian decision to sign ""may be the most important thing that's happened here so far,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund, a private advocacy group. Backers of the climate treaty were predicting that more than the required 50 signatures would be obtained in Rio to put the treaty provisionally in force. It is to be presented for signature on Thursday, the biodiversity treaty on Friday. **********Environmental groups were lobbying hard for the biodiversity treaty, describing it as a breakthrough in the worldwide attempt to contain human destruction of natural ecosystems and habitats that, some scientists fear, could result in the extinction of a quarter of the planet's plant, animal and microbial species in the next half century. **********The treaty would require signers to consider the preservation of species as well as economics in their development decisions. The defection of many industrialized countries would cripple the treaty because they would provide the money to make it work. **********William K. Reilly, the head of the American delegation, arrived in Rio proclaiming the protection of the world's forests as his Government's primary objective for the summit meeting. President Bush announced last week that the United States would provide $150 million next year as a down payment on additional aid to developing countries in preserving their forests. The Americans say their focus advances the general aims of the two Earth Summit treaties because forests absorb carbon dioxide and contain the richest ecosystems. **********But Ting Wen Lian, a Malaysian delegate, has said in no uncertain terms that the developing countries will tolerate no infringement on their right to use their forests as they see fit. Malaysia, whose economy depends heavily on logging, has been a leader of the developing countries on the forest issue. A Debate on Forestry **********The battle is to be joined here in a debate over a set of principles to guide world forestry, with the United States advocating that the conference call for the future negotiation of a binding forest treaty. Many developing countries strongly resist the idea. **********Mr. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said today that if the biodiversity treaty had been restricted to conservation matters, ""we would have signed it."" **********The United States decided not to sign on grounds that the treaty fails to give adequate patent protection to American companies that transfer technology to developing countries, that it leaves unclear the way in which money would be transferred from North to South and that it tries to regulate genetically engineered materials, the production of which is a field in which the United States leads. **********The treaty leaves the amount of money to be determined by the conference of the parties to the agreement. If more developing countries than rich ones were to ratify it, as is possible, they would hold the majority vote and could, for example, require developed countries to put up more money than their domestic politics or policies would allow. **********Other industrialized countries expressed unease with the financing provision, and there was talk that many of them would follow the United States in rejecting the treaty. But the announcements by Canada and Germany appeared to blunt whatever momentum the treaty's opponents had brought to the summit meeting."

Seeks Blocked Funds to Use in Iraq," **********The United States and the other four permanent members of the Security Council are considering using Iraqi assets frozen abroad to pay for humanitarian supplies and the destruction of Baghdad's most dangerous weapons, and to start compensating victims of its invasion of Kuwait, diplomats said today. **********Iraq's assets abroad are thought to total about $5 billion. The amount in the United States is about $500 million, according to recent Congressional testimony by the Bush Administration. **********The Council has already asked Iraq to resume selling oil, its major export, under the terms of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war. The terms require that the money be handed over to the United Nations, which would then spend it on food and medicine, the elimination of Iraqi weapons and reparations to Kuwait and to individuals who suffered losses as a result of the Iraqi invasion and occupation.  Stubborn Over Oil **********Iraq has returned some of the property it plundered from Kuwait, but so far has refused to sell its oil, despite evidence of mounting hardship in Iraq. The Government says it will not compromise its sovereignty by having the United Nations dictate how Iraqi money is spent. **********Because Iraq has refused to sell oil, the fund set up to pay compensation claims against Iraq remains empty. **********The United States has suggested that priority go to compensating poor foreign workers who lost their savings as a result of the invasion, since this would provide a useful injection of hard currency into countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Egypt, which are heavily dependent on remittances from citizens working abroad. Stubborn Over Weapons, Too **********Iraq is also refusing to cooperate with United Nations efforts to identify and destroy its most dangerous weapons, and is defying international pressure to end an economic blockade against the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. **********Britain and France are urging the council to send an envoy to Iraq to persuade the authorities to lift the trade blockade on the Kurdish region and to end military harassment of Shiite Muslims in the south. **********Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to meet with the Security Council here on March 11 to explain why Iraq is refusing to destroy ballistic missile equipment and to provide further details of its armament plans. 3 Ways to Spend Money **********Diplomats say the United States has proposed three ways to use Iraq's frozen assets. **********The first would be a Security Council order directing that the $1.5 billion worth of Iraqi oil in transit when the international embargo against Iraq was imposed be put under United Nations control. These assets, in the form of oil and delayed oil payments, has already been earmarked by the Council for compensation payments and humanitarian aid. **********Another option, officials say, would be a resolution directing the Bank for International Settlements to hand over more than $300 million that Iraq keeps there. This cash is a deposit from which the bank settles other countries' trade accounts with Iraq. **********Finally, the Security Council could order or encourage countries to unblock Iraq bank deposits and other financial assets, including shares held in companies. **********The Security Council committee overseeing sanctions against Iraq has already said that governments may unfreeze such funds at their discretion, provided they use the money to sent humanitarian goods to Iraq. But the United States and the 12 European Community countries agreed not to do so in order to encourage Baghdad to accept the oil-sales plan. **********While major governments agreed to freeze what Iraqi assets they could find, experts say Baghdad still has access to secret funds abroad that are being used to pay for some imports of food and other goods. But no one knows how much is involved."

At the time, though, Larry Yost, the executive in charge of operations in the industrial control business, had his eye on a future in which a growing number of his products were likely to be electronic machine controllers, vision systems and similar solid-state devices. **********One result of that vision, a new circuit board assembly line in Milwaukee, is now being shown off for the first time and it looks as if the 54-year-old Mr. Yost and his colleagues are in for a new round of praise and visits. **********Some 15 employees run the line, overseeing equipment that each week puts about 500,000 components on boards per shift. The volume is not high by consumer electronics assembly standards but the variability is. The line can be working on as many as 10 different products simultaneously, can handle production batches as small as a single unit and can deliver a product within a day of an order being received. A few unusual components are handled manually. **********""This is different from the contactor facility because it takes into account long-term plans for new products,"" said Mr. Yost, referring to the line's capacity to accommodate several different methods of attaching components to circuit boards. **********Allen-Bradley credits the new line with sharply reducing inventory and other overhead costs. Because the line is tied directly to computer-aided design stations, the time to create new products has been pared from as much as three years to as little as five months."

Aide Says","Iraq Trying to Make Plutonium Too, U.N. Aide Says"," **********United Nations nuclear inspectors now in Iraq are hunting for a secret nuclear reactor capable of producing enough plutonium to make two or more bombs a year, United Nations officials and European diplomats say. **********For the first time, the United Nations inspectors searching for President Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction have described intelligence suggesting that Iraq has a previously unknown reactor capable of turning out plutonium. **********So far the main thrust of their search has been toward discovering evidence of Iraq's attempt to make highly enriched uranium explosive and to design a weapon capable of using it. **********The significance of the new intelligence, experts say, is that President Hussein was trying to build an atomic bomb using plutonium explosive as well. 'Reason to Believe' **********While the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima used uranium as its explosive, the one that destroyed Nagasaki used plutonium, which is also used in most nuclear weapons now. **********""We have reason to believe Iraq may have an undeclared plutonium reactor but our inspectors have found nothing significant yet,"" Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish head of the special United Nations commission, said today. **********""All the specialists believe there is a reactor somewhere there,"" a European diplomat said. **********The current search, the tenth the United Nations has conducted, has yielded nothing so far and the team is to leave Iraq on Thursday. On Tuesday the team searched the prison in the northern city of Mosul but again drew a blank. **********However the intelligence, much of it from France, suggesting that Iraq has such a reactor has encouraged the United States, France and Britain to consider asking the Security Council to issue a new ultimatum to President Hussein ordering him to cooperate with their efforts to remove his weapons of mass destruction, diplomats say. The Unresolved Issues **********These three countries, together with the other two permanent Council members, Russia and China, are discussing a possible new Security Council resolution or statement that would address several of their current disputes with Baghdad, according to diplomats. **********These include President Hussein's economic blockade against dissident Kurds in the north, trade-sanction violations, the failure of Iraq to account for hundreds of missing Kuwaitis, Iraq's refusal to sell oil under United Nations guidelines to pay for food imports and the President's refusal to cooperate with the Security Council on the weapons issue. Most of these steps were part of the cease-fire agreement ending the Persian Gulf war. **********Some diplomats said that if Baghdad rejected a new ultimatum, it could help pave the way for a new allied intervention in Iraq, aimed in part at encouraging a coup. **********The nuclear inspections mounted by the special commission and by the International Atomic Energy Agency have established that President Hussein had a large nuclear-weapons program that included plans for producing highly enriched uranium explosive using both the centrifuge technique and electromagnetic separation. **********Like all other aspects of Iraq's covert nuclear program, possession of a secret nuclear reactor would violate the country's obligation as a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to place all its nuclear installations under international safeguards. **********Possession of a reactor also violates a similar obligation that Iraq accepted when it agreed to the Security Council resolutions ending the Gulf war. Help From China **********Last July, a declassified United States Army intelligence document said the United States believed that in 1986, China completed a feasibility study on building a nuclear power plant in Iraq. **********The heavily censored document, which was obtained by the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington research group, revealed that the specifications for the project included ""ability to camouflage from satellites,"" suggesting that the plant was being built for clandestine operation. **********However Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, said he has no evidence the reactor was ever built. **********Officials at the United Nations say the intelligence presented so far suggests that Iraq might have concealed a reactor with a power of between 20 and 30 megawatts, which could produce about 20 pounds of plutonium each year. Assuming 10 to 12 pounds of plutonium for each bomb, this amount would allow Iraw to build two nuclear weapons annually.  How to Use Plutonium **********The bomb dropped on Nagasaki has been widely reported as containing about 12 pounds of plutonium. But the United Nations inspectors have already found evidence that Iraqi scientists were experimenting with more modern techniques to increase a bomb's explosive yield, permitting use of less plutonium. **********The plutonium that Iraq acquired from a reactor would need to be separated from the residue of its burnt uranium fuel rods. And experts point out that Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission made no secret of its interest in doing this, reporting several separation experiments in recent annual reports. **********The United Nations inspectors also discovered that Iraq illicitly produced about 3 grams of plutonium by secretly irradiating uranium in a Soviet reactor that was under international safeguards. The test was carried out between visits by inspectors sent by the international agency to make sure the reactor was not used for military ends."

Maloney seek criminal fraud charges against Grumman and Mr. O'Brien, the lawyers said yesterday. It is now up to Mr. Maloney to decide whether to go along with this suggestion or file a civil lawsuit, the lawyers said. Mr. Maloney, whose jurisdiction includes Grumman's headquarters in Bethpage, L.I., could also decide to drop the matter, but the lawyers said this was highly unlikely. Focus on No-Bid Jobs **********The investigation focuses on a series of no-bid Navy subcontracts Grumman awarded to companies controlled by James T.

But powerful political opposition has complicated chances of ratification here. 'Funny Trade Laws' **********A decision by American steelmakers at the end of June to file charges against Canada and 20 other countries, accusing them of dumping steel -- selling it below cost -- has made Canada's position in the broader trade negotiations even more difficult. Canada immediately retaliated by naming the United States as an unfair seller in Canada. **********""The way the American dumping law is written and interpreted, it can't deal with the total integration of our marketplace,"" said Fred Telmer, chairman of Stelco Inc., one of Canada's largest steel producers with $2 billion (Canadian), about $1.68 billion United States, in annual revenue. **********Mr. Telmer and other steel executives here say the American definition of dumping makes no sense in a market in which hundreds of trucks are delivering steel plate, sheet and pipe across the border daily and in which Canadian steel sales representatives have to go to Detroit to sell steel to Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three auto makers. **********John Mayberry, executive vice president of Dofasco Inc., another leading producer, added, ""We should be able to compete in the market without looking over our shoulders at funny trade laws all the time."" **********The Canadians are seeking a common set of principles similar to those agreed to in a 1965 agreement that provided for a free flow of autos and parts and that was extended under the Canadian-United States free-trade agreement that took effect Jan. 1, 1989. **********Stelco, Dofasco and three other Canadian companies -- Ipsco Inc., Sidbec-Dosco Inc. and Algoma Steel Inc. -- have formed a coalition to press for agreement with the Americans that dumping laws should not be so narrowly defined and reflect instead the integrated nature of North American steel trade. **********Specifically, they say antidumping measures should be prohibited if imports are either priced to meet the competition or do not have a substantial market share. **********Canadians have about 3 percent of the United States market. American steel companies, which have become increasingly export oriented in recent years, now supply about 15 percent of the Canadian market. **********As part of a new steel arrangement, the Canadians are hoping to get immediate elimination of both steel tariffs and other barriers and to establish mechanisms governing the use of government subsidies and the imposition of countervailing duties. International Effort **********The industry talks are being held within a forum, the North American Steel Council, a body of producers from Canada, Mexico and the United States that tackles common problems. That council is part of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the powerful Washington-based trade association. **********Mr. Telmer of Stelco is the new chairman of the North American Steel Council, succeeding Frank Luerssen, chief executive of Inland Steel, who is retiring. **********A spokeswoman for the Department of International Trade in Ottawa said, ""Both Governments are aware that the industries are talking, and the Canadian Government is strongly encouraging the talks to continue."" **********An American trade official who declined to be identified said the Bush Administration was interested in the idea but would await a conclusion of the industry talks before proceeding with any formal negotiations."

Hills, the United States trade representative, released a list of $2 billion worth of annual food imports from Europe and said she intended to impose prohibitive duties on $1 billion of them unless the issue was resolved. The duties, which are likely to be 100 percent or more, could make these products exorbitant in the United States, costing double or triple the current prices. **********For example, vermouth, a minor but necessary ingredient in dry martinis, now sells for about $7 a bottle. But it could cost $15 or $20 a bottle if American trade officials decided that extremely high duties were necessary to discourage sales. French Goods Are Notable **********The list was drafted to include a range of goods from many European countries. Exports from France, which has been the United States' biggest adversary in agricultural trade talks, are prominently featured on the list. **********The proposed retaliation is aimed at making European luxury food producers beseech their politicians to reduce the community's soybean subsidies. Today's extensive list of targeted imports also represents an American bargaining stance that may change during trans-Atlantic negotiations, which are likely to result eventually in some duties, although likely on less than $1 billion of imports. **********The announcement of imports for tariff retaliation is also a form of public posturing, because negotiations could theoretically continue into next year before duties are actually collected. **********Once a period for public comment expires in mid-July, Mrs. Hills will be free to cut the list by half and assess tariffs for each product at any time. The new tariffs would not actually be collected for at least a month after that, and possibly not for seven months if Mrs. Hills periodically announces that she is making progress in negotiations.  Today's announcement came after the close of business in Europe, but European officials predicted a blistering reaction on Wednesday morning in Brussels from either Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community, or Frans Andriessen, a vice president of the community and its chief trade official. **********European officials were privately outraged, accusing the Bush Administration of pandering to domestic farm groups in an election year and endangering recent progress toward a global free-trade pact. They said the community had offered earlier today to negotiate limited restrictions on its exports in exchange for a quiet settlement of the issue, and accused the United States of taking unilateral action in a dispute previously handled through extensive talks among diplomats in Geneva. **********One European official pointed out that the United States also has a swelling trade surplus with the European Community that reached $16.73 billion last year. ""It's strange to attack or retaliate against your best customers,"" said the official, who insisted on anonymity. **********In the past, the mere announcement of American plans to retaliate was enough to restrict imports. When Washington announced its intention earlier this year to impose steep, retroactive duties on imports of Canadian beer, Canadian breweries shut off most of their shipments. **********That case, like others, was resolved without the duties' actually taking effect, and the soybean dispute may still follow the same pattern if the European Community changes its position. **********In the spring, a trade arbitration panel organized by the Geneva-based secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruled against the Europeans. The panel found that the community's soybean subsidies discriminated against imports and effectively raised import barriers that the community had agreed to lower 30 years ago when Europe had a negligible soybean industry. The panel ruled that the Europeans should either change their policies or allow the United States to raise comparable barriers to European exports. **********The European Community insists that it cannot change its soybean policies quickly because farmers planted crops this spring on the assumption that the subsidies would persist. The community made a formal offer this morning in Geneva to negotiate tariffs that the United States might impose as compensation for the soybean barriers. **********But European officials have consistently contended that the loss in foregone American exports does not exceed several hundred million dollars, and does not approach the $1 billion figure threatened by the Administration today.  American soybean exports to Western Europe have also suffered from extra competition as the community has opened its markets to Polish soybeans, partly in response to pressure from the Bush Administration."

N. R. Robinson, as well as many Trinidadians, especially those who had friends and relatives among the 31 dead and 693 wounded, Mr. Abu Bakr's group, the Jamaat al-Muslimeen, was awarded $700,000 in damages. **********Soon afterward, another stated goal of the Muslim uprising was achieved when Mr. Robinson's Government was voted out of office in a regularly scheduled election. ""Things don't always go as planned, but those people are gone now, just as we demanded,"" Mr. Abu Bakr said in an interview. **********If the Government is gone, Mr. Abu Bakr is decidedly back. Despite an injunction, his followers busily rebuild their school, green-spired mosque and office complex, which were largely destroyed by angry soldiers after the coup attempt. **********Even as two police officers came to serve him notice that his mosque had been barred from further construction, a smiling Mr. Abu Bakr told a foreign journalist that he could not be bothered with the futile attempts by the civil authorities to restrict him. **********""Two man rat can't live in the same hole,"" the towering Muslim leader said, spinning patois-laden proverbs as he spoke. ""If they bring us to confrontation, this time it will be a real confrontation. I can promise you that."" **********Seamlessly switching from magnetic charm to glowering menace, the pencil-mustached Imam inveighs against everything from homosexuality to drug trafficking, constantly returning to Islam, a faith for which he says he is an indomitable gladiator. A former soldier and policeman, he converted to Islam during a 10-year stay in Canada that began in the late 1960's. **********As his community has grown from a core of disaffected blacks inspired, like himself, by the black nationalist currents of the 1960's, taking in younger converts, including members of Trinidad's large Indian population, he has sought to redefine himself as the defender of the oppressed. **********With patients dying in hospitals for lack of medicines, he justified the coup as an attempt to reverse the country's grave moral failures. In another variation given in a recent interview, he said the coup was a pre-emptive strike against a Government that was preparing to move against him because of evidence he says he has about high-level involvement in a booming drug trade. **********Many remain worried by what they see as the dangerous rise of a charismatic demagogue in a small and easily destabilized society. With frequent assertions that he is the country's most popular figure, Mr. Abu Bakr has done nothing to dispel the concerns. **********""Abu Bakr has transformed the politics of this country in the sense that most people never thought there could be a coup,"" said Lloyd Best, an editor of The Trinidad and Tobago Review. ""The question is whether he will be able to profit from it. Now that he is being watched by everybody, including the man in the street, he is no longer a novelty and he has lost the element of surprise."""

While Guangdong used to be politically suspect within China for its laissez-faire ways, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders have recently praised it as a national model and called upon the province to become Asia's fifth ""dragon."" The Bribes Help **********That suggests that Guangdong has defeated Beijing, at least for now, in the competition to chart China's future. This could have enormous repercussions, for Guangdong represents a fundamentally different vision of China than Beijing. **********""You can get anything done here,"" said an entrepreneur who found that bribes of $2,000 helped win commercial licenses and official support for his thriving business here in Guangzhou, also called Canton, the provincial capital. The businessman works 16-hour days, rakes in the cash, and has even bought a forged American passport for $20,000. He wants a foreign passport for ease of travel and for protection in case Chinese policy changes, but for now he prefers to remain in Guangzhou. **********""There's more money to be made here,"" he said. **********Guangdong (pronounced gwahng doong) is a symbol of aggressive restructuring, a place where people go to Paula Abdul concerts instead of Marxist study sessions, where entrepreneurs outnumber ideologues, where more people are rich than red. It is China's economic frontier, a magnet that draws the ambitious and restless from all over the country, and it is becoming a more important force than Beijing in shaping the values, fashions, economic understanding and social problems of the entire country. The Underside of Success **********A 25-year-old woman described her elation when she came down to Guangdong from Beijing in January and found a job as a secretary for a factory manager. Her salary was $190 a month, five times her previous wage. **********But there were two problems. She was regularly exhausted by the long hours and heavy workload. And her boss made advances toward her and arranged for her to live in a room that was near to his and that had just a curtain for a door. **********""So I quit,"" the woman said. ""I got my old job back, and my parents ordered me never to leave Beijing again. But the pay and the opportunities were better in the south. Much better! So I'm going to take the job as secretary again. I'll find a way of dealing with the boss. And if worse comes to worst. . . ."" Her voice trailed off and she shrugged. **********Such social problems as sexual harassment, drug addiction and prostitution are more common in Guangdong than in most of the rest of China. But most people now accept that they are the inevitable underside of the economic integration of the province with Hong Kong and its rise as one of the world's major manufacturing bases for products like Mickey Mouse toys, Wendy Walker dolls, Adidas sweat pants, Yashica cameras, Accord watches and a cornucopia of sweaters, brassieres, purses and shoes. **********The economic boom in Guangdong and Hong Kong may be one of the most important transformations under way in Asia. The boom, which is focused on the Pearl River delta towns nearest to Hong Kong, has lasted more than a dozen years and in many ways parallels the rise of the four dragons -- except that Guangdong's population of 68 million is about equal to that of all four dragons combined. **********The Tiananmen crackdown and nationwide economic slowdown in 1989 caused a pause in the typical double-digit growth rates, but by last year Guangdong had rebounded: in 1991, the equivalent of gross national product jumped 13.5 percent, and industrial output soared 27.2 percent. **********For someone arriving from northern China, the towns around here feel like the free world. Guangdong still has political prisoners -- including Wang Xizhe, a thoughtful democrat and essayist who is serving a 14-year sentence in solitary confinement -- but many fewer than Beijing. There is also less surveillance here, less intimidation, less political indoctrination, and less of a state sector. **********In Guangdong Province, 38 percent of industrial production comes from private or foreign-financed businesses, while only about 35 percent is manufactured by the state sector. The remainder is produced by collective enterprises, which are often owned by the local townships. **********Even the state-owned companies, because they must operate in a market environment, are far more competitive than state-run companies elsewhere in China. Bei Zhaohan, the chairman of the Baiyunshan Group Corporation, a state-owned conglomerate based in Guangzhou, seems not so different from Western business tycoons. The Lure of Property **********""We want to get into property development,"" said Mr. Bei, a dynamic 52-year-old man with a well-tailored suit and boardroom manners, ""because I see that the richest people everywhere -- in the U.S., in Japan, in Hong Kong -- are all property magnates."" **********Guangdong's township enterprises are even more freewheeling, and many do without any Communist Party secretary. One prosperous township brimming with such companies is Houjie, a frenetic community about half-way between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. **********Houjie has an official population of 75,000, mostly peasants who used to wade through the surrounding rice paddies, but it also is a temporary home to more than 80,000 migrant laborers who work on assembly lines in the township's 900 factories. **********""There was nothing to do at home,"" Yan Jimei, a 20-year-old woman with long, neatly combed hair, said of her village in nearby Guangxi Province. ""So I came here to look for a job. Life's much better here."" **********In a slightly squalid dormitory room in which 12 young women bunk together, 16-year-old Wang Zhiyin recalled that a year ago she was living quietly in the Sichuan Province countryside. Then several women returned to her village from their jobs in Guangdong and told of the wages they were making. A few days later, Miss Wang accompanied them back to Houjie and found an assembly line job making pink stuffed turtles for $50 a month. **********American labor organizations have charged that Guangdong factories are inhuman sweatshops that frequently employ children. While some teen-agers do work in the factories, most are in their late teens and their dormitory living conditions are often better than those they left behind in their villages. **********Wages are low by American standards, but extravagant by Chinese terms: $50 to $60 a month, more than some university professors earn. Almost all of the workers are women, who are regarded by factory managers as more responsible and adroit with their hands then men, and they typically work six days a week for up to about 10 hours a day. The women say this is far preferable to sloshing around the rice paddies. **********The Communist Party Secretary in Houjie, a short, exuberant man named Fang Shuhui, is enormously proud of the town's progress and points out the sights -- the gleaming new movie theater, the mansionlike public toilet -- as he cruises around Houjie in the back seat of his chauffeur-driven gray Mercedes Benz 300 SEL. The car is nicer than those assigned to Cabinet ministers in Beijing, and Mr. Fang also has a cellular telephone, a beeper and other paraphernalia of a tycoon. **********Communist Party bosses like Mr. Fang have nurtured a quasi-market economy, with 85 percent to 90 percent of prices in Guangdong determined by supply and demand, but the province is still a planned economy in one very useful way: the Government has devoted enormous resources to building bridges, roads, electricity plants and the like. The result is that some analysts believe that growth in Guangdong may be more sustainable than in places like Bangkok, where the economic boom of recent years has strained the infrastructure and led to constant traffic jams. The News From Hong Kong **********The opening up of Guangdong has created some risks for the local Communist leaders, however. News from Hong Kong, where newspapers and television report constantly and unflatteringly about the Chinese leadership, filters across the border more and more easily. **********In the city of Dongguan, the local government even operates a cable television service for $7 a year, offering Hong Kong channels. **********A major lesson of the south -- and one that Deng Xiaoping appears to have drawn, encouraging him to make Guangdong a national model -- is that the strategy of the moderates in Guangzhou appears to have been far more successful than that of the hard-liners in the north. The Communist Party seems much more likely to be toppled in Beijing than in Guangdong, and it was striking that during the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989 the protests were far milder in southern cities than in the north. **********As in Singapore and Taiwan, the ruling party here in southern China has won a measure of popular support simply by raising living standards. **********""Folks complain here, too, but the volume is much lower than in Beijing,"" said a woman who abandoned a promising career in one of the most prestigious ministries in the central Government to come to Guangzhou to do business. **********The willingness of such intellectuals to come to Guangdong to work, joining the uneducated peasants who hold assembly line jobs, reflects the rising status of Guangdong around the country. Increasingly, it is seen as China's economic frontier. **********""There are more opportunities here,"" said Zhang Yanan, a 31-year-old university graduate from the central Chinese city of Wuhan who has just found work in a township. ""Maybe there's not so much culture, but there's more money -- and with money, you can do a lot of things."""

Earlier this year, for example, he traveled to the Swiss town of Zug, where he slipped inside a 9-foot puppet of the fugitive financier Marc Rich and allowed himself to be berated for the sins of capitalism by a 12-foot puppet of Mother Jones, the 19th-century labor hellraiser. **********The performance, in front of the headquarters of Mr. Rich's commodities empire, naturally drew a crowd, including television crews that beamed the story throughout Europe and back to the States. Thus did street theater become part of the route by which the United Steelworkers of America brought to heel the Ravenswood Aluminum Company of Ravenswood, West Va., a company which Mr. Rich is thought to control. **********For the first time in a long while, the trade union movement has major victories to celebrate at its solidarity picnics tomorrow. True, it is the the year of Caterpillar, the ascendancy of genteel euphemisms like ""replacement workers"" and ""recessing"" a strike and ritual intonations of labor's declining numbers. **********But the decision of the United Automobile Workers to take on General Motors at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant, labor experts say, is making General Motors squirm now and in anticipation of contract talks next year. The strike, which is likely to be settled this weekend, emphatically has not had the kamikaze quality of some other recent union actions. **********Then there is Ravenswood, which, if nasty, brutish and protracted, nevertheless suggests that labor may finally have found a more sophisticated parry to the thrusts of capital. ""In the trade union movement, we've become very predictable,"" said Mr. Uehlein, the director of special projects for the industrial union department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington. ""We have to do less predictable things,"" he continued. ""We can't continue to play by old rules."" **********At Ravenswood, the steelworkers effectively pulled a three-strand noose around the neck of management. With solid support from a disciplined local, they coordinated a legal battle at the National Labor Relations Board, a boycott that slowed demand for Ravenswood aluminum and a public relations campaign that raised the profile of the elusive Mr. Rich, who has been on the run since 1983 when he was indicted in the United States on tax evasion and fraud charges. **********""The union had lost when it began,"" said Jack Metzgar, a labor scholar at Roosevelt University in Chicago, referring to events on Halloween night, 1990, when, after contract negotiations involving wage, benefit and safety issues broke down, the Ravenswood strike began. ""People were already replaced. Workers were out of work. The company was producing with the replacement workers. It is amazing that they were able to reverse a situation so far gone."" **********RAVENSWOOD made what may have been its greatest mistake early on: it hired replacements, mostly from out of town, for its 1,700 locked-out unionized workers. That helped coalesce the opposition in the small, homogeneous town. ""They came in and stole our jobs while we were out fighting for them,"" said Dan Stidham, president of the Ravenswood local. At Caterpillar earlier this year, the picket line was a semipermeable membrane. In Ravenswood, only 17 of the 1,700 union members agreed to cross the line. **********Solidarity at the grass roots allowed the pursuit of other tactics. Mr. Uehlein was asked three months after the lockout began to see if a corporate campaign -- a nontraditional form of pressure -- was feasible against Ravenswood. **********The corporate campaign is not a universally beloved tactic, especially since one such effort drove a spike between a local meat processors' union in Austin, Minn., and its national organization. But Mr. Uehlein, who was called in by George Becker, vice president of the Pittsburgh-based steelworkers, managed early on to uncover a loan agreement in documents at a local courthouse that eventually suggested ties to Marc Rich, and with it, potential leverage. **********Mr. Uehlein began reaching out to unions in eastern and western Europe, searching for information on Mr. Rich's activities. Once the connection seemed confirmed -- the Rich organization never acknowledged involvement in the Ravenswood plant, but a Rich lieutenant was a prominent shareholder -- Mr. Uehlein formulated ""zaps"" of the sort that led him to the plaza of Rich headquarters in puppet mufti. **********He traveled abroad several times looking for opportunities to embarrass Mr. Rich. A ""wanted"" poster with the union's interpretation of Mr. Rich's misdeeds was distributed throughout Europe. The puppet theater drew attention wherever it went. Eventually, Mr. Uehlein hired a European coordinator to keep the pressure on. **********It took 19 months, with the steelworkers footing the cost of both the strike and Mr. Uehlein's campaign. But last spring the company capitulated and made peace with the union. In June the replacement force departed to make way for returning workers. **********The Ravenswood victory is not without its cautionary footnotes. Mr. Stidham said there is lingering bitterness between union members and salaried workers, some of whom helped relatives get jobs as replacement workers. A strike that drags on is almost inevitably ugly, said Carrie Leana, an organizational studies professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has done research on unions. ""The union won in the end, but a long struggle is not a desirable thing,"" she said. **********But Ravenswood, she said, should serve as a warning to companies that the use of replacement workers, which companies tend to see as a major and legitimate power play, may be a high-stakes gamble. ""It turned a dispute over working conditions into a life-or-death struggle,"" she said. **********The campaign also helped Mr. Uehlein establish ties with unions abroad, all of which were amazed, he said, that American companies may replace striking workers. Those ties may help American labor in its next great challenge: chasing capital across international boundaries."

Thus they have been forced to remain largely on the sidelines as companies from France, Britain, Canada, Spain and elsewhere seized upon opportunities opened up by recent reforms in the island's policies governing private investment. Yet foreign subsidiaries of United States companies have started to take advantage of a little-heralded 1975 amendment to the American embargo that allows them to trade nonstrategic goods with Cuba. **********Cut off from its traditional lifeline to the defunct Soviet Union, Cuba is scurrying to replace subsidized supplies of everything from industrial spare parts and oil to flour for making bread. It is feeding the effort by setting up attractive new investment regulations that permit the repatriation of profits, majority foreign ownership in some instances and control over management decisions like hiring and firing that were once the sacrosanct domain of the Government. **********Cuba, locked into a sterile brand of central planning for the last three decades, barely tips the scales in the economic life of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is a Communist oddity in an increasingly free-market world. ""If Cuba were to somehow sink tomorrow and disappear from the map, it would hardly make a ripple in the hemisphere's economy,"" a World Bank official said recently. ""It would just not be felt."" **********But many companies have begun to prospect the island's markets, convinced that Cuba's bid to survive will ultimately lead it to convert to a capitalist economy, even if it is not acknowledged in name. If the Government should suddenly pull back on its reforms, many say, economic collapse will follow, eventually leading to the same result. **********""There is growing anticipation among my clients, rightly or wrongly, that a political change in Cuba will happen sooner rather than later,"" said Sally Shelton, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Caribbean affairs in the Carter Administration who now works as a Washington-based consultant for several multinationals. ""The feeling is that Cuba cannot remain unchanged forever, and quite apart from politics, Castro's need for hard currency will drive him to liberalize further and make foreign investment even more attractive."" **********While the debate is played out among Cuban policy makers over how quickly to pursue reforms and how to prevent the budding liberalization from ending the Communist Party's vise-like grip on almost every aspect of Cuban life, foreign companies are grabbing up rights to a growing variety of business ventures. **********Recent investments run from the Spanish hotel company Grupo Sol's conquest of undeveloped tourism sites that are the envy of the Caribbean to a contract with Canada's Sherritt Gordon to rehabilitate some of the world's richest nickel mines. Sherritt Gordon failed to return repeated telephone calls about the size of its contract, but it is believed to be worth about $1.2 billion. **********In a bid to relieve a crushing energy shortage that has brought back horse-drawn carriages and oxen-powered plows, the French oil company Total-Compagnie Francaise des Petroles was recently awarded a six-year contract to explore and develop offshore fields, which though still unproven, are widely believed to hold important reserves. **********Shell, British Petroleum, the Swedish firm Taurus Petroleum and the Brazilian company Braspetro, drawn by the same prospect, have become active in Cuban oil exploration. **********Although American companies remain excluded from Cuba by the embargo, the have been tantalized by thesight of foreign firms reaching potentially lucrative deals just 90 miles off South Florida's shores. Yet few of them, largely out of fear of confrontations with Cuban-American groups opposed to trade with the Government, are willing to speak openly about their involvement. **********""I think a lot of them are really frightened about the legal complications of angering Washington,"" said Christopher Barton, assistant director of the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia. **********""I don't think we should lift the embargo, but people who say they do are always getting death threats,"" said one business consultant on Latin America who refused to be named. **********Foreign subsidiaries of United States companies are active in everything from fertilizer and elevator parts to raw sugar and tobacco. Their commerce more than doubled between 1988 and 1990, according to a recently published Johns Hopkins University study of Cuban-American trade relations. In 1990, the last year for which complete data are available, that trade reached $705 million. **********The growing list of parent companies whose subsidiaries are involved now reads like a Who's Who of the American corporate world, including such names as Dow Chemical, Du Pont, Ford, General Electric, I.B.M. and Union Carbide. Treasury Department documents indicate that the vast majority of these subsidiaries are registered in Switzerland, with England a distant second. One company, Otis Elevator, is rehabilitating equipment in old buildings and installing new elevators through its Mexican subsidiary. **********""Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the potential for U.S. trade has increased dramatically, and we have seen that in the subsidiary trade,"" said Donna Rich-Kaplowitz, an author of the Hopkins study. ""We believe that we could see between $1.2 billion and $2 billion in trade the first year after the embargo is lifted and some analysts think that figure could rise to $6 billion fairly quickly."" **********One indication of the mounting American interest in Cuba is that an 84-page booklet called ""Developing Business Strategies for Cuba,"" published by the New York-based publishing and consulting firm, Business International, ""sold as well as any research document we have put out on Latin America, including much larger countries like Mexico,"" said Santiago Fittipaldi, the company's assistant editor for Latin America. **********Subscriptions for the London-based bi-monthly newsletter, Cuba Business, have increased so handsomely in the United States in the last year that the publisher, Gareth Jenkins, plans to introduce an American monthly edition next month. **********In June, another British publication, Euromoney, will hold a two-day conference on Cuba for American companies in Cancun, Mexico. The conference includes a one-day excursion to Havana, made legal despite Treasury Department restrictions on Americans spending money in an ""enemy"" country, because all expenses for the side trip will be paid by the Cuban Government. **********For all of these signs of burgeoning corporate interest, however, experts in Cuban affairs say there is little chance that the United States embargo will be lifted. While allowing American subsidiaries to trade with Cuba, the United States quietly, but actively, discourages even foreign-owned companies from providing strategic goods to Cuba or resuscitating vital industries. **********Last year, diplomatic pressure of this kind was widely believed to have scotched a pact by the Brazilian airline, Vasp, to acquire a major share in the Cuban carrier Cubana, which is badly in need of investments to replace its antiquated Soviet fleet. Executives at Vasp have declined to provide details of why the deal was suddenly canceled. **********The Castro Government's harshest foes in this country are seeking to get the Bush Administration to take an even harder line on Cuba in a bill that is now before Congress. **********Opponents of further tightening of the embargo, both here and abroad, see Cuba as a Communist dead end, a country in which economic realities are already working inexorably to bring about a dramatic transformation. **********But until that transformation comes, many American companies say, there is little that they can do but watch. **********""Like any big company in the United States, we are keeping an eye on the situation there,"" said George Jamison, a spokesman for General Electric. ""As soon as things change, we will be taking a hard look at the opportunities there."" AN ANTI-CASTRO CONGRESSMAN NAMED TORRICELLI **********Even as international business involvement in Cuba grows, offering what some say is perhaps the island's only chance for peaceful change, President Fidel Castro's most determined foes are moving in this country to hasten the collapse of the 64-year-old dictator's Government. **********In the forefront of these efforts lately has been an unlikely champion of a hard-line approach, Representative Robert Torricelli, a 40-year-old New Jersey Democrat who identifies himself politically as a liberal. **********Representative Torricelli is the principal author of legislation that would penalize foreign-based subsidiaries of American corporations for trade with Cuba and at the same time seek to discourage American allies from doing business with the island by banning ships that dock in Cuban harbors from this country's ports for six months. **********""It has been one of Washington's fondest hopes to separate Castro from $4 billion in Soviet assistance each year,"" Mr. Torricelli said. ""Now that that is being accomplished, the assistance is being replaced with the profits of American corporations and that is intolerable."" **********President Bush, who has enjoyed support from conservative Cuban-American groups which strongly endorse the proposed legislation, has nonetheless vetoed past attempts to ban subsidiary trade. In doing so, he has cited concerns about the principle of free trade and potential impact on trading partners. **********Administration officials have expressed concern that other elements of the Torricelli bill, which may reach a vote next month, also would unnecessarily damage relations with important trading partners. Other critics of the bill say it is a dangerous example of overkill. ""Cuba is in a desperate state and change is just around the corner,"" said Merilyn K. Potter, head of the Latin America section of the London Chamber of Commerce, which organizes frequent visits to the island for British businesses. ""There is no need for heinous laws that will only encourage violent disorder."" **********Representative Torricelli said that the first time he had heard of Cuba he was ""hiding my head under a desk in the sixth grade during the missile crisis"" of 1962. He called it unlikely that Cuba could change peacefully, and said it was ""hopelessly naive to believe that any amount of commerce with Cuba would lead to reform by a leader who is as recalcitrant as Castro."""

But despite its country's smallness, KLM has been able to become the world's eighth-largest carrier. It serves 157 cities in 6 continents, connecting the Netherlands with the rest of the world with a fleet of Boeing 747's much like the great Dutch trading ships did in the past. **********The airline has also been able to adjust well to the greater competition of deregulation. It has brought down costs and has been able to show profits even in some tough years. **********Then why is this proud airline seeking to strengthen ties with Northwest Airlines? It formed an initial alliance in 1989 when it bought a 20 percent stake in Northwest for $400 million. Now its executives are sitting down with their Northwest counterparts to try to create an interconnected worldwide route system. **********With such a service, a passenger could fly from the West Coast via Northwest to New York, for example, and continue to Amsterdam on KLM with one ticket and with all boarding passes in hand. The goal is to create service so seamless that customers could not discern that they had been traveling on two different carriers. **********The proposal to, in effect, operate in most cases as one airline must still be approved by the Transportation Department, which has said it will look on the combination with favor. **********KLM would remain essentially independent and so would Northwest; KLM's stock would continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, and Northwest would remain privately owned. Still, the Dutch carrier is expected to lose some of its identity. **********So why is KLM pursuing the combination? There is wide agreement that KLM had little choice but to ally itself with a larger airline. The European Community has decided to bring down most barriers to aviation in the next four years, which will allow powerful larger carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France to quickly expand across Europe. **********KLM, too, would have an opportunity to build a larger European system, but it does not have the resources to buy additional aircraft or pay the considerable costs required to open new markets. And with the growing alliances between foreign and American carriers, KLM faces growing difficulty in filling its flights to the United States. **********""Each carrier has to insure that they have route-network distributions in regions where they can't get the bilateral rights to fly,"" Paul Karos, an airline analyst for First Boston, said. **********He said that although the Amsterdam hub had been successful until now because of its international traffic, most hubs that remained viable were those with considerable domestic traffic, something the Netherlands could not provide. **********""It has to protect itself long term,"" he added. ""KLM could not sit back and hope that it would remain competitive. It had to take some action."" **********KLM and Northwest have a unique freedom to meld, since the United States and the Netherlands recently signed one of the most liberal bilateral aviation treaties in history. **********Both carriers can fly anywhere in each other's countries with as many planes and as frequently as they want. They can also fly to foreign points from the United States and the Netherlands if they can get other countries to agree. **********Both countries have agreed to allow sharing of computerized flight information to all destinations, meaning KLM flights will appear promptly on the computer screens of travel agents checking airline schedules. **********""KLM has the right to code-sharing on every city in the United States,"" Mr. Karos added. ""That's important."""

Your Huddled Masses? No. This Door Is Closed."," **********Ellen Jeko was heading across the border into Austria five months ago when Hungarian border guards caught her and brought her to the desolate camp in this village outside Budapest. **********Unlike the refugee camp where the 26-year-old Liberian hoped to find Austrian asylum, this camp offers most residents only one way out of the fenced compound: a ticket home. **********""But I'm afraid to go back,"" she tearfully told a group of Hungarian legislators visiting the camp at Kerepestarcsa (pronounced KEH-reh-pesh-tuhr-chuh). Her husband, Samson, stood protectively at her side, shielding her from other refugees desperate to tell their tales and the guards who stood nearby.Fear of Being Overwhelmed **********The 130 refugees besieging the rare visitors were only a fraction of the close to 10,000 who have come through this camp on their way home, and the estimated 50,000 illegal aliens who have gathered in Hungary in recent months, stalled in their westward odyssey toward a better life. **********These migrants, who have tried to enter Western Europe through Hungary's Austrian border, have found only a closed door. **********After Hungary's Communist Government took down the Iron Curtain on the Austrian border in 1989, making travel between the two countries easier than it had been in decades, the Austrian Government put intensive police and army patrols in place to re-seal the frontier. **********Now Hungary, too, fears being overwhelmed by a mass of immigrants, most of them poor. The country has tightened control over its borders, conducting periodic campaigns to deport illegal aliens, and making work and residence permits harder for foreigners to obtain. **********The police have cited economic pressures, security concerns and rising crime to justify the restrictions. But they also rely on a simpler, more chilling rationale: the presence of foreigners causes tension. **********""It is worthwhile thinking about which cultures to accept in as small a country as Hungary,"" an Interior Ministry official, Karoly Nagy, told a weekly early this year. ""We might avoid xenophobia by not repeating West European countries' earlier mistakes. They once kept the gates open wide before immigrants. Now, clearly, they are prisoners of the situation they created.""They Come From Romania **********Border guards have turned back almost half a million foreigners seeking to enter Hungary legally since early October, for lack of either travel documents or enough money to pay for their stay. **********In the first two months of this year, they caught nearly 4,000 illegal entrants from 59 countries trying to sneak across the border. Most were coming from Romania, where thousands of Africans and Asians, as well as Romanians, are reportedly waiting to try to get into Hungary. **********Many still evade the guards, stealing across fields on moonless nights, or crouching among piles of goods in freight trucks. So, further inland, the Hungarian police go to flea markets, railway stations and underpasses, checking identity documents of people with the dark skin, poor dress or bulging shopping bags. **********[Growing frustration among the camp's residents has occasionally burst into vandalism and violence. Some refugees have escaped. Most recently, on April 25, detainees reportedly broke furniture and threw objects at camp guards to protest conditions there.] **********The signs of Hungarian unease over the country's foreign population have grown. An incident in early January in which a Nigerian stabbed a Hungarian teen-ager to death in a fight touched off an alarmed reaction in the press. **********In the next two weeks, gangs of skinheads attacked 25 foreign students. And the Asians and Africans? **********Hungary has stressed its compassion for some asylum-seekers, taking in ethnic Hungarians fleeing Romania beginning in the late 1980's, and Yugoslavs fleeing the civil war. **********About 102,000 foreigners, including 70,000 ethnic Hungarians from neighboring countries, were registered as refugees or recipients of temporary haven last year. **********But when Hungary ratified the United Nations Convention on Refugees in March 1989 and acceded to the United Nations protocol to grant asylum to refugees fleeing political or religious persecution in their homelands, it obligated itself to consider only asylum-seekers of European extraction. The country now faces pressure to extend this commitment to Asians and Africans. **********By law, foreigners who endanger public safety or the state's interests can have their permission to remain in Hungary withdrawn. If found, they must leave the country within 48 hours. **********Legally, they can be held for up to six days, but in practice the detentions stretch to months. Since systematic roundups of foreigners began in October 1990, 35,000 illegal immigrants have been sent home.The Stench of History **********Some Hungarians, especially members of the liberal opposition, have criticized the Kerepestarcsa camp, which served as a collection station for Jews being deported to Nazi death camps, and later as an internment center for opponents of the Communist Government. **********The Hungarian authorities say they will make the voluntary return of the camp residents easier to accomplish. But having come so close to their goal, the West, almost none want to go home. **********Galib Ahmed, a 33-year-old Iraqi Kurd who was brought to the camp several months ago after being detained at the Budapest airport on his way to Denmark, refused to go home. **********""I'm still waiting to hear from the United Nations,"" he said hopefully."

Agent in Sweden,U.S. Suffers Setback on Ex-C.I.A. Agent in Sweden," **********Swedish security authorities, who last week arrested the only C.I.A. officer ever to defect to the Soviet Union, took a step today that could undermine American efforts to return him for trial on espionage charges in the United States. **********In an announcement, Swedish officials said the security police had dropped an inquiry into whether Edward Lee Howard, who eluded Federal agents and fled to Moscow in 1985, engaged in espionage in Sweden, where he has lived since last fall. Mr. Howard remains in jail in Sweden on a visa violation. **********Without the espionage charges it will be more difficult for Swedish officials to expel Mr. Howard, who is wanted in the United States on charges that he compromised American intelligence operations in the former Soviet Union. **********Intelligence officials said that Mr. Howard caused irreparable harm by selling the Soviets the secrets of the C.I.A.'s Moscow station, including the identities of its Soviet agents, at least one of whom was reportedly executed on the basis of the information. He has denied that he worked for the K.G.B. or had caused the death of any Soviet agent. **********Jan-Henrik Norden, Mr. Howard's Swedish lawyer, said in a telephone interview today from Stockholm that the move was a victory that came after a lengthy day-and-night interrogation.  He has said Mr. Howard has been operating in Sweden as a private business consultant, helping Scandinavian companies find investment opportunities in the former Soviet Union. **********The Swedish action also appears to increase the likelihood that Mr. Howard will be permitted to remain in that country or move to a country of his choosing, possibly Russia, where he would be beyond the reach of the United States. **********His travels began when he fled from his home in New Mexico in 1985, two years after he was forced to resign from the C.I.A. after he failed a polygraph examination. In 1986, he was granted political asylum in the Soviet Union. **********The move to Sweden came after several years spent in Moscow with the support of the K.G.B. and in former Soviet bloc countries. **********In the past he has granted interviews in which he professed his patriotism and suggested the charges against him were unfounded. **********After his escape, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board criticized the C.I.A. for its hiring, screening and dismissal of Mr. Howard and the F.B.I. for allowing him to elude agents while he was under 24-hour surveillance. **********That criticism, along with the widespread perception that Mr. Howard betrayed the agency's principles of loyalty, left a bitter residue of rancor among intelligence and law enforcement officials that has contributed to a powerful desire to force Mr. Howard's return to stand trial. **********But the effort to bring him back to the United States is complicated because Mr. Howard cannot legally be extradited for espionage, an offense that is not covered by the bilateral treaty between the United States and Sweden. **********Mr. Howard has said in a recent interview with the Swedish newspaper, Expressen, that he was contacted by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whom he accused of intimidating him with threats of forcing his expulsion from Sweden."

Just don't quiz them on arithmetic. **********That lesson was learned this week -- bitterly -- by investors in Buffets Inc., a developer and operator of an all-you-can-eat restaurant chain based in Eden Prairie, Minn. **********On Tuesday, the company held a conference call with secruities analysts to trumpet record earnings and a big jump of about 11 percent in quarterly sales at stores open a year or more. **********Investors flocked to the stock on the news, and short-sellers, who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock's price will fall, scurried for shelter, snapping up their own shares to cover their positions. The shares jumped as much as $4.50 on Tuesday, before closing with a gain of $2.75, to $29, in over-the-counter trading. **********Investors were excited by the idea that Buffet was able to get that kind of sales surge at its older restaurants. It seemed almost guaranteed to enjoy strong growth as it expanded. **********Well, not so fast. On Wednesday, red-faced Buffet executives made a second announcement. It seems there was a mathematical error in the original calculations: rather than jumping 11 percent from the previous quarter, same-store sales actually drifted sideways, rising an almost invisible three-tenths of 1 percent. **********Suffice it to say, investors were not happy. They rapidly unloaded shares, and by yesterday the stock had given up almost all of its gains from earlier in the week, closing at $26.375, or 12.5 cents above where it stood before the troubles began. **********For their part, company officials said any worried investor should give them a call for a chat.  ""This is the first time, for lack of better terminology, we made this kind of error,"" said Clark Grant, vice president of finance at Buffets. ""There's not a lot to add to it.

The increasing concerns about the treaty negotiated last year at the Dutch town of Maastricht also left businesses uncertain about how to plan for the future. **********The erosion in public support for the plan added to already heightened fears in the markets that interest rates would have to rise in Britain, Italy and perhaps France. The Bank of England intervened in foreign currency markets today for the first time since the value of the German mark began surging last week. **********The intervention helped to stabilize the pound at 2.794 marks at the close of trading in London. That is just above the level at which the British Government would be obligated to raise interest rates under the European exchange-rate mechanism, which commits nations to keeping their currency values within a specified range. Stocks and Bonds Steadier **********After three days of sharp losses, stock and bond markets across Europe steadied somewhat, although traders said the mood remained extremely jittery. **********In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed four points higher, at 2,285, after hitting its low since the Persian Gulf war on Tuesday. Markets in Paris and Frankfurt also eked out tiny gains. But analysts said there was little hope for any real rebound in prices or investor confidence soon and that both financial markets and companies would be hostage for the next month to fears that France will reject European unification when the treaty is put to a referendum on Sept. 20. **********One day after four polls in France showed a clear erosion in public support, another poll released today, conducted for Le Point magazine, said 52 percent of those who had made up their minds would vote to reject the treaty, the highest percentage so far in favor of a no vote. **********Should France reject the treaty, it would almost certainly doom, at least for now, efforts to create a single currency and to continue to unify the economies and governments of the 12 European Community nations. Doubts in Several Nations **********Doubts about unification have become apparent for several months in other nations as well, including Germany, where some officials have expressed second thoughts about giving up the mark in favor of the single European currency envisioned by the treaty, which was agreed to by the leaders of the 12 European Community nations in Maastricht last year. In Denmark, which shocked Europe by narrowly rejecting the treaty in a referendum in June, recent polls have shown that sentiment against the Maastricht agreement is growing even stronger. **********Analysts said the uncertainty was another blow to Europe's recession-shaken business community, which because of the increasing questions about monetary policy and the pace of European integration is starting to encounter difficulty in making decisions about financing and long-term investment. **********""It's quite negative for growth in general and for the financial markets in particular,"" said Jean-Francois Mercier, an economist at Salomon Brothers International in London. ""Not only is it putting pressure on the currencies, but fears of an interest-rate rise at a time when real interest rates are already high could only affect corporate financial planning, undermine business confidence and perhaps affect planning on hiring and investment."" Plans Are Put on Hold **********Immediately after voters in Denmark rejected the treaty, some of Denmark's largest companies delayed or canceled plans for expansion, citing uncertainties about the course and pace of European unification and their nation's role in it. The Lego Group, for example, postponed a decision to build a factory and a training center. **********Analysts said that a rejection of the treaty next month in France could force a similar reassessment by companies throughout Europe, and that until the French vote and its ramifications became clear most businesses were likely to delay making important strategic decisions. **********The death of the Maastricht Treaty would not undo the significant progress toward a unified European market already accomplished in recent years, including the end of most trade barriers by the end of this year. **********But by slowing or stopping the push for a single currency and a centralized monetary policy, it could accelerate the flight to the mark, now seen as the world's most stable currency. At the same time, it could force governments of some key countries, including Britain, Italy and France, to make difficult choices between maintaining the value of their currency against the mark -- a step that would most likely involve raising interest rates -- or devaluing their currencies, a step that would be politically less painful but that could lead to higher inflation in the long run. **********The leading European governments are pledged to maintaining the stability of their currencies relative to the mark, even if that means raising interest rates. Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, said today that the nation would not consider devaluing the pound or leaving the European exchange-rate mechanism. But many analysts think there would be pressure to devalue the British, Italian and perhaps French currencies, or to abandon the exchange-rate agreement altogether, should France reject the Maastricht Treaty."

Starting this morning, for instance, WJBK of Detroit is dropping the ""CBS This Morning"" news program. **********The network also faces increasing problems with its late-night shows and could also be threatened in parts of prime time. **********Since CBS announced earlier this year that it would reduce the payments that the affiliates receive for carrying network programs, its local affiliates have been balking -- the strongest signal yet that the historical relationship for program distribution is breaking down. **********Both ABC and NBC are watching the developments at CBS closely as they negotiate their own compensation plans with their affiliates. **********WJBK, which is replacing ""CBS This Morning"" with a two-hour local newscast, is the second big CBS affiliate to decide to drop the morning program this summer (the other is WAGA in Atlanta). This means that ""CBS This Morning"" is at an increasing competitive disadvantage in the national ratings with NBC's ""Today"" and ABC's ""Good Morning, America."" And other CBS stations are said to be considering similar moves. **********The threat to ""CBS This Morning"" comes at a time when the program has begun to demonstrate some improvement in the national ratings. But that growth will be impossible to maintain if many more large CBS stations abandon the program. **********Moreover, ""CBS This Morning"" is vulnerable because it is still No. 3 in the national ratings, while ""Good Morning, America"" and ""Today"" are competitive for the top spot. **********CBS will try to stem the defections from ""CBS This Morning"" by announcing a plan to give stations much more time for local newscasts within the program. That announcement is expected this week. But CBS executives say they will never allow stations to broadcast only portions of the program, such as the last hour. **********Last week, CBS executives met with representatives of the network affiliate board to seek a compromise that would ease tensions between the network and the stations. Those tensions flared after CBS announced in June that it planned to cut about $25 million from the money paid to stations for carrying CBS programs. **********Anthony C. Malara, president of affiliate relations for CBS, said the network would soon make a formal presentation to its affiliates to try to forestall retaliatory pre-emptions tied to the decision to cut the network compensation payments. **********""The bottom line is we will still be paying at least $100 million to the stations,"" he said. ""The ultimate risk is that people are perfectly willing to see the institution of the network go down the drain."" **********In making the announcement of the compensation cuts, CBS contended that the network, which lost money last year, needed to restructure what it considered an antiquated system that paid stations for carrying its programs as well as giving them advertising time to sell in those programs. The stations reacted angrily, threatening to pre-empt CBS programs to make up for the lost revenue. Competitive Reasons **********Still, Steve Antoniotti, the general manager of WJBK in Detroit, said he decided to drop ""CBS This Morning"" for competitive reasons and not out of pique over reduced compensation. **********He added, however, ""The concept of a network programming for everyone at one time doesn't work as often as it did in the past, especially in fringe dayparts."" **********Morning is a fringe daypart, and so is late night, and CBS executives are already expressing concern that affiliate defections may make it more difficult for the network to put together an offer that would win David Letterman away from NBC. CBS has made no secret of its intention to woo the late-night star aggressively. **********The threat against the network even extends to prime time. Several CBS affiliates, disgruntled about the plan to cut compensation payments, have bought a pair of hourlong dramas to be produced by Paramount, ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""The Untouchables."" They have made clear they intend to use these shows in place of CBS's prime-time programs if the network does not rescind its compensation cuts. If they did make the replacements, CBS's lower-rated shows, including several new shows like ""Raven"" and ""Angel Street"" on Saturday night, would be most vulnerable. Looking for More Revenue **********Though neither NBC nor ABC is overtly at odds with its affiliates, both networks have stations that are pre-empting prime-time programs for syndicated shows in order to take in more revenue. Generally, a station makes much more money from a syndicated show because it can sell about half the commercial time on it, as opposed to only about 10 percent of the commercials on a network show. **********In the early days of television, the network and affiliates were essentially partners with shared interests. But most stations in those days were owned by individuals. Now a vast majority of stations are owned by broadcasting groups, most of which own stations affiliated with two or even three networks. Thus, CBS executives say, the station owners have no real reason to consider one network's interests as vital to their own. **********For example, both WJBK in Detroit and WAGA in Atlanta are owned by Gillett Holdings Inc., which also owns several stations affiliated with NBC. **********In addition, CBS, NBC and ABC no longer completely dominate television. The three networks now face tough competition from Fox Broadcasting, independent stations that broadcast high-quality syndicated programming and the growing proliferation of cable channels. **********As such, a senior executive for a broadcasting group said: ""Everybody knows the business is cyclical. There's no point in aligning yourself with just one network."" Self-Inflicted Wounds **********This executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said CBS's problems with its affiliates were largely self-inflicted, both because of the manner in which the network said it would impose the compensation cuts and the network's own strategic decision to make CBS strictly a broadcasting business. **********Both ABC and NBC have invested in other television businesses, including cable channels. ""CBS has limited themselves by not diversifying,"" the executive said. ""If the ABC network is having a tough year, some good returns at ESPN may help mitigate that. CBS can only look to save $25 million by asking their stations to accept compensation cuts."" **********In addition, the executive said CBS's rationale for the cuts -- its huge losses last year -- is losing impact in light of the network's growing strength. ""The stock price is up,"" he said. ""Analysts are recommending the stock. CBS is starting to look like it's in a lot better shape financially than a lot of the station groups that went heavily into debt to buy stations in the 1980's."""

But businesses can send only small data bursts like a sales order or a repair estimate over special radio lines. By sending much longer messages over the more widely available cellular network, the International Business Machines Corporation and the nine telephone carriers hope to expand the market sharply, from fewer than 100,000 customers today to more than 13 million by the year 2000. **********The companies have signed up Sears, Roebuck and Company as their first trial customer.

Mr. Callahan said transfers of cellular data ""will have to overcome a lot of negative perceptions out there for cellular calls."" **********The nine phone companies provide service in more than 95 percent of the country and are in all the main urban markets, where such services are likely to be in demand.

Of the Bell operating companies, only BellSouth is not part of the consortium. **********I.B.M., the world's largest computer maker, is contributing software and hardware that allows cellular operators to modernize the existing $9 billion network with a relatively modest investment of perhaps several hundred million dollars. The techniques use the current analog network but with a digital information stream. The I.B.M. techniques, known as Celluplan II, take advantage of idle air time to intersperse data amid voice conversations. **********At 19,200 bits of information a second, the consortium's service would be twice as fast as the fastest office fax machines today. But it would still take nearly six hours to send the equivalent of ""Moby Dick."" **********The consortium's service is likely to be expensive. The companies said the service would be ""competitive"" with current data-only services offered by companies like RAM Mobile Data in New York, which is in a joint venture with BellSouth, as well as the Advanced Radio Data Information Service Company of Lincolnshire, Ill. That company, known as Ardis, is a joint venture of I.B.M. and Motorola. **********A short burst of information, like a paragraph, would cost about 16 cents with these data-only services. But a long burst of data, like a full page, would cost far more, about $7.36, because of the means of transmission. **********""The market is big, it's inevitable and it's now,"" said Lee L. Franklin, president of the wireless data division of Pactel Cellular. Pactel estimates that by the year 2000 wireless data transfer could account for 10 to 30 percent of its cellular revenue. **********Moreover, the data-transfer service may enhance the emerging technologies for intelligent-vehicle highway systems, in as-yet-unanticipated ways. Such instruments would allow vehicles to pay tolls without stopping; alert repair trucks to the exact location of accidents, and enable drivers to receive or send messages through devices in their cars -- possibly for alternative routes around congestion."

Fujimori reaffirmed today by claiming emergency powers, his Government has proved incapable of keeping the rebels at bay. **********In Lima's shantytowns, the revolutionaries have fed on the same desperate poverty that long fueled their rural revolt. Since 1990, while the Government shifted to a free-market economic program, five million additional Peruvians were pushed into extreme poverty, a designation that now embraces half the population. **********More ruthless than any other Latin American guerrilla group in memory, Shining Path has caused 25,000 deaths and economic losses estimated at $20 billion. By their own accounts, the rebels want to overwhelm Peruvian society like an Andean earthquake in order to build an orthodox Maoist state on the rubble. They have offered cold-blooded estimates that the process could cost one million lives. **********Those who tried to defend the ways in which Peru had been confronting the insurgents sought to vault over or ignore a welter of obstacles that went further than the political corruption cited by President Fujimori as the rationale for his supression of normal political life. Rebels Too Have Problems **********Among these were an intimidated justice system that often freed Shining Path detainees, a demoralized, under-equipped army, a populace that rejected political parties, and racial resentment by Peru's Indian and mixed-race majority against a European elite. Others were a free-market economic plan that was imposed without shock absorbers for the poor, a cocaine export business that funneled millions of dollars in protection payments to guerrillas, and a civilian political leadership that largely fought subversion with speeches. **********Reflecting the insurgents' spread, one-half of Peru's population of 22 million were living under states of siege even before today's proclamations. Still, despite its growth, the Shining Path movement has also been afflicted with problems. **********In some areas it has been challenged by Andean peasants organized into self-defense militias. Moreover, until today's developments at least, Peru was able to gain growing international support. At home, public opinion has been largely opposed to the terror tactics of the rebels and to their contention that life would improve under the form of Communism they were advocating. **********But as Ideele, a center-left magazine, warned in a March editorial: ""History is riddled with examples where active, organized minorities, convinced of their ends, have imposed their will on majorities."" **********Few people in Peru have expected a decisive showdown soon with the group known here as Sendero Luminoso. But with mayoral elections scheduled for this fall, it was clear during a prolonged visit to the country that ended a week ago that Peruvians were bracing for a violent year, mindful that last year Shining Path squads murdered 44 elected officials and caused elections to be annulled in almost half of 498 jurisdictions. The Land  A Bountiful Nature Is Betrayed by Man **********At stake is an ancient nation with such a deep tradition of mismanagement that a 19th-century Peruvian geographer called it ""a beggar sitting on a beach of gold."" **********From a Pacific coast desert, through snow-topped Andean ranges, to a sweltering Amazon rain forest, South America's third largest nation is brimming with copper, zinc and oil. Offshore, rich fishing grounds propelled Peru to the top of the world's fishing industry in the 1960's. **********But in the 1970's a leftist military Government nationalized oil companies and the fishing fleet. Fish exports nosedived, and Peru slipped from oil exporter to oil importer. **********Thirty years ago, Peru and South Korea had the same per capita income. Today, Peru's per capita income is still at 1960's levels. South Korea sends foreign aid. **********Archeologists studying the Incas' sophisticated system of irrigation canals, terraced mountain fields and warehouses calculate that, five centuries ago, the area now covered by Peru supported a population of 18 million people. But by 1796 imported European diseases and Spanish enslavement of Indians reduced colonial Peru's population to one million. Only in the 1980's did Peru's population finally surpass the peak of Inca period, attaining 22 million. **********Today, half of those people live crowded on one percent of the land: a series of river-fed oases in a narrow, 1,200-mile long coastal desert. In the 1970's, the military undertook a land distribution program that broke the back of the traditional landed gentry, but also of food production. Today, Peru survives on food imports, with American food donations reaching one out of seven Peruvians. The Rebels  Marxism the Seed, Poverty the Soil **********Abimael Guzman Reynoso, a 57-year-old former philosophy professor who founded and leads the Shining Path, has flourished in the prevailing frustration. The man who spent much of his youth in China during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, now bills himself as ""The Fourth Sword of Marxism"" -- after Marx, Lenin and Mao. Mr. Guzman says he is adapting Mao's war tactics to South America. **********On a recent Sunday in a Lima jail block, a thin, bespectacled prisoner let her lunch sit untouched as she lectured her fellow inmates about Maoism's long march in the Andes.  ""The 1990's will be the decade of victory,"" said the woman, a high ranking Shining Path member. She said Peruvians who did not embrace Maoism would face three choices: emigration, re-education camps, or what she described as popular justice. **********After a decade of rural warfare, Mr. Guzman's guerrillas now control roughly 20 percent of Peru's hinterland and are in a position to curb or severely limit government activity in an additional 20 percent. **********""Guzman is not playing at war,"" said Sinecio Jarama Davila, a retired Peruvian Army general who in the early 1980's led a violent but unsuccessful counterinsurgency campaign against the Maoists in their Andean cradle, Ayacucho. ""In the last year, Sendero has been proselytising intensely in Lima's shantytowns. Their long-term plan is for an insurrection there to coincide with their army descending down the Central Highway from the Andes."" **********The Shining Path has started killing elected leaders and creating ""liberated zones"" in rural areas in a 100-mile-wide semicircle around Lima. Penetrating Lima's 2,000 shantytowns, home to half of this city's population of eight million, rebel teams are signing up recruits, conducting propaganda work and intimidating political opponents. **********While occasional murders of community leaders have gained headlines in Lima, analysts have worried more about clandestine recruitment by apostles of the insurgent force that some call ""a political religion."" **********""They are looking for single, unemployed men and women among youth clubs, seminaries, college preparatory schools, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses,"" said an American priest who works in several shantytowns. ""We are expecting a very bloody year in Lima."" **********Demonstrating a self-confidence they had not previously shown in Lima, the Maoists attacked a American diplomatic residence on Feb. 11. The movement's clandestine newspaper, ""El Diario,"" described the target as ""a symbol of Yankee imperialist intervention and looting of the wealth and natural resources of Peru, the headquarters and lair for the misdeeds of C.I.A agent and Yankee Ambassador in Peru Anthony Quainton."" **********In the assult, a Shining Path squad was able to set off a small charge by a 10-foot wall surrounding the Ambassador's tightly guarded downtown residence. Once the police gathered to investigate, guerrillas rolled a red car packed with explosives toward the wall. This second bomb killed three policemen, wounded 20 passers-by and blew out a 40-foot section of the wall. **********The bombing was part of a series leading to an ""armed strike"" on Feb. 14. In the strongest of five such muscle-flexing excercises here, the Shining Path managed, through intimidation and protest appeals, to shut down much work activity in the capital. The Army  Underpaid Force, Fully Unprepared **********The task of conducting a war of counterterror has fallen to Peru's army, a 120,000-member force whose traditions and strategic plans were largely shaped in long-ago wars with Chile in 1881 and Ecuador in 1941. **********""All our units are prepared for conventional war against our neighbors,"" said Brig. Gen. Juan Manuel Campos Luque, who retired from the army in January. ""We don't even have manuals for counterinsurgency training."" **********With 60 percent of Peru's army concentrated near Ecuador's border, President Fujimori conducted a peacemaking visit to Ecuador last January. But for Peru's real war, basic counterinsurgency equipment is lacking and there are constant complaints by officers that their units do not have enough boots, packs, uniforms, radios, trucks and helicopters. **********""I visited one battalion commander in the Andes -- he had 20,000 square kilometers to patrol without a single helicopter,"" a European military attache here said. **********Peru's officers are demoralized by salaries so low that they invite corruption -- $250 a month for a general. Desertion rates are running to 40 percent of draftees and 25 trained officers a month. Fearful of rumored coups, President Fujimori had further weakened counterinsurgency effort by repeatedly shuffling generals and by refusing to appoint a single executive to direct the war full time. **********Mr. Fujimori, who declined to be interviewed for this report, has repeatedly stated that he will clean terrorism out of Peru by the end of his term, July 1995. **********""The real problem in Peru has been to get public authorities to come to grips with terrorism,"" said a former American Ambassador to Peru. ""Civilian response has been to ignore it. The military response has been to blow everyone away."" **********Having hoped to win military aid from the United States, Peru's military has curbed human rights violations -- disappearances of prisoners and detentions without trial. But Lima's middle class increasingly calls for a ""strong hand."" **********""Stop worrying about human rights,"" a 72-year-old Swiss immigrant, a factory owner, growled to an American visitor. ""We need a dirty war, just like in Argentina."" **********Peru's special prosecutor for terrorism, Daniel Espichan Tumay, has said that 85 percent of the 7,000 terror suspects detained in the last decade have been released. Belying hopes for tougher justice, Peru's Supreme Court on March 19 dismissed murder and sedition charges against Mr. Guzman. A month earlier, President Fujimori doubled the reward for Mr. Guzman to $500,000 dead or alive.  The Economy  Leader Is Banking On Private Sector **********With the state virtually bankrupt, many Peruvians still believe that private initiative will save their nation from the Shining Path. Under this theory, an expanding economy will soak up unemployment, and neighborhood self-defense groups will kill terrorists. **********On the economic front, Mr. Fujimori was dismantling state controls imposed by Peru's military Government of 1968 to 1980. By issuing a blizzard of decrees Mr. Fujimori has sought and technically succeeded in establishing one of freest investment environments in Latin America. **********He has settled longstanding disputes with three companies from the United States, the country where half of Peru's foreign invetsment has originated. In response, 10 foreign oil companies are negotiating to sign exploration contracts, and Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Peru's largest private oil producer, announced a $60 million program to increase production 20 percent. **********Mending fences with the international financial community, Mr. Fujimori is winning commitments for billions of dollars in low-interest loans.  For the average Peruvian, the biggest economic benefit has been a radical drop in inflation, from 7,650 percent in 1990 to 139 percent in 1991. But 12 million Peruvians now live in extreme poverty, according to Cuanto, a Lima consulting group.  The Militias  Villages Rally; How About Lima? **********Without waiting for Peru's econmomy to revive, many Peruvians believe that the Shining Path must be fought now through self-defense militias, known as ""rondas."" In the Andean highlands, the army has organized 200,000 peasants in lightly armed rondas that have protected some villages from Shining Path attacks. **********""The rondas are the biggest triumph of the state in 12 years of war,"" said Carlos Ivan Degregori, who organized a national ronda conference at his private study group, the Institute for Peruvian Studies. **********Mr. Degregori predicted it would be harder to devise a successful militia formula for Lima's urban shantytowns, which lack political cohesion and interfamily ties. In addition, the Government is hesitant about working with left-wing slum organizations who oppose Shining Path. **********Seventeen days ago, 15,000 shantytown women marched through downtown Lima to protest ""hunger and terror."" Leaders told reporters that Shining Path threatened many marchers for administering private soup kitchens and government milk programs. **********When they arrived at Lima's ornate Government Palace, protesters were outraged to learn that Peru's Vice President, Maximo San Roman, would not receive their leaders. Tempers rose, and the police dispersed the women with water hoses and tear gas. **********At the time President Fujimori was in Japan where he assured his hosts that Shining Path has been reduced to a small jungle redoubt and that it would be wiped out by the end of his term."

Read Very, Very Carefully","Trying to Decode Proxies? Read Very, Very Carefully"," **********How can a company best avoid disclosing how much it pays its top executives? The traditional way has been by listing salaries in the arcane argot of a proxy statement. **********But with today's renewed interest in executive compensation, the proxy statements sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission and shareholders each spring are coming under new scrutiny. Some investors and regulators even want them translated into conversational English. **********To illustrate the difficulty of reading proxy statements, the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit group that represents 70 of the nation's largest pension funds, held a proxy-reading contest at its two-day meeting last week in Washington. **********The winner was Janice Hester-Amey, an adviser to the California State Teachers' Retirement System. She was awarded a barbecue grill for making the most accurate calculations of the compensation of three top American executives based on information provided in proxy statements. **********Ms. Hester-Amey's calculation for the compensation of the Coca-Cola Company's chief executive, Roberto C. Goizueta, for example, was $66 million. Although her figure was higher than the $63.5 million value that the contest's organizers, who were advised by Graef S. Crystal, the compensation expert, put on the cash, stock and deferred compensation the soft-drink maker awarded its chief, it was much closer than the estimates of other contestants, one of whom estimated as low as $4.1 million. **********One reason for the wide disparity in the estimates was that the restricted stock portion of Mr. Goizueta's compensation was not mentioned until page 13 of Coca-Cola's proxy and was written out rather than shown numerically. Company officials refused to comment. **********Public companies are required to send out proxy statements before their annual meetings. In the statements, companies disclose details of issues to be voted on at the meetings, like compensation for executives and the election of directors and accounting firms. **********The statements also seek permission for companies to act as agents, or proxies, for stockholders, voting their shares as they please. But with corporate issues becoming increasingly complex, and compensation packages ever-more lucrative, proxy statements have become an intricate maze of facts, figures and sometimes gibberish. **********""The current system does not allow even sophisticated investors to make good ball park guesses,"" said Sarah Teslik, the council's executive director. **********Although more than 200 of the investment world's keenest minds had assembled for the conference of the Council of Institutional Investors, only 27 dared enter the proxy-reading contest. **********Contestants were given statements from three companies -- Coca-Cola, the General Motors Corporation and Paramount Communications Inc. -- and asked to determine how much each chief executive made in the latest year. The names of the companies and executives were concealed in the proxies the contestants were given. **********Paramount's chief, Martin S. Davis, earned $3.4 million last year, the contest's organizers and the company agree. Yet, because the information was scattered through the company's proxy, contestants guessed anywhere from $2 million to $4.2 million. Off the Mark on G.M. **********Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, earned $2.1 million in 1990, the last year G.M. has reported, if a value is assigned to his stock options. But contestants' guesses ranged from $1.1 million to $4 million. **********One common pitfall: the company disclosed in its proxy that its five-year incentive plan had paid Mr. Stempel an ""annual average"" amount of $115,000, and some contestants apparently failed to realize they had to multiply that number by five. **********But G.M. promises that its 1991 proxy will be more informative. **********A G.M. spokesman, William B. Winters, said that investors will see a lot of current information summarized in a table for the first time, plus two years' worth of back data. **********""We will take the lead in making it simpler for the stockholders to understand how much the executives made last year,"" he said, ""since that's the name of the game."" **********The S.E.C. has promised to strengthen the rules that govern the information required in a proxy. ""It shouldn't take you forever to figure out what the executive was paid,"" said Mary L. Schapiro, one of five S.E.C. commissioners.  Limited Requirements **********Until the S.E.C. acts, however, most proxies will continue to be among the least user-friendly filings. Companies are not required to value stock option grants, summarize information in tabular form, or provide more than one year of data for comparison purposes, so few do. Most proxies do not even include a company's recent stock price. **********""The proxy system is totally biased toward management, and you need a Ph.D. to understand it,"" said Gray Davis, the Comptroller of California, who attended the conference. **********Carol O'Cleireacain, the New York City Finance Commissioner, disagreed. ""I am a Ph.D., and I can't figure it out,"" said Ms. O'Cleireacain, who exercises executive privilege when a proxy needs to be read. ""I don't do it; I have staff that do it, thank God."" **********Raymond J. Sweeney, the general counsel for the sheet metal worker's pension fund, threw his hands up in disgust at the thought of reading proxies for the contest. **********""About two years ago, we decided we'd vote all the proxies and I was assigned to do it,"" he recalled. ""I thought, 'I can read and write, I can understand this,' and after billing my clients for six hours and getting nowhere, I gave up."""

Clifford, adviser to several Presidents, is too ill to stand trial in New York State on charges stemming from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal. **********At a hearing in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Justice John A. K. Bradley appeared receptive to a motion by Mr. Clifford's lawyer, Charles A. Stillman, to dismiss the state charges against his 85-year-old client. Mr. Stillman has submitted written statements from several doctors who assert that Mr. Clifford suffers from heart disease and other maladies and might be killed by the strain of a trial. **********Justice Bradley indicated that he must hear from the doctors in person ""if I were inclined to grant your motion."" He ordered Mr. Clifford, who lives in Washington, and did not attend yesterday's hearing, to submit to examination by another doctor, one chosen by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, before the Dec. 9 hearing. **********In addition to facing the state charges, Mr. Clifford, a former Secretary of Defense, and his law partner and co-defendant, Robert A. Altman, were named in a Federal indictment in Washington arising from the B.C.C.I. affair. In both cases, they are charged with helping B.C.C.I. to conceal from Federal banking regulators its ownership of several institutions in the United States, including First American Bankshares Inc., which Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman headed. **********Mr. Stillman, Mr. Clifford's lead lawyer in New York, said his client would also seek to have the Federal charges dropped, though Mr. Clifford's lawyers in Washington have not made such a motion. ""There will be no trial of Clark Clifford anywhere,"" he predicted. **********Tacitly conceding that Mr. Clifford cannot stand trial in his current condition, an assistant district attorney, John W. Moscow, argued that the state indictment should be kept alive but dormant, until Mr. Clifford either recovered or died. **********Mr. Moscow said dismissal of the criminal charges would, at least temporarily, release to Mr. Clifford $17 million of his assets that have been frozen by a civil action brought against him in the B.C.C.I. case by the District Attorney's office. It would also permit Mr. Clifford to seek reimbursement from First American for millions of dollars in legal fees, under an indemnification agreement with the bank, he added."

Jacques Delors, who heads the European Commission, accuses the Americans of ""not budging because they think they can divide the Europeans, and they are wrong about that."" **********The Bush Administration regards cuts in agricultural export subsidies crucial to a successful conclusion of the trade negotiations. Julius L. Katz, the United States deputy trade negotiator, interviewed shortly before he took off Wednesday for Europe, said the United States has gone as far as it could toward a compromise on farm subsidies. **********The Administration, he said, has now accepted the package of proposals offered by Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of GATT. These include a 36 percent cut in farm subsidies, in budgetary terms, over the next six years, from its original proposal to eliminate farm export subsidies completely. The Dunkel proposal, Mr. Katz said, would mean ""no more than a 25 percent cut"" in the physical volume of subsidized farm exports. **********Ambassador Katz said he had ""speculated out loud"" about the possibility of removing agriculture from the Uruguay Round to save the rest of its agreements. But such a solution is impossible, because many nations, even more dependent on agricultural exports than the United States, will not accept smaller cuts in Europe's farm subsidies. Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and other agricultural exporting countries have accepted the Dunkel proposals. But the French, Mr. Katz said, ""are still saying no to Dunkel."" **********There is widespread concern, among American and Japanese business executives, that Europe is turning inward. With the end of the cold war and the Soviet threat, many Europeans think the United States is losing its importance in the world economy. **********""If America's decline hardens into reality, Europe will suffer,"" Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, writes in his new book ""Millennium."" Mr. Attali, a close adviser to President Francois Mitterrand of France, adds, ""But, if Western Europe is able to link Eastern Europe with its development, an integrated Europe has a chance to assume the role of the center of the world economy. It will then be able to develop as the most populated, the richest and the most creative center in the world. **********""If not, the new center will likely be Japan, for that island nation combines the necessary conditions for attracting global monetary, industrial and even cultural power."" **********Yet many of Japan's government and business leaders, keenly aware of how vital open world markets have been to their own development, are worried about how a failure of the Uruguay Round would damage the Japanese economy. But with its weak political leadership now worsened by the scandals linking Japanese gangsters to some highly placed politicians, the Liberal Democratic Government, afraid of losing the farm vote -- and especially that of the rice farmers -- is doing next to nothing to help rescue the Uruguay Round. **********""Japan is a sideline player,"" Mr. Katz said. ""Japan is always playing a waiting game. You'd think they'd be in the forefront, given what they have at stake."" **********Some Japanese officials, however, are starting to speak out. Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said last week that Japan would be left on the sidelines of the world economy if it refused to lift its ban on rice imports. And he told a parliamentary panel that Japan would be held responsible if the Uruguay Round failed. **********The United States itself is being accused by its GATT partners, and even its free-trade partners in Canada, of sliding toward protectionism because of election-year pressures from the Democrats and industrialists and workers hit by the recession. Mr. Bush's trip to Japan, accompanied by the chief executives of the Big Three auto companies, is offered as Exhibit A in the Administration's drift toward managed trade. **********Ambassador Katz denies this, declaring that he has never known any President so committed to open trade and so willing to get into the trade issue. **********Will the Uruguay Round fail? ""I have swung from optimism to pessimism and am now neither optimistic nor pessimistic,"" Mr. Katz said. **********He said his ""honest answer"" was that the Europeans and the United States were now very close to an agreement, though France is the linchpin.  ""Even if the talks fail,"" he added, ""it won't be the end of the world. It won't be Armageddon."" **********But many businessmen and economists fear that a failure to make a trade deal now would start a process of deterioration that would aggravate a growing split into rival trade blocs and inflict new hardships on the world economy. The irony is that a relatively small number of high-cost farmers in France and Japan may wreck a global trading system from which vast numbers have benefited."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/07/business/credit-markets-bond-prices-fall-jobs-data-awaited.html,Jonathan Fuerbringer,1992-08-07,,750,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bond Prices Fall; Jobs Data Awaited,CREDIT MARKETS; Bond Prices Fall; Jobs Data Awaited," **********The bond market fell yesterday as traders spent a day warily preparing for the release of the July unemployment figures today. **********""The market is a little off because it is worried about the jobs number,"" said Donald Fine, chief market economist at Chase Securities Inc. ""No one wants to go into a number that is so unknown or that can influence the market so much either very long or short,"" he said. This means that few traders want to bet one way or the other on the report by either buying a lot of notes or bonds or by selling them in advance. **********In trading in the secondary market, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bond of 2021 was offered at 106 14/32 , down 13/32 , to yield 7.45 percent, compared with 7.42 percent on Wednesday. In the pre-auction or when-issued market, where the new 30-year bond is already being traded in anticipation of its auction next Thursday, the yield was 7.41 percent, up from 7.37 percent yesterday. **********In other trading, the 10-year 7.5 percent note was offered in late trading at 106 4/32 , down 8/32 , to yield 6.63 percent. In the pre-auction market, the new 10-year note to be awarded next Wednesday was offered at a yield of 6.65 percent, compared with 6.62 percent the day before. Three-Year Note Offering **********The 5.5 percent three-year note was offered at 103 1/32 , unchanged for the day, to yield 4.69 percent. In the pre-auction market, the new three-year note to be awarded Tuesday was offered at a yield of 4.84 percent, compared with 4.83 percent on Wednesday. The two-year note ended at 99 31/32 , down 1/32 , to yield 4.26 percent, compared with 4.25 percent on Wednesday. Three-month and six-month bills were down only slightly and the one-year bill was unchanged. **********Today and next week could be rough for the market. The unemployment data could change the tone of a market that rallied strongly in July. But the number could also restart the rally. And whatever tone is set, investors next week must digest $36 billion of 3-year and 10-year notes and a new 30-year bond. Some analysts are worried about indigestion, which means the market would fall some from its recent highs. **********Today traders will have to do a little analysis before they can figure out whether to buy or sell and whether the upward trend is back on, off or on hold. One key number they will look at is the increase, or decrease, in nonfarm payroll jobs. The consensus forecast is that this number will increase by 100,000 to 150,000 after a decrease of 117,000 in June. **********But the new July numbers are likely to be distorted and pushed higher by the hiring of workers under an emergency Federal jobs program that began last month. These jobs could add as many as 150,000 workers to the nonfarm payroll total. **********In addition, analysts will be looking at whether the 117,000 decline of last month is revised significantly. If it is and the revision decreases the reported decline a lot, the impact of the new July figure may be lessened because, as one government securities trader said, the new number will have no credibility. **********""Everyone just wants to get through tomorrow,"" he added, reflecting the concern of many that instead of coming in as expected, the jobs figure will be a big surprise, as it was when the June report came out at the beginning of July, **********One factor that appeared to pull down the prices of Treasuries with longer maturities was that investors abandoned one recently popular way to play the market: betting that short-term interest rates would rise while longer-term rates declined or, at least, did not rise as fast. **********To make this play, the investor sells short-term notes, like the 2-year, and buys longer-term maturities, like the 5-year, 10-year note or the 30-year bond. **********To get out of this position, because it might be too risky going into the unemployment report, the investor buys 2-year notes and sells the longer maturities. In a possible reflection of these kinds of trades yesterday, the 2-year note outperformed the 10-year note and the 30-year bond. The yield on the two-year note rose a basis point or one one-hundredth of a percentage point while the yields on the 30-year bond and the 10-year note were up 3 basis points each."

Palmer is not planning to hold to the status quo for long after he takes over as president and chief executive of the Digital Equipment Corporation on Thursday. Mr. Palmer is planning to carry out major organizational changes within the troubled $14 billion computer maker, according to internal memos obtained by PC Week, an industry trade publication. **********The documents lay out a ""new direction"" for Digital, in which a new, more focused organizational structure will make the company far more customer-driven than it has been in recent years. Digital has been hit hard in recent years, losing $2.8 billion for the 1992 fiscal year. **********""Our products are difficult to understand and to sell,"" Mr. Palmer writes in the documents, copies of which were also obtained by other reporters. ""It is difficult for customers to do business with us. Over all, our business practices, processes, services and products are not competitive, and are not satisfying our customer's requirements."" 'Redundant Efforts' Criticized **********Mr. Palmer's plans call for the company to ""re-engineer"" all of its business practices and processes in order to make it far easier for customers to order and receive Digital's products. **********A Digital spokesman called the documents ""confidential"" and said the company would have no comment. He noted that the information represented ""work in progress"" and should not be considered final plans. **********In one memo, Mr. Palmer proposes what he calls a ""supply-chain strategic plan"" for Digital that will eliminate overlapping and competing engineering and business units. He complains that existing processes and systems were not created with any comprehensive plan and that they have resulted in ""redundant efforts."" **********Among the prospective plans: to combine all of the company's hardware development efforts under one hardware engineering group and all of its networking products under a separate single group. He expects such consolidation to result in cost reductions of $1 billion and asset reductions of $1 billion, according to the memo. **********Mr. Palmer instituted broad changes in Digital's manufacturing and logistics organization, which he ran before being named to succeed Kenneth H. Olsen, who resigned in July. Mr. Palmer received high grades from analysts for consolidating and streamlining Digital's manufacturing process after taking over that operation in November 1990. The company reduced its work force by 20,000 during that period, with 70 percent of the cutbacks coming from Mr. Palmer's organization. **********Analysts expect Mr. Palmer's changes to result in some high-level management shake-ups, with several top executives losing their positions."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/business/mutual-funds-when-the-time-is-right-to-sell.html,Carole Gould,1992-11-29,,1009,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Mutual Funds; When the Time Is Right to Sell,Mutual Funds; When the Time Is Right to Sell," **********BUYING mutual fund shares is simple, partly because the industry is so eager to help. But when it comes to deciding to sell, investors are on their own. **********While people hang on to losing shares for many reasons -- benign neglect, for one -- most fund purchases are not lifelong commitments, investment advisers say. It makes sense to periodically review a portfolio and prune. Some clues: changes in performance, management or asset base. **********""People need long-term outlooks, but if you have serious doubts about a fund, there's probably a good alternative,"" said Kenneth E. Gregory, who edits the L/G No-Load Fund Analyst in San Francisco. **********A fund manager's departure is a red flag. ""It doesn't mean you should automatically sell, but you'll have to assess how important the manager really is and who the replacement is,"" Mr. Gregory said. **********A manager's departure means something different at different funds. Some rely heavily on their managers' quirky stockpicking styles; Janus and New England Growth are two examples. Others -- Twentieth Century and the American funds, for instance -- take a team approach, so losing a manager has less impact. Still others, like Vista Growth and Income Fund or the Valueline Fund, use more defined approaches to stockpicking so the manager has less discretion. **********Then there is the question of evaluating the new manager. In the case of Fidelity Magellan, the nation's largest equity fund, the two who have succeeded Peter Lynch since he departed in 1990 had built excellent track records elsewhere. But in many cases, the new managers are unknown. **********Because most manager shifts are not as widely publicized as the changes at Magellan, experts recommend calling the fund once a year to verify the manager's status. **********A seller must also factor in tax costs.  Investors with huge taxable capital gains might think twice about cashing out. But because funds pay capital gains annually, on which investors then pay taxes even if the money is reinvested, the potential tax bill on selling may not be as big as you think. **********Even so, investors who plan to leave fund shares to heirs, and avoid some capital gains liability, might take that tax break into account, said Nadine Lee, a tax partner with Ernst & Young, in New York. **********Some experts would be wary of a big drop in assets during rising markets; it can indicate poor strategy, poor shareholder services or other problems. And if a fund no longer conforms to investment guidelines -- a small-cap value fund starts buying earnings-oriented stocks -- ""that's a clear sell signal,"" said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago. **********Most of these changes show up in a fund's performance. But evaluating performance itself can be tricky. **********When some funds lag, it may be related to a reasonable strategy. For instance, the hallmark of some stock funds, like the Phoenix Growth Fund, is a defensive approach. While they might underperform in strong rallies, they maintain superior returns by limiting their losses when the market sours. **********Most important is to compare a fund's performance with that of its peers. Because the market rewards various stockpicking styles at different times, the proper benchmark is critical. A fund that buys small stocks using a value approach, like Nicholas Limited Edition, should be compared with similar funds, like Pennsylvania Mutual. If realistic competitors are performing better, ""that's a reason to get out,"" Mr. Phillips said. **********But experts caution against weighing quarterly, monthly or annual performance too heavily. Mutual funds are based on long-term investing, and even great stockpickers have bad years. Mr. Gregory looks for trends.  ""Two years of underperformance would be a concern."" he said. After three disappointing years, ""I'd look for alternatives."" **********One reason to dump a fund is that you originally misunderstood it. For example, many shareholders of short-term global income funds found they could not handle the risks during Europe's currency crisis in September. **********Radical increases in fund size, especially of small stock funds that grow rapidly after being discovered by investors, should also raise a red flag. A small fund that owns 30 stocks is very different from a fund that is five times larger in assets and owns 200 stocks. The Janus Venture Fund, for instance, closed when assets reached $1.2 billion; now it manages $1.6 billion. While its performance hasn't suffered, ""it's worth watching,"" Mr. Gregory said. **********Then there are changes in your own financial situation. As you grow older, for example, it may be wise to begin trimming risks by replacing some aggressive growth funds with, say, equity-income funds. **********Nonetheless, ""if you picked a fund because you like the ability of its manager and its style, stick with it,"" said Mr. Phillips, who still owns shares in the Templeton Growth Fund, which he bought more than 15 years ago. Assuming your original research is still valid, he suggests, rebalance your portfolio occasionally by selling some shares that have performed strongly and replacing them with shares of a fund that has done less well. TWO STRATEGIES PUT TO THE TEST **********WHO would add more value to a fund: a money manager who excels at market timing, or one who can identify the best industry sectors? **********The industry selector wins hand down, says a recent study by CDA/Wiesenberger, mutual fund researchers in Rockville, Md.  The study, which compared the performance of two theoretical money managers, assumes the market-timer correctly called every market swing of at least 10 percent, while the industry selector chose the winning sector each year among energy, financial services, gold, health care, technology and utilities. **********The market-timer parlayed $1,000 into $14,650. The industry selector's $1,000 grew to $62,640. A buy-and-hold S.& P. 500 investment would have grown to only $6,030. The study shows that industry selection is more important than market timing, which most investors can't do anyway, said Steve Savage, managing editor for CDA/Wiesenberger."

It is true, though, that the McDonald's Corporation has begun test-marketing, yes, a vegetarian burger. **********McDonald's, the company that has made the red-blooded American hamburger an international cultural icon on a par with Coca-Cola, is doing its best to play down its exploration of the meatless burger frontier. **********""It's only a five-restaurant test in the Netherlands,"" Richard Starmann, a senior vice president at the company's headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, Ill., said today. ""Next month it will expand to all 84 stores in that country, but that's only 84 stores out of nearly 13,000 worldwide, one country out of 63."" **********The meatless burger that has gone on sale in the Netherlands consists of potato, peas, carrots, corn, onion and spices. It sells for 4.75 Dutch guilders, or about $2.70, slightly less than a standard Big Mac. **********Mr. Starmann said the company had no plans to test the Dutch vegetable burgers in the United States. He noted that a number of products, like the fried egg sandwiches at McDonald's outlets in Malaysia, developed local followings but were not exported to other nations. Others, like the McRib pork sandwich, popular in Germany, have been tried elsewhere but failed to gain acceptance. **********Nevertheless, today's announcement had animal rights and vegetarian groups in the United States salivating in anticipation. **********""I think it's terrific that McDonald's is recognizing the vegetarian market, and I hope it makes its way here soon,"" said Robin Walker, a spokeswomen for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group based in Washington. **********And some McDonald's restaurant operators in the United States say they would like to be able to try the product on their customers. **********""I think this would be a good site for that product,"" said Serafin Rodriguez, manager of a McDonald's outlet in Malibu, Calif. ""We get a lot of requests for hamburgers with no meat."" **********The Dutch vegetable burger is not McDonald's first stab at a beefless, patty-like product in a bun. A fabled flop in the company's early history was an attempt in the early 1960's by the chain's founder, Ray Kroc, to introduce the Hula Burger, a cheese-covered pineapple ring in a bun. **********To date, McDonald's chief rival, Burger King, has been the international pioneer in fast-food hamburger alternatives. Its Spicy Bean Burger has been an increasingly popular item on its British menus for three years. But despite lobbying from vegetarians in this country, Burger King has conducted no tests of the product here and has no plans to do so, according to Cori Zywotow, a spokeswoman for the Miami-based chain, a unit of the British food conglomerate Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. **********""We are constantly doing market research, and at this point we don't see any pull for it from consumers,"" Ms. Zywotow said. **********About 12.4 million Americans describe themselves as vegetarians, according to a survey done early this year for Vegetarian Times, a magazine published in Oak Park, Ill. About one-third of them eat red meat several times a year, and higher percentages eat other items on the standard McDonald's menu like chicken. **********Analysts doubt that the strict vegetarian market is big enough to make much difference to McDonald's. But all of the chains are concerned about the vegetarians' possible influence on other health-conscious diners. **********""Testing this burger is just an extrapolation of what's been going on for years in the industry,"" said John J. Rohs, who follows fast-food companies for Wertheim Schroder in New York. ""They are catering to more and more of the palate."" **********The downside of such developments, Mr. Rohs said, is that each new menu item adds complexity and increases labor costs. **********McDonald's says vegetarians are already offered breakfast foods and salads at its restaurants. Another response to the growing health concerns of consumers has been the McLean Deluxe burger, a lower-fat hamburger that many food critics lambaste in taste tests. McDonald's declines to release sales figures, but it says it is happy with the product. Most industry analysts judge it to be a marginal enhancement to the menu at best. Other chains that have introduced similar products have reported disappointing results, and some, like Hardee's, have given up on them. **********McDonald's can afford to keep such an item if it broadens the customer base. The company had a net income of $730.7 million on sales of $5.30 billion in the first nine months of this year."

Take 150 mostly male, fast-track business executives between the ages of 40 and 50 and immerse them in a three-month intensive business program at the country's top school. Take them away from their spouses and kids. Make them live with each other in a dorm. Work them harder than they've ever worked. Tell them not to call their offices. Make them admit their weaknesses and showcase their strengths. **********This is Harvard University's Advanced Management Program, an intellectual boot camp for the future chief executives and chief financial officers of the world -- Parris Island for the Fortune 500. Though one graduate described his stint at Harvard as ""animal house for 45-year-olds who take themselves far too seriously,"" the program is deadly successful, with many graduates earning promotions soon after returning to the real world. **********But the program, which runs twice a year, with the spring session recently ended, is not for the faint of heart. ""You get put into an environment where you are totally intimidated by everything -- by the Harvard name; by being with the top level folks from very large, successful companies, from all industries, cultures and from many different countries,"" said George Harvin, vice president of Roses Stores Inc. in Henderson, N.C.. ""And you find out how you measure up. **********Participants must have 15 to 25 years of business experience and are usually sent by their companies, like it or not. The former director of the Center Intelligence Agency, Adm. Stansfield Turner, says he was ordered by the Pentagon to report to duty to Harvard in 1966, before becoming president of the Naval War College. William McManaman, vice president of finance at the Brunswick Corporation, the Illinois-based boating and recreational company, was sent by the chairman of his company in 1989. **********It may sound like a warning from the boss. But being among the 150 participants selected signals that a person is on the fast track to the top -- and not only because of the $30,500 tuition. ""Your boss has to decide to do without your brains for three months and agree not to bug you while you're there,"" said Jeanette Wagner, one of two women in her 132-person class in 1983. At the time, she was a senior vice president of Estee Lauder International Inc. Now she is president. **********There are no grades in the program, where fast trackers develop skills in finance, marketing, operations and negotiating. But competition is fierce. ""I would say that for the first week, participants are almost like dogs sniffing each other,"" said Jay Lorsch, senior associate dean and chairman of executive education programs at Harvard, apologizing for his analogy. ""Once they've been here a few weeks, they realize they can lower the mask and reveal their weaknesses and say: 'I don't understand this. Help me.' Most can't do that in their companies without being penalized."" **********With almost half of each class from countries outside North America, friendships form between folks who stand a good chance of being economically or politically important some day. Part of that is due to the forced, close living arrangements. All students live in one building in ""can"" arrangements, eight single rooms grouped around a common living room. Richard Adkerson, president of the Freeport McMoran Oil and Gas Company, said he recently turned to one of his ""can"" mates, a top level architect in Bangkok, while putting together an oil and gas concession in Thailand. **********Deals are often struck during the course. ""I remember finding out a big deal had been consummated in one session between an Australian guy from a mining company and a woman who was the treasurer of a big Korean trading company,"" Dean Lorsch said. **********Despite a grueling class and homework schedule, the program is not all business. ""Usually about two-thirds of the way through, everyone loosens up and has fun,"" Mr. Harvin said. ""It usually comes after the computerized game -- a 'what if' situation where you are given a fictitious company and there is a hostile outsider and white knight. You're under the stress of time, and you have to decide with your peers what will be done. You find out after that you've made good friends."" **********Claude Zinngrabe, chairman of Prudential Home Building Investors Inc., the insurance company's real estate arm, says he fondly recalls the night 14 Japanese executives from the program threw a party that was supposed to last from 5 P.M. to 7 P.M. ""All I can tell you is I found myself, beer in hand at midnight, singing 'Hey Jude' next to a Scotsman playing the piano,"" he said. **********And while being away from their spouses and kids is difficult, some take advantage of the freedom. One head of a large beverage company in Europe was nicknamed ""Bond, James Bond"" by his suitemates because of his nocturnal wanderings. ""The whole can would go out for dinner and, like clockwork, Bond would be gone before dessert,"" said one colleague. ""We never saw him at night."" **********Another tells a story, perhaps apocryphal, of how on the last weekend, when spouses are invited to attend classes and graduation, the wife of one foreigner stumbled upon her husband snuggled up with one of the few women in the class. **********And finally, there is graduation. Someone passes the hat, and money is set aside for a final party. But no kegs or ""Thumper"" drinking games here. ""We dressed in black tie and tails,"" said one participant. ""Some of the spouses wore traditional dresses -- saris, kimonos. It was a really lovely evening."" And the cost? A mere $45,000."

Signals From London **********One such hint was Mr. Major's decision recently to meet with Mr. Lee, whom Beijing detests, and pose with him for photographs at 10 Downing Street. **********Another was Mr. Major's replacement of Hong Kong's Governor, Lord Wilson, a career diplomat who supported the Foreign Office approach. The new Governor, Christopher Patten, who takes up his duties next week, is said to be considering a more democratic style of Government. **********The next hint was a statement by Alistair Goodlad, the new British minister with special responsibility for Hong Kong, that it was possible to increase the number of directly elected legislative seats in Hong Kong. **********Beijing was horrified. **********A China-backed newspaper in the territory, Wen Wei Po, warned that a ""hard line"" against China could ""throw Hong Kong into disorder."" A Poor Loser **********The problem with direct elections, from China's point of view, is that its candidates never win. When Hong Kong held its first democratic legislative elections last year, not one of the 18 seats went to a supporter of China. **********Hong Kong is now a free but undemocratic society run by the British colonial Government. Many Hong Kong citizens seem to feel that this benevolent dictatorship may lose its benevolence after the handover in 1997, and they favor democratic institutions as a check against the Communist Party. **********Chinese officials say it is unthinkable to increase the number of directly elected legislators in 1997 from the 20 planned at present, out of the 60 seats in the legislature. **********For its part, Beijing has signaled its irritation by criticizing the spending on the proposed airport. Without Chinese support, it would be virtually impossible for Britain to raise the private funds necessary to build the airport. **********Many diplomats suspect that China is hoping for a compromise: It would back the airport if Britain dropped its talk of democracy in Hong Kong."

It left unclear which nations would take part, how a military operation would be organized and what role would be taken by the United Nations peacekeeping force already in place. Hope for Diplomatic Solution **********Some observers here said the wording of the resolution was left intentionally vague to allow time for possible diplomatic solutions to the conflict before military force was called in. **********About the only overt action was taken by the United States Navy, which ordered the aircraft carrier Saratoga, with 80 aircraft on board, to take up a postion in the Adriatic Sea off the coast of what used to be Yugoslavia. Accompanying the Saratoga is the cruiser Biddle. **********In Geneva, the United Nations Human Rights Commission concluded a two-day emergency session by sending former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland to the former Yugoslavia to investigate assertions of atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including deportations of civilians in the name of ""ethnic cleansing."""

'No More Free Lunches' **********Recent accusations in Washington -- vigorously denied by Israel -- that Israelis surreptitiously re-exported American weapons technology without getting United States approval has further deepened feelings among some people that they had better think harder about going it alone from now on. **********""The message from the United States is becoming clearer,"" Yoel Marcus, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, wrote in a widely shared opinion. ""The relations between the two countries will never be the same again, and there will be no more free lunches."" **********If anything, the general sense of siege intensifed tonight with reports that at least 10 people were killed and almost 100 wounded in a bomb explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. **********Officially, Israel has not withdrawn its bid for the loan guarantees, which it first requested a year ago to help absorb what was then a torrent of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, however, the stream of immigrants is much thinner. **********""Why should we make life easier for the Bush Administration?"" one official said. ""Let them be the ones to say no.""  Going It Alone **********But several top officials suggested that the aid package was all but clinically dead, a theme echoed by some newspapers. **********Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who met in Washington today with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said in radio interviews broadcast here that Washington's insistence on no new settlements in the occupied territories amounted to ""impossible terms"" that ""no Government in Israel could accept."" **********""We will have to raise the necessary funds for absorbing immigration from the Soviet Union ourselves, with the help of Jewish communities around the world,"" said Mr. Arens, who is close to Mr. Shamir and is No. 2 on the ruling Likud Party's list of candidates for parliamentary elections in June. **********Referring to the loan guarantees, he said, ""In my opinion, there's no point to another request."" **********Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental body responsible for immigration, told Israel radio that there was no longer any reason for the Government to press its search for aid.  What's Next? **********All this raised questions about what Israel would do now. **********While Mr. Dinitz said the loan guarantees were essential, other officials said Israel could get by without them, even if it might cause the economy to limp a bit more heavily. **********The idea of the guarantees is not that the United States would give Israel $10 billion but that it would stand behind Israel when it goes to private institutions to borrow the money. Two billion dollars' worth of such loans were included in Israel's 1992 budget, which may have to be recalculated. **********With the guarantees, interest rates would be lower and loan terms more favorable; repayment might be stretched out over a much longer period, for example. Without the guarantees, some economists say, the country faces rougher sledding. Foreign investors may even view the lack of guarantees as a vote of no confidence that casts doubts on the wisdom of putting any money into Israel.  Defining Alternatives **********Saying that the ""writing is on the wall,"" Dan Gillerman, head of the Israel Federation of Chambers of Commerce, called for a ""crash program"" to revitalize the country's lumbering economy. Senior officials of the Bank of Israel, who have been among the most insistent on the importance of the guarantees, met tonight in a long session but announced no decisions. **********Still, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai said that the country ""can manage in the worst-case scenario"" and that there were alternatives. **********The newspaper Maariv reported that Mr. Modai had made a secret visit to Europe to persuade Jewish millionaires that, in the probable absence of the guarantees, now was the time to come to the aid of the country. He reportedly came away feeling confident. **********The $10 billion in loan guarantees anticipated an average of 200,000 immigrants a year in the next few years. But thus far in 1992 the pace has slowed to 5,000 a month, an annual rate of 60,000. And while officials say that conditions are so unstable in the former Soviet Union that immigration could surge at any moment, they acknowledge that they may have extra breathing room.  The Bigger Picture **********Dollars aside, some argue that the shabby state of United States-Israeli relations is likely to make Israel more skittish in the peace process, which has bumped along inconclusively for five months. **********""To the extent that Israelis perceive that they don't have the cushion of a firm, reliable American ally, it might affect their willingness to take what they perceive as security risks,"" said Harry Wall, who heads the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. **********There were no public comments on the loan guarantees today from the opposition Labor Party. But it seemed inevitable that Labor would seize the moment to repeat charges that Mr. Shamir had sacrificed a Zionist opportunity to increase Jewish immigration on an ideological altar: his commitment to Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Labor, like the United States, has called for a freeze on such settlements. **********But Mr. Shamir, some commentators said, may respond with an argument that the Americans have it in for Israel and, with or without settlements, the aid request was in trouble. **********In any event, the Prime Minister told reporters that he would not alter his policies and that he expected ultimately to prevail. **********""If we do not change, and continue our political path,"" he said, ""I have no doubt that also the stance of the other side will change over time."""

It proceeded, like other newspapers and radio and television stations here, to examine the legacy of what is by far this country's most traumatic experience: the brutal seven-month occupation by Iraqi troops, whose victims are still being counted. **********In this most conservative society, what is worse than the Iraqis' torture of Kuwaitis, worse than the 300 killings, worse than the 800 Kuwaitis who were taken prisoner and are still missing, is the issue of rape. **********""Crimes of honor,"" as they are called in Arab societies, are just beginning to be discussed after a long silence during which rape victims and their families chose to hide their pain, seeking therapy outside Kuwait to preserve their secrets. **********Marwan al-Muttawa, a Kuwaiti psychiatrist, told newspapers that began to creep across this sociological minefield this week that he estimated that 3,200 women had been raped by Iraqi soldiers and officers. **********""Only 400 raped women have reported their cases at psychiatric centers in the country,"" Dr. Muttawa was quoted as saying in articles that were themselves startling, since such subjects are close to taboo and have never been discussed so openly here. ""A majority of them have decided either to remain silent or to go abroad for treatment.""  Can This Child Be Loved? **********None of the rape victims have been publicly identified, although several doctors and officials corroborated the press accounts. But publicizing the stories of a few is a manifestation of how, two years after the invasion, Kuwait's wounds still fester. **********Some women got abortions, according to doctors who verified these stories. But in an Islamic society where abortion is a sin, many women had their babies. Many of these women, the doctors say, gave up their babies for adoption. Others, like Haifa, kept their infants, struggling in a relationship with a child that is theirs, but not by choice, and in a society where a deep stigma is attached to women who bear children outside of wedlock. **********""My feelings toward him are ever changing,"" Haifa was quoted as saying about her son, identified as Abdallah. ""Sometimes I hate to look at him for two whole days, and on other occasions I hug, kiss and take him into my arms."" **********According to the article in Arab Times, an English-language daily, Haifa was engaged to be married when the invasion took place in August 1990. Her fiance was killed by the Iraqis, as was her brother. Her mother, who had a heart condition, died. Then came the rape at gunpoint by two Iraqi soldiers. It was after she fled Kuwait to another Persian Gulf country in the early months of the occupation that she became aware of her pregnancy. Rise in Violent Crimes **********The lingering pains of the invasion include a palpable undoing of the social fabric in other areas too. **********This morning's papers reported that on Saturday, a man had entered a Government office where his divorced wife worked and shot her dead. When her superior came to investigate, the man shot him dead, too, and then turned himself in to the police. **********It was the 400th violent use of weapons reported in Kuwait since the liberation -- a stunning increase in crime in a country where murder was a rarity. **********Attacks on Asian maids have greatly increased since the liberation. While rape and beatings always occur in a country that employs thousands of domestics, the sharp rise has led to an exodus of maids and to many questions about the impact of the war and the invasion on this society. **********According to several reliable reports, harassment and beatings of suspected Iraqi collaborators, particularly among the dwindling community of 40,000 Palestinians, still take place regularly. Nearly 300,000 Palestinians have left Kuwait after being dismissed from their jobs and denied residence permits because most Kuwaitis believe they supported the Iraqi invasion. That exodus is still under way. **********Last week, the Government passed a law that allows it to surround entire neighborhoods and search each house for arms. It is reckoned that not a single home is without a firearm. **********""They won't find anything,"" said Ahmad al-Khatib, a politician and doctor. ""People have been hiding their weapons and ammunition for weeks before this came out."" He said the invasion had created such deep insecurities that most Kuwaitis felt they needed arms to defend themselves ""against anybody and everybody."""

Gephardt, said today that the labor and environmental provisions were so badly flawed that the pact should be renegotiated. **********Mr. Gephardt, one of the most influential House Democrats on trade issues, ran for President in 1988 on a platform that emphasized restrictions on imports from Japan. His last-moment support last year was crucial to the narrow approval of the measure giving President Bush the authority to negotiate the agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada. Mexico and Canada do not want to renegotiate the pact. **********Worried that support for the pact could hurt them among constituents anxious about job losses to Mexico, not even the Republicans at a Senate Finance Committee meeting on Tuesday and at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing today made any commitments to back it. **********But neither house will vote on the issue until next year, making it easy to criticize now and to support later. ""Almost everybody who is carping to you now will vote for it,"" predicted Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican on the trade subcommittee. **********Mr. Gephardt's call for renegotiation followed a chorus of complaints from Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, about White House attacks on Gov. Bill Clinton for not taking a position on the pact. Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rostenkowski said the election-year attacks had threatened the bipartisan consensus for free trade and the accord's prospects for eventual passage. Protecting Their Candidate **********The complaints reflected Congressional sensitivity to Mr. Clinton's possible vulnerability on the issue.  ""They're lining up to provide some cover for their Presidential candidate,"" said Thomas E. Mann, the director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington. **********But George C. Shipley, a Democratic consultant based in Austin, Tex., said he doubted that the issue would affect Mr. Clinton much at the polls because not enough voters were paying close attention to it. **********Mr. Gephardt had said, before the agreement was finished, that shortcomings in it probably could be repaired by the legislation needed to put its provisions into American law. Today, he attributed his shift in position to his reading of the text of the agreement and conversations with voters. **********President Bush announced the agreement on Aug. 12, and released its voluminous text in two installments on Friday and Tuesday. All drafts had been classified on the ground that public debate might limit the flexibility of the American negotiating team during the 14 months of talks. Though members of Congress were allowed to look at the drafts, many staff members lacked the necessary security clearances. Areas That Raise Objections **********Speaking at a conference here sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and four other environmental, labor and consumer groups, Mr. Gephardt said the agreement failed to address specific pollution and workers' rights issues in Mexico and should have done so. **********Asked afterward whether Mr. Clinton should renegotiate the pact if it is left until next year, Mr. Gephardt replied, ""A lot of it can be done through the implementing legislation -- I think some of it has to be done through renegotiation."" **********Mr. Gephardt's criticisms drew a sharp response from the Administration. ""The Nafta will generate more jobs, provide more environmental protection and make America more competitive than has any other trade agreement, include trade agreements for which Mr. Gephardt has voted in the past,"" said Kathleen A. Lydon, the White House's chief spokeswoman on trade issues. **********Mr. Gephardt said the agreement should include worker protection rules for Mexico and a special commission to issue bonds for environmental cleanup along the border. He called, as he had in July, for a tax on trade to help pay for the cleanup and to pay for retraining workers who lose their jobs to Mexico. **********This tax should be ""far lower than the current levy"" on imports from Mexico, which averages about 4 percent, he said in the speech. But later he said when talking to reporters, ""It may be 2 percent; it may be 3 percent."" Opposition to Border Tax **********In her testimony today before the Ways and Means Committee, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, dismissed the idea of a border tax. ""The whole purpose of the North American Free Trade Agreement is to lower barriers, not to raise taxes, and to do so would defeat the very purpose of the agreement,"" she said. **********Mrs. Hills also identified for the first time those sectors of the economy that she thought would be most vulnerable to import competition from Mexico as a result of the free trade pact: glass and some farm products during certain seasons. The American household glass and fruit and vegetable industries are labor-intensive and are already having trouble in competing with imports from Mexico."

Israeli troops fired tear gas to break up some demonstrations and there were clashes between Palestinians and soldiers. **********The celebrations, some said, indicated renewed support for Mr. Arafat, whose leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization has come under criticism from some people in the territories who question his political judgment and style as well as his distance from their daily lives. **********""This was a new referendum for Mr. Arafat,"" said Mohammed Shtayyeh, an economist from the West Bank city of Ramallah and a member of the Palestinian team in the Middle East peace talks. ""What I saw today was a new green light to go ahead with his policy."" **********But while the dominant mood was one of relief, there were also Palestinians who felt no grief when they first learned that the airplane that was carrying Mr. Arafat from the Sudan to Libya was missing and assumed that the P.L.O. chairman was dead. They saw it as an unexpected opportunity for new leadership to emerge, a feeling that was especially conspicuous in the Gaza Strip, where the Hamas group of Islamic fundamentalists is a strong rival to Mr. Arafat's Fatah faction. **********In East Jerusalem, too, some said that it was time for a change. **********""I wanted him to be gone,"" said a resident of the working-class neighborhood of Wadi al Joz. ""He is an unsuitable person for his position. There are better people than him."" **********Not surprisingly, Israeli leaders were unlikely to have grieved at Mr. Arafat's death, even though some say they worry that whoever comes next may prove to be even more unacceptable from their viewpoint. **********Speaking to reporters before word came that Mr. Arafat was alive, Defense Minister Moshe Arens said, ""If it turns out that he is dead, I don't think that anyone in Israel is going to mourn."" **********""He has headed a murderous organization for years that bears responsibility for the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people,"" said Mr. Arens, who was visiting an area in southern Lebanon where two Israeli soldiers were killed earlier this week by Shiite guerrillas.  Marches in West Bank **********But on most Arab streets, the news that Mr. Arafat had survived the plane emergency was greeted by shouts of joy and a din of horn honking. Hundreds of people marched through a main shopping street of East Jerusalem, where many handed out pieces of candy or tossed them in the air as a celebratory gesture. **********Among them was Faisal al-Husseini, the Palestinian leader in East Jerusalem, who said that ""all the Palestinians feel happy."" **********Similar demonstrations took place in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but there were clashes between marchers and Israeli soldiers. Battles were fought in several Gaza locations, and a dozen people were wounded when soldiers fired on them. In Ramallah, Israeli troops fired tear gas to disperse several hundred students. Later, the city, along with the neighboring town of Al Bireh, were put under curfew. **********Some Palestinians who saw Mr. Arafat as having been strengthened by the airplane episode said they did not think he would enjoy the benefits for long. In particular, opponents said the need for a broader leadership had been underlined. **********""It gave us a good lesson that we can't worship personalities, that we need a new leadership to grow so there are natural successors,"" said Ali Jiddah, who is aligned with the militant Progressive Front for the Liberation of Palestine. **********Still, Mr. Jiddah said that even he, as an Arafat opponent, was glad that the P.L.O. Chairman had survived. **********""At the end of the day,"" he said, ""we're all in the same boat."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/23/business/the-media-business-multicultural-ad-agency-aims-to-join-mainstream.html,Karen Stabiner,1992-11-23,,941,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Multicultural Ad Agency Aims to Join Mainstream,THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Multicultural Ad Agency Aims to Join Mainstream," **********It sounds like a high-concept situation comedy -- an advertising agency run by a black entrepreneur, an Asian journalist and a Colombian would-be opera singer. Lots of jokes based on idiomatic misunderstandings, like the partner who declares ""right off"" when he agrees with someone. Endless opportunities for trouble with clients, like the time the printer dropped a line of type from a transit billboard for Pacific Bell and then pasted the Chinese characters back on upside down. **********But J. Melvin Muse, chairman of Muse Cordero Chen Inc. here, is dead serious. Mr. Muse, known as Jo, David Chen and Mavis Cordero founded what he calls a ""multicultural, ethnically diverse"" agency six years ago, and in that time have lifted their billings to $25 million from less than $2 million. Their half-dozen clients include Nike Inc. and the American Honda Motor Company. Going Mainstream **********Now, Muse Cordero Chen is ready to go mainstream, and one look at the arithmetic of ethnic diversity explains why: Nike and Honda account for almost 75 percent of the agency's billings. In contrast, Rubin Postaer and Associates of Santa Monica bills $127.6 million for its work for Honda, while Nike spends an estimated $223.3 million on advertising. Its general account is handled by Weiden & Kennedy of Portland. **********As the singer Paul Simon has observed, one man's ceiling is another man's floor. Although ethnic spending has held steady in the midst of a recession, it's a tiny part of the whole. **********""There's a reluctance,"" Mr. Muse said, with a rueful grin, ""to cut budgets that are already so low."" And ethnic advertising is in danger of disappearing as a separate discipline. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Quaker Oats have shut ethnic marketing groups, not because they don't care about minority-group consumers but because those buyers are a growing part of the general market. **********So Muse Cordero Chen wants to cross over. In the last two months, the agency has pitched two mainstream accounts, losing both times. But it recently was named one of five finalists, from an original field of 10 agencies, that on Dec. 7 will pitch the $7 million Smith's Food and Drug Centers account. A 'Natural Progression' **********Mr. Muse considers the move a ""natural progression"" in a society that is increasingly more diverse. Sixty percent of the population of Los Angeles is made up of minority-group members; by the year 2000, almost a third of this country's population will be black, Asian or Hispanic. **********""Nobody argues the Spanish influence on Los Angeles,"" he said. ""And after 20 years with an Afro-American mayor, nobody can argue that influence. And don't forget the Asian component. The culture is shifting. And by understanding Los Angeles we naturally can grow to handle larger accounts."" **********Juliet Erickson, president of the Los Angeles office of Rogen Inc., a consulting firm, thinks Muse Cordero Chen has a chance to break through because what it really does is single out consumers, a skill that can be exploited on a larger scale. **********""All the intellectual capital they've built up is that they segment, target and streamline messages,"" she said. ""That's what they're known for, where they're ahead of the game. And whether it's Mexicans, Japanese or toothpaste buyers is irrelevant."" Culture as 'Gripping Dynamic' **********Ms. Erickson believes that consumer-goods companies may have to shift their emphasis from managing brands to managing consumers, to keep up with expanding ethnic markets. ""Mainstream is such an old-fashioned idea,"" she said. Mr. Muse agrees. ""Culture is as gripping a dynamic as economics,"" he said. ""Maybe even more so."" **********Mr. Muse said the reactions from the ad community to his new goal ranged from concern about whether the agency could survive the transition to worry about a potential new competitor. Mr. Muse bristles at the suggestion, however well intentioned, that going after mainstream accounts will hurt his ethnic business. He wonders whether people would ask that question of, say, D'arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, ""which just got the Afro-American portion of the American Express card? Did anyone ask if they were going to lose Sea World because of it? You want ethnic, we do ethnic. You want something else, we do that."" **********Until now Muse Cordero Chen has won most of its accounts through what Muse calls ""strategic alliances,"" associations with agencies that eventually led to a chunk of budget being allocated for ethnic advertising. The agency says it is not yet very good at a traditional pitch. No Words Minced **********""We stunk up the room,"" was Mr. Muse's curt appraisal of the agency's performance at a recent Family Bargain Centers pitch. He credits staff changes and several rehearsal sessions with an improved performance in the preliminary round of the Smith's Food and Drug effort. **********At the same time, the agency recently persuaded Nike that it could reach a broader audience. **********One print ad encourages black youngsters to pursue a variety of goals, warning, ""Life preys on one-dimensional players."" The ad ran in Ebony, Black Enterprise and several other magazines. Scott Bedbury, Nike's director of advertising, said the company wasso sure the ad would have a general appeal that it was revising its spring media plan and hoped to run the ad in Sports Illustrated. **********""Where the country is heading is toward more culturally intelligent communications,"" he said. ""You have to find ways to bring along a lot of people at one time. It's not a melting pot. It's a mixed salad. And you have to appreciate all the distinct elements."""

Summit Meeting Called **********""We in Britain have got our own choice to make,"" Michael Spicer, a Conservative Party critic of the treaty, said tonight. ""We cannot rely on the French to make the choice for us."" **********Critics of European union in both the Conservative and the rival Labor parties also pressed the Government tonight to put their case for the treaty before voters in a referendum, just as in France. **********Speaking tonight, Mr. Major repeated his support for the treaty as good for Britain and Europe. Mr. Major, now serving as President of the European Commission, a revolving post, also called a summit meeting of European Community leaders for early next month, presumably in London. **********The debate over the treaty will be joined in earnest on Thursday, when Parliament reconvenes in a special session for an emergency debate on the economy. It is not clear, however, when the treaty will come before the House of Commons for ratification. **********Mr. Major also said tonight that he was uncertain when he would reopen debate in Parliament, because he is waiting to see if European leaders can persuade Denmark to reconsider its rejection of the treaty. Danes voted it down in a referendum last spring. **********All 12 member nations of the European Community must ratify the treaty, a blueprint for closer political and economic cooperation, if it is to take effect. **********The rebellion over Europe could further imperil the political leadership of Mr. Major, who is already under fire for his embarrassing reversal of policy last week, when he abandoned efforts to preserve the value of the struggling British pound in the European monetary system. The pound has since dropped sharply in value. **********Treaty opponents say about 100 backbenchers - nearly a third of the party's strength in Commons - will join their movement. **********Opponents of European integration in Britain were emboldened over the weekend by what they described as growing signs of public doubt here. **********A poll of 1,063 voters appearing today in The Independent on Sunday, a British newspaper, showed a 2-to-1 margin against the treaty. Forty-seven percent said they would vote against the treaty, if given the chance in a referendum, and only 24 percent said they would vote yes. Twenty-nine percent were undecided. **********Critics were also cheered Saturday by the return to the battlefield of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a longtime skeptic on European integration. **********On Saturday, in a speech delivered in Washington, Mrs. Thatcher called for a halt to what she described as the ""European gravy train,"" and restated her explicit opposition to the treaty, which Mr. Major and other European leaders signed this year in Maastricht, the Netherlands. **********Trying to exploit the growing rift in Conservative ranks, Gordon Brown, the Labor Party spokesman on economic affairs, warned darkly that the Tories were ""lurching into a new anti-Europeanism."" **********But the Labor leadership faces a rebellion of its own. Bryan Gould, one of the party's top officials, has urged the Labor leadership to let the British people decide for themselves about European union in a referendum. **********There was some good news today for Mr. Major and Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Two public opinion samplings published in London newspapers showed that two-thirds of British voters favored the Prime Minister's staying in office. Slightly more voters were in favor of Mr. Lamont's staying on than favored his resigning."

Chrysler, which acquired the American Motors Corporation and its Jeep operations in 1987, had been building about 12 Comanches a day. The Toledo plant now makes about 720 Cherokee sport-utility vehicles a day. **********The Comanche is a pickup truck version of the Cherokee.

He said he was not surprised by the projection, in light of the number of lawyers needing to get up to speed and the debtor's stinginess with certain financial information. ""You've got three different countries and a different set of creditors in each entity,"" he said. ""At this juncture, it probably is about as expensive a proposition as I can imagine."" **********Since Canada does not have the well-developed market or legal framework that exists in the United States to provide bankrupt entities with fresh loans as they work out their debts, Olympia & York has to depend on its current lenders to approve any restructuring and possibly to pick up the tab for it. **********And because the creditors whose collateral is rock-solid have little incentive to go along with a restructuring plan, Olympia & York will be expected to pay administrative costs out of assets it owns that were not covered by the formal insolvency filing in Canada before turning to creditors for the balance. ""Creditors are saying they don't want to pay it,"" Mr. Sharpe said. List to Be Submitted Soon **********As a result, he and Olympia & York's other lawyers huddled yesterday with various creditors to give them a preview of a partial list of its holdings -- ranging from aircraft to undeveloped land to marketable securities -- that it planned to make public in court on Wednesday. Such assets, which Mr. Sharpe estimated were worth ""tens of millions of dollars,"" could be used to cover the costs of a restructuring for several months. **********James E. Fordyce, a partner with the law firm of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt in Toronto, who represents Credit Lyonnais, a creditor, said he did not quibble with Mr. Sharpe's overall estimate, although he said it would take the creditors a while to discern the assets' true value. **********Even if the overall portfolio turns out to be insufficient to pick up the entire tab, his client is not expected to protest as much as some creditors over sharing the costs of a restructuring. ""We're on record as favoring a restructuring, and I guess along with that position goes the acceptance that a restructuring will take some money to do,"" he said."

Getting the Right Mix on R.& D."," **********WHEN he takes office next month, President-elect Bill Clinton will have the opportunity to remake science and technology policy so it can better serve the competitive needs of the nation. He will also have the opportunity to redefine the relationship between universities -- possibly our greatest economic assets for the competitive challenges of the future -- corporate laboratories and the military. Such changes could greatly enhance productivity, manufacturing prowess and, ultimately, our standard of living. **********In the United States, government and industry together spend about $150 billion a year on research and development covering everything from mapping the human genome to exploring the frontiers of physics. That is about 3 percent of gross domestic product, about the same percentage that Japan and Germany spend. **********But unlike Germany and Japan, which devote almost all of their research spending to civilian projects, the United States spends about 40 percent of its research and development budget on military projects. And of the Federal research and development budget, the military absorbs a full 60 percent. While such heavy military-related spending may have been proper during the height of the cold war, it is far too high now. **********To shape the nation's science and technology efforts, Mr. Clinton needs to approach his policy from an entirely new perspective. Several things need to be kept in mind: *********** Commercializing technology is industry's responsibility. Mr. Clinton's first impulse may be to set up Federal programs to help companies collaborate with universities. But industry already has complete access to university research. John A. Armstrong, vice president for science and technology at the International Business Machines Corporation, contends that the problem is industry itself. What companies need are incentives for lengthening their investment time frame to convert nascent technologies into products. And what universities need is more Federal investment to repair their decaying research infrastructure. *********** A well-trained work force is required to make technology pay off for the country. Compared with the Germans and Japanese, most Americans are not adequately trained in technology before they join the work force. That puts our companies at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. Mr. Clinton must stick to his campaign promise of improving worker training and restoring the American educational system to world leadership. *********** More attention needs to be paid to civilian research. Reverse the priorities and spend 60 percent of the Federal research budget on civilian research and 40 percent on the military. Mr. Clinton should phase in the shift over four years so scientists can transfer from military jobs to civilian ones. American cannot afford to put its best brains out of work -- the way the Russians did -- by changing the research mix too abruptly. *********** Tax credits for research and development are vital and should be made permanent. More investment in high technology is urgently needed, as John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc., said at Mr. Clinton's recent economic conference in Little Rock, Ark. One way to encourage such investment is to assure industry that it will not lose its tax benefits before its projects pay off. *********** A civilian counterpart to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would be beneficial. Darpa is responsible for keeping America's military contractors at the forefront of technology. A civilian counterpart would do the same for America's commercial industries by administering grants to promising new technologies. But to protect the Federal investment in new technology, the Clinton Administration ought to control the foreign sale of patent rights and licenses. *********** The nation's military laboratories can still serve an important function. Instead of shutting many of them down, convert them to civilian use. The laboratories in Livermore, Calif.; Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Albuquerque, N.M., and Los Alamos, N.M., employ thousands of the best scientific and engineering minds. They developed much of America's arsenal -- everything from nuclear weapons to advanced electronics and laser-guided missiles. Much of their research prowess can be directed toward commercial applications. IN addition, Mr. Clinton should urge universities to offer a new research degree for science and technology. In the United States, students can get a master's degree, which is suitable for those who want to teach high school science, or a doctorate, which is suitable for those who want a university career. That leaves industry's needs at least partially unmet. **********What is needed is a research degree especially suited for work in industrial laboratories. The new degree would require two years of research, including six months of an industrial internship. It would produce a new group of scientists whose training and orientation would enable them to take fruits of civilian basic research and bring them to market. **********Making America a more competitive nation will take time. But the intellectual resources to do it are here. What is needed are intelligent policies to put those resources to work."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/04/business/business-technology-an-egalitarian-approach-gains-in-computing.html,,1992-11-04,,1198,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,An Egalitarian Approach Gains in Computing,BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; An Egalitarian Approach Gains in Computing," **********A leading producer of computer networking systems for small businesses received a vote of confidence last week that it could probably have done without. The Microsoft Corporation entered its market. **********Artisoft Inc., tiny but profitable, has seen its once high-flying shares lose more than half their market value since Microsoft's plans became known this summer. And last Tuesday, when Microsoft formally announced its new software, shares of Artisoft took an additional hit, dropping 75 cents, to $14, in over-the-counter trading. **********But Jack Schoof, Artisoft's 34-year-old founder, chairman and chief executive, gamely puts a positive spin on this state of affairs. ""It's a great opportunity to buy our stock,"" he said. Artisoft shares rose 25 cents today, closing at $15 each. **********Artisoft, founded in 1982 in Tucson, Ariz., has for the last five years been the leader in a lucrative niche market: software that lets businesses with a few, or few hundred, workers set up desktop-computer networks that are cheaper and simpler than the sophisticated systems operated by larger corporations. **********For its first quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, Artisoft had a 64 percent rise in profits, to $3.6 million, compared with last year's first quarter. Sales were up 52 percent, to $22.1 million. Those results were a continuation of the growth in the fiscal year that ended June 30, in which sales rose 79 percent, to $73.2 million, and profits more than doubled, to $13.2 million, or 76 cents a share. **********Artisoft's specialty is so-called peer-to-peer networks of personal computers. As their name implies, these networks are based on sharing among desktop equals. Far more common are hierarchical systems known as client-server networks. The leading client-server network software, called Netware, is sold by the Novell Corporation. **********On a client-server network, resources like data base files or services like electronic mail reside on a centralized computer, the server, which is called upon by other computers, the clients. On a peer-to-peer network, by contrast, any computer can be a client, a server, or both. **********Netware Lite, a peer-to-peer product introduced last year by Novell, has not made a significant impact on Artisoft, but analysts said that was because the product was weak. **********Microsoft, despite being the dominant software company in the personal computer business, was not successful in an earlier offering for the networking market, a client-server system call LAN Manager. But that product is based on I.B.M.'s OS/2 PC operating system, a market that Microsoft has largely abandoned in favor of its wildly popular Microsoft Windows operating system. A peer-to-peer networking product based on Windows is a potentially powerful market force. Control Is an Issue **********Proponents of peer-to-peer networking say it is more true to the spirit of the personal computer revolution because it places control in the hands of the individual rather than in some centralized computer bureaucracy. They say client-server computing is a legacy of the old mainframe computing model, where all data and computing power resided in the central machine, with users relegated to ""dumb"" terminals. **********""People want control of the desktops, their data and their destiny,"" said Artisoft's Mr. Schoof (pronounced Shoaf), whose Lantastic program remains the most popular peer-to-peer networking system. More than a million machines are currently attached to one Lantastic network or another, and Artisoft says an additional 100,000 machines are being placed on Lantastic networks each quarter. **********Counting the $299 adapter card needed for each computer on a Lantastic network, and the $99 software fee that covers up to 300 users, a typical five-computer network might cost the customer about $1,600. If a user wanted to set up a client-server Netware network of comparable size, the cost could easily be twice that -- not counting the probable need to hire a consultant to set up the network and the expense of having an expert on hand to keep it running. **********""The point of peer-to-peer is you can choose how your business works,"" Mr. Schoof said. ""Client-server forces you, as mainframes and minicomputers did, to put all your eggs in one basket."" 'Simplicity and Cost' **********Besides its lower costs, the chief advantage of a peer-to-peer network is that it does not require the services of a professional networking specialist to install or maintain. ""It comes down to two words: simplicity and cost,"" said Mary Modahl, director of network strategy research at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. . **********But Darrell Miller, Novell's executive vice president, said peer-to-peer became awkward in large installations, and was really best for small companies or ad hoc work groups within larger businesses. Even though Novell is seeking to enhance its peer-to-peer product, Netware Lite, by increasing its capabilities for portable computers, the company still regards it as only a small part of its overall business. **********But Microsoft considers peer-to-peer an important element in its market strategy. In introducing Windows for Workgroups last week, Microsoft said it would be available immediately in seven languages worldwide. Priced from $99 to $849 in various combinations of hardware and software, it will also be available pre-installed from at least 40 computer manufacturers. **********Windows for Workgroups is an extension of Microsoft's popular Windows computer control program, and adds networking services like the ability to share data base files and printers. Analysts expect the new program to rapidly surpass Windows 3.1 as the standard version for personal computers on networks. Currently, users of the 3.1 version of Windows must also use Lantastic or another network operating system to share files. **********In networking, ""you can either get easy and small, like Lantastic, or big and powerful but complicated, like Netware,"" said Richard Tong, Microsoft's director of Windows marketing. ""We want to make it both easy and powerful -- let customers start easy and small and then grow."" **********Windows for Workgroups presupposes that the networkng customer becomes a Windows user. But as Mr. Schoof likes to point out, of the 100 million personal computers in the world, about 70 percent are older machines that cannot run Windows.  Problems With Older Models **********Windows for Workgroups can accommodate computers that use Microsoft's older and far more pervasive operating system, MS-DOS. But in such setups, the older machines can act only as clients, not as servers, defeating the architectural purpose of a peer-to-peer network. What is more, the DOS-based machines must be outfitted with an add-on program called Workgroup Connection, which eats up substantial memory. **********Windows for Workgroups is ""a good product, but it's totally biased toward Windows,"" said Adrian King, a former engineer and executive with Microsoft and Artisoft, and the author of the book ""Running Lantastic."" **********""Microsoft is really betting on being able to continue the growth of the Windows market,"" Mr. King said. ""It's a good bet. It's what Microsoft should do.

""But for a lot of people who are very active here, it's not something that's a complete surprise."" **********Tungsram continued to advertise ""for a brighter world,"" in newspapers and on billboards this week, but as of Monday most of the operations at 10 of Tungsram's 11 Hungarian plants were suspended for two to five weeks, and workers were sent home with 80 percent of their salaries. **********The company announced a 90-day moratorium on new investments in the venture. Tungsram's chief executive, George Varga, predicted that G.E. would cut by half its planned $40 million investment this year. **********Mr. Varga, a Hungarian emigre who had risen through G.E.'s ranks and won the coveted job of nurturing the infant joint venture, attributed its losses to the combination of 30 percent annual inflation and small devaluations of the Hungarian currency, the forint: 1.9 percent in mid-March, following devaluations of 5.8 percent in November 1991 and 15 percent in January 1991. The company's loss last year came despite a rise in sales of 16 percent. **********""Since 75 to 80 percent of Tungsram's products end up in the most competitive markets, in the United States and Western Europe, if costs in Hungary multiply 90 percent in three years, then it is logical that the profit margin should fall,"" Mr. Varga said. He added that ""the East European market has practically disappeared."" **********The Central Statistical Office reported that as of February the annual inflation rate had fallen to 25.8 percent, from 33.2 percent a year earlier. Government Criticized **********At a recent news conference, Mr. Varga lashed out at the Hungarian Government. ""I understand that the Government's first priority is the fight against inflation,"" he said. ""But I am convinced that in such a time of recession a tight monetary policy hardly serves the interests of industry,"" he said. **********The daily newspaper Nepszabadsag quoted him this week as having said, ""I think it is fatal to have the Finance Ministry be the ruler in economic policy."" **********Mr. Boone commented, ""G.E. has built up so much good will through their investment here, I think they feel they should be listened to."" Mr. Varga is reported to be frustrated that in three years he has been unable to get Hungary's Prime Minister, Jozsef Antall, to receive G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., even for a courtesy visit. Finance Ministry officials declined to comment on the matter today. **********""Economically and politically, the first priority is inflation,"" said Maria Zita Petschnig, senior scholar at the Monetary Research Institute. ""You can't solve unemployment in the short term, but you can achieve something with inflation."" Motivations Questioned **********Dr. Petschnig questioned Tungsram's real motivations in suspending operations at the plant, saying that while the forint was overvalued, this was a less significant factor in companies' economic well-being than their markets, for example. **********""Maybe Tungsram is being used as a Trojan horse for domestic enterprise lobbyists,"" she ventured. ""A lot of people are threatened with unemployment, but there's no direct social pressure."" **********Similarly, Laszlo Lang, an economist, suggested, ""If a company with G.E.'s backing can't sustain its market, it may go back to reasons other than an overvalued currency."" **********He added, ""Even with an overvalued currency, some Hungarian companies have been cashing some good export receipts in the past two years."" **********Mr. Lang described G.E.'s purchase of its share in Tungsram as a ""strategic buyout,"" to get a well-known brand in the regional market. ""Perhaps some in G.E. are wondering if it was worth the price just to get a trademark,"" he said. **********It is still too early to tell whether Tungsram's problems will have an effect on the flow of other Western investments into Hungary. Mr. Boone said, ""Companies currently considering investments may analyze some of the risk factors more closely."" **********When G.E. purchased its share of the business for $150 million in 1989, the Tungsram joint venture inherited a manufacturing operation that was overstaffed, like most state-owned enterprises in Eastern Europe. Minimal Layoffs **********Mr. Varga's team opted for a ""soft"" approach, offering early retirement options to about 4,000 employees instead of laying off workers. **********""We've gone down over 5,000 in two years, but with only 400 real layoffs,"" said Jim R. Conheady, Tungsram's vice president for organization and personnel development, said last month. Now Mr. Varga is pointing to more drastic moves. **********""We are planning about a 25 percent cutback in personnel, which first of all will affect the approximately 1,000 people in administration,"" he told Nepszabadsag. **********Union officials at the plant said they understood the motivations for suspending operations. Still, they are nervous about the future. **********Gyorgy Selmeczy, head of the Tungsram Workers' Independent Trade Union, said: ""On the positive side, it looks as if the enterprise will survive. But every one of the employees wonders which of us will end up on the street next."""

The company's worldwide sales rose by 6.6 percent, to $3.35 billion. **********But J.& J. said its American pharmaceutical sales declined by 1.5 percent, with pharmacy sales of oral contraceptives down by 4 percent in January and February. The company has about 45 percent of the $1 billion American market for oral contraceptives. **********The other company, the SmithKline Beecham Corporation, said its profits rose by 12.2 percent, while its worldwide sales were up by 9 percent, to $2.09 billion. SmithKline's American drug sales dropped by 2 percent. **********Share prices for several pharmaceutical companies declined yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Johnson & Johnson's was down $2.125, closing at $90.875. SmithKline's American depository receipts closed at $70.375, down $1.75. **********Details of the two companies' reports follow: Johnson & Johnson **********Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., said its profits rose to $464 million, or $1.39 a share, from $418 million, or $1.25 a share, in the first quarter of 1991. **********Ralph S. Larsen, the chairman, said the strenth of the dollar against foreign currencies reduced J.& J. sales by two percentage points. He said overseas drug sales increased by 12.8 percent, led by Eprex, an anti-anemia drug; Prepulsid, a gastrointestinal treatment, and Sopranox, an antifungal product. **********Robert M. Goldman, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said increased sales of lower-priced generic oral contraceptives probably contributed to the decline in the company's Ortho contraceptive line. **********Another concern, he said, was that quarterly sales of Johnson & Johnson's laparoscopic instruments for ""less-invasive surgery"" declined from the fourth quarter of 1991. Meanwhile, he said, the sales of the other main laparoscopic instrument maker, the United States Surgical Corporation, were increasing. SmithKline Beecham **********SmithKline Beecham, with headquarters in London and Philadelphia, said its net income rose to $311 million, or 23 cents a share, from $277 million, or 21 cents a share. **********The company said sales of the ulcer treatment Tagamet were up by 2 percent, buoyed by a 9 percent increase in its United States sales. It said the sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic, dropped in comparison with the first quarter of 1991, when wholesalers were building inventories. **********""This industry is slowing down a bit,"" said Marc O. Mayer of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. He said investors would watch closely to see if the company's American drug sales recover in the second quarter."

But modern culture is about money, too, not to mention politics, and as in Soho and Tribeca in New York, the artists of St. Petersburg, Russia's ""window on the West,"" are enveloped in a feud over property. **********The edifice in question is an enormous, decaying Rococo apartment building of eight stairways, three courtyards and about 162,000 square feet of space, now divided into some 170 apartments and offices. Superbly situated at 10 Pushkin Street, just off the grandeur of Nevsky Prospekt, no one -- even the most artistic person -- has any confusion about the worth of the 1877 structure, even in this period when the ruble has only a notional value. **********Three years ago, the building was emptied for a major renovation, the inhabitants banished, in the Russian style, to new apartments on the city's outskirts -- save three residents who simply refused to go. The city hired a firm called Okhrana, or Guard, to discourage looters attracted to the fine woodwork, decorative moldings and copper pipes. **********A few artists who had worked independently, without benefit of the official Union of Artists, got in touch with a friend in Okhrana, who let them live in the building to help guard it. The idea caught on, and the building became a squatters' home for artists, many of them dissidents. **********Today, about 150 artists, actors and musicians have studios here, many of them squatting and paying a nominal rent of 20 rubles a month, or less than 20 cents. There are some 30 commercial offices, too. **********Around them, the building decays. The stairwells are painted with slogans and nicknames; the electric wiring hangs loose; many windows are cracked or broken. But repair is paralyzed because of a feud, become vicious, between two groups that once cooperated in securing the right to work there. **********Sergei V. Kovalsky, 43 years old, and Yuli A. Rybakov, 46, are old friends and fine artists who head a non-profit foundation called ""Free Culture."" Mr. Rybakov, a city councilor, helped obtain city approval for an ambitious plan to renovate the whole building and devote a third of it to a cultural center, which would include St. Petersburg's first museum of contemporary art and a floor of studios for artists. The city, however, retains ownership. A Very Russian Struggle **********But a rival group, ""The Cultural/ Commercial Center -- Pushkinskaya 10,"" is challenging them for the building, arguing its case both in city offices and the courts. Consisting of the merchants and some of the artists in the building, this group has put up some money and formed a shareholding company. In return for ownership, they promise a renovation with bank financing, including 100,000 square feet of studio space, half of it to be provided at no charge. **********In the meantime, the Free Culture Foundation has cut off the telephones of its rivals, and feelings run high. **********Barbara Hazard, an American artist close to Free Culture, said the battle ""all seems very Russian -- an exaggeration of feeling, people taking sides and then having nothing to do with one another."" **********Mr. Kovalsky agrees. ""The situation is quite typical of everything in Russia now,"" he said. ""As soon as one group offers an idea and is ready to implement it, another springs up to force an alternative."" **********Mr. Rybakov, the city councilor, said: ""It's typical also of our politics now, with the privatization starting in real estate and trade. And all kinds of fishy people are in the water."" **********Mr. Rybakov was born in a prison camp, where his parents were placed by Stalin. As an adult, he himself spent nearly seven years in a camp, until 1982, for theft. In fact he had stolen a military radio to listen to Western stations.  Ninotchka vs. Mickey Mouse **********Judging from one of its leaders, Larisa V. Ulitina, the Cultural/Commercial group is certainly the harder-nosed of the two. Mrs. Ulitina is director of Gallery 10-10, in Apartment 10 of 10 Pushkin St., which used to show the art of Mr. Kovalsky, Mr. Rybakov and their friends. All had worked together to obtain rights to the building. **********Now her group is trying to nullify the city's deal with Free Culture. And the foundation has cut off the gallery's phone. **********An elegant figure with a stylish haircut and suit, softened by a lavender cashmere sweater, Mrs. Ulitina has the forceful air of a Soho gallery owner, down to her American cigarettes. **********""Of course there's personal animosity now,"" she said matter of factly. ""There's a feeling of betrayal."" **********Mrs. Ulitina then tapped out another cigarette. ""I'm just sorry about the time and the energy that could have been used for something productive,"" she said, blowing some smoke and then waving it away, Ninotchka-style, with her hand. **********Mr. Kovalsky and Mr. Rybakov, who still hold the upper hand, refuse to be too nasty about Mrs. Ulitina. Mr. Kovalsky points to one of his newest pictures, which features a Mickey Mouse with a blue, prisonlike pallor and the slogan: ""You are not in Chicago."""

The most vivid was Mr. Bush's collapse at a state dinner, but there was also the much-criticized performance of his traveling companions, the highly paid chief executives of Detroit's Big Three auto makers facing off against their more modestly compensated Japanese counterparts. **********In the ensuing nine months the ""action plans"" adopted during the visit have yielded mixed results. While sales of the Big Three's cars in Japan seem unchanged this year, American auto-parts makers have said that they are encouraged by a tremendous increase in the number of inquiries from Japanese makers, particularly Toyota. **********Moreover, the number of American-made cars shipped to Japan is rising -- though not the cars Mr. Bush had in mind when he began the visit-turned-trade mission here. Most are Japanese-name cars produced in the North American plants of Japan's biggest auto companies and shipped back to Japanese consumers. Honda seems likely to sell more than 20,000 American-made Accords in Japan this year, and Toyota said recently that it would sell 700 American-made Camrys a month in the Japanese market. **********""Legally, Japanese-badged cars made in America contribute to the goal in the action plan,"" said an American official dealing with Japanese trade issues. ""But politically, they don't contribute much."" **********Indeed, the symbolic centerpiece of the effort was expected to be an arrangement between General Motors and Toyota that would have given G.M. access to the largest car sales network in Japan. Earlier, Toyota officials had talked of selling 5,000 G.M. cars a year. **********But this week Tatsuro Toyoda, the company's president, said that ""talks with G.M. regarding the sales of G.M. cars have not made progress."" **********Mr. Toyoda, a member of the firm's founding family, blamed G.M. for backing away from the effort in recent months because it did not want to undercut Yanase & Company, the importing agent it has used in Japan for 70 years. **********""In consideration for the company,"" Mr. Toyoda was quoted by Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily, as saying, ""G.M. is avoiding establishing another sales channel."" But he said that Toyota still remained interested in ""helping any way we can"" and noted that it had put on a large exhibition of G.M. cars in Tokyo this summer. **********A spokesman for General Motors' Asian headquarters here, David G. Bodkin, said today that ""the discussions haven't stopped,"" but acknowledged that G.M. did not want to undercut Yanase. **********""We are similar to the Japanese, and we value our long-term relationships,"" he said. Though it has been criticized in the past for not selling General Motors cars aggressively enough, Yanase has recently shown new signs of life: it will soon import Opels, made by G.M.'s European subsidiary. **********Still, G.M. estimates that its sales in Japan this year will be about what they were last year, hovering around 10,000, a tiny sliver of a market of more than 7 million new cars a year.  Mr. Bodkin did say, however, that the company expected about a 10 percent increase in sales of car parts here, a business that has grown rapidly for a decade. Japan Has Its Own Problems **********Even if the General Motors-Toyota sales effort had gone ahead, it was highly doubtful that the American car makers would have seen the kind of advances Mr. Bush and Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, talked about in January. **********Sales of all cars and trucks in Japan are down more than 6 percent, an effect of the enormous slowdown in the Japanese economy and a new conservatism among once free-spending Japanese consumers. Unless those figures change dramatically, which seems unlikely, this year will mark the first time since the end of World War II that Japanese car sales decreased for two consecutive years. **********There are some signs of progress, however. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation is reportedly talking to Chrysler about selling the American company's new LH models here. Ford, meanwhile, has purchased a larger share of its distributor here, Autorama, and seems to be paving the way for greater exports to Japan. **********And all three of the American car makers have vowed to make the change that most embarrassed the President's aides: the failure of the Big Three to manufacture right-hand drive vehicles for export to Japan, where motorists drive on the left of the road."

Even those with a little bit of strength have lost the will to walk 100 yards to a feeding station. **********Dr. Walid Musa, a Sudanese physician with the United Nations Development Program, spent 14 days here last month, trying to save the starving. ""There is a very high probability they will die,"" he said, ""because of the ad hoc service and the lack of continuity."" A Fragile Bond Is Broken **********In Somalia, the United Nations relies on agencies like CARE to do the hands-on work -- cooking and distributing food, attending to the sick, organizing burials -- while it is supposed to provide support and logistical help. But this partnership fell apart in Bardera this week, Dr. Musa said, and it is fragile in other parts of Somalia's famine zone. **********The private organizations are unwilling to stay unless the United Nations is in place giving such support -- and preferably, providing troops to protect the aid workers. The United Nations, in turn, does not have the people to staff Bardera full-time. And although aid groups have had workers in Bardera for three months, the situation is worse than ever. **********Almost a month ago, the United Nations announced a 100-day plan, costing $83 million, to get more supplies to Somalia. But so far the plan appears to be falling well short of its target, especially here, officials said. **********The private agencies and the United Nations agree that the main shortcoming is the world organization's inability to provide on-the-ground support -- like payments to local security forces and trucking services, which would allow the private groups to distribute food and provide medical care. **********About 4,000 people have died in Bardera's camp of twig huts in the last 24 days from lack of food and rampant disease, including a recent outbreak of typhoid, doctors said. The survivors are drinking filthy river water. Chased Out by Gunfire **********Remaining United Nations and CARE employees left here on Wednesday after shots were fired onto the airstrip where food is delivered. No one was hit during the incident, nor were any planes damaged. **********Bardera, 220 miles southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, has probably suffered more than most other Somali outposts from the clan-based warfare that has devastated the country since Gen. Mohammed Siad Barre was overthrown in January 1991 after 21 years as President. **********On Oct. 13, the town was stormed by fighters of Mohammed Siad Hersi Morgan, General Siad Barre's son-in-law and a former Somali Defense Minister. General Aidid's troops fled. **********Mr. Morgan's fighters have been fortified by illegal shipments of arms from the Government of neighboring Kenya in defiance of a United Nations embargo on arms exports to Somalia, Western diplomats in Kenya say. **********There was little fighting in the takeover of the town, United Nations officials said, but General Aidid moved his forces 40 to 60 miles away and has threatened to take the town back, making aid workers nervous. **********Staff members from CARE, who had been working in Bardera, were evacuated the day Mr. Morgan's troops took over. About half a dozen CARE and Unicef workers returned on Oct. 29, and cooked rations for the hungry. **********Even though there was no fighting going on, the workers said they were unsure of the security situation and refused to stay overnight. They flew in during the morning and out in the afternoon, commuting this way for a week. Then CARE protested that security was insufficient even for these day trips. Martyrs Die, Not Help **********""Our people are useless as martyrs,"" said E. K. Krishnan, the agency's director for Somalia. ""If they die, they are of no use to anyone. We are not there for heroics."" **********Dr. Musa, who is deputy chief of the United Nations Development Program in Somalia and has been involved in Somali operations since August 1991, said the United Nations must improve its efforts and provide services like security, political contacts and transportation. **********Without such help, he said, the private groups were intimidated by demands from Somali factions. Even when the United Nations has persuaded a private agency to manage relief work, as it had done with CARE in Bardera, there have been problems, Dr. Musa said. **********After arriving in Bardera on Oct. 15, two days after CARE and Unicef left, he said he was shocked to find a population on its last legs and hundreds of bodies littering the dirt paths of town. Dr. Musa stayed for 14 days and was joined in the last five days by three nurses loaned to Unicef by the Swedish Relief Agency. **********As the days wore on, he said he was perplexed to find people who had supposedly been helped for two months yet were in such appalling condition. **********About 500 tons of wheat had been airlifted by the United Nations World Food Program to CARE in Bardera between August and Oct. 13, he related, yet the people looked as though they had received nothing. Vital Food Is Diverted **********""My assumption is that 80 percent of the population was severely malnourished,"" Dr. Musa said. ""Obviously the food was not reaching the target population."" **********He said it was clear that the food had been diverted by the sub-clan of General Aidid, who controlled the town until Oct. 13, but that CARE did not complain prominently about it and that the United Nations had failed to monitor the situation. **********A Belgian physician, Dr. Willy Janssen, medical coordinator of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who has been in Bardera overseeing the opening of a Red Cross operation here, said he agreed with Dr. Musa's assessment. **********""The kind of malnutrition you see here, this does not happen in three weeks, it happens over a long period of time,"" Dr. Janssen said. ""If you read the reports of what was supposed to be happening here -- supplementary feeding, distributions -- it looks very impressive on paper. But in actuality, it looks as though humanitarian help comes here for the first time now."" **********Dr. Janssen said the hungry at the camp for displaced persons told him in interviews that they had not received food. **********He was appalled to see that children 7 to 10 years old, who usually have enough vitality even when starving to reach for food, just lay prostrate and refused to eat. **********""It was as though the children had switched on the off button themselves,"" Dr. Janssen said. **********A spokesman for CARE, Rick Grant, said in an interview from Mogadishu that the airlifted wheat had been handed by CARE to relief committees in Bardera and surrounding villages. At the time, these committees were controlled by General Aidid's forces. **********The two physicians surmise that the food had been diverted. **********Mr. Grant said: ""There was no one to monitor and no way to know honestly where it went. It is one gigantic question mark where the food went and who got it."" **********Dr. Janssen also said that wheat was not the right kind of grain for people in such desperate straits as those in Bardera. ""This is not complete enough,"" he said. ""You need proteins, oil, if you want the people to catch up."" **********Khalil Dale, a nurse from Scotland with the Red Cross, said he had organized the gravediggers into four teams and arranged burial sites. Until now, some of the bodies had been lowered into the riverbanks, he said, resulting in further pollution of the already unhealthy water."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/business/market-place-portuguese-bank-shows-strength.html,Michael Quint,1992-06-29,,898,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; Portuguese Bank Shows Strength,Market Place; Portuguese Bank Shows Strength," **********If an American banker could start with a clean slate and a new bank, the result might resemble Banco Comercial Portugues, a Lisbon-based bank that is only seven years old, but already in the top tier of Portugal's banks. **********Banco Comercial's success and future prospects were intriguing enough that it was able to raise $108.5 million of equity earlier this month by selling new shares to foreign investors, most of them American, through securities dealers led by Merrill Lynch & Company. The shares, issued in American depository receipts, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and closed Friday at $15.625, up 12.5 cents on the day and 18.5 cents higher than the public offering price of $15.44. **********Unlike its older and larger Portuguese rivals, the bank has the luxury of entering only those parts of the banking business where it sees the greatest profit potential, because the Government does not own any of its shares. **********After starting in 1986 with two groups focusing on medium-sized companies and wealthy but not super-rich people, the bank expanded in 1989 to include a banking group for the richest individuals, a corporate bank for the 500 largest Portuguese companies and a branch network called Nova Rede for middle-income individuals. This year, the bank began catering to small busineses. **********Each of the six business groups operates as an independent company with its own offices and managers. They all share a centralized computer system that is expected to be large enough to give the bank room for years of growth. **********""Our strategy has been to segment our market, which allows for more specialization and higher quality service to all parts of the business,"" said Jorge Goncalves, chief executive, said in an interview in New York through an interpreter. In the decentralized organization, lending decisions for all small-business loans and about half the medium-sized business loans are handled by branch officials, with only the largest loans referred to headquarters for approval. **********The Nova Rede system, which relies heavily on an American-designed computer system, uses branches that offer mutual fund sales and insurance, as well as the normal bank deposit and loan products, with only two to six employees per branch. Banco Comercial claims to be the first and largest user of telephone marketing and direct mail in Portugal. As a result, it has accumulated a large customer base without the expense of its competitors' archaic branch systems. **********""We did not want a consumer banking business like other banks' that operated at a loss and had to be subsidized by other parts of the business,"" said Christopher de Beck, managing director. This logic is a reason, he added, that the bank has chosen to avoid the poorest half of the Portuguese market, which does not like electronic banking, although that is the least expensive way of serving it. **********Since 1987, when it completed its first year of operations with a profit equal to about $13 million, the bank has remained solidly profitable, despite heavy investments for its 240 branches, 3,500 employees and the equivalent in Portuguese escudos of nearly $9 billion in assets. Loans grew to $3.8 billion at the end of 1991 from $282.2 million in 1987. **********In banking, such rapid growth is often a warning of problems to come. Senior managers of the bank insist that they have avoided the pitfalls and note that while the bank is new, it started with a cadre of experienced lenders. About 2 percent of the bank's loans were nonperforming at the end of 1991, or only slightly less than the 2.2 percent average for similar-sized American banks. **********Last year, the bank's profit of $135.3 million was the equivalent of 16.9 percent return on shareholders equity, compared with the average of 13.2 percent for American banking companies of similar size, and its profit of $1.90 for every $100 of assets was more than twice as high as the American average of 89 cents. **********Since much of the heavy investment in computers and other expenses needed for expansion has already been made, the bank says, its profits should be higher in coming years. Even with the heavy investment needed for Nova Rede in 1991, Banco Comercial's noninterest expenses amounted to only 63.8 percent of net interest income and other income, about normal for similar-sized American banks.

On the Lisbon exchange, where its stock is the most actively traded, Banco Comercial's recent price is less than half the peak set in late 1989.

They feel bad enough already. **********Nothing, of course, can match the shock of losing one's job. The body blow to self-esteem, as well as financial well-being, that comes with being laid off is nearly always traumatic. But handing out the pink slips can take a toll, too. **********Just ask three executives involved in the process at Nynex, the telephone company in White Plains, N.Y., that is in the throes of layoffs that will affect nearly 3,400 people over the next two years. Donald J. Sacco, the executive whose name goes out on every Nynex layoff notice, felt a stabbing pain when he saw friends' names on the ""at risk"" list. Daniel C. Petri, who has had to personally deliver bad news to his staff, can't help recalling the outrage he felt when he was almost laid off at another company years ago. And Christine A. Killorin, whose husband was recently laid off, has spent sleepless nights worrying about having to inform some of her staffers that they must go. **********Winnie Downes, an executive vice president at Lee Hecht Harrison, the New York consultants advising Nynex on the layoff process, warned the company's executives that they would feel this way. Despite elaborate business plans and personnel evaluations that take place before an execution, executives still feel wrenching pain, said Ms. Downes. ""We told them, 'Don't bottle up your emotions,' "" she said. ""This is going to be tough for you, too."" **********People being told they are losing their jobs are likely to be angry or numb and may even try to bargain with their boss or appeal to a more senior supervisor. To ease the tension for both managers and employees, Ms. Downes told executives, it is important not to be drawn into such behavior. **********Don't say, ""I know how you feel,"" because you really don't and the remark could sound patronizing, according to Ms. Downes. Don't say, ""They're making me do it;"" that's shirking responsibility. Above all, she advises, don't say, ""It's a blessing in disguise,"" because it is belittling. **********What to do? Empathize, but underscore that the layoff is an irreversible fact of life that would be best dealt with by planning or getting some career counseling. **********That this is untraveled territory for the phone company only makes matters worse. Unlike General Motors and other companies accustomed to huge cyclical hirings and firings, a job at the telephone company was supposed to be good for life. **********All that changed, of course, with the 1984 breakup of the Bell system. Nynex, the parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone, had special problems. In the early 1970's, it hired a bumper crop of young employees to cope with economic expansion in New York State and, particularly, the explosion in demand for telephones by Wall Street and the booming banking business. **********Twenty years later, Nynex finds itself with thousands of employees in their mid-40's -- too young to retire but too expensive to keep. In recent years, Nynex has asked four times for volunteers to retire early and four times not enough people did so. ""We looked at the numbers and asked ourselves was there any other way of doing it, and there just wasn't,"" said Mr. Sacco, Nynex's vice president for human resources. **********In November, Nynex took a $550 million charge against earnings, 70 percent of it for work force reduction costs like severance packages. It was by far the largest such charge for the Baby Bells. **********The month before, Nynex executives had worked out a ""position analysis,"" laying out how much work needed to be done and, later, a ""people analysis,"" laying out who was qualified to do it. The employees most at risk for layoff were told on Jan. 7, the first such date in a vast shrinkage that is likely to last into the mid-1990's, analysts say. **********""You wind up seeing the names of your friends as the ones going to leave the business,"" said Mr. Sacco, whose 350-member staff was reduced by more than 100 positions.  ""It's anguishing for the people let go and for the people who let them go, no matter where you are in the organization chart."" As one of the most senior Nynex officers, the 50-year-old Mr. Sacco did not have to inform anyone personally. **********By contrast, Mr. Petri, New York Telephone's general manager for Midtown Manhattan, had to tell his people personally, a dozen so far in his 220-member staff. ""I never had to lay off anybody,"" said Mr. Petri, who is 43. **********When he was a young aerospace engineer on Long Island, he was threatened with layoff. ""I remember that surge of energy, that feeling you want to fight the system,"" said Mr. Petri. ""If I tell you that you are at risk of losing your job, you don't sit there and doze off. I remember that and I feel that."" After his near-brush with job loss, Mr. Petri left for New York Telephone -- attracted by its job security. **********Reflecting on his recent interviews with employees likely to be laid off, Mr. Petri said, ""I don't have nightmares or bad dreams, but I do take that stuff home with me."" **********Ms. Killorin, New York Telephone's general manager for operator services, has had restless nights. She had to reduce her staff of 330 managers by 17 positions. Her husband, who was laid off last summer, tried to convince her that layoffs were the price paid for a free-market economy. **********Still, she could not sleep. ""That's kind of my way of dealing with problems,"" said Ms. Killorin, who is 40. **********""I've fired people before for cause,"" such as incompetence, she said. ""That wasn't hard because you at least had the conviction that somebody didn't belong in that job. But these were all good people and it was tough dealing with how hard it was."""

Many Angolans were forced to sell their harvests and minimal possessions in Zaire to purchase rides on private trucks. **********In a response to the critical situation in the camp, the United Nations refugee agency organized several airlifts for about 1,200 returnees to their home provinces this week. **********Silva Pedro, 66, who fled Angola in 1975, was one of those flown to his home in Uige province.

But operating income from publishing operations rose 22.8 percent, to $44.7 million from $36.4 million. **********The company attributed the increase to the strength of its nine newspapers, and a spokesman said cost controls played an important role. He noted that in Kansas City, Mo., for example, the company had combined its two newspapers into one last March. **********David Londoner, a media analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, estimated that network earnings were down a third, to about $55 million, in the fourth quarter, and that income from the company's eight television stations was down modestly, as were earnings of its 21 radio stations.

Last Friday was the date promised shareholders in the company's most recent annual report, advanced from January. **********But we all know how things get when business is humming along. ""We've been too busy running the business"" to organize the shareholders' meeting in time to make Friday's deadline, said Christopher O. Werner, chief financial officer at Aqua Buoy. Shareholders, no doubt, are wondering exactly what is keeping management so busy. From a 1992 high of $6.875 on Jan. 15, when new management took over, Aqua Buoy shares had fallen to $2.125 by Friday. And that despite a flurry of cheery news releases. **********Aqua Buoy is a Newport, R.I., company, maker of a wrist bracelet carrying that name that is designed to inflate into a life vest in the event of a water emergency. Consumer Reports once commented that the device was ""slightly better than no life jacket at all."" **********The company was taken public by Joseph Pignatiello, who was convicted in a penny stock scam and enjoyed a year of Southern hospitality at the Federal prison in Fort Worth, Tex., in 1986 and 1987. In recent weeks, Mr. Pignatiello was slapped with unrelated criminal charges of insider trading, and pleaded not guilty. Through his lawyer, Leonard E. Davies, he declined to comment. **********New management of Aqua Buoy tries to play down the role of Mr. Pignatiello and his wife, Constance, who served as president from July 1990 to last February while her father, a root canal specialist, sat on the board. But 12 percent of the company's shares are still owned by Mrs. Pignatiello and -- despite their official absence in day-to-day matters -- the Pignatiellos still play a curious role in the company, whose disclosure is murky at best. **********Aqua Buoy shareholders were no doubt pleased last month to see that their company had managed to squeak by with a one-cent gain in earnings per share for the year that ended June 30. But the 11 cents per share in earnings was thanks entirely to the benevolence of Mr. and Mrs. Pignatiello, who generously forgave most of a $1.5 million loan to the company -- indeed, just enough to make up for what was actually a loss of $1.1 million for the year. And the loan forgiveness itself perhaps didn't belong in the financial statement for the year ended June 30. The deal was struck on Sept. 30, but Aqua Buoy back-credited the forgiven loan to the June 30 year. **********The operating loss wasn't the only hitch. Management wrote down assets to $15.3 million from a stated $28.2 million on March 31. Rounsevelle W. Schaum, chief executive of Aqua Buoy, is a proponent of more conservative accounting than was previous management, Mr. Werner explained. **********Investors needn't worry, Mr. Werner said, because the story of the incredible shrinking assets began and ended with the writedowns announced Oct. 16. The current $15 million valuation ""truly reflects their value,"" he said. But that is probably little comfort to investors who bought in when Aqua Buoy was touting the spending spree that boosted stated assets to $28.2 million in the first place. **********In the seven months after a former Ladenburg Thalmann investment banker was named to the company's board in May 1991, Aqua Buoy acquired an empty warehouse, a sporting goods company and several bankrupt companies, pushing assets from $461,000 in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1991, to $28 million by the end of last year. All the while, news releases celebrated the fine additions to Aqua Buoy's portfolio. **********The corporate buying binge culminated with the purchase on Jan. 15 of International Yacht Builders, a company run by Mr. Schaum. Though Mr. Schaum became president and chief executive simultaneously with the Jan. 15 purchase, Aqua Buoy managed to avoid any mention of Mrs. Pignatiello's departure in its news releases. It also waited until Aug. 24 to mention in a news release that Mrs. Pignatiello was no longer on the board, though she resigned June 30, according to the 10K form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 16. Or was it on Feb. 17 that she resigned as a director, which is what the 10Q report filed with the S.E.C. on May 11 reported? Shareholders can take their pick. **********Regardless of when she really left the board, between the Jan. 15 date that Mr. Schaum took over and the Aug. 24 news release, Mrs. Pignatiello managed to sell more than 100,000 shares at prices from $5.25 to $6.13 a share. No wonder nobody wanted to remind investors that Mrs. Pignatiello had been out of the company -- and selling stock -- for months before the stock sank to $3.38 the day the release went out. **********Cynical shareholders may say they've had it with their company and its farflung, unreliable businesses, but Mr. Werner assures that great things are yet to come. Being a responsible public company, though, Aqua Buoy can't discuss all the positive developments, he said, ""because we haven't released them to the public."" Asked about Lord Jeff Knitting, one of the many companies Aqua Buoy bought in 1991, Mr. Werner said that the company has not produced any clothing since Aqua Buoy bought it, but that it is a ""corporate goal"" to get it up and running. Though the company's last 10K said that Lord Jeff would be operating by next June, Mr. Werner said, ""I'm not going to project a time"" when that might happen. **********Aqua Buoy recently settled a financial dispute with mortgagors on property owned by Lord Jeff, though it hasn't yet told shareholders about it. The company also is negotiating financial settlements with owners of the retirement hotel it bought in 1991. The owners sued Aqua Buoy alleging fraud, deceit and breach of contract on June 23, and seem to be more amenable to a compromise settlement. But longtime shareholders will know not to hold their breaths for timely news if a deal is struck."

The rules, which were not aggressively enforced for more than a year, limit what doctors in the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled can charge beneficiaries in addition to what Medicare pays. **********The excess charge for 1992 is limited to 20 percent; it will drop to 15 percent next year. The law is intended to curb the custom of some doctors who charge fees far above what Medicare pays. **********Congressional aides who worked on the legislation said they expected nationwide savings under the 20 percent limit would be at least $250 million in 1992. But no one knows exactly what the employers' share will be. Much depends on each company's retiree health plan. Companies that have been paying the most will reap the greatest savings, benefits consultants say. The newly imposed limits and other Medicare payment restrictions will help reduce the enormous costs of medical care for future retirees, which companies face under new corporate accounting rules. **********Richard J. Sinni, health management director with Buck Consultants, said many employers offered ""richer benefits"" than Medicare's. This is especially true for large employers that have union contracts and companies with retirees who started receiving benefits years ago, before senior executives began to worry about retiree medical costs. **********Even with Medicare paying the major bills for those over age 65, employers spent an average of $1,418 each for these retirees in 1990, according to the latest available survey by the A. Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm. **********Robert Eicher, a principal with Foster Higgins, said one large New York-based manufacturing company had planned to spend $12 million for retiree health care this year, up from $10 million in 1991. Under the new rules, he said, the company now expects costs to hold steady at $10 million. **********Potential savings will vary widely around the country. ""They will be much less noticeable in rural and suburban areas than in a place like Manhattan,"" Mr. Eicher added. Doctors' fees in New York -- which reflect high costs for all expenses, from rents to wages for nurses and receptionists -- have long been well above the national average. **********Government officials said that across the country 88 percent of the $31.5 billion that Medicare paid to doctors last year went to physicians who had volunteered to hold their charges to the amounts allowed by the program. In New Jersey, for example, 80 percent of Medicare payments went to doctors who accepted these restraints. In some states (Pennsylvania, for example) it is illegal for doctors' fees to exceed the Medicare charges. But even with the state laws and voluntary agreements, $3.78 billion in physicians' fees were not covered by the restrictions in effect last year. **********A few executives like Richard D. Quinn 3d, benefits planning manager with the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, based in Newark, repeatedly complained to Medicare administrators and members of Congress when most insurers representing the program and doctors ignored the fee limits that Congress had said would start in January 1991. Some insurers, like the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company of Columbus, Ohio, told doctors in their areas to abide by the ceilings. But Mr. Sinni said ""very few"" insurers had done so. **********Gail Wilensky, a White House health policy aide who formerly headed the Medicare program, said her agency wrote letters explaining the law to 5,000 physicians caught ""overbilling"" in 1991. But only a few weeks ago did the agency order the insurance companies that process Medicare payments to include the information in the official explanations of charges that are sent to Medicare beneficiaries. **********Doug Smith, a spokesman for Pennsylvania Blue Shield, which handles Medicare claims in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, said his organization would be sending out explanations of the fee limits by the end of this month. Starting in July, Medicare doctor bills will be monitored, he said. ""If they are going way over the limiting charge, we will go back to the doctor and say, 'Wait a minute,' "" he added. The explanations will again be revised next January, and then the beneficiary ""will actually see the overcharge, if any,"" Mr. Smith said. **********Medicare go-betweens like Pennsylvania Blue Shield have been told to keep doctors informed and be ready to make payment adjustments in special circumstances. **********Mr. Smith said Pennsylvania Blue Shield had already sent ""a couple hundred"" letters noting overcharges to New Jersey doctors this year. He said most cases had been resolved as misunderstandings, and some money was ""even refunded."" **********In a Feb. 27 letter, Medicare said the insurance companies would not have the legal power to demand refunds. But it said the insurers would have the authority to refer physicians to Medicare for administrative sanctions, including fines and even removal from the Medicare program."

""The more money we spend the less money we make, and at the same time the customer is not being served."" **********Using NCR's new self-service terminals, he said, the bank will now be able to offer all banking services, including contact with mortgage specialists and loan officers, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Moreover, the bank will be able to reach customers at many more locations, like supermarkets or at branches when they are closed. **********The technology that makes the new service possible has been developed jointly by A.T.&T. and Compression Laboratories, a Silicon Valley, Calif., maker of a work station or telephone-based video conferencing system. Mr. Randle said that within several years it would be possible for bank customers with video telephones to call the bank directly from thier home or office. **********The A.T.&T. compression technology presents an image that generates 10 to 15 frames a second, meaning that motion is slightly jerky but almost as clear as a television picture. **********The new terminals permit customers to review their accounts and get additional information on bank products and rates."

""There's more positive than negative news."" **********""It's a long-term feeling; it's here to stay,"" he added, noting that holiday sales grew 12 to 15 percent from last year. **********Tulsa, where unemployment is below 6 percent, is way ahead of the rest of the country in spirits and spending, but there are other signs that Americans in virtually every region are feeling better about the economy. **********One example: sales of existing homes -- the kind that represent most of the buying and selling in the residential real estate market -- leaped last month to the fastest pace since the mid-1980's, an annual rate of nearly 3.9 million single-family houses and apartments. Home sales were up 3.7 percent in the still depressed Northeast and 3.8 percent in the West. **********The magnitude of the December spurt in confidence surprised almost everyone, including Fabian Linden, who is in charge of the Conference Board's 5,000-household survey and has watched past November surges in the wake of Presidential elections fade after a month or two. **********""It would have been natural to expect some erosion in December,"" said Chris Probyn, an economic forecaster at Data Resources/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. ""What happened is that expectations about the future just kept heading higher."" **********""People feel the Democrats are going to provide the answer for the economy,"" he added. ""Confidence should stabilize now, but it will be vulnerable if policy gridlock develops in Washington."" **********Indeed, consumers in the survey were only mildly more upbeat than two months ago about current economic conditions, especially in the job market. Those who said jobs are scarce, for example, outnumbered by a huge margin those who found them abundant. **********By contrast, consumers are a lot more hopeful that conditions will improve in the next six months or so. Expectations, as measured by one component of the Conference Board index, have jumped 34 points, to more than 100, since October. **********Despite bad news on military and computer industry layoffs, 21.7 percent of households, compared with 13.5 percent in October, thought more jobs would be available six months hence, outnumbering those who thought fewer jobs would be available. Meanwhile, the job-market pessimists shrank from one quarter to one-sixth of the respondents. **********The better mood suggests that consumers will keep spending, though hardly at the rapid pace of the last six months. Based on October and November Government data and anecdotal reports from retailers, spending probably grew at an annual rate after inflation of more than 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter. It rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in the summer. **********""You'll still see decent spending gains at a 2 to 3 percent annual rate,"" said Deborah Johnson, an economist at C. J. Lawrence & Company. **********The pace of spending is likely to settle down, simply because it has lately outstripped the growth of both jobs and wages and because Americans' savings rate is already low. **********""You can only grow consumption faster than income for a short period of time,"" said Mr. Probyn of DRI/ McGraw Hill. ""If the malaise in the job market continues, confidence will be vulnerable."" Weak Job Growth **********Though unemployment has declined to 7.2 percent, job growth has been extraordinarily weak by the standard of past economic recoveries. Like other forecasters, DRI/McGraw Hill does not expect the economy to grow fast enough to whittle away quickly at the jobless rate. ""We're projecting growth, on average, of around 2.7 percent a year, and that's consistent with a very, very gradual downtrend in the unemployment rate,"" he said. **********Retailers track confidence surveys closely for clues about spending trends. The Conference Board measure, which correctly signaled a temporary slump in spending a year ago, has not tracked this year's stop-and-go pattern in shopping very well. **********One reason for thinking that the survey is picking up real improvement, however, is that the Conference Board report is consistent with the latest reading, for December, from the generally less volatile University of Michigan survey. The Michigan survey registered a substantial 5.7- point gain in December, after an advance of 12 points in November. More important, the Michigan index, which reached 91 points, is back within the range it registered during most of the long, strong 1980's expansion."

When that happens, stocks that the broker is promoting can abruptly plunge. **********That lesson was driven home again on Friday, when the S.E.C. went to court to seek an injunction against Stratton Oakmont Inc., a Lake Success, L.I., brokerage firm. In documents filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the commission charged that Stratton had defrauded customers by manipulating stock prices and misrepresenting the merits and risks of the penny stocks it promoted, and that it had exaggerated the firm's professional experience in dealings with the public. **********The firm, in a statement released late Friday, said it planned to ""vigorously defend itself"" against the S.E.C.'s allegations and would fight any move to freeze its assets. It emphasized that it was still in business and would continue to make markets in over-the-counter securities. ""These charges are nothing more than a rehash of stale allegations,"" the firm said. ""Stratton Oakmont has thousands of customers who are very supportive."" **********Notwithstanding that, the stocks for which Stratton was the primary market maker plunged in price on Friday, losing an average of 31 percent on extremely heavy volume. **********Shares of Ropak Laboratories, a longtime Stratton recommendation, fell $1.25, to a bid of $2.875.  Licon International, one of the firm's earliest underwritings, dropped $1.625, to a bid of $2.125.  Another stock promoted by Stratton, Healthcare Imaging Services, dropped $2.50, to a bid price of $4.50. **********In addition, the units of Nutrition Management Services declined $2.375, to a bid of $5.50; IPS Health Care fell 62.5 cents a share, to a bid of $2.875 a share, and Repossession Auction dropped $1.25, to a bid of $3.875. **********The S.E.C. had been investigating Stratton for more than a year, according to various prospectuses filed by companies whose stock sales were underwritten by the firm. But the firm continued to grow, employing more than 130 brokers and 100 broker-trainees -- a sales force that the S.E.C. charges was largely inexperienced. **********In a complaint filed with the court, regulators charged that the young brokers who worked at Stratton were schooled in the use of ""abusive and high-pressure sales techniques to overcome all conceivable customer objections"" to buying Stratton's stocks. **********Richard H. Walker, the regional administrator for the S.E.C., said on Friday that in addition to fines and other penalties, the commission would seek to recover a minimum of $11 million in ""ill-gotten"" trading profits from the firm and its principals. Those gains relate specifically to profits the firm reaped by selling shares of Nova Capital. **********The S.E.C. has charged that Stratton made exaggerated and phony claims about the company's prospects to push the stock, instructing its brokers in May 1990 to assert that the company's shares, then trading for about $7, were sure to double. **********The brokers, according to the S.E.C. filings, said the company was about to get the same management that had led another company, known as Visual Equities, to soar to more than $120 a share from $6 in the early 1980's. In fact, the S.E.C. says, Visual Equities had never traded for more than $6.50 a share. **********What the brokers did not say, according to the S.E.C., was that ""Nova had no revenues, negative earnings, limited operations and net assets of only approximately $2.3 million."" That works out to less than $1 a share. **********Nova is in many ways a classic penny stock, replete with conflicts of interest and a dizzying array of transactions between the company and its controlling shareholder. In 1991, the old management of Visual Equities did indeed take over Nova, as promised by the Stratton brokers, and Nova's name was changed to Visual Equities. **********The principal assets of the new company are works of art. Some were bought at auctions, including its best-known acquisition, a rare original copy of the Declaration of Independence, for which it paid $2.4 million last year. But most of its artworks were purchased from Alvin Abrams, who was both the original underwriter for the company and is now its controlling shareholder. **********During the most recent fiscal year, for which the company reported revenues of $931,800, 83 percent of its revenues came from the sale of artworks to Mr. Abrams. The company had originally bought the artworks from him at much lower prices. And after selling the artworks, the company later turned around and bought them back from Mr.  Abrams. **********As with many other companies in which Stratton was the leading market maker, Friday's S.E.C. action brought bad news for Visual Equities shareholders. The bid price fell 75 cents, to $1.50. People who bought at the $7 price that Stratton was pitching have lost 79 percent of their investment."

The company cited a ""severe and prolonged recession"" in its markets. **********The company, based in Uniondale, L.I., said that it would close 15 of its 37 stores and that more than 300 of its 1,300 employees would lose their jobs. **********Yesterday's filing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan results from two trends: an economic downturn that has been particularly hard on retailers, especially in the Northeast, and the continued unwinding of the leveraged buyout spree of the last decade. **********In its filing, the company said it had liabilities of $363.7 million and assets of $141.3 million as of Oct. 31. The Christmas season was unlikely to have improved the situation, since it is generally a slow time for furniture retailers, with few shoppers making such major purchases during the holiday season. **********Seaman is the second Kohlberg, Kravis buyout to file for bankruptcy protection. While Seaman is a relatively small holding in the firm's portfolio, the filing tarnishes Kohlberg, Kravis's reputation for finding profits in the financial transformation of mundane companies. In early 1990, the Hillsborough Holdings Corporation, a company formed to acquire Jim Walter, a large building-materials company in Tampa, Fla., also filed for bankruptcy protection. **********Seaman has aimed to sell high volumes of low-priced furniture through the help of its aggressive television advertisements. But it has had a history of problems since it was taken private in 1988 in a $360 million deal. **********In late 1989, Seaman said it could not meet its principal and interest payments. Its senior lenders and bondholders agreed to accept large losses in return for a larger equity position in the company. **********At that time, Kohlberg, Kravis's ownership fell from 80 percent to 37 percent, and the firm's investors had to put in an additional $28 million. The company's banks, led by the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, acquired nearly one-third of the company in return for forgiving more than $100 million in debt and agreeing to defer principal payments until 1992. **********Despite this, the company has been unable to turn a profit while servicing a remaining debt burden of about $310 million. In the first quarter, which ended July 31, 1991, Seaman's reported a net loss of $6.4 million, compared with a net loss of $1.2 million in all of 1990. **********""We want to restructure the company, under the supervision of the court, to a debt level that the business can support,"" said Matthew D. Serra, Seaman's chief executive. ""The reason for the filing is the prolonged downturn in sales. It's been much longer than we've expected. **********Seaman executives calculated yesterday that a more manageable debt burden for the company might be in the neighborhood of $20 million.  Expression of Optimism **********Mr. Serra remained optimistic about Seaman's prospects. He said that the 22 stores to remain open contributed about 80 percent of the company's volume. He added that four of the stores to be shut had already been scheduled to close. With the cutbacks, the company will withdraw entirely from the Philadelphia area. **********Scott M. Sperling, a partner at the Harvard Management Company, which has invested with Kohlberg, Kravis since 1982, said the bankruptcy filing ""isn't good news from the perspective of the value of the Seaman's equity."" But he said the filing was a ""rational and prudent reaction"" to the difficult retailing environment and the company's debt burden. **********""Seaman's obviously had problems because of the amount of debt it took on, and therefore it has been more vulnerable than other retailers might be,"" Mr. Sperling said. **********To support its operations during reorganization, Seaman has obtained a $25 million commitment from the GE Capital Corporation, the financing arm of the General Electric Company. Such loans to a company already in bankruptcy reorganization usually receive priority in repayment. Seaman will use the money to pay suppliers and vendors. ""It will help us run the business in terms of working capital and meeting all our financial needs,"" Mr. Serra said. **********Seaman's largest unsecured creditors include Credit Agricole of France, with $21.9 million; National Westminster Bank of Britain, $18.76 million; First Bank National Association of Minneapolis, $17.5 million; Nippon Credit Bank of Japan, $12.9 million; National Australia Bank Ltd., $7.75 million; town of Islip (L.I.) Industrial Development Agency, $5.5 million, and the Saudi International Bank, $5.169 million."

Fell Short In Predicting the Soviet Collapse,Director Admits C.I.A. Fell Short In Predicting the Soviet Collapse," **********Responding to criticism that the Central Intelligence Agency failed to forecast the collapse of the Soviet system, its director, Robert M. Gates, today conceded shortcomings in the agency's analysis, but defended its overall performance over the years. **********In a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York, Mr. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, said that although the agency wrote many assessments describing a growing crisis in the Soviet Union, it was not until 1989 that agency analysts began ""to think that the entire edifice might well collapse."" **********Mr. Gates also acknowledged that the agency's statistical analysis portrayed a stronger and larger economy than the one that existed in reality. ""From a personal standpoint,"" he added, ""I would contend also that our quantitative analysis always considerably understated the real burden economically of the Soviet military."" **********During his confirmation hearings last fall, Mr. Gates was widely criticized for having promoted a view of an expansionist, invulnerable Soviet Union in more than a dozen speeches and articles between 1986 and 1988, when he was a senior C.I.A. official. The agency was also faulted for exaggerating the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union. **********Adm. Stansfield Turner, who was Director of Central Intelligence from 1977 to 1981, complained in an article last year in the journal Foreign Affairs about ""revisionist rumblings that the C.I.A. did in fact see the Soviet collapse emerging after all."" **********""On this one,"" Admiral Turner added, ""the corporate view missed by a mile."" **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who wrote in 1979 that the Soviet Union would break up in the 1980's, has called for the dissolution of the agency. The Senate and House intelligence committees have introduced bills calling for sweeping reorganization of the entire intelligence apparatus of the Government. **********But Mr. Gates, citing hundreds of assessments, briefings and monographs produced over the last three decades, maintained that the C.I.A. had accurately described the weaknesses of the Soviet Union, including the economic distortion from its extraordinary investment in the military."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/08/business/economic-scene-choreographing-the-deficit-dance.html,Peter Passell,1992-04-08,,801,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Economic Scene; Choreographing The Deficit Dance,Economic Scene; Choreographing The Deficit Dance," **********EVERYBODY knows that a bigger budget deficit would be bad news. **********Everybody, that is, except the 100 heavyweight economists (including six Nobel winners) who last week urged Washington to douse the recession with some old-fashioned Keynesian pump-priming. And Robert D. Reischauer, the widely respected director of the Congressional Budget Office, who last week warned that penny pinching on the deposit-insurance bailout would increase its ultimate cost while adding only cosmetic improvements in deficit finance. **********Confused? Read on at your peril. The rationales for taking the deficit figures with a grain of salt are many and varied. And the very latest contribution to the debate, a clever way of looking at fiscal policy called generational accounting, challenges the very logic behind deficit arithmetic. **********Part of the problem is that deficits are only part of The Problem. Most of those 100 would-be pump-primers worry a lot about the consequences of deficit finance, but worry more about the costs in waiting for the economy to recover on its own. **********Others point out that all deficits are not created equal. An extra billion invested in education to make sure Johnny can read by the time he graduates from junior college is not the same as, say, an extra billion in tax cuts to help families pay their heating bills. In a better world, they say, the Government would keep separate books for capital and current expenses. **********Consider, too, Mr. Reischauer's rationale for taking deposit insurance out of the deficit equation. The half-trillion dollars needed to make good on deposit-insurance claims is real money. In the most immediate macroeconomic sense, though, the transfer from the Treasury to depositors' accounts has no consequence: The cash is unlikely to affect the total demand for goods and services because the depositors receiving the cash never thought they had lost it. **********But none of these qualifications touch the issue addressed in ""Generational Accounting,"" a new book by the Boston University economist Lawrence Kotlikoff. Developed by Mr. Kotlikoff along with Alan Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania and Jagadeesh Gokhale of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, generational accounting is a radically different way of calling fiscal balls and strikes. **********The core objection to deficit spending for consumption today is that it comes at the expense of consumption tomorrow -- that today's taxpayers are racking up bills that future generations will be obliged to pay. Mr. Kotlikoff agrees, but puts a very different spin on the conventional wisdom. **********This year's deficit, he suggests, is only a snapshot of fiscal events in motion. Government spending and taxes -- notably, big-ticket items like Social Security -- create a stream of benefits and an offsetting stream of financial obligations that differ from age group to age group. And what ought to count in measuring generational equity is not who gets what in 1992, but how fiscal policies affect each age group's lifetime balance of benefits and obligations. **********Seen in this light, black often becomes white and white, black. In the 1950's, for example, a period of seeming fiscal prudence, Washington voted to increase Social Security pensions without taxing the likely recipients. Then in the 1980's, a period of apparent fiscal profligacy, Congress stripped down the future pension benefits of workers while dramatically raising their payroll taxes. **********Mr. Kotlikoff would replace static deficit calculations with generational accounts showing how much, in ""present value"" terms, each age group (as well as generations unborn) can expect to pay and expect to receive from government. A sample accounting for the year 1989 shows that 20-year-olds can, on average, expect to be net losers to the tune of some $169,000 over their lifetimes. But 65-year-olds, who have paid most of their lifetime tax bill and are about to receive Social Security, are in the black by $32,000. **********How to measure generational neutrality? One might wish the newly born to pay no more than they get back. Or one might compare the net payment expected from the just-born with the payment from those yet unborn. **********In the 1989 calculation, newborns will shell out $74,000 more in taxes than they can expect in benefits, while the unborn will be left footing a bill of $90,000. The sum of current spending and taxing policies, it seems, favors the mature over the young, and the living over those yet to come. **********A big problem with generational accounting is that much of the benefit stream, such as the flow of services from military defense, is hard to apportion. Mr. Kotlikoff's solution, simply leaving out such intangibles, begs the issue. **********But there is little doubt that generational accounting, especially year-to-year changes in the accounts and changes associated with specific policy decisions, says something important -- something that cannot be captured in the standard deficit arithmetic."

Now, as the chief executive of the Malibu Graphics Publishing Company of Westlake Village, Calif., he is taking on the titans of comics, Marvel and D.C., with all the aggressiveness of a superhero. **********Last week Malibu lured away eight of Marvel's top artists and writers, instantly making the company a far more credible force in the industry. ""With these artists on board, and with the new titles we'll be debuting, we see significant market share growth ahead,"" said the 29-year-old Mr. Rosenberg, who started Malibu in 1986 with three partners. **********The defections came at a bad time for the Marvel Entertainment Group, the comic book world's sales leader. The artists and writers confirmed their departure for Malibu on Tuesday, the same day Marvel's stock plummeted $11.375 a share, to $54.625, after an unrelated but negative article in Barron's. Marvel called the article ""inaccurate and highly misleading"" and sought to play down the loss of the writers and artists to Malibu. **********But the hirings caused considerable celebrating at Malibu, which Mr. Rosenberg said is already fourth in comic book sales behind Marvel, D.C. Comics and Dark Horse. Malibu publishes its books under the names Adventure Comics, Aircel Comics, Eternity Comics and Platinum Editions. **********Mr. Rosenberg said Malibu's new writers and artists include those responsible for five top titles at Marvel: ""Spider-Man,"" ""X-Men,"" ""X-Force,"" ""Uncanny X-Men"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" The first new book for Malibu from the newcomers will be ""Youngblood"" by Rob Liefeld, who had been in charge of ""X-Force"" at Marvel. **********Mr. Rosenberg said he was able to lure the artists and writers from Marvel by promising them their own imprint, to be called Image Comics, and a cut of the profits not just from the comics themselves but also from any licensing or merchandising of their characters. He said the industry was growing rapidly, in part through increasing tie-ins with movies and television shows. Malibu's current titles range from ""I Love Lucy"" to ""Dinosaurs for Hire."" **********""This is the kind of business where I wake up on Monday morning and I'm dying to get to work,"" said Mr. Rosenberg. ""It's just a lot of fun."""

But now, with the country facing economic ruin and increasing violence, there has been a marked surge in hostility toward Washington for its longtime support of President Mobutu's autocratic rule. **********Students and intellectuals have long denounced the United States as a repressive force in Zairian politics, accusing Washington of pressing a cold-war ideology that has helped prop up the Mobutu dictatorship. But amid the growing political turmoil, even Zairians who reject such views are taking a more critical view of the United States. **********""There's no doubt that many people here blame the United States for keeping Mobutu in power for so long,"" said Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of Zaire's biggest opposition party, who served briefly as Prime Minister in October. ""The anti-American sentiment has recently become a lot worse because many people can't understand why the U.S. is still supporting his regime."" **********Zairians say they believe that the United States has the power to remove the President, but is unwilling to. **********President Mobutu has received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States since he came to power in 1965. Over time, public and private American voices were raised against that aid. **********Last November, allegations of a massacre of university students in a major southern city, Lubumbashi, and persistent reports that he amassed a fortune prompted Congress to end all military and economic help. **********Nonetheless, the United States is perceived as President Mobutu's Western backer, which has made life uncomfortable for Americans living in this Central African country. This hostility is directed not just at Americans but at Zairians who are friendly with Americans. **********A Zairian who studied at Stanford University said, ""Even people who have been educated in the U.S. like me have been told things like we're brainwashed, or probably C.I.A. agents, or on the C.I.A.'s payroll."" **********A poll taken by the Zaire Institute of Public Opinion in February found that 73.3 percent of those asked had a poor opinion of American policy toward this country. In contrast, 78.9 percent said they had a good opinion of Belgium, the former colonial ruler. **********American officials said they were hard pressed to explain this, since in recent months, at least publicly, the United States and Belgium have taken virtually the same positions toward the Zairian leader, criticizing him for being unwilling to grant political pluralism he promised in 1990. **********""The difference,"" said a European diplomat, ""is that Belgians have been wrestling with Mobutu for a much longer time, and most people here believe that they truly want to get rid of him. The Americans, on other hand, aren't seen as credible; they're afraid to say publicly what they privately believe, that Mobutu must go."" **********This view has come at a time when the American presence has nearly vanished. Since the State Department warned of danger in Zaire in September, thousands of Americans have left. The few who remain -- fewer than 100 by some estimates -- say they are targets of strident criticism. Many fear that the tension could easily turn violent. **********""It is not the virulence of the stories appearing in the local press that concern me,"" said Melissa Wells, the United States Ambassador, ""but it is the comments of longtime American residents, including many missionaries, who say they have never known this extent of anti-American sentiment. And I hear such comments day after day after day."" **********The anger increased a few weeks ago when Herman J. Cohen, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, met briefly with President Mobutu. Mr. Cohen declined to discuss the meeting, and his silence seems to have released a torrent of pent-up anger and fed conspiracy theories involving the United States. **********Mr. Cohen, though critical of President Mobutu, has said he should stay in office during a transitional period leading to multi-party elections."

The requests, Government experts say, have set off a high-level rift and a policy review within the Government that will probably have to be resolved by the Clinton White House. **********It is a watershed, analysts say, that the Government is even considering permits to sell such high-tech surveillance craft, which can cost a billion dollars and have been cloaked in the highest secrecy ever since their debut 32 years ago. Several people are now in jail just because they leaked information about such satellites or data gathered by them. **********From orbiting, satellite cameras can photograph objects on the ground of enormous interest to military planners, revealing for example the size and location of tanks, troops, ships, missiles and aircraft. Defense and Aggression **********The use of such imagery, experts say, can aid or deter war. A nation peering far beyond its borders from space is less vulnerable to surprise attack. But it can just as easily scout invasion routes and targets. During the cold war, spy satellites were the chief source of targeting directions for the United States' long-range bombers and missiles. **********The satellites are built by private industry, but to export any kind of military equipment, a contractor must first get a Government license. **********Federal experts said last week that Spain, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates have all recently sought spy craft. American defense contractors, eager for such lucrative work as military budgets decline, said in interviews that other Middle Eastern and Asian countries has also expressed interest. **********The disclosure last week of the U.A.E. request, the first public hint of such activity, prompted the State Department to confirm that a sale was under consideration and to add that a broad Federal policy review had been initiated to weigh its merits. **********""We are carefully examining, on an interagency basis, the complex issues involved in such transfers,"" Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said Tuesday. He declined to elaborate or say when the review might be concluded. **********Dr. Hans Mark, a former director of the National Reconnaissance Office at the Pentagon, which develops and operates the nation's spy satellites, said in an interview that the spread of such satellites could ease tensions around the globe by substituting realistic appraisals for military speculation. But he said the United States should pick customers carefully. **********""We need to differentiate between the Irans of the world and the South Koreas,"" Dr. Mark said. ""Any nation that puts a price on the head of an author is not civilized, and our political judgments need to be made in that context."" Fears of Nuclear Risk **********But William E. Burrows, the author of ""Deep Black,"" a book about space espionage, said any sales were ""a terrifically bad idea"" and could raise the risk of nuclear war. **********""Reconnaissance and nuclear missiles go hand in hand,"" he said. ""If we sell this stuff, we'll enable the buyer or anybody who deals with them to do precise targeting. It doesn't have to be a ballistic missile or an atomic bomb to be a dangerous weapon."" **********Federal officials in the departments of State, Commerce and Defense, as well as the nation's intelligence agencies, are said to be deadlocked on whether to approve such sales. **********But one Federal reconnaissance expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he sensed that influential elements of the bureaucracy were leaning toward approval. ""It's going to be pitched in Clinton's lap,"" the expert added. ""It's a big deal that needs to be looked at very carefully."" **********Today only the United States, Russia and China have spy satellites. All three strive to keep the placement and exact power secret so rivals are less likely to be able to evade espionage. The best United States satellites are said to be able to see objects as small as a baseball, although such claims have been disputed. **********Nations now trying to develop such craft are said to include France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Israel and India. But building from scratch can be enormously expensive. It can cost several billion dollars to establish a launch site, build rockets, develop the spacecraft, construct a ground control network, buy the necessary computers and software and maintain a staff of photo interpreters. Spain's 1990 Request **********Spain was apparently the first country to ask the United States for a permit, making its approach in 1990 though an American defense contractor, the Science Applications International Corporation, in San Diego. The company drew up a plan for a relatively small, inexpensive satellite that could be put in place by Pegasus, a 50-foot winged rocket fired from an airplane. **********A company official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the plan was proposed by Madrid's defense and interior ministries. He added that a request for an export license for a photo-reconnaissance satellite went to the State Department but was dropped early this year after Madrid decided budgets were too tight. ""They're still interested but don't have the money right now,"" the official said. **********Gilbert D. Rye, senior vice president for business development at the Orbital Sciences Corporation, which makes the Pegasus and is based in Fairfax, Va., said the international appetite for such sales has only increased since the Spanish initiative. **********Experts say that appetite was whetted by the Persian Gulf war, in which American spy satellites were seen as giving the allied coalition an important edge over Iraq. **********Soon after the war, the United Arab Emirates, a coalition partner, contacted an American defense contractor, Litton Itek Optical Systems, of Lexington, Mass., which makes high-resolution optics for civilian and defense uses, including reconnaissance craft. The U.A.E. asked about buying a satellite, and soon made a formal application to the Washington. As Pentagon Work Dwindles **********""They wanted a feasibility study of a photo-reconnaissance craft,"" said Richard Wollensak, the company's vice president for program development, ""and the United States Government has been debating it ever since."" **********Mr. Wollensak said that his company had laid off about a quarter of its 800 employees as Pentagon work dwindled in recent years and was now ""pursuing new opportunities,"" including foreign sales. He added that the spread of spy satellites was inevitable. **********""There are a lot of countries,"" he said, ""that have that capability: the French, the Russians, the Chinese."" **********He said such proliferation might be a good thing. ""The world community is becoming more relaxed in understanding that surveillance is a nonviolent way to defuse situations,"" he said. **********Strongly at odds with such assessments are Israeli officials, who last week denounced the idea of selling a spy satellite to an Arab country. A Defense Ministry official, quoted anonymously last Thursday by The Jerusalem Post, condemned the United States for refusing to share more reconnaissance with Israel or to help ""in building our own reconnaissance satellite."" **********Now, the official added, ""they are going to supply the Arab countries with binoculars that will enable them to see every military movement here."" **********American experts say Israel has been working on a spy satellite for many years, carrying out its first space experiment in 1988. **********The other country shopping for a spy satellite is South Korea, Government experts said. Unlike the Emirates, however, Seoul has not made an official application for an export license. **********Robert B. Mantel, a State Department spokesman, said he knew of the Spanish proposal but could not confirm South Korea's interest. ""We have one formal request for the export of a photo-reconnaissance satellite,"" the department said in a statement, adding only that ""there have been inquiries in the past from other nations."" **********Though several analysts suggested that blocking spy-satellite sales in Washington would simply send potential customers abroad, Mr. Burrows, the author, called such arguments ""a transparent attempt to make some money"" and said the Federal Government should instead use all its influence to stop proliferation. **********""They should be working out international agreements so nobody will sell this stuff,"" he said, ""rather than competing over who can put the best system on the market."""

She would have been the first woman to hold a senior cabinet post in Bonn. **********Mr. Kinkel's selection came after 36 hours of confusion and maneuvering among Free Democratic Party members. The Free Democrats are junior members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition, and under an agreement among the coalition partners, they choose the Foreign Minister. **********Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who had held the post for 18 years and become a symbol of German diplomacy, unexpectedly resigned Monday. Leaders of the Free Democratic Party quickly named Mrs. Schwaetzer as his successor. Their decision was not well received among party members in Parliament, who have the final say. Tonight, they voted 63 to 25 in favor of Mr. Kinkel. **********Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats, described the meeting as exhausting and said he was ""naturally not especially happy"" with the legislators' rejection of his choice. He said, however, that he would not resign the leadership and that he had urged Mrs. Schwaetzer not to quit as Housing Minister, her current job. **********When news of Mr. Genscher's resignation spread on Monday, many politicians thought that Mr. Kinkel might be named to succeed him. A former head of the German secret service, he has impressed many with his imaginative leadership of the Justice Ministry. Mrs. Schwaetzer, by contrast, was not considered a likely candidate. **********Party leaders, however, had hoped to keep Mr. Kinkel at the Justice Ministry so he could push through important constitutional changes that are to be debated in Parliament this summer. They assumed that their choice of Mrs. Schwaetzer would be routinely ratified. **********Within hours of Mrs. Schwaetzer's nomination, though, discontent began to spread among the Free Democrats in Parliament. Some thought she was too weak for such a vital post, and feared that by naming her, the party would effectively be turning the Foreign Ministry over to Chancellor Kohl. **********""There's a rebellion in the ranks,"" one politician said. ""The party wants someone strong enough and experienced enough to fill Genscher's shoes."" **********Neither Mr. Kinkel nor Mrs. Schwaetzer offered any substantive comment after the vote. His selection was not expected to have any immediate effect on German foreign policy, although Mr. Kinkel is known as an innovative thinker who does not stand by tradition for its own sake. **********As Justice Minister, he has dealt with important and delicate problems, and in the process, become familiar to readers and TV viewers. Mr. Kinkel took the lead in pressing for the return of Erich Honecker, the former East German leader, to face trial here. **********He also scored a success in public negotiations with the terrorist Red Army Faction. In January, he urged the radicals to call off their campaign of bombing and assassination and suggested that if they did so, the Government would offer reciprocal gestures. The faction replied this month that it was ready to renounce violence."

The extension expires at midnight on Friday. **********Paul Verbinnen, a Brooks Brothers spokesman, said the letter's description of the company's proposals were inaccurate but offered no further clarification. He said the company and the union leadership had agreed to carry on their negotiations in private and that the letter must be the work of ""renegade"" members."

'A Very Quick Turnaround' **********While 44 percent of Japanese still say their country will dominate the world economy in the next century, their certainty appears to be ebbing. Only a year ago 53 percent expressed that opinion. **********""It is a very quick turnaround in perceptions,"" Masaru Yoshitomi, a leading Japanese economist and an adviser to the country's Economic Planning Agency, said today. ""People's impressions of the power of the Japanese economy were inflated by the bubble economy,"" he said, using the term Japanese often invoke to describe the country's tremendous expansion in the late 1980's, before it began to burst two years ago. ""More of a sense of reality is setting in,"" he added. **********Plummeting corporate profits, growing bankruptcies and the beginnings of job layoffs in Japan -- all unaccustomed events in the country's remarkable postwar growth -- have left the Japanese pessimistic about their country's prospects for the next few years. **********In the poll, 71 percent of Japanese said the state of their economy was ""fairly bad"" or ""very bad."" Only 6 percent saw reason for hope that things were getting better. **********But old perceptions abroad die hard.  More than half of the Americans polled rated the state of the Japanese economy ""fairly good"" or ""very good,"" evidence that the two countries measure their economic performances by very different yardsticks. **********Thirty-four percent of Americans said the future generation of Japanese would be better off than people today, while only 13 percent of Japanese said they shared that view. Two years ago more than half of Americans said the future generation of Japanese would be better off. **********The results appeared just as Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has come under increasing fire at home for doing too little to spur Japanese economic activity. Over the weekend, the Cabinet approved a budget for the next fiscal year, but critics immediately characterized it as a warmed-over version of past budgets that would do little to revitalize the economy. **********The poll findings were based on nationwide telephone interviews with 1,333 Americans conducted Dec. 7-9, and in-person interviews with 1,357 Japanese throughout Japan conducted Dec. 3-9. Each poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. More Optimistic in U.S. **********In the poll of Americans, 50 percent said the economy would improve with Bill Clinton as President and nearly a third said the economy was ""getting better."" That was an increase in optimism since the end of October, when only 17 percent said the economy was on the upswing. **********As the new Administration prepares to take office in the United States, Japanese are also somewhat more pessimistic than Americans are about relations between the two countries, particularly on trade matters. **********While 77 percent of Americans describe relations between Japan and the United States as ""friendly,"" and 17 percent say they are ""unfriendly,"" Japanese are more closely divided. Fifty-three percent say relations are friendly; 46 percent say they are not. **********The percentage of Japanese who term relations unfriendly has been rising since the Times/CBS News/Tokyo Broadcasting System poll began asking the question in 1985. At that time, only 21 percent of Japanese expressed that view. **********The two countries are far apart on the question of whether Japanese companies are competing unfairly with their American counterparts, or whether the United States is blaming Japan for its own economic problems. Among Americans, 40 percent said competition was unfair, while 49 percent said Japan was being used as a scapegoat. **********But 78 percent of Japanese said they were being blamed by America for problems that were not of their making; only 17 percent said Japanese companies were not competing fairly. A Matter of Respect **********Once again the poll revealed that a majority of Japanese -- this year about 77 percent -- say Americans look down on Japanese. Only 18 percent said Americans respect the Japanese people. **********But the results were very different when the question was asked in reverse: whether Japanese respect Americans. Fifty-eight percent of Japanese said most Japanese do respect the American people, though only 31 percent of Americans share that belief. About 55 percent of Americans said Japanese look down on them, a view shared by 33 percent of Japanese. **********An increasing number of Japanese -- though still a minority of 34 percent -- say their country has a ""responsibility to give military assistance in trouble spots around the world"" when help is sought by the United States or other Western allies. An additional 39 percent say Japan has a responsibility to give financial aid to military peacekeeping efforts around the world. **********Sixty-nine percent of Americans say Japan has a responsibility to provide military aid. **********While participation in United Nations peacekeeping activities is not an issue in the United States, it is a constant subject of debate in Japan. The governing Liberal Democratic Party spent more than a year winning passage of the bill that permitted the deployment of troops to Cambodia, over the objections of those who said the Japanese Constitution bans any use of force overseas. Under Severe Restrictions **********Though troops have now been sent to Cambodia, the first such deployment since the end of World War II, they operate under severe restrictions, forbidden from entering any area of likely conflict. Japan has not contributed personnel to other peacekeeping efforts. **********The poll suggested that Japanese are more cynical than Americans about their central Government. More than two-thirds of Japanese said Japan had more government corruption than did the United States, a view that was doubtless amplified by the latest political scandal here, in which allegations have been made that organized crime had a role in the naming of Noboru Takeshita as Prime Minister in 1987. **********Fifty-three percent of Americans said the United States Government was more corrupt than Tokyo's. HOW THE TWO POLLS WERE CONDUCTED **********The New York Times/CBS News/Tokyo Broadcasting System Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 7 to 9 with 1,333 adults throughout the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, and on personal interviews conducted Dec. 3 to 9 with 1,357 adults throughout Japan. **********In the United States, the sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. **********Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. **********In Japan, the survey was conducted by the Nippon Research Center under supervision of the Tokyo Broadcasting System.  Personal interviews were conducted in communities throughout the country to yield a statistically representative sample of the Japanese public. **********In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults, or all adult Japanese. **********In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the polls. The translation of questions between English and Japanese, for example, can sometimes result in questions that have slightly different meaning in each language."

Mr. Rubic and 56 men stood in a line along the desolate marsh as a Yugoslav Army major played God, with advice from a local Serb named Dusan. **********""Do you know this man?"" the Major asked, shining a light at Mr. Rubic's face. ""Yes I do,"" Dusan replied. ""I know him as a good man."" **********As Mr. Rubic and 19 other men who had been pulled from the line were packed into cars and driven away to begin what became nine months in Serbian prisoner of war camps, the darkness echoed with the sound of machine-gun fire. **********Mr. Rubic, a 59-year-old factory worker, wept today as he recalled the sensation of imminent death. **********""There was a film winding in my head,"" he said, ""from the moment I was born to when I became aware of my presence in the world to that moment when I was put into the line in that swamp, waiting."" Saved, by Bowling Together **********He said he did not know Dusan's full name, only that they had once been on a bowling team together in the years before Serb, Croat and Muslim stopped spending their leisure time together and began to kill one another. **********The men of Vukovar and several other Croatian cities came home this weekend after Serbs and Croats traded about 1,000 prisoners of war from last year's conflict. At a former Yugoslav Army dormitory in Zagreb, the Croats who had been released spoke of daily humiliations, of scant rations and of beatings in their months of captivity. **********Vukovar, the city from which most of them had been captured, has a special place in history of the war between Serbia and Croatia. Croats used the city's resistance as a rallying point, and its final defeat after Serbian artillery pounded its once-beautiful buildings into rubble was a bitter blow. **********Today the ruins of Vukovar are within one of four United Nations-protected areas in Croatia and are patrolled by peacekeepers. It remains effectively under the local control of Serbs, and none of the prisoners who have been released expect to return and rebuild their homes any time soon.  Pleas for Missing Kin **********Among the released prisoners, there was joy today as relatives embraced. But there was also sadness, as those still looking for their missing family members walked from room to room, pasting pictures and written pleas for help on the walls. **********All of the detention centers in which these men had been held were under regular inspections by the International Red Cross, unlike other Serbian camps that have been the focus of world attention in recent days. **********The accounts from these men, however, raise questions about the effectiveness of the Red Cross inspections in preventing abuses. Several said that when they complained to the Red Cross about conditions in the camps, even more intense beatings followed. **********The International Red Cross is responsible for monitoring compliance with the Geneva Conventions on treatment of prisoners of war. Its officials visit detention centers and conduct extensive one-on-one interviews without guards present. But Mr. Rubic said that by looking through peepholes or other means, the guards seemed to know who said what."

The features are a sign that consumers stand to benefit from the growing competition among banks and nonbanks for trustworthy credit risks. G.M.'s card, whose primary mission is to help the auto maker sell cars by building brand loyalty through offering rebates, is likely to take a toll on some smaller players and continue the consolidation under way among credit card companies. In the last five years, the market share of the top 10 card issuers has increased to 51.5 percent from 37 percent. **********Analysts say the G.M. card will also weigh heavily on the beleaguered card operations of American Express, whose premium charge cards and Optima credit card are struggling. **********""American Express is a loser any time any big player comes in offers a card nationally with no fee,"" said Robert B. McKinley, president of RAM Research in Frederick, Md. Borrowing Ideas From Rivals **********The G.M. Mastercard borrows pages from the playbooks of several rivals and goes beyond the card that the GE Capital Corporation announced last week -- a card with discount coupons and rebates from 24 large companies, as well as discounts on General Electric products. **********""It's a whole new face of credit card marketing,"" said David Robertson, president of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif. **********The G.M. card has no annual fee and an adjustable rate of 10.4 percentage points above the prime rate. Currently, that makes its interest rate 16.4 percent, more than 1.5 percentage points below the industry average and the same as the rate on the A.T.& T. card. **********Customers can spend their way to rebates of up to $3,500 on the purchase or lease contract of any new G.M. car or truck except the Saturn models. The 5 percent rebate on most purchases, to a maximum of $500 a year, is cumulative over seven years. If customers transfer the balance on their current cards to G.M., they will receive 5 percent of that amount as a rebate. **********In addition, G.M. has joined forces with Avis, the Marriott hotel chain and MCI Communications. Charges with those companies give card users an additional 5 percent rebate -- a $100 car rental charge with Avis would credit users with a total of $10 toward a rebate on a G.M. vehicle. In addition, there is no cap on these rebates, and more such partners may be named at a later date, G.M. executives said yesterday. **********The G.M. Mastercard will be administered by Household Credit Services, a unit of Household International Inc. of Prospect Heights, Ill., that has grown rapidly in recent years to become the ninth largest issuer of credit cards. Last September, Household helped the Ameritech Corporation issue a Mastercard, making it the first Baby Bell to offer a credit card that can be used for consumer purchases and to pay for telephone calls. **********G.M. executives declined to discuss its financial relationship with Household and its other partners. They did say that Household would administer the card, own the receivables and decide who would get a card. **********General Motors said it was mailing packets to 30 million households. **********The card is an expensive bet for G.M.; analysts have estimated that it will spend roughly $60 million on the advertising campaign that describes a card ""that turns buying power into horsepower, plastic into steel."" **********Wooing new credit card customers costs, on average, more than $50 an account, analysts said. Household and other partners will undoubtedly shoulder some of those costs. Auto Market Share **********G.M. could use any help the card provides. In the last eight months, the auto maker, as well as Honda, Toyota and Nissan, have lost market share in the United States to Ford and Chrysler. Through the first eight months of the year, G.M. had 34.9 percent of the market, down from 35.4 percent a year earlier and down sharply from historic levels of about 45 percent in the early 1980's. **********Some analysts project that G.M. will gain two million to three million card holders in the next year or two. Whether those customers will prove profitable for Household and G.M. is unclear. **********Some industry analysts say the lack of annual fee may attract many poor credit risks. And many people with high incomes who buy new cars frequently also do not carry balances on their card, essentially using them as free credit. **********""G.M. and Household are walking into a shark's mouth,"" said William C. Dunkleberg, dean of Temple University's School of Business and Management and a consultant to the credit card industry."

Many others were said to have died in later years, though the fate of the entire crew of 139 people is not made clear. **********The 416-foot submarine was based on the American Nautilus submarine, displaced 6,000 tons and carried three ballistic missiles with warheads of 1.4 megatons each as well as several nuclear torpedoes, the paper said. But on its maiden voyage, headed for war games in the Atlantic, the reactor blew. **********The crew managed to do emergency repairs and get the submarine to the surface. They were rescued by a Soviet diesel-engine submarine that took them back to base in Polyarny, the newspaper said. It is unclear whether the damaged submarine was salvaged or sank, and the newspaper provided no details on what happened to its missiles. Many Reactors Dumped **********The article was one of a series about the once tightly guarded secrets of the Soviet nuclear forces. The Russians have also revealed recently that many nuclear reactors from submarines have been dumped into international waters, especially off the Arctic island of Novaya Zemlya, and that at least one nuclear submarine was lost, off the coast of Norway in 1989. **********The United States Navy, so far as is known, has lost two nuclear-powered submarines, the Thresher in 1963 in the North Atlantic and the Scorpion in 1968 in the Azores, and has dumped one reactor, that of the Seawolf, in 1959."

The Bush Administration's proposed 1993 budget calls for a further increase of 4 percent, to more than $1.1 billion. **********Its self-confidence is evident, too, in statements by its managers, who now describe their work as ""public diplomacy."" **********Michael D. Schneider, the U.S.I.A.'s deputy associate director for policy and programs, said that during the cold war, ""there were a lot of issues that were dormant."" Satisfying Demand in the East **********""We are doing more in areas that relate to democracy building and privatization of the economy,"" he said. ""In the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe, they are desperate for expertise on the theory of constitutions, administrative law, setting up open elections, how to deal with environmental issues in a democracy, the role of press, citizen involvement, how to advance credit, how to open a business, how to find out what consumers want."" **********The new programs include management workshops for professionals in formerly Communist countries. Among the most successful is a longstanding visitor program, which brings 2,600 foreign leaders in government, business, science, the press and labor to this country for about a month each year. **********The U.S.I.A. and its broadcasting arm, the Voice of America, had their origins in the Office of War Information and the Foreign Information Service in 1942. **********President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued an executive order in 1953 making the U.S.I.A. an independent agency. Then as now, some of its senior officials were drawn from the C.I.A. Then as now, policy guidance on critical foreign-relations questions was provided by the State Department. **********A former associate director of the agency, Walter R. Roberts, was asked whether the U.S.I.A. ever participated in Government clandestine operations during the cold war. He replied, ""In the mid-1950s, it subsidized certain book programs and did not immediately say it was U.S.I.A. money."" Occasional Help to Friends **********He also said that the agency ""occasionally in the beginning"" provided cover overseas for C.I.A. officers. Except for this, he said, ""U.S.I.A. was always overt."" **********Two other American outlets, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, did have covert origins. They were founded by the C.I.A., in 1949 and 1951 respectively, to broadcast to the Soviet bloc. In 1971 they were placed under the supervision of Congress. **********While the U.S.I.A. maintained a combative stance during the cold war, its anti-Communist edge was blunted or sharpened depending on the inclinations of the director. During President Richard M. Nixon's first term, for example, Frank Shakespeare, as director, insisted on anti-Communist militancy to the point where he came into conflict with Mr. Nixon's plans to negotiate with the Soviet Union and China. He was replaced in 1972. **********When Ronald Reagan was President, the agency gained visibility and a much bigger budget. Under Charles Z.

The opportunity for newly created jobs in a recession-weakened economy was one reason opposition crumbled. Another was the personal diplomacy of Alan Fortunoff. **********Mr. Fortunoff, the 59-year-old president of the chain of houseware and jewelry stores that bears the family name, is the force behind the new mall, and he said last week in a telephone interview that he realized early in the planning that he needed to win over the community. **********""We wanted to have the support of the local groups, rather than just neutralize them or have them in opposition,"" Mr. Fortunoff said. ""We set out to bring them the exact details of the project. We reached out through luncheon groups -- the Chamber of Commerce and the Rotarians. And we reached out to civic associations by organizing barbecues and coffee hours in the homes."" **********Mr. Fortunoff has a long association with Long Island. His mother and father, Max and Clara, started the family business in 1922 with a housewares store in Brooklyn. In 1964, the Fortunoffs followed their customers to Long Island, where they built a store in Westbury. The business now has five stores in the New York area. **********The Westbury store, at the site of the new mall in the heart of Nassau County, will be upgraded to be an anchor along with a new Price Club warehouse store. The 60-acre mall, to be called the Fortunoff Galleria, will expand on what was a vast parking lot for the now-shuttered 172-acre Roosevelt Raceway, which is being developed by others. **********Mr. Fortunoff's original plans for the mall included upscale anchors like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, but these plans were scaled back, which solved many of the zoning tiffs. **********""The biggest issue was density,"" Mr. Fortunoff said. ""We reduced the size of the mall and came back with a project that met the code,"" meaning that no variance was needed. **********The $194 million Galleria, which will be built in two phases, will employ 3,540 full-time workers with a payroll of some $97 million when it is fully finished in 1995."

This reflects the fact that investors are scrambling for alternatives to record-low interest rates in money market funds. Equity-income, utility and, to a lesser extent, option-income funds all produce higher yields than other classes of stock funds. **********The second theme is uncertainty, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. The prices of foreign securities have been falling because of the uncertainty in unstable areas of the world and political issues abroad. The combination of these problems and currency movements have left overseas funds among the year's worst performers. **********Most important for investors in stock funds is to focus on the long term and not to panic merely because of the poor showing in 1992. This year's flat market is not surprising in view of the 30.7 percent gains that stocks funds made on average in 1991."

Yesterday, the news was that Jerry's back and Newsweek's got him. **********Yes, Jerry Della Femina, whose colorful campaigns have delighted and dismayed consumers and competitors since the 1960's, is returning to advertising, five months after leaving his previous agency, Della Femina, McNamee Inc., in a bitter dispute with its French owners. **********The initial client at Mr. Della Femina's new agency, coyly called Jerry Inc., will be Newsweek magazine, which has had its estimated $3 million to $5 million trade and consumer account at John Emmerling Inc. in New York since June 1990. 'Real Thrill' **********""It would be easy to put out a shingle and say 'I'm back,' "" a flu-beset Mr. Della Femina said. ""But to come back with an account like Newsweek, that's the real thrill."" **********Since leaving Della Femina, McNamee in June, the flamboyant Mr. Della Femina has been running an Italian restaurant in East Hampton, L.I., called, in his characteristic flair for self-promotion, Della Femina. He said his first contact on the account had come when a Newsweek executive, dining at his restaurant, gave him her card. **********Mr. Della Femina said he would shortly open an office in Manhattan, most likely within a large agency from which he would draw resources. The usually forthcoming executive declined to discuss the five agencies with which he said he was negotiating, the staff he might hire, his start-up costs or names of potential clients. **********In effect, Jerry Inc. will serve as a creative boutique, offering Mr. Della Femina's brand of advertising typified by aggressive and sometimes confrontational humor **********Among Mr. Della Femina's creations: Joe Isuzu, the prevaricating pitchman for American Isuzu; Meow Mix, a Ralston Purina product billed as ""the cat food cats ask for by name,"" and Fingerman, an anthropomorphic index finger that seals Ziploc plastic storage bags. (Interestingly, for someone awarded a major magazine account, the lion's share of Mr. Della Femina's creative output has been television commercials.) **********Through attention-getting campaigns and a penchant for attracting coverage in gossip and advertising columns, Mr. Della Femina built Della Femina, McNamee into one of America's biggest, best-known agencies. But in recent years, billings plunged as important clients like American Isuzu and Ziploc left. Administrative Duties **********A primary reason for those losses, it appeared, was Mr. Della Femina's disengagement from hands-on creative work in favor of administrative duties. That was exacerbated by frequent feuding with Euro RSCG in Paris, which inherited Della Femina, McNamee from predecessors that bought it in 1986. Relations soured so irreconcilably that in June, Euro RSCG bought out Mr. Della Femina's contract, for a settlement estimated between $1 million and $3 million, and extinguished Della Femina, McNamee, merging it into Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer. **********While Mr. Della Femina disputed interpretations that he had disassociated himself from the creative process, he said that at Jerry Inc., ""I've gotten back to doing what I do, to write and create."" His work for Newsweek, intended to be tougher and more competitive than previous campaigns, will begin running early in 1993. **********Mr. Della Femina's surname is absent from his new agency because a stipulation of his settlement with Euro RSCG bars its use for an agency. **********Asked if his first name would be construed as being part of that prohibition, Mr. Della Femina replied, ""If they're going to say they own 'Jerry,' too, they're going to have a problem with my mom."" **********Another stipulation was that Mr. Della Femina could not hire any employees from Della Femina, McNamee, even if they were dismissed. He said he would abide by that, though it means he cannot hire his brother, Joseph, a copywriter. **********Newsweek selected Jerry Inc. in a review in which four other New York agencies also made presentations: Emmerling, Goldsmith/Jeffrey Inc., Omon New York Ltd. and Christopher Vincent Inc., which produces sales-promotion materials for Newsweek; Vincent affiliated with Ally & Gargano for its presentation. Kirshenbaum & Bond in New York was involved in the review's earlier stages. **********Becoming the first client in Mr. Della Femina's comeback bid was ""a minor factor"" in choosing him, Richard M. Smith, Newsweek's president and editor in chief, said. Rather, Mr. Smith added, it was his unconventionality, which reflects an attitude at Newsweek exemplified by its current campaign by Emmerling, carrying the theme ""Unconventional wisdom."" **********""I like the fact he doesn't take himself too seriously,"" Mr. Smith continued, ""but he takes what he does very seriously."" **********Mr. Della Femina demonstrated that in remarks about Newsweek's rivals in the rough-and-tumble news magazine market, Time and U.S. News & World Report. **********""If they can grow to hate me,"" he said, ""I will have done my job."" **********As for Emmerling, John A. Emmerling, chairman, president and chief executive, attributed the loss of Newsweek's account to ""different management that wanted something different."" In July, Harold Shain, the news weekly's executive vice president and general manager, assumed advertising sales and marketing responsibilities previously handled by Peter Eldredge, executive vice president and publisher, who had hired Mr. Emmerling."

Milken was certain that a kickback scheme involving bond trades that Federal prosecutors accuse him of masterminding would ""pass the smell test"" of securities regulators, provided that each trade was made to ""look legitimate,"" a Government witness testified yesterday. **********The witness, David B. Solomon, testified in Federal court in Manhattan that Mr. Milken had forced him to pay the kickbacks in return for participating in the junk-bond business, which Mr. Milken largely controlled. He said such kickbacks were applied in 1985 and 1986 to dozens of bond transactions between Mr. Solomon's $1 billion investment company and Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street brokerage house. **********It was at Drexel that Mr. Milken created a junk-bond empire that became a multibillion-dollar profit center, only to collapse after becoming embroiled in Wall Street's insider-trading scandals. Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 1990. **********Mr. Solomon's testimony thus far would make it seem that Mr. Milken was on trial. But the defendant is actually Alan E. Rosenthal, one of Mr. Milken's closest aides in Drexel's high-yield, or junk-bond, department. **********Mr. Solomon was granted immunity in exchange for testifying, initially against Mr. Milken and now against Mr. Rosenthal. Mr. Milken, in the hope of gaining a reduction in his 10-year prison sentence, is also to testify against Mr. Rosenthal. **********Mr. Rosenthal is charged with helping Mr. Milken provide a fraudulent $1.6 million tax write-off to Mr. Solomon in 1985 and with aiding in what has been termed a Milken scheme to embezzle from mutual funds controlled by Drexel and Mr. Solomon. **********According to Mr. Solomon, Mr. Milken took kickbacks on bond trades of up to 1 percent to offset fees that Drexel was charging against Mr. Milken's huge junk-bond profits. Mr. Solomon said the victims were the people who invested in the bonds involved in the trades. Referring to Mr. Milken, Mr. Solomon testified, ""He suggested I add a small fraction to the cost of the trades."" He also said Mr. Milken had assured him that the procedure ""would pass the smell test,"" as long as the added charges ""be made to look legitimate."" **********As for saving $1.6 million on his 1985 taxes, Mr. Solomon said Mr. Milken had sold him securities that Mr. Solomon then sold back at a loss as a way to offset his profits. The next year, Mr. Solomon said, Mr. Milken ""arranged"" a profitable trade allowing him to make up the difference."

Manuel Antonio Noriega, who had been indicted in the United States on drug-trafficking charges. **********Still, many Panamanians predict a huge no vote today, one that would amount to a firm rejection of Mr. Endara's Government. The President and aides are widely accused of ignoring Panama's social problems and hesitating to make decisions except under strong prodding from the American Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton. **********Although Panama's economy is expanding rapidly, unemployment remains in double digits in many areas. Many citizens are also dissatisfied with the lawyerly style of Mr. Endara, a sharp departure from the passionate language of past leaders.  59 Changes Proposed **********Voters are to approve or reject with a single yes or no vote a package of 59 changes in the 1972 Constitution, including an amendment prohibiting Panama from having an army. **********The prohibition would be a constitutional recognition of the de facto situation that has existed since United States forces forcibly disbanded the Panamanian Defense Forces and captured their leader, General Noriega.  Since then, Panama has had only a police force. **********But those lined up against the packing, including many who supported General Noriega's ouster, say the Government deserves a no vote regardless of the substance of the changes. **********""We are voting no because the politicians who got into power with our help have turned out to be a total failure,"" said Tomas Herrera, a lawyer who was part of the public campaign against General Noriega and is now part of a group organizing a new political party. **********A poll published Friday suggested that more than a third of the voters were still undecided and that the rest were almost evenly divided. But opponents of the constitutional package seem much more confident of victory than the supporters. Frustration Is Cited **********Even the country's First Vice President, Ricardo Arias Calderon, whose Christian Democratic Party was the main architect of the constitutional proposals in the Legislative Assembly, suggested that a big no vote would signal that ""the majority feel enormously frustrated for what the Government of Endara has not done."" **********Mr. Arias, who has been excluded from executive decision-making since last year after a dispute with the President, said a yes vote would reflect a national consensus on shifting Panamanian politics away from dictatorship."

In the fourth quarter of 1990, income had been reduced by a pretax charge of $264.4 million to pay for the costs of laying off more than 33,000 employees and consolidating some operations. **********The most recent fourth-quarter results also reflect a $35.5 million one-time charge for a change in accounting practices. Revenue climbed 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, to $15.97 billion, from $15.56 billion a year earlier. **********Edward A. Brennan, chairman and chief executive of Sears, said the company outfoxed the recession by eliminating about $600 million in annual expenses from its operations, which had depressed its earnings in 1990. **********For the year, Sears earned $1.28 billion, or $3.17 a share, on revenue of $57.24 billion. Profit was up 42 percent from full-year 1990, when Sears had net income of $902.2 million, or $2.63 a share, on revenue of $55.97 billion. **********Even Sears's beleaguered retail business, which has suffered from weak consumer spending, showed marginal improvement, mostly because of the continued cost cuts. The merchandise group's earnings more than doubled to $289.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $95.6 million in the period a year earlier. **********The retail and financial services company also announced yesterday that it would sell $1 billion of preferred stock and use the proceeds to reduce debt and expand its stock brokerage and credit card businesses, which have been the company's growth vehicles for some time. **********""They had a good rebound on top of a poor 1990 performance,"" said N. Richard Nelson, a retail analyst at Duff & Phelps in Chicago. ""I think it's too early to say Sears has turned the corner, but it's encouraging news."" **********Sales at Sears stores grew marginally to $9.5 billion from $9.44 billion, although sales in stores open more than one year were down. ""The encouraging signs are that the slippage in sales in the merchandise group was less dramatic in the fourth quarter than during the rest of the year,"" Mr. Nelson said, ""and January looks like it will show a pretty good increase."" **********Since Sears's store profits improved almost solely because of the stringent cost-cutting program, analysts say the challenge now is to increase sales. **********""They need to show some top-line growth,"" said Daniel D. Barry, retail analyst at Kidder, Peabody. ""You can only cut so much, and they've pretty much done that."" **********After the fourth-quarter earnings report was released yesterday, Mr. Barry has raised his earnings estimates for Sears by 10 cents, to $4.25 a share for 1992. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Sears shares were down 37.5 cents, to $39.875. **********Income at Sears's Dean Witter financial services group, which includes the Discover credit card, rose 48 percent during the quarter to $83.8 million, compared with $56.8 million in the comparable period last year. The rally on Wall Street and an increase in the number of stores and businesses accepting the Discover card contributed to the unit's strong fourth-quarter earnings. **********Earnings for the Allstate insurance business increased 78.4 percent, to $210.9 million, from $118.2 million in the fourth quarter of 1990. The company attributed the good performance to improved underwriting results and investment income. **********But fourth-quarter earnings at Coldwell Banker, Sears's real estate business, dropped 65.5 percent, to $17.2 million, from $49.9 million during the period a year earlier. The company blamed the weak housing market for the income decline."

In his district in Milan, Mr. Bossi polled 242,500 votes, one of the highest personal tallies in postwar electoral history and the biggest in this election. 'We Are Ready' **********""There are far too many parties in this country,"" Mr. Bossi said. ""No one can govern like this."" **********With almost 9 percent of the vote nationwide and a dominant position in the industrial north, the League could become the deciding voice in any coalition. But many analysts doubt the political experience of the upstart, which lured voters with calls for a federal Italy divided into three zones and an end to sponsorship of the poorer south from the taxes of the wealthier north. **********The election left the ruling coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals with 48.8 percent of the vote, according to final official results. Although the Christian Democrats remained Italy's largest party, their share fell about four percentage points; the share of the Socialists, the other major partner, fell by one percentage point. The Ice Is Very Thin **********""Italians have said 'enough' to the rituals of an aging court that works behind closed doors without heeding the cries of the populace pressing against the palace gate,"" L'Osservatore Romana, the Vatican newspaper, said today in one of the bluntest attacks ever by the Roman Catholic church on the parties that have dominated politics since the fall of Fascism. **********Under a system of proportional representation, election results yielded a leaf-thin majority of parliamentary seats for the parties of the current coalition. But most political leaders said the margin, 15 seats in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies, was simply too slender to withstand the buffeting of Italy's fractious politics. **********""We lost the election,"" said Silvio Lega, deputy leader of the Christian Democrats. Intramural Bickering **********Moreover, the result highlighted rifts among the Christian Democrats, with the party's younger figures demanding changes. ""Italy is no longer willing to accept its old ruling class and its misguided policies,"" said Mario Segni, an influential dissident in the party. **********Mr. Andreotti is under no legal obligation even to consider stepping down until Parliament meets on April 23. In one of his few political responsibilities, President Francesco Cossiga will invite Mr. Andreotti, or someone else, to try to form a government. **********President Cossiga, who left on Tuesday for a visit to the United States, has turned his largely ceremonial office into a platform for attacks on veteran politicians, once calling Parliament a group of ""zombies"" and tilting frequently against Mr. Andreotti, his former ally in the Christian Democrats. **********The reason there is no clear alternative is that the 51 percent of the vote won by the opposition is split among an array of political groups pursuing exclusive agendas. **********Both a hard-line Communist splinter group and the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement, for example, polled about 5 percent of the vote in the Chamber of Deputies. Among the neo-Fascist winners was Alessandra Mussolini, a granddaughter of the late Italian dictator. ""For me it's a victory for the Mussolini family,"" she told reporters. **********In a further sign of disaffection, another statistic that emerged today was that 6 million of the 47.5-million electorate did not vote. The figure represented a drop of nearly 20 percent in the turnout since the last election. **********""Love"" was also among the casualties of the inconclusive vote. A pornography star, Moana Pozzi, failed to win election on the Party of Love ticket, whose platform called for the creation of ""love parks"" and legalized prostitution. Another porn star, Ilona Staller (a k a Cicciolina), who was elected in 1987, withdrew her candidacy before the election. **********""This was a victory for the party of hate,"" Miss Pozzi said.

Yeltsin of Russia said today that politics made it untimely for him to hand over disputed Pacific islands to Japan, and he complained that Tokyo was putting inappropriate pressure on him to do so. **********After Mr. Yeltsin's meeting today with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, Russian officials said that the President had ""12 variants"" for a possible settlement to discuss in Tokyo during his Sept. 13-16 summit meeting, but that the Japanese position seemed not to have changed. **********Japan has been demanding nothing less than full recognition of Japanese sovereignty over the islands. Refusal by Japan to change its position led to an impasse on the issue when Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Tokyo early last year. **********Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, said Mr. Yeltsin had refused to discuss the disputed islands with Mr. Watanabe, apparently to keep some sense of suspense about his visit. **********Russia is eager for Western and Japanese investment, especially in Siberia and along the Pacific Coast, but Japan has refused significant economic aid to Russia until the issue of the islands' sovereignty is settled. Issue Blocks Peace Treaty **********The dispute over the four small islands off Hokkaido at the southern end of the Kurile chain, seized by Russian troops in the last days of World War II, has prevented Moscow and Tokyo from signing a peace treaty formally ending that war. **********Mr. Yeltsin came to power promising to resolve the issue. But as his plans for radical economic reform have run into increasing criticism from conservatives and self-described ""national patriots,"" especially in the Russian legislature, it has become more and more difficult for Mr. Yeltsin to be seen to hand over any Russian territory. **********As he waited for Mr. Watanabe today, Mr. Yeltsin conducted an informal poll of some 20 Russian photographers and camera crew members about whether Russia should ""give away"" the islands. **********Opinion was divided among the camera workers, and they quoted Mr. Yeltsin as saying: ""You see, opinions differ. Politically it's not the time for Russia to do this now."" **********After the half-hour meeting, the spokesman for Mr. Yeltsin said he had told Mr. Watanabe that ""Russia and its President cannot decide this problem under any pressure applied by Japan -- economic, political and social, and even psychological."" **********Mr. Yeltsin heard nothing new from the Japanese, Mr. Kostikov said. ""Today's negotiations,"" he said, ""showed no signs of Japan's being ready to adopt a flexible approach toward this problem.""  More Flexible Abroad **********Mr. Yeltsin is always careful to speak strongly for a domestic audience. Once abroad, however, his positions tend to be more flexible. **********The Japanese position is also more shaded than the Russians portray it. In Tokyo last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada told a Yeltsin envoy that Tokyo does not call for the immediate return of the four contested islands -- their Japanese names are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai islets -- but only wants Japanese sovereignty to be recognized. Japan was prepared to be flexible about the timing of any actual return of the islands, Mr. Owada said. **********While refusing direct aid, the Japanese have taken part in international groups giving aid to Russia, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which together drafted a $24 billion package of loans, credit and aid to Russia. **********In their 1951 peace treaty with Japan, the United States and other Allied powers forced Japan to renounce all right and claim to the Kuriles. **********But Tokyo insisted then as now that when it renounced the Kurile Islands it did not mean any of the four in question. The islands control rich fishing grounds, from which Russia last year took one million tons of fish."

The memo was obtained by a consumer group and distributed last week. **********The memo, written on the day the hurricane wrought billions of dollars of damage on South Florida, has been cited by consumer groups as evidence that A.I.G., and perhaps other companies, planned to use the hurricane as an excuse to charge unjustifiable rates. **********The chairman of the New York-based A.I.G., Maurice R. Greenberg, said the meaning of the memo had been taken out of context. It was written by his son, J. W. Greenberg, an executive vice president, and was sent to the company's top executives. **********For years, the senior Mr. Greenberg has argued that premiums charged business customers were inadequate and he said yesterday that the memo simply reiterated the company's longstanding view. **********In another announcement yesterday, State Farm, the company with the largest homeowner and private automobile insurance business in Florida, said its losses from Andrew would total $1.2 billion as a result of more than 110,000 claims. William Sirola, a spokesman for the company, said that State Farm had no immediate plans to raise rates. **********In yesterday's action against A.I.G., the Florida Insurance Commissioner, Tom Gallagher, said he and Florida's Attorney General, Robert A. Butterworth, would investigate whether the company was actually trying to raise prices excessively and whether it was acting in violation of state antitrust laws. **********In any case, a department spokesman added, Mr. Gallagher felt the memo showed a callousness on the part of an executive to the human tragedy taking place in Florida. **********""A.I.G. and all of the other companies who sell commercial, property and auto insurance in Florida better get this message now,"" Mr. Gallagher said. ""We won't tolerate any company trying to take advantage of our citizens in the aftermath of this tragedy."" **********Mr. Gallagher's order froze the rates and premiums set by A.I.G. in the state for 60 days. The commissioner announced he would hold a public hearing to look into the matter. Florida law allows companies to set rates first and then file them with regulators, who can then reject them. **********The commissioner also sent a letter today to the chief executives of the 780 companies licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in Florida. In his letter, he warned that his department would reject any efforts by the insurance industry to ""capitalize on the misfortune of Hurricane Andrew's victims"" through unjustified rate increases. **********The memo marks the latest battle in a war between consumer groups and the property casualty industry in states across the nation. Consumer activists, like Robert J. Hunter, the president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, which first obtained the memo last week, and Ralph Nader, have argued that insurers make more than adequate returns with current prices. Worry About Capital **********The insurance industry and most Wall Street analysts and economists who follow the industry say that at least in certain types of insurance that involve commercial customers, competition in recent years has kept prices so low that in the long run, if prices do not go up it will be hard for the industry to attract capital and remain healthy. **********Immediately after Hurricane Andrew hit shore on Aug. 24, the stocks of many major insurers climbed in expectation that the storm damage would deplete the industry's capital and change the psychology of the market place so that property casualty rates would rise. But a majority of analysts now say they doubt whether Andrew alone -- which is expected to result in nearly $8 billion in insured losses in Florida and Louisiana -- will cause a climb in premiums. **********The A.I.G. memo said: ""The industry cannot absorb the loss and cash hit without increasing rates. We have opportunities from this and everyone must probe with brokers and clients. **********""This is an opportunity to get price increases now,"" the memo continued, ""We must be the first and it begins by establishing the psychology with our own people. Please get it moving today."" **********In a statement issued by A.I.G. yesterday, the company's chairman said the company would dispute the charges of wrongdoing at a public hearing. **********""Insurance rates are not set in response to any single event, even a disaster as unprecedented as Hurricane Andrew,"" the senior Mr. Greenberg said. ""They are set by the marketplace. Any informed observer of our industry knows that."""

Only occasionally are jewelry and watches inscribed with initials or a name. Rarely is the manufacturer's name apparent. In the vast majority of cases, the artifacts could have belonged to anyone. **********For example, the collection includes gold and silver wrist and pocket watches, buttons, bracelets, jeweled necklaces, rings, tiepins and hairpins, gold pince-nez, leather goods, several hundred English coins, and ivory combs, mirror cases and hairbrushes. **********French law requires that ownership claims be invited before the objects are returned to Titanic Ventures, the international consortium that financed the French expedition organized in 1987 to recover artifacts from the wreck found two years earlier. **********France became involved because the objects were brought here by for safekeeping and restoration at a special laboratory run by Electricity of France, a state-owned utility. The restoration took two years, but plans to return them to their owners were delayed by several court cases. **********A notice inviting claims was published today in The New York Times, The Times of London and three French newspapers. Potential claimants can study photographs of the artifacts at the French embassies in Washington and London as well as the Merchant Marine Secretariat in Paris. **********At a news conference today, the Secretary of the Merchant Marine, Charles Josselin, said that any person able to offer proof of ownership of an item would have to contribute toward the $5.5 million cost of the expedition if he wished to repossess it. **********""How much he pays will depend on the value of the object on the market,"" he said. ""In many cases, it will be very little."" He added that the collection did not contain enormously valuable pieces because the expedition was only able to reach the Titanic's third-class section. **********Under its contract with the French Institute for Maritime Research and Exploration, which carried out the expedition with a manned mini-submarine, Titanic Ventures agreed not to sell any artifacts brought up from the wreck, but it can organize exhibitions and charge an entry fee. Individual owners, though, will be allowed to sell any items they now recover. **********Mr. Josselin anticipated conflicting claims of ownership. ""I wonder what will happen if several grandchildren all come forward to seek the same object,"" he said, adding that French courts would have the final word. **********The problem of identifying ownership of objects, however, remains. Four tiepins carry the initials R.L.B., some leather goods identify where in London and Paris they were acquired and numerous bottles display the names of the oils, dyes and lotions they once contained, but invariably there is no hint of ownership. **********Remarkably, some printed material has been restored, although it may have little more than sentimental value. A visiting card in the name of Maj. Arthur G. Penchen of the Second Queen's Own Rifles of Canada gives the National Club as an address. Another card in the name of Mr. R. M. King identifies him as a member of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron. **********Indeed, while some of the jewelry may have more intrinsic value, the items' principal worth is simply that they come from the Titanic and, as such, may interest collectors. **********""What most struck me,"" Mr. Josselin said, ""is that in such a long list of day-to-day objects, there was nothing made of plastic. That, if nothing else, shows how much times have changed."""

Was the French Revolution? And was the French Revolution devalued by the terror that followed it? **********Most perplexing for the students is that there are no longer right or wrong answers: Mr. Kubis wants a debate, an exercise in critical thinking, evidence that history can be analyzed from several points of view. He is pleased when, in response, the class wants to question Czechoslovakia's own ""Velvet Revolution"" of 1989. **********Three years after the universities stood in the forefront of protests against the Communist Government, a transformation in learning is under way across the country and educators struggle with the challenge of teaching students how to think and function in an open, critical and competitive society. The Burdens of History **********Their daunting handicap, though, is that the instructors who are supposed to be fostering the new thinking are usually themselves products of the rigid, fixed ways of the past. **********Thus, though Czechoslovakia is a pace-setter for educational change in the former Communist countries, it also mirrors how far they still have to go. The reflection is one of acute shortages of libraries, classrooms, money and well-trained, motivating teachers. **********After Jan. 1, when Czechoslovakia splits into two nations, the situation may worsen in Slovakia, which is poorer than the Czech Republic. **********""We are sclerotic, that's the problem,"" said Radim Palous, a philosopher and chemist who is now rector of Charles University in Prague, one of the oldest seats of learning in Europe. He speaks of education crippled for more than half a century, beginning in 1939, when Nazi Germany first closed the university, and then in the decades that followed, when Communism cut learning off from the modern world. **********""We have to adapt to new sciences, new methods,"" Mr. Palous said. ""We are searching for new standards. But how? Where do we get new teachers?"" Books vs. Business Skills **********As a reminder of a proud past dating to 1348, Mr. Palous led the way into the university's medieval Great Hall. He also made a point of showing the ancient ceremonial robe and mace of his office, as though still incredulous to find himself, a philosopher and chemist, at the head of this institution after the years of arrests, of holding clandestine philosophy seminars, of working as a furnace stoker. **********Specialists, including foreign economists, say the state of education is a better barometer for durable change than the capitalist arts, which are already blooming in the region. **********They also see education as a truer gauge of the complexity and the time required in creating a democratic society, even in Czechoslovakia, which once had strong liberal traditions. **********""Our smooth and nonviolent 'Velvet Revolution' of 1989 created the illusion that the transformation from socialism would be swift and easy,"" said Jiri Musil, the rector of the new Central European University. ""In education, that illusion is gone. The core of the problem is that we have an unbelievable scarcity of human resources, of good teachers. And no one can solve this quickly."" **********Some educators here, even those grateful for the help coming from the West, say they wish the West would stop harping on the glories of business expertise. They believe this shows a misunderstanding of the long-term needs of Central and Eastern Europe. **********""Our disaster lies in the way people think, in their closed and passive minds,"" Mr. Musil said. ""It's not the absence of management skills."" A New University's Goals **********He says Central European University in Prague is in the forefront of change because it aims at preparing the new intellectual elite. ""We want to train future academics, politicians, civil servants,"" he said, ""in the bases of an open society, the people who will build up civil society."" **********This graduate school in social sciences and humanities is largely financed by the Soros Foundation in New York, which was founded by George Soros, a Hungarian-born businessman, to promote democracy in Eastern Europe. Thus it is privileged compared with local institutes, providing its 110 students with one of the nation's best libraries and an international staff. **********Although foreign foundations and governments, including the United States, have sent books, equipment, teachers and money, shortages everywhere are daunting. **********Most precarious is the fate of Trnava University, founded in 1635, the oldest university in Slovakia, which had its funds cut back in September. The Government has claimed insolvency, but students and teachers said in angry demonstrations that the Government wants to throttle the school because the rector and others oppose the official Slovak nationalist line.  Classic Books, by Xerox **********At the English department at Charles University, a photocopy machine donated by the British Council makes up for missing texts, as long as teachers pay for the paper. An instructor discussing Jane Austen has used it to copy entire novels. **********""I only pick essays,"" an American teacher said. ""My courses are determined by the length of a text. If it's more than 20 pages, it will take me too long to Xerox copies."" **********Yet across the country, a whirlwind of formal changes has already put a great distance between this academic year and the time, just three years ago, when Czechs and Slovaks studied scientific atheism and the legal relationships between state enterprises. **********The ubiquitous institutes of Marxism-Leninism have gone, and so have the many compulsory courses spun from its doctrine. The 23 Czech and 15 Slovak institutes of higher education have all overhauled their curriculums. Some changed crucial subjects like law and history; others, particularly technical institutes, tried to end the Communist-style separation between teaching and research, which was reserved for the prestigious, but separate, science academies. New Curriculums Not Enough **********In its soot-covered buildings around town, Charles University has recently revived departments like theology, political science and sociology and opened new studies in economics and computer science. **********Monica Vesela, a fifth-year history student, is not impressed. She singled out Mr. Kubis, the history professor, as a man of ""modern"" ideas, but she said she had not seen much change. **********""Seventy percent of our teachers are the same people who talk the same boring way and are just as inflexible as before,"" she said. Many older teachers, expelled in the past as ideologically suspect, have been reinstated. **********Milos Kocman, a law student, said the old-time lecturers have learned the new laws but teach on the old principle of ""just copy and learn by heart."" First, Purge the Communists **********Except for the former East Germany, no other former East-bloc country has staged a political purge quite like Czechoslovakia's. The reaction has been intense because Czechoslovakia's former Communist bosses gave great importance to controlling all liberal reflexes, dismissing hundreds of scholars and teachers. **********In the counterpurge since 1989, hundreds of faculty and staff members have lost their jobs. Many were forced out by students who labeled them Communist Party hacks or police informers, others simply because their specialties in doctrine or central planning are obsolete. Those who remain are a mix of former Communists and their critics, though many dissidents have gone into politics. **********The Education Ministry says it has no statistics on these changes, but some specialists estimate that since 1989, perhaps 3,000 people, including 10 percent of the instructors and most administrators, have lost jobs in education. Mr. Palous said Charles University alone dismissed 500 of its 3,500 teachers. **********Even libraries have been weeding out their shelves. ""People are so allergic, they are rooting out all Marxist material, even Western views of Marxism,"" said Richard Ayres, a British librarian at the Central European University, who expressed a collector's regrets. ""It's disturbing. They're not locking it up but throwing it all away."" No Lack of Enthusiasm **********But the thirst for education is impressive. Charles University, which has 30,000 students, this year had 42,000 applicants; only 6,000 were accepted. The crush has been greatest at the law schools, where 7,000 students applied and teachers complain that the 900 admitted far exceed capacity. **********Communist governments had kept enrollment low, often responding to the dictates of central planners. **********But demand is now high for almost any course. The Czech Republic, which had 89,000 students enrolled in higher education in 1985, has more than 150,000 enrolled today; enrollment in Slovakia has jumped at the same rate, to 60,000. **********This puts enormous demands on a Government strapped for cash. Officials say they may start charging for education, which is free, as it was under Communism. Communist spending on education, despite official propaganda, was relatively low. **********In 1988, Government spending on higher education accounted for eight-tenths of 1 percent of the gross national product, compared to 1 percent in West Germany, 1.3 percent in the United States and 1.8 percent, one of the highest rates, in the Netherlands. A study of higher education in Czechoslovakia to be published shortly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recommends that the Government start looking for private contributions, increase the number of students per teacher and give greater autonomy to schools. **********Many educators agree that the battle for education will be slow and hard to win. A glimpse of this can be seen at the Teachers' Training College in Prague. Vlastimil Parizek, a deputy director, said that among the 3,000 students, a growing number have financial problems. ""One of my students works half the week in a pizza parlor on Wenceslas Square, one is a night watchman, one is a waiter,"" he said. **********Claire Wallace, a Briton who heads the sociology department at the Central European University, said the greater challenge was to break down the conformism and apathy wrought by years in a mental straitjacket. **********""The mindset here is, so Marxism was wrong,"" she said. ""So what shall I do now, where are the new rules? Most students are not looking to think but to get the new recipe. It takes time to revive, to re-open the mind."""

Cherney, a managing director of Ferguson Partners Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm that specializes in advising the real estate industry. **********A recent study by the firm documents many changes in the industry and calls for finding a new approach to educate people going into real estate by the year 2000. This education, the study says, should shift the emphasis away from finance and law in many real estate programs at the degree level of master of business administration. ""For the study we talked to real estate executives around the country as well as professors of real estate at many universities,"" she said. **********The pendulum has swung back toward the need for a broad general education, before training in the specifics. **********Tomorrow's real estate leaders, the study found, must be capable of dealing with global issues, complex financing that might involve foreign currencies, environmental obstacles, a political process that moves slowly, and the ever-present requirement for more sophisticated marketing. **********Formal undergraduate training should involve the liberal arts, foreign languages, communications skills, computer skills, along with marketing courses and knowledge gained on the job, the study showed.  In addition, there should be graduate training in general management and finance. **********The study indicates why the change is needed in educational focus. Real estate companies will be much larger, as evidenced by consolidations like the one that involved Coldwell Banker, acquired by Sears, Roebuck, which expanded further by acquiring Schlott, a large real estate firm in New Jersey. **********Many of the enlarged real estate companies will have international operations and must be staffed with managers who can deal with broader operations. This will give the companies more stability during economic downturns. **********""The bigger firms will provide more services such as development of projects and the management of the projects,"" she explained. She pointed out that many more real estate firms would be part of giant companies like Prudential Insurance and Equitable Life Assurance. Also, there will be more control of real estate companies in this country by foreign owners. **********All this, Miss Cherney said, will lead to a new type of career opportunity in real estate. **********Since the companies will have international divisions or possibly be owned by a foreign company, there will be a need for executives who are bilingual or multilingual and who understand how to deal with foreign culutres and foreign economic and political issues. **********And since environmental problems will affect real estate even more in the future, the real estate executives of the year 2000 must understand issues like waste disposal, urban land use, recycling, waste, air and noise pollution, to mention some, as well as use of fuel sources like nuclear and solar energy. **********In the realm of public affairs, the problems of today will be magnified by the year 2000 because of the growing population and accompanying urban sprawl. These problems include taxation, already a major issue, traffic congestion, new roads and public transit, municipal needs like additional water sources and more sewage plants. **********Institutional investors with large amounts of pension fund money to invest will be reassessing their investment strategy in real esate companies and putting more focus on sound performing real estate assets. **********This will put an emphasis on improved financial management of real estate firms and the need for their treasurers to have broader relationships with banks, pension funds, foreign investors and other capital sources. **********At the same time, corporate real estate departments, Miss Cherney believes, will shrink as the big companies continue to slim down their managements. That indicates the need for more help and consultations with the outside real estate firms. **********Miss Cherney points out that professors of real estate at various universities around the nation are well aware of these changes in the industry. ""While other industries are looking for more specialized preparation for their field, real estate is bucking that trend, seeking managers who will have a well-rounded advanced education, she said."" **********She cited Peter T. Allen, an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan's graduate business school, who believes that a liberal arts background, customer experience, plus a graduate degree in an area like urban planning would be a good background for tomorrow's real estate executive."

Ibrahim Babangida, Nigeria's President, said the guard would replace the armed forces and police in riots. He stressed that any future unrest would be dealt with ""using all means,"" including emergency powers. **********But General Babangida also reaffirmed plans to push through a widely debated schedule that he has offered for handing power to elected civilians by next year. He spoke of unnamed ""sinister"" elements committed to discrediting the military. **********He added he would not be hurried out of office. Soldiers have run the country for all but nine years since it won independence from Britain in 1960. **********""The present situation of urban and communal unrest provides the perfect rationale for the establishment of the national guard,"" General Babangida said. The announcement followed an emergency meeting on Friday in Abuja, Nigeria's new capital, of the Armed Forces Ruling Council, the military governing body. **********After the meeting, the President told reporters: ""There was a crisis, and it remains a crisis."" He added that the 20-member council would defend ""with the last drop of our blood"" his program to restore civilian rule to Africa's most populous nation. **********Although the President gave few concrete details about the new national guard, Western and African diplomats said the guard is likely to number in the tens of thousands, report directly to the president, be armed with modern weaponry and incorporate the present riot police. 'Democratic and Civilian Rule' **********General Babangida told Nigerians that he was speaking with ""a heavy heart"" after the worst outbreak of religious, ethnic and anti-government riots in at least a decade. But he said the military government was determined to carry on in the belief that most people still supported its program to hand back power to civilians. **********""Our destination, in concrete terms, is military disengagement and the return to democratic and civilian rule, as well as the modernization of Nigeria into a private enterprise, free-market economy,"" General Babangida said. **********During the past two weeks, at least 500, and perhaps as many as 800 people are believed to have died in fighting between Christians and Muslims in Kaduna State in the country's northern region, and in skirmishes between anti-government rioters and police in several southern coastal cities. **********Most experts on Nigeria agree that Muslims constitute close to half of the total population of about 88.5 million and that Christians make up roughly one third. Most of the rest are animists. **********But it is not only longstanding religious feuds, and parallel rivalries among the country's 250 ethnic groups, but growing poverty that makes Nigeria's situation so volatile. **********As in many oil-producing nations, the booming 1970's created expectations of prosperity. Instead, in this time of hyperinflation, currency devaluations and rising unemployment, real wages for most Nigerians have fallen sharply. **********Under General Babangida's tightly controlled transition to civilian rule, elected civilians are scheduled to take over early next year after national assembly and presidential elections are held in December. A Controlled Process **********The trouble, critics say, is that the military is so determined to stage-manage the transition process that the ""grass-roots democracy"" they hoped to create may be strangled before it has a chance to bear fruit. **********For one thing, the authorities have allowed only two political parties, both of which it created: the Social Democratic Party and the National Republican Convention, or, in General Babangida's phrase, ""one a little to the left, and the other a little to the right."" **********The Government has also drafted the platforms of both parties, which mostly mirror the economic and social polices of the present rulers."

Gaidar, for assurances that Moscow would not backtrack on economic reforms under a hostile Parliament's pressure. **********Several ministers said they were worried that Russia might slacken its reforms in the face of strong efforts by legislators in Moscow this month to dilute President Boris N. Yeltsin's program to reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. The finance ministers voiced particular concern that Russia might not keep its budget deficit in check or do enough to tighten credit. Helping Those Who Help Selves **********""Our message must be for self-help,"" said Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, before the meeting. ""We want to signal to them that we want to help, but the major responsibility must be theirs."" **********On his arrival this weekend from Moscow, Mr. Gaidar, architect of Mr. Yeltsin's economic program, sought to assure the finance ministers that his nation deserved the multi-billion dollar aid package that the Group of Seven promised early this month. **********""We are doing enough,"" he said. A 35-year-old academic with little management experience before his appointment last year, Mr. Gaidar has impressed foreign officials with his grasp of Russia's economic situation. **********Today's Group of Seven meeting was the first gathering of the finance ministers from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada since President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany announced the broad outlines of a $24 billion Russian aid package on April 1. **********The package is designed to soften the trauma of Russia's market-oriented reforms. Much of it includes aid already committed by the West, and some details remain to be resolved. **********Continuing a yearlong campaign within the Group of Seven, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady used the meeting, which included central bank governors, as an occasion to press Germany, Japan and the other nations to do more to spur world growth. **********With a weak economy hurting President Bush as he seeks re-election, Mr. Brady has said repeatedly that faster world growth is vital to transitions to market economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. **********A communique issued this evening said: ""The ministers and governors welcomed the reforms already undertaken in Russia. They underscored that there is no productive alternative to establishing a market economy in Russia through the adoption of strong and comprehensive macroeconomic and structural reforms."" **********The ministers called on Russia to reduce its budget deficit, curb monetary growth, set up a legal framework for a market economy, and reform its farm and energy sectors to increase production and foreign exchange. **********Mr. Brady said of Mr. Gaidar after the meeting, ""he took those points and he believes he can deliver."" **********The communique said that ""the ministers and governors remain concerned that aggregate G-7 economic activity this year would be below potential and growth would be inadequate to achieve a reduction in unemployment."" **********The ministers, without naming names, called upon Germany and the United States to lower their deficits. ""This is important both for countries with long-lasting fiscal imbalances and for countries experiencing exceptional adjustment challenges,"" the communique said. **********Exchange markets have been generally stable in recent months, the communique said. **********But as for the Japanese yen, the ministers ""noted that the decline of the yen since their last meeting was not contributing to the adjustment process."" Bush Administration officials have said economic growth, which is already lagging, might be dragged down further by Japan's slowdown and by Europe's sluggishness. **********In the days before the meeting, a quarrel of unusual bitterness erupted after American officials urged Bonn to do more to cut its budget deficit to make it easier for Germany's central bank to cut its high interest rates. German officials accused a senior Treasury official of making false comments and of meddling. **********At previous Group of Seven meetings, American officials pressed Germany's central bank to lower interest rates. But at today's meeting, they focused their attention on Germany's growing deficit, which has created inflationary pressures. **********Officials of industrial nations have recently voiced concern that for years to come Bonn might continue paying large subsidies to the east, keeping deficit and interest rates high. **********Although American officials are eager to see Germany's short-term rates fall, they received little solace today.  Helmut Schlesinger, president of Germany's central bank, said, ""The Bundesbank has no room to cut rates."" **********Japan's plunging stock market and declining asset values were also subjects of concern at today's meeting. Referring to Japan, the communique said that in countries with large trade surpluses and declining growth ""policymakers should be mindful of the possibilities of strengthening domestic demand."" Last week, American officials urged Japan to raise Government spending, especially on infrastructure, such as roads, to stimulate its economy. **********Although Japanese officials have criticized the Russian aid package, they indicated today that they would back it even though a territorial dispute with Russia remains unresolved. **********Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, is scheduled to meet this week with Chancellor Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France to ask for help in persuading Russia to give back a group of islands taken from Japan at the end of World War II."

The narrower loss from a reduced sales volume ""indicates that our efforts to reduce costs without compromising our product plans are working,"" said Harold A. Poling, the chairman and chief executive. ""Not Out of the Woods"" **********Analysts cautioned that Ford might be facing more hard times. ""Ford is not out of the woods,"" said Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco. Investors should realize ""there is no chance of a dividend increase for several years,"" he said. **********Investors took the results in stride today, as Ford's stock gained 62.5 cents, to $35.25. With 2.5 million shares traded, it was the fifth-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. **********For the year, Ford lost $2.25 billion on revenues of $88.28 billion, compared with a profit in 1990 of $860.1 million, or $1.86 a share, on revenues of $97.65 billion. **********In 1980, Ford lost $1.54 billion, its second-biggest loss. When the General Motors Corporation posts financial results next week, the Big Three will have racked up an estimated $7 billion in losses last year, by far the industry's worst year ever. **********""Many of the problems that affected us in 1991 are continuing into 1992 -- soft economies, intense competition and excess industry capacity,"" Mr. Poling said. Besides cost cuts, Ford forecasts a gradual economic recovery this year, he said, giving ""us reason to believe our 1992 operating results will show substantial improvement,"" he added. **********Ford declined, however, to disclose its internal prediction of whether it would be profitable in 1992. Balancing Losses **********The car maker's worldwide automotive operations lost $712 million in the fourth quarter; $506 million of the loss came from the American automotive operations. The loss was balanced by a $236 million quarterly profit from Ford's financial services group, which includes the Ford Motor Credit Credit Company, the Associates Corporation of North America and the First Nationwide Financial Corporation. **********Depressed sales volume because of the weak economy hurt Ford's United States results in 1991, but the No. 2 auto maker also lost market share during the period. Its share of the American car market dropped by one percentage point, to 20.1 percent, mostly reflecting weaker demand for Ford's two-door sporty models, the Probe, Mustang, Thunderbird and Cougar. **********Ford's share of the American truck market was also down, by four-tenths of a percent, to 28.9 percent, reflecting a shift toward smaller trucks, away from the larger model segments in which Ford is strong. Worldwide Sales Down **********Worldwide, Ford sold 5,359,000 cars, trucks and tractors to dealers in 1991, down from 5,872,000 a year earlier. For the quarter, factory sales totaled 1,296,000, down from 1,436,000 in the fourth quarter of 1990. **********Overseas, losses in Britain overwhelmed Ford's profitable operations elsewhere. Although Ford remained the top-selling car maker in Britain, sales volume industrywide dropped by 21 percent, the biggest plunge in 40 years. Ford of Britain and Jaguar Ltd. together lost $1.1 billion last year; combined overseas losses, including the rest of Europe, Latin America and the Far East, totaled $970 million. **********But Mr. Poling said, ""We believe the worst is behind us in Britain, and we expect a modest economic recovery this year."" Financial Unit's Profit **********For 1991, Ford's financial-services business posted a record profit of $927 million, a 22 percent increase from a year earlier. **********The aggressive sale of preferred and common stock and other tactics designed to strengthen Ford's balance sheet have left the company flush with cash to develop new products. Ford reported cash and marketable securities worth $9.8 billion at the end of the year, compared with $6.1 billion a year ago. **********Mr. Glantz, the Dean Witter analyst, predicted Ford might be able to weather 1992 without additional financing."

Indicator Turns Upbeat,Market Place; The R.V. Indicator Turns Upbeat," **********Sales of recreational vehicles, those homes on wheels that clog the nation's highways during the summers, appear to be picking up, figures compiled by the industry's trade association show. That may signal some good news for the nation's economy; many in the industry at least view R.V. sales as a reliable leading indicator. **********""The pattern has held for 20-plus years,"" said H. Wayne Dahl, president of the Holiday Rambler unit of Harley-Davidson Inc. ""Recreational vehicle sales are among the first things to fall off in a recession, and they have always led the recovery."" Although Harley-Davidson is best known for its rumbling motorcycles, 25 percent of its revenues come from Holiday Rambler, which makes high-priced motor homes and other vehicles. A Cyclical Business **********David Humphreys, who is president of the Recreational Vehicle Industries Association in Reston, Va., said: ""We knew the industry had a history of ups and downs, but at first we didn't believe that we were a leading indicator. But Chase Economics and the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center found that we were one of the most leading indicators they could find."" **********Part of the reason, he said, is that the purchase of an R.V. can be readily deferred. People have to buy cars and trucks eventually for basic transportation, but nobody needs an R.V. So when the economy turns down and people start worrying about their jobs, they avoid frills like an R.V. Now, with the worst of the recession evidently past, and vacation season approaching, buyers are returning to showrooms to look at products ranging from folding camp trailers starting at $4,000 to luxury cruisers costing more than $100,000. **********For investors, the sales upturn offers opportunities, but most analysts are recommending a selective approach that favors the smaller companies in the industry over the bigger names like Winnebago. **********The association, which represents R.V. manufacturers and their suppliers, says shipments to dealers totaled 62,100 units in the first two months of this year, an increase of 84 percent over the 33,800 shipped in the comparable 1991 period. This includes vans that have been converted to include sleeping areas, but which lack the kitchens and bathrooms of fully equipped vehicles. **********The year-to-year comparison is distorted by the effects of the Persian Gulf war last year, as well as by the fact that dealers were consciously drawing down their inventories; still, it gives an indication of the turn. **********Mr. Humphreys notes that with dealer inventories slim, wholesale shipments should translate quickly into retail sales. That should produce more orders for factories. R.V.'s are largely hand built, so factories can crank up production fairly quickly by adding labor. **********John DeWolf, an economic forecaster who is a consultant to the association, said R.V. sales usually lead the overall economic recovery by about half a year. ""They pick up about six months ahead of industrial production,"" he said. He attributed this year's increased sales largely to lower interest rates. Since R.V. loans can have terms as long as 15 years, interest rates are an important factor. **********Mr. DeWolf is forecasting that recreational vehicle sales, excluding converted vans, will increase 12.4 percent this year, to 191,200 units, from 170,100 last year. That would still be well below the peak of 223,100 in 1988. **********But the sunny outlook has not so far been extended to the stocks of the companies that make the vehicles. Most stocks in the group peaked late in March and have been drifting lower since then. **********Fleetwood Enterprises, the industry leader, which was profitable all through the sales trough, hit $48 on March 20, but has since slumped below $40 and closed yesterday at $38, up 62.5 cents for the day. Winnebago Industries, once a darling of investors, has struggled up to $6.25, but yesterday it closed at $4.625, down 62.5 cents. Winnebago, unlike most of the industry, is expected to remain in the red for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends in August. **********Ellen T. Horing, who follows the recreational vehicle industry for Gabelli & Company, suggests that some of the smaller companies, like Coachman Industries and the Skyline Corporation, might provide a conservative bet on the industry. **********Coachman returned to profitability in the first quarter, posting earnings of 5 cents a share in contrast to a loss of 57 cents a year ago. Unlike some of the larger companies, it has held on to most of its gain from the first quarter. After peaking at $8.875 it slipped, closing yesterday at $7.625, down 50 cents. Skyline closed yesterday at $16.875, up 12.5 cents; it went as high as $18.875 in late March."

In the last three years, superpower rivalry has been replaced by international indifference. **********""With the end of the cold war, Africa has lost whatever political luster it may have once had,"" Michael Chege, a Kenyan political scientist working in Zimbabwe, wrote recently in the journal Foreign Affairs. There are no compelling geopolitical, strategic or economic reasons ""to catapult it to the top of the global economic agenda,"" he said. ""Africans must now take the initiative."" **********The abandonment is vividly evident here in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia and Somalia, which were at the center of the tussle for influence on the African continent in the 1970's, now lie devastated, orphans of the post-cold-war era. **********Long pro-American, Ethiopia, a pre-industrial country with 50 million people, joined the Soviet camp in 1977 and was rewarded with Cuban troops and billions of dollars of military equipment. Washington responded by pumping arms and money into the vacuum left by Moscow in neighboring Somalia, a desert strip of six million nomads. **********Today, Ethiopia, its 30-year civil war over, holds to a fragile peace with a Government that says it wants to establish a democracy. But it has yet to receive any of the economic aid that Washington has promised. The former Soviet Embassy, once swollen with military attaches and diplomats, is virtually empty. **********And Somalia, shredded by a civil conflict fought with the instruments of the cold war, is considered so irrelevant that in April Washington successfully pushed for a sharp reduction in the size of the United Nations peacekeeping force being sent there. **********But if the superpowers are no longer much interested in Africa, that also means that African despots can no longer insure their grip on power by playing off Washington and Moscow against each other. In country after country they have fallen. As they go, Africans are demanding democratic government. **********A big question of the post-cold-war era is how Africans, dependent since their independence on outside aid, will deal with their political and economic futures as they are left to fend for themselves.  AIDS Infects Six Million **********Not only do African countries have to wrestle with economies wrecked by civil war and mismanagement; they must also contend with the world's worst AIDS epidemic, which has infected six million people so far and is devastating embryonic middle classes. **********World Bank and American officials insist that the overall sums of aid to Africa have not diminished since the end of the cold war. Young African political leaders agree, but predict that aid will soon drop as richer nations, hard up because of recession and facing competing demands for assistance, turn their attention to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. **********In many African countries, an onerous legacy of the cold war is centralized government control, particularly over economic matters, many experts say. **********In an address in Washington last October, George B. N. Ayittey, a Ghanaian who teaches economics at American University, said that while there was ""a deep-seated fascination with socialism"" across the continent, ""the basic problem of Africa is statism."" **********""Whatever the ideological professions of African governments, most -- even so-called capitalist states -- have been characterized by heavy state interventionism,"" he said. **********Professor Ayittey said the solution for Africa was ""a situation in which no individual or group, regardless of religion, race or ideological predilections, can capture the state."" **********For some Africans, South Africa, which is moving to end white rule, offers a glimmer of hope. These Africans look forward to beneficial economic ties with the only industrialized nation in sub-Saharan Africa as South Africa sheds its pariah status. The Talk Is of Money **********But overall, African intellectuals are not optimistic. **********""This is the only region in the world where you have B.C., A.D. and the 21st century,"" said Abdul Mohammed, the director of the Inter-Africa Group, a new consulting concern based in Addis Ababa. ""And in some places, like the southern Sudan and Somalia, it's even more B.C. than it was five years ago because of civil war."" **********Mr. Mohammed, an Ethiopian, said it would take a long time for the aid-dependent countries to wean themselves from the habit. ""The first reaction of governments in Africa across the board is to talk about money -- and the money is supposed to come from somewhere else,"" he said. ""The debate is not about multiparties or economic issues, but money."" The Roots  From the Empire Into the Fire **********The height of the superpower competition in the late 1950's and early 60's coincided with African movements for independence from the colonial powers, mainly Britain and France. As the Europeans were tossed out, Washington, Moscow and in some instances Beijing were eager to move in. In the 1970's, the Soviets started deploying Cuban proxies in Africa as Portugal was ejected from its colonies in Angola and Mozambique. **********The superpowers saw post-colonial Africa as fertile territory for their ideologies and for the reaping of rich resources at low cost. **********Moscow, judging the anticolonial fervor to be a good fit with Marxism, waded in first. In 1960, Nikita Khrushchev embraced African leaders at the United Nations, and Soviet embassies sprouted in barely known African countries. **********President Kennedy responded by appointing a high-profile politician, the former Governor of Michigan, G. Mennon Williams, as Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, a signal that Washington planned to keep as many African countries as possible out of the Communist fold. Africa was regarded as a dynamic place for talented young diplomats as Kennedy's New Frontier did battle with the Soviets and the Chinese over foreign aid and propaganda. **********In Zanzibar, for example, the island in the Indian Ocean off Tanzania, a revolution in 1964 put a Chinese-trained Marxist politician in charge. An aggressive young diplomat, Frank C. Carlucci, later head of the National Security Council in the Reagan Administration, was dispatched to keep the island out of the clutches of Beijing. Kenya Is the Prize **********In capitalist-oriented Kenya, newly independent from Britain in 1963, the Soviets and their East European satellites rushed to open embassies. Washington quickly followed, offering exchange programs in America for Kenyan students to offset the offers from Moscow universities. A prominent politician, Oginga Odinga, was financed by Moscow in his political struggle with the first President, Jomo Kenyatta, a tactic that served to reinforce American enthusiasm for Mr. Kenyatta. **********The superpowers' early interest in Kenya was not so much a result of what Kenya had but of where it was located: on the Indian Ocean with the port of Mombasa and near Zaire, Africa's second largest country, rich with minerals in the heart of the continent. **********In the former Belgian colony of the Congo, later renamed Zaire, the United States engaged in what are viewed as some of its most nefarious cold war covert actions. Fearful that its first leader, Patrice Lumumba, was too cozy with Moscow, the Central Intelligence Agency decided he had to go, even dispatching a specialist in poisons to plan his death. That plot never took place, but eventually the C.I.A. arranged a coup in which Mr. Lumumba was slain and Mobutu Seso Seko, an army colonel, came to power. **********In memory of their African hero, the Soviets established Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow where thousands of third-world students were trained by the end of the cold war. This year, the scholarships were canceled. **********President Mobutu was a staunch friend of the United States, and successive American administrations, Democratic and Republican, looked the other way as he looted the country. The Battle for Angola **********Above all, what Washington got was a base for its operations in Angola, a cold war theater of operations as hot as that in the Horn. **********When Angola became independent of Portugal in 1975, the Soviets and Americans supported different factions competing for power. The Americans were involved because Angola possessed rich oil deposits, and the Secretary of State, Henry A. Kissinger, argued that a Soviet-dominated Angola would endanger the Atlantic sea-lanes. The Cubans sent thousands of troops to bolster the new Marxist Government and the United States launched a covert action to support the anti-Communist Jonas Savimbi. **********Not until last year, with the cold war over, was the civil war settled, with the Soviets and Americans cooperating in achieving the peace. Foreign Aid   A Story of Failure, Told in Ruins **********It is hard to argue with African economists, business executives and aspiring politicians that the cold war was a debilitating and destructive experience for Africa. **********The three decades not only produced wars and dictatorships. Across the continent, the shells of buildings, potholed and overgrown roads, rusting buses and trains, even rotting books housed in leaking libraries attest to the failure of aid from both West and East. **********The hospital that the Chinese built on Zanzibar is now bereft of drugs, windows and furniture. The island's economy, which once flourished on cloves and trade, limps along on the proceeds from a few adventurous tourists. **********The $400 million railroad that the Chinese built through tropical swamps and forests from Tanzania to Zambia barely functions. In Addis Ababa, at the rundown Soviet-built hospital, the Russian doctors have left and Ethiopian medical graduates prefer to work abroad for better wages. **********In Zaire, countless American aid projects from corn plantations to road building have disappeared into the jungle. **********Why didn't Western aid work? The present Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, who served in the United States Embassy in Zaire in the 1960's, said the aid was dispensed amid ""unsound economic policies -- government ownership of major industries, disincentives for agricultural production and unrealistic exchange rates."" Poor economic policies were generally accompanied by repressive political arrangements: the one-party state. **********""Why didn't we put more pressure on them for reform?"" Mr. Cohen said. ""I'm probably a minority of one on this. I don't think it was the cold war. I think it was guilt. Guilt for colonialism. **********""The Africans claimed they had their own form of African democracy. It was only toward the end of the 1970's we saw the one-party states were fraudulent. But we didn't want to tell the Africans the truth: democracy and human rights were not on anyone's agenda."" The Leaders  The Dying Days Of the Despots **********In 1990 the State Department announced that aid to its old friends in Africa would be conditioned on progress toward democracy. **********""The U.S. policy shift surprised African despots and thrilled African democrats,"" said Mr. Chege, the Kenyan political scientist. **********Nowhere has the postwar policy been more evident than in Kenya, where after nearly a decade of one-party rule the Government has allowed the registration of political parties and the once reticent press is more outspoken. **********The leader in the campaign to persuade Kenya to open up the political process was the American Ambassador, Smith Hempstone Jr. A journalist who had traveled across Africa on the eve of independence, Mr. Hempstone was for many years a cold war warrior who had made his views known as a newspaper columnist and editor of the conservative Washington Times. Tough Talk From U.S. **********Almost immediately on arriving in Kenya in December 1989, Mr. Hempstone began speaking of the need for political pluralism. Whenever a dissident was arrested or a publication closed, Mr. Hempstone issued a statement condemning the Government. **********Such public statements from the Americans -- there were many -- angered President Daniel arap Moi and encouraged the opposition. Mr. Hempstone is the first to acknowledge that his outspokenness would have been impossible during the cold war. **********In country after country in the last two years, long-entrenched African leaders have been pushed aside. In some cases, rebels seized on the vulnerability of dictators marooned by their former patrons. **********In Liberia, Samuel K. Doe, a favorite of Washington, was slain. In Ethiopia, Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, an ally of Moscow's, fled, as did Mohammed Siad Barre of Somalia, who worked first with Moscow and then with Washington during his 21-year stewardship. **********In other cases, previously untried democratic processes worked. In Zambia, Kenneth Kaunda, President for 27 years, was overwhelmingly defeated in peaceful elections last October that brought to power Frederick Chiluba, a trade union leader Mr. Kaunda had kept in jail. In Benin, a former World Bank official, Nicephore Solo, was elected President. After 11 years of military rule in Ghana, Flight Lieut. Jerry Rawlings has bowed to calls for multiparty politics. Even in formerly Marxist Angola elections are scheduled for later this year. Zaire's Leader Hangs On **********In Zaire, President Mobutu hangs on, despite the end of Western aid. But the opposition reacted joyously when Mr. Cohen issued a statement in the Zairean capital, Kinshasa, last November, saying, ""Mobutu has lost legitimacy and should hand over the Government to an opposition-led transition."" **********The end of the cold war has given the United States an opportunity to be serious about promoting democracy in Africa, but having adopted a pro-democracy policy there it seems to be having difficulty carrying it out. **********Six months ago, officials at the United States Agency for International Development started a search for a dozen African countries that were democratic enough to merit especially generous amounts of the $800 million available in foreign aid to Africa. So far, officials say, they have been unable to decide on the list. **********Even in Ethiopia, where Washington has praised the fledgling Government's efforts at democracy and aid has been promised, it has yet to arrive. ""Washington bureaucracy takes a long time to work,"" Mr. Cohen said.  South Africa  A Pariah No More, But a Source of Aid **********There seems little dispute that the end of the cold war gave President F. W. De Klerk of South Africa the opportunity to release Nelson Mandela from prison and legalize the African National Congress. No longer could it be argued that the congress was being run from Moscow with the idea of turning South Africa into a Marxist state. **********For its progress toward democracy, Washington has rewarded South Africa with its biggest hunk of aid on the continent: $80 million distributed among nongovernmental agencies working in social services, housing and education. **********With the prospects of a black-controlled government in sight and the industrial might of South Africa still intact, many African nations are looking to it for their economic salvation. African politicians are rushing to Johannesburg with trade delegations hoping a prosperous South Africa will provide the engine for their countries' own development. From Bully to Benefactor **********That, some analysts believe, is tantalizingly possible. **********Already South Africa has transformed itself from bully to benefactor. Military aid to the Savimbi forces in Angola stopped in the late 1980's and South Africa permitted the independence of its former colony, Namibia. In Mozambique, the South Africans say, they have severed aid to the rebels. **********In both Angola and Mozambique, South Africa has established flourishing trade missions. In Zimbabwe, thousands of people line up daily outside the South African trade mission in the capital, Harare, to apply for business visas. Nine flights a week service the Mozambican capital, Maputo, from Johannesburg. **********Mr. de Klerk recently visited several African countries, including Nigeria, whose President, Ibrahim Babangida, is the president of the Organization of African Unity and one of the chief crusaders against apartheid. **********Wherever Mr. de Klerk went he preached regional co-operation with South Africa, insisting that trade, not aid, was the future for the continent. The Prospects  Money Is Needed, And It's Not There **********""Many people think Africans are incapable of running things,"" Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, told Western and African officials at a meeting in his country this month. ""And even I wonder sometimes."" **********Mr. Museveni, who in the mid-1980's emerged as the victor from nearly two decades of civil war and has kept the country in relative peace since, argues that the colonial past and then the cold war prevented Africans from being themselves. **********""You often heard the question, 'Are you pro-East or pro-West?' "" he said, ""the implication being that the interests of the West and the East were the only interests to be considered. Those of us who believed that there was such a thing as African interests as distinct from the interests of East and West found lot of difficulty in getting ourselves understood."" **********Without the constraints of the cold war, Mr. Museveni talks about a reawakening in Africa. But recent events in Uganda, which is suffering from one of the continent's worst AIDS epidemics and where Mr. Museveni has ordained a ""no-party democracy,"" suggest some of the hazards ahead. Inflation Shakes Uganda **********After making economic progress from 1989 to last year with large amounts of World Bank aid, Uganda suddenly saw inflation roar out of control a few months ago. Thousands of government employees are being laid off from their meager $3-a-month jobs. **********At the heart of the crisis, Ugandan officials say, was mismanagement by the recently dismissed Finance Minister, who borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from the Central Bank to pay some dubious military expenses and then ordered new money to be printed. **********The World Bank's vice president for Africa, Edward Jaycox, has outlined some ""minimally acceptable "" requirements for Africa to make it in the world economy. The growth rate of agriculture should be increased from 2 percent to 4 percent, he said, and investment increased from 11 percent of gross domestic product to 25 percent. **********To achieve these goals, Mr. Jaycox said, Africa will need a net annual inflow of $19 billion. It is an amount many African and Western economists consider unrealistic in the present international environment."

But many personal computer customers seemed to have missed a few lessons. Despite the largest price cuts in the history of the personal computer business in recent weeks, they have decided to stop buying, stand back and enjoy the spectacle of an industry whirling into a vortex of hyper-deflation. **********""Customers come up to me and say, 'When are the prices going to drop again?' "" said Harry Shasho, sarcastically imitating their winks and nudges. A vice president of Willoughby's camera and electronics store on West 32d Street in Manhattan, Mr. Shasho recently surveyed a computer department bereft of customers and said, ""When a guy's seen Compaq drop, and AST drop, and Leading Edge drop, all in one month's time, he says, 'Hey, I'll wait.' "" **********During recent weeks, Mr. Shasho said, sales have been down about 10 percent even from the recessionary levels of last year. Cuts of as Much as 40% **********The lack of enthusiasm among some buyers is all the more striking given the extent of the recent price cuts -- as much as 40 percent just in the last month. And it demonstrates that the computer industry obeys its own economic laws: procrastinators are always rewarded, because prices always move lower. **********""I am thinking about buying a computer for my aunt,"" said Thomas Sedlock, a customer at J&R Computer World, near City Hall in lower Manhattan. ""Compaq's price cuts stimulated me to see what's available. But, for myself, I'm fussier. I would wait till color laptops are cheaper."" **********Dr. Sedlock, a psychiatrist, gave a few desultory taps to the keyboard of a NEC 386-5L20 laptop, then he looked longingly at a far more expensive machine that came with a color display. **********He said he was confident that color laptops, which at J&R start at $2,899, would soon be cheaper than the black-and-white model he was testing. At J&R, prices are changed so frequently that few are posted, and a salesman had to tap into a computer himself to learn that the NEC costs $1,880. **********Michael Ginsburg, a freelance writer testing the word-processing abilities of a Leading Edge computer at J&R, said he was also checking mail-order catalogues. Even then, finding the latest prices took some effort. **********""Don't look at the prices,"" he said he was told when he called to request catalogues. ""When you're ready to shop, call us."" **********The price wars appear to find corporate America asleep at the keyboard. Mr. Shasho said his corporate and institutional customers, including several Ivy League universities, were too fixed in their purchasing habits to either rush after any bargains or wait for further discounts. **********""They have budgets, they have committees, they have purchase orders,"" he said, speaking at his usual 50-megahertz pace. ""I'm talking about major companies, not Sid & Al's Hardware."" **********Kimball Brown, director of personal computer hardware research at the International Data Corporation, a consulting and research company, said all the price-cutting would lead to only minor increases in the number of machines sold this year, and no growth in revenues. **********Some buyers, Mr. Brown said, are waiting for the International Business Machines Corporation to make its move. He expects to see a revamped product line in September. ""When that happens, we'll have a whole new round of price cuts,"" he said. The company has already announced plans to sell clones in Europe and Canada under a new Ambra nameplate. **********Lower prices for computers are nothing new. Prices have been falling and performance improving since the personal computer industry emerged from some West Coast garages about 15 years ago. But several analysts said the latest price war was fiercer than any they recall and the relative lack of customer response surprising. **********""This is the most intense,"" said Seymour Merrin of Palo Alto, Calif., who publishes a computer newsletter.  ""This industry is incredibly Darwinian."" **********The latest struggle for survival started on June 15. The Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston, the first company to sell clones of I.B.M.'s personal computers, grew tired of smaller clone makers doing to it what it had done so well to I.B.M. Its market share and profits dwindling, Compaq struck back. **********Before the hostilities, Compaq machines started at about $2,000. Now, for $899, a buyer can get a machine lacking only a few of the higher-priced model's features. **********Dell, Toshiba, Sharp, NEC and Hyundai rushed to introduce low-priced computers or cut prices on their current models by as much as 40 percent. Over the last month, price cuts averaged 20 to 30 percent -- as much as computer prices normally fall in a whole year, said Jonathan L. Yarmis, the director of the personal computer division at the Gartner Group, a market research and consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.  Gartner is now advising clients to begin buying personal computers again, unless they want to wait for further possible savings from I.B.M. or AST Research. **********Among several major computer makers, only Compaq, which has many corporate and institutional buyers, reports that the price cuts have brought a surge of orders -- more than it can immediately satisfy. **********Genelle Trader, vice president of marketing at Everex Systems Inc., which sells I.B.M.-compatible clones, said ""things got very quiet"" after Compaq slashed its prices. ""We did see some caution and stalling. I've talked to acquaintances at other competitors and they all see the same thing,"" she said. **********But she said she saw some revived buying last week. And some rapidly growing clone makers, including the Dell Computer Corporation, say the price wars are not costing them any business. **********Indeed, hesitation to buy is by no means universal. Some buyers are so awed by the performance they can afford that they see no reason to wait. **********In the buy-now camp is Robert D. Holmes, a Southern California Gas Company computer specialist who helps channel more than $2 million in annual purchases of personal computers. He said that to delay buying would deprive the company of the greater productivity the new machines bring. Moves Up the Line **********With a goal of spending about $3,000 a machine, Mr. Holmes had initially planned to buy computers powered by 386DX chips. Now, instead, he plans to buy machines with the much faster, top-of-the-line 486DX chips. **********But some people who bought computers recently cannot forgive themselves. A lawyer stopping by J&R said he was proud when he landed a Centrix computer a month ago, powered by the fast and powerful 486DX microprecssor, and connected to a broad, 15-inch color screen -- for $2,500. That system now sells for hundreds of dollars less. ""I'm kicking myself,"" he said. **********Adding to the injury, he said, several colleagues at his firm -- some secretaries, too -- are still waiting to buy. **********Mr. Shasho of Willoughby's said some customers berated him when they found that a machine they bought for $2,798 16 months ago was now the economy model, selling for $799. **********Some buyers do not have the luxury of waiting for lower prices. Gennady Mossin, a shopper at Willoughby's, carefully looked over the least-expensive computers and wondered whether they might someday be able to handle Cyrillic. Mr. Mossin, a translator and interpreter, told a salesman he wanted to buy something small enough to carry back on the plane to Russia. **********""For me, it's now or never,"" Mr. Mossin said."

Referendum rules also require approval by a majority of the country's cantons, and there the difference was far greater: 16 cantons voted no, 7 voted yes. Nein vs. Oui **********The vote also exposed a potentially dangerous split in a multicultural country that has long favored consensus over confrontation: All but one of the German-speaking cantons opposed closer ties with Europe, while all six French-speaking cantons strongly backed the plan. Sentiment in the smaller Italian-speaking areas was generally opposed to union. **********Further, the vote revealed a different kind of social division. By turning their backs on Europe, many Swiss voters, particularly in small rural communities, ignored the recommendation of industrial, banking, labor and intellectual leaders, as well as of the multiparty Government. **********""Switzerland has renounced the many political and economic opportunities opened up by the European Economic Area,"" Rene Felber, the French-speaking president of the Federal Council, said tonight. ""It has also broken with its traditional policy of rapprochement with Europe. **********""We have witnessed a grave rupture between the Federal authorities and the people. The cleavage between the French-speaking cantons and the rest of Switzerland is a matter of great concern."" Leaving Switzerland Behind **********Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, another member of the seven-man council, warned that European economic integration would go ahead anyway and that Switzerland's ""defection"" would result in discrimination, possibly against its economy. **********The impact on the rest of Europe is expected to be mainly psychological. The other six members of the European Free Trade Association -- Sweden, Austria, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein -- are still likely to help form the European Economic Area early next year. **********Yet, coming only months after a crucial treaty on European union was rejected by Danish voters and only narrowly ratified by the French, the Swiss vote underlines how many ordinary Europeans are skeptical about the whole notion of European unity. **********The heated campaign that preceded the vote reflected the conflicting messages -- economic opportunities and political uncertainty -- that Switzerland has received from the rest of Europe since the end of the cold war.  The Pros and Cons **********The country's political and economic establishment argued that the country would lose its competitive edge if it resisted the movement toward regional economic blocs. Some leading business executives and bankers even warned that investment would drop and unemployment would grow. **********But opponents of integration said Switzerland's unique grass-roots democracy would be undermined if political decision-making was transferred to the community's headquarters in Brussels. They also insisted that the country would remain an appealing financial haven if it kept its distance. **********Perhaps their most effective argument, though, was that Switzerland would soon be flooded by immigrants. With many Swiss already alarmed by the destabilizing impact of waves of refugees on neighboring Germany, this argument apparently had a strong influence in German-speaking cantons. **********The 19-member economic area was approved in April when the European Free Trade Association decided to join the single market being established on Jan. 1, 1993, by the community, with goods, services, capital and people moving freely through a vast and prosperous region. **********The governments in Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Finland saw this as the antechamber to the community and had planned to start entry negotiations next year. Now, however, while the rest of Western Europe heads towards closer economic ties, Switzerland has chosen the opposite direction."

Reflecting Bush's Values **********The trade publication Advertising Age, in this week's issue, reported that Mark McLaughlin, the November Company's media director, wrote CBS last month that the network would have to determine which programs were ""in good taste"" and ""reflective of the moral values of the President"" before the November Company would agree to purchase spots during those programs. The report said CBS replied that such determinations ought to be made by advertisers, rather than by the networks. **********In a subsequent letter, Mr. McLaughlin wrote that the November Company would accept CBS's position, adding, ""We hope we can count on you for insight into program content from time to time, although you are not responsible for it."" **********The exchange of letters underscored the intensification of interest in the so-called moral or family values issue in the wake of Vice President Quayle's attack on ""Murphy Brown,"" CBS's most highly rated entertainment series. The Vice President's castigation of the title character's decision to bear a child out of wedlock indicated that the Republicans would seek to make that issue a crucial component of their re-election bid. **********Mandy Grunwald, coordinator of the creative advertising team for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, said yesterday that executives working for the Democratic candidate nominee would not follow the Bush-Quayle example. **********""Our approach is to target programming that reaches the voters we want to reach,"" said Ms. Grunwald, a partner in Greer, Margolis, Mitchell, Grunwald & Associates in Washington, which is handling Mr. Clinton's political advertising effort. Looking at the Context **********She added that the context in which a political spot appears could be important; for instance, it might be inappropriate to run a humorous commercial during a dramatic program. Even so, she said, ""we don't believe in reading the scripts in advance."" **********In political advertising, campaigns usually seek to buy commercial time during programming that reaches the largest number of viewers, with content a secondary consideration."

Little Cause for Optimism **********""I don't see anything that is going to change this pattern of a very, very slow turnaround,"" said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the department store company based in Minneapolis. ""You'll see a little rise in spending in the fall, but consumers won't be running into the stores."" **********Or onto car dealers' lots, for that matter. Consumers bought domestically made models at an annual rate of six million the first 10 days of this month, only a bit ahead of the 5.9 million rate in July. **********But the reluctance of consumers to spend has had one benefit. It has made it difficult for many businesses to raise prices. **********Despite a spurt in fruit and vegetable prices, the Consumer Price Index edged up just three-tenths of a percent in August, following similarly small or smaller increases in each of the last four months. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation is running lately at a 2.4 percent annual rate. **********""Over the last few months, inflation news has been a lot better than the bond market had been expecting,"" said William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ""Last month's report shows that the good news was no fluke."" **********Economists said today's reports did not contain any clear signal to the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates significantly or immediately. Retail Sales **********The sour August sales results were sweetened a bit by the fact that sales were stronger in July and June than was previously believed. Retail sales not only zigzag from month to month but are also frequently revised. **********Spending rose twice as much in July, and fell only a third as much in June as originally reported, mostly because the Commerce Department had missed some car sales. In the end, that meant that sales for August were four-tenths of a percent higher than May's sales -- instead of three-tenths of a percent lower. **********""The report shows a little more strength in the third quarter than we thought,"" said David Kelly, senior economist at the Boston Company Economic Advisers, ""but only a little bit more."" **********One reason for the weakening in August was that car sales, about a fifth of retail sales, stalled. Another was that the housing market was still weak, hurting sales of furniture, appliances and building materials. **********Consumers did show up at department stores in August -- also about a fifth of retail sales -- but sales did not grow as much as in July. **********""In past recoveries, we didn't have to see improvements in income before consumers were willing to step up their spending,"" said Richard Curtin, director of the Center of Consumer Surveys at the University of Michigan. ""They always felt improvement was on the horizon."" **********For the first time, he said, the Michigan survey is finding that most families do not expect their financial circumstances to be better five years from now and most do not think it makes a difference who will be President next year. Consumer Prices **********Excluding food and energy -- volatile categories which tend to obscure the underlying price trend -- inflation has been heading down this year. **********The most promising sign that inflation might continue to cool was that price increases for services, which are largely immune from foreign competition and seemingly impervious to the weak economy, finally appeared to be moderating. **********The cost of everything from renting an apartment to going to the movies was climbing at an average annual rate of more than 5 percent in the second half of the 1980's. But since the end of last year, price increases for services have eased from a 4.5 percent annual rate to a 3.9 percent rate. Rents are no longer climbing relentlessly and even medical costs are rising no more than five-tenths of a percent a month. **********""Businesses can't make price increases stick,"" said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. ""That's one of the more unusual aspects of this recovery."""

General Says Bosnia Attacked Convoy,Angry U.N. General Says Bosnia Attacked Convoy," **********The commander of the United Nations peace force in Sarajevo charged today that Muslim militiamen had deliberately attacked a United Nations supply convoy on the city's western fringe Tuesday night, killing two French officers and wounding five. **********Witnesses said the convoy was unprotected and drove onto the scene where an exchange of fire took place between Serbian forces and Muslim militiamen loyal to Bosnia and Herzegovina's Government. **********The 39-vehicle convoy was on a road just outside Sarajevo airport, passing between positions held by the Serbian and Muslim forces when Muslim militiamen opened fire with machine guns, said the peace force's commander, Brig. Gen. Hussein Ali Abdul-Razek of Egypt, at a news conference in the Bosnian capital today. **********""It was very clear that the fire came from the Bosnian side,"" he said. ""It was just one or two persons on the ground who were involved."" **********The general offered no motive for the attack, but the United Nations troops in Sarajevo are unpopular with militiamen on all sides -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- who accuse the peacekeepers of aiding their respective enemies. **********""Irresponsible elements failed to respond to the local Bosnian commander's orders and attacked the convoy at a range of less than 100 meters,"" said General Abdul-Razek, who reportedly lodged a strong protest with the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, at a meeting this morning. **********""Up until the last moment we were in contact with both sides,"" he said, asserting that French officers had worked out a local cease-fire to secure passage of the United Nations vehicles, which are painted bright white and fly the organization's blue flag. **********""For 15 or 20 minutes,"" he continued, ""there was no firing. The light was enough for anybody to recognize and identify the trucks. There is always a fight. If I am to stop movement when there is fighting, we would not move anywhere. The major problem is that there are uncontrolled elements on the ground."" **********The attack prompted French officers attached to the 1,500-member United Nations contingent for Sarajevo to demand that it be given additional protection. It came after an Italian relief plane crashed west of Sarajevo last week; United Nations officials said today that it had been shot down. **********French troops said that the convoy, which was on a regular weekly run with food, fuel and water from Belgrade, had not been accompanied by armored vehicles. **********A French lieutenant who asked not to be further identified said the attackers failed to hit two fuel trucks in the convoy with small-arms fire.

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/07/world/puzzle-of-moscow-milk-price-soars-still-scarce.html,Celestine Bohlen,1992-02-07,,1970,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Puzzle of Moscow Milk: Price Soars; Still Scarce,Puzzle of Moscow Milk: Price Soars; Still Scarce," **********Four weeks after Russia threw itself on the free market, Moscow's central milk-processing concern is paying its suppliers eight times more for milk than it did before. Yet, in a paradox that is both maddening and typical of the first month of economic shock therapy, higher prices so far have had almost no effect on supplies. **********In fact, Moscow today is receiving about 1,220 tons of milk a day, less than half of the average for January 1989, the last time milk supplies for this city of nine million people could be considered ""normal,"" according to Mikhail V. Nabatnikov, general director of the milk company, which has the no-nonsense name of Milk. **********When prices shot up after Jan. 2, Mr. Nabatnikov had hoped to see an increase in deliveries from local dairies, at last freed from artificial price controls and incentive-dulling subsidies. But he was disappointed: all told, deliveries went up 100 tons, about one quarter of what he had expected. **********""Now we realize that prices are not the only thing that drive this economy of ours, not by a long shot,"" Mr. Nabatnikov said, having learned a lesson brought home with a thud this month to managers and economists across the length and breadth of Russia. Dictated by Producers **********In this strange twilight period when prices are neither set by the state nor dictated by the market, the cost of things -- from shoes to cars, from meat to pajamas -- is largely whatever the producer says it is. If that is more than the consumer can afford, then most producers, instead of trying to lower the price by cutting back on costs, have simply cut back on production, in some cases shutting down altogether. **********A meat factory in the historic Russian town of Vladimir recently sent its workers home on unpaid leave because local shoppers, most of whom have family incomes of between 500 and 1,000 rubles a month, refused to buy its meat at 54 rubles a pound. Russian television reported the shutdown as an example of the devastating effect of high prices, without any discussion of how the factory, which was buying its meat at 16 rubles a pound from the local cooperative farm, could trim costs, lower prices and save jobs. **********As production slips -- some official predictions now estimate the decrease for all of 1992 at 20 percent -- critics accuse the Government of failing to foresee that in an economy still dominated by monopolies, price liberalization would become an excuse to simply jack up prices. **********""Where there are monopolies, there liberalization can give only the results that we have seen,"" Georgi Matyukhin, head of the Russian central bank told the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya. ""The monopoly begins with a cut in production, and then raises prices. Anyone can understand that."" In Government's Defense **********Defending themselves, Government economists say that only with price liberalization could the monopolies be publicly exposed and finally forced to break up. Furthermore, they argue, only with a realistic pricing structure could a real market economy take shape. **********In the case of milk, the higher prices charged by producers and suppliers have not been brought home to the consumer, since the retail price of milk is still controlled, held to 7.4 rubles a gallon, the equivalent of 8 American cents at the unofficial rate and up only three times from prices before Jan. 2.  That makes milk a bargain in these inflationary times, and not surprisingly, milk supplies vanish as soon as they appear in Moscow shops. **********For families with small children, for nursing mothers, for people who need milk in their diet, the milk shortage has pushed patience to the limit. Aleksandr, an 80-year-old Muscovite who declined to give his last name, spends his free time these gloomy winter days scouring the city for milk. **********""Today, I have already been to two shops in the Kirovsky district -- no milk,"" he said. ""Then I went to the Yelysyevsky shop -- no milk. **********""Now here -- no milk,"" he said outside the milk store off Tverskaya Street. ""I can do without milk, but my wife cannot live without milk."" Private Deliveries Arranged **********To get around the shortages, some Moscow families make arrangements for private deliveries from local farms, which can cost them 17 rubles a liter or more. Others have come to rely on 28,000 tons of powdered milk, provided by the European Community as humanitarian aid to Moscow and St. Petersburg and distributed through the schools. **********In the last few months, unpasteurized milk has appeared in the private farmers' markets, but at prices that range from 35 to 50 rubles a liter, it is far out of the reach of the average family. **********Surveying the first month of economic reform, some members of the Government have argued that price controls on milk should be lifted to ease the shortages and cut the ballooning subsidies now being paid by local governments to cover the low price of milk at the retail level. In Moscow, the city is now paying 10 million rubles daily in milk subsidies, a burden that it is expected soon to ask the Russian Government to help bear. **********But evidence from the first phase of the reform suggests that further price increases at the retail level still will not solve the supply problem, although it would probably reduce demand. As Mr. Nabatnikov has discovered, the dramatic drop in milk supplies has roots sunk deep in the Russian economy, starting with the sorry state of the Russian farm. Feed for Cows Plunges **********Gennadi Dovner, who heads the division of milk production in the Moscow region's agricultural agency, said the drop in milk production in the region last year, to 86.7 percent of 1990 levels, could be traced to bad weather and to a decrease in feed supplies. This year could be worse, he said, since dairy cows outside Moscow are getting one-third of the feed they received last year. **********Thus, the milk yield per cow is likely to drop further below last year's annual yield of 8,075 pounds, which is down from 1989's level of 8,800 pounds. For comparison, an American or European cow produces on average more than 15,000 pounds of milk a year. **********The feed crisis was recently cited by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the economic reforms, as a critical issue in the months ahead. Western agricultural experts trace the problem not only to the cut in imports of feed grains but also to the disintegration of traditional economic links in the former Soviet Union. ""Basically, they are not getting the feed where they need it, when they need it,"" an agricultural specialist said. **********Supplies this winter have been further cut by the Russian Government's failure to stockpile powdered milk, traditionally one way Moscow and other big cities have maintained milk supplies through the winter. But according to some Western aid officials, the city authorities have resisted offers of low-fat powdered milk from abroad, arguing that Russians -- used to the 3.5 percent fat content in their milk, sold either in cartons or poured into containers direct from vats -- would object to a thinner variety. **********Even at higher levels of fat, Russian milk has an insipid taste to someone used to drinking the product of the West's relatively pampered cows. But it is a popular beverage, and is used in kasha, a Russian porridge, and in sweet cakes and other traditional foods. Some add it to their coffee, but most regard the English habit of putting milk in tea as a joke, except for children. **********Some commentators have charged that the farms are actually producing more milk but that the dairies are turning it into higher-priced products like sour cream or cheese. But most agree that the main problem is a lack of significant competition. **********""Because we have monopoly structures, the monopoies are competing over how to raise prices,"" said Mr. Matyukhin, the central bank chief, who is viewed as an opponent of the Government's policies. ""Therefore we have situations where they sell a kilogram for sour cream and pour the rest into a ditch, or give it to the pigs. Right now, our piglets are living very well. They feed on milk."" **********The Moscow milk-processing monopoly, which consists of five giant plants employing a total of 6,000 people, is supplied by the regional consortium of dairies, where the milk is first taken off the farms. In January, after the price liberalzation, the Moscow region's dairy association came to Mr. Nabatnikov and offered him a price of 25 rubles a gallon, up from their old price of 3 rubles a gallon. Another Offer: The Same **********He had no choice but to accept, since 75 percent of Moscow's milk comes from the surrounding region. Three weeks later, a delegation of dairy directors from the Tver district, 100 miles from Moscow, made him an offer. It was exactly the same. ""Of course, they all got together and decided ahead of time,"" he said. **********A faint glimmer of competition has appeared in the last month as a few large and successful state farms have offered to sell their milk directly to Mr. Nabatnikov for less than 23 rubles a gallon. But these offers of milk straight from the farms would still not amount to more than 15 percent of supply, Mr. Nabatnikov said. Most farms, he noted, are ill-equpped to handle direct shipments to the city, lacking the storage, the trucks and other equipment necessary to start marketing their own produce. Now, after the price increases, the cost of such equipment has soared out of sight. **********Mr. Nabatnikov now sells his milk at 41.5 rubles a gallon to the city-owned stores where milk is sold retail. He said his price is justified by the rise in his own costs. **********But meanwhile, his buyer -- the city -- is in no better a position to negotiate than he was with his own suppliers. Although Moscow's milk trading association was recently disbanded by a decree issued by President Boris N. Yeltsin, its milk stores -- most of them shabby with broken tiles, empty counters and abacuses instead of cash registers -- have neither the contacts nor the experience to go outside the established chain of command. Monopoly Position Defended **********Mr. Nabatnikov defends his own monopoly position on the grounds that the alternative -- competition between the five milk processing plants -- would only lead to higher prices. ""Imagine if the dairies from Tver, operating together with a fixed price, came here to negotiate with five different buyers,"" he said. ""They would all inevitably outbid each other."" **********Unlike milk prices, prices on other dairy products -- such as sour cream and farmers cheese, two Russian staples -- are no longer controlled. The first effect of price liberalization was to bring both sour cream and farmer's cheese, for months missing from shop shelves, back into the stores, but at fantastic and basically unaffordable prices. **********In one of the few cases where consumer balking has had an effect, Moscow shoppers refused to buy sour cream after it rose to 30 rubles a pound. As a result, 500 tons of sour cream were returned to Milk's warehouses. After much pleading, Mr. Nabatnikov was given permission to lower his prices to 16 rubles a pound, less than the 19 per pound he had paid the local dairies. **********But his response to this forced lesson in market economics is also telling. He has applied to the city for a 12 million ruble subsidy to cover his losses."

Abu Musa, the largest of the three, was used by Iranian revolutionary guards to stage attacks on oil tankers during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88. **********Traditionally, the islands have been ruled by Sharja, now one of the seven United Arab Emirates. But under a 1971 agreement with Britain, which was in the process of ending its protectorate over the emirates, the Iranian Government of the Shah was allowed to maintain a military garrison on Abu Musa. Civil administration of the island was divided between Iran and the Emirates when the Emirates became independent in December 1971. **********The revolutionary Government that took power in Teheran after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979 continued the arrangement with the Emirates, but began to argue that sovereignty over the islands belonged to Iran. **********These demands came to a climax last April when Iranian officials on Abu Musa began to insist that the inhabitants, including several hundred citizens of the Emirates, obtain Iranian documents or leave. **********Talks between Iran and the Emirates collapsed on Monday, with Saudi newspapers accusing Iran of expansionism and the Iranians accusing gulf governments of collusion to introduce a permanent Western military presence in the area. **********Before the talks in Abu Dhabi broke down, the Emirates formally demanded sovereignty over all three islands and the end of any Iranian military presence. The demands were rejected by Iran. The chief Iranian negotiator, Mustafa Haeri Foumani, was quoted Tuesday by the official news agency as saying, ""No Iranian would allow himself to negotiate with others on the sovereignty of his own land."" **********The strong backing given the Emirate's complaints in the last two weeks by both the Arab League and the United States has aroused concern in Teheran that the confrontation may intensify, diplomats say. **********Iran has accused the United States of inflaming the dispute to justify the continued presence of its military forces in the region. **********On Tuesday, the Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, and his Bahraini counterpart, Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, said their countries would fully back any complaint brought by the Emirates against Iran in the Security Council. **********The dispute has also halted a normalization process that had been under way between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Last week, Prince Sultan, the Saudi Defense Minister, said it was up to Iran to improve ties by abandoning its policy in the Persian Gulf."

Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York, ""these tend to be strategic or symbiotic on an operating level."" **********Among the impending and expected transactions (subject, of course, to the usual derailments over price, power and client conflict) are these: *********** BBDO Worldwide in New York acquiring the Ross Roy Group in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The two agencies share a major client, the Chrysler Corporation, which is believed to be considering a reduction in the number of agencies on its roster. *********** Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston buying a New York-based shop to strengthen its own New York office, which has lagged behind other large agencies' operations here. *********** Ketchum Communications in Pittsburgh and New York and Ayer Inc. in New York merging, combining an agency company that is stronger domestically (Ketchum) with one stronger internationally (Ayer). *********** The Lowe Group in London acquiring Scali, McCabe, Sloves Inc. in New York from the WPP Group P.L.C. in London, which has been under financial pressure from an extensive and expensive series of deals made in the 80's. **********Susan L. Decker, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco, said the transactions seemed ""more mutually beneficial this time around,"" to clients as well as to agencies. **********For instance, she added, agencies realize that ""they need more geographic breadth"" as ""clients expand into other markets."" **********The backdrop for the new round oftransactions is the industry's continuing recession, now entering its third year. **********""When the business is lousy, anything's possible,"" said James D. Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest U.S.A. in New York. ""I didn't make it up, but necessity is the mother of invention."" **********""It's obviously a highly fragmented business that is always amply populated,"" he added. ""Some of those agencies find it possible to make a go of things in this climate. Some don't."" **********Mr. Gottesman said that several of the anticipated mergers were recession-related; he characterized them as ""two guys who figure if they lean against each other, they'd stand up under the wind better."" **********Mr. Dougherty thought it telling that two likely acquisitions would involve two huge agency companies, the Omnicom Group in New York, owner of BBDO, and the Interpublic Group of Companies, owner of Lowe. **********""Essentially, there are two agency groups that have money,"" he said, ""so they have a constant stream of suitors."" **********In all the transactions, Mr. Dougherty added, ""there are none where the principals will walk off with substantial fortunes,"" which happened during the 80's, with, for instance, the acquisition of the Ted Bates agency by Saatchi & Saatchi. **********Mr. Gottesman said that because ""financing was available then and it isn't now, some of the deals, if they happen, will be mergers with no interchange of money."" **********If there is a silver lining, it might be that clients, who were mightily irked when executives at their agencies pocketed robust fortunes during the 80's takeovers, will feel better about today's transactions."

An Unlikely Scenario **********Publishers and booksellers who are enjoying the windfall from these sales chuckle at the unlikely scenario. Imagine a writer submitting a book proposal about the debt crisis and swearing it will become a best seller? It might be worthy, but a reading public that reaches for homilies and thigh exercises would never go for it. **********Surprise. It's the No. 12 book on the hard-cover nonfiction list, ""Bankruptcy 1995: The Coming Collapse of America and How to Stop It"" (Little, Brown), by Harry E. Figgie Jr., a former Reagan adviser, with Gerald J. Swanson. **********""We didn't expect these political books to do quite as well as they have, but people are really interested in the political process this year despite the fact that everyone predicted there would be all this apathy,"" said Bruce Dasse, divisional merchandise manager for Waldenbooks, whose responsibilities include books about history, biography and political science. ""What we're discovering is that people want substance. People aren't interested in the personalities so much as the issues."" **********The best-seller list reflects that interest. On the hard-cover nonfiction side, in addition to ""Bankruptcy 1995,"" is ""Earth in the Balance"" (Houghton Mifflin), by Senator Al Gore, the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate's book about the environment, which will hit the No. 3 spot on Sunday. And No. 8 is ""Truman"" (Simon & Schuster), David McCullough's biography of the former president whose name has been invoked so often in this campaign, he seems almost contemporary. **********The paperback nonfiction list shows an even sharper interest in politics and government. In the No. 1 slot is ""United We Stand"" (Hyperion) by Ross Perot, the independent candidate's program for rebuilding America. The No. 2 book is ""Putting People First"" (Times Books/Random House), by Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Gore, the Democratic candidates' program for changing America. **********Next on the list is ""America: What Went Wrong?"" (Andrews & McMeel), by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, an analysis of how the practices of Wall Street and Washington have benefited only a few Americans. And at No. 5 is ""The Government Racket"" (Bantam), by Martin L. Gross, examples of Washington waste with suggestions for curbing it. **********Some of the books were commissioned before publishers had any clue that this election would spur such interest. Others were rushed into print to take advantage of the political mood, to educate and, yes, concede the publishers, to make money. **********The popular books are mostly slim and fairly inexpensive, with all the paperbacks selling for less than $10. Booksellers say the length and the price have helped attract customers. People feel they can learn more about the issues without committing a lot of time and money. **********Charles E. Hayward, president of Little, Brown, described the books as ""almost like manifestoes."" He and others in publishing said readers clearly were interested in ""digestible"" political books, ones that concentrated on a single issue or that boiled down the essence of several important issues. Reflecting Public Opinion **********Not everyone agrees that this is a healthy trend. ""The good news is that people are buying political books,"" said David Rosenthal, executive editor of the Random House adult trade division. ""The bad news is that these are the printed equivalent of sound bites. The information is written, packaged and printed in a way that is disturbingly similar to TV."" **********One noteworthy observation about the top-selling books is that none of them is about the Republican candidates, except by implication the ones that criticize the current state of Government affairs. Even the political books that are not on best-seller lists but that are enjoying respectable sales in the stores are favorable profiles of Mr. Clinton or Mr. Perot or satirical looks at President Bush and Vice President Quayle. **********The books reflect the public opinion polls and the sentiments of many people in the publishing industry, said Steven Schragis, publisher of the Carol Publishing Group. The company's Birch Lane Press currently has two biographies on the market, one of Mr. Clinton and one of Mr. Perot. It also has a novel about an idiot who becomes Vice President. **********""The books I publish absolutely reflect my political inclinations,"" Mr. Schragis said. ""But based on the best-seller lists, I would say it's the public's inclinations, too."""

But he has avoided words widely regarded as obscene. **********Mr. Stern's agent, Don Buchwald, said neither he nor his client had any comment on the proposed F.C.C. fine. **********Even as it announced the fine, which Infinity has 30 days to appeal, the commission approved Infinity's $100 million purchase of stations in Boston, Chicago and Atlanta. Critics of Mr. Stern had lobbied the F.C.C., asking it to block Infinity's purchase of the stations and noting that fines did little to deter Mr. Stern and Infinity from objectionable broadcasting. **********Infinity's lawyers argue that Mr. Stern's broadcasts are not indecent within the meaning of F.C.C. rules. Court rulings have declared that indecent speech cannot be banned but can be regulated as to when it can be heard, Mr. Lerman said."

Under a proposal put forward by the commission in January, these companies would be forced to give up their licenses after 10 or 15 years to make room for services ranging from a generation of low-cost wireless telephones to palm-top computers that send data over the air. **********If the proposal becomes law, the new provision would protect the utilities by prohibiting the commission from designating them as secondary users that could be pre-empted by new services. **********After 15 years, new companies seeking to use the frequencies would have to submit a proposal to an outside arbitrator and would have to pay the costs of forcing the utility to use a different channel. **********Senior officials at the F.C.C. were also opposed. Anticipating a fierce battle between the rival business groups, the agency has offered several compromise proposals to microwave users. **********""Given all the efforts that the commission has made, we think it is premature to conclude that the commission is intent on harming the incumbent users,"" said Terry Haines, chief of staff for the F.C.C.'s chairman, Alfred C. Sikes. **********But the battle is hardly over. Although the appropriations bill is likely to pass the Senate, the Hollings provision is likely to run into opposition in the House from the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is headed by Representative John D.

It's like local area networks a few years ago: Everybody said, ""year of the LAN, one of the most overpromised technologies."" But you knew that it had to happen. People want to be connected, and sooner or later they're going to have to share all this stuff. When it becomes easy to use, and practical to use, then people will use it. And that's what happened. I think the same thing is going to happen with this. If we do a good job making them simple and cheap, this will be a gigantic market. I mean, I can't think that it wouldn't be, but then again, I'm more cautious than everybody else. **********Q: Why? **********A: A couple of people got too hypey about this. This is not going to happen overnight, and we just have to be careful. Pen computing already has a lot of wounds from too-high expectations.

I don't use my mobile phone; the battery life is so short. Aargh! It drives me crazy. I'll use a pay phone. **********Q: What kind of device would you like to carry? **********A: The ultimate is one I could carry like the old Hewlett-Packard calculators. People are looking at wireless devices as notebook replacements. If these devices are going to be successful, somebody has to say, ""This is as good as a notebook, but it also offers other things -- like communications."" That's why at GO we've taken a completely different approach, designed to take advantage of mobility.

But Petain went on, in World War II, to lead the collaborationist Vichy Government that rounded up tens of thousands of French Jews and deported them to Nazi camps. **********So in these days when neo-Nazi thugs are sending shivers through Europe, Mr. Mitterrand's wreath-laying gesture two weeks ago on Armistice Day left many Jews cold. Nor were they assuaged by assurances today from Israel's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister that the French President was ""a friend of Israel"" and ""the man who best knows Jews and Jewish history"" among European politicians. **********When Mr. Mitterrand went to lay another wreath today, this time at the Jerusalem memorial to the Nazi Holocaust, he was greeted by 20 protesters wearing the striped uniforms and yellow Stars of David of the concentration camps. Israeli newspapers have also roughed up the President for icily telling an Israeli television interviewer that Vichy's crimes were a French affair and no one else's concern. **********""This was a miserable declaration,"" wrote Tom Segev, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, one of many here who wondered aloud and in print how the Holocaust had become, in Mr. Mitterrand's words, ""an internal matter."" **********Barely a day passes here without some sort of echo of the right-wing xenophobia and violence that has gripped Germany and elsewhere. **********On Wednesday, when Mr. Mitterrand arrived, the Israeli press reported a sudden burst of interest on the part of European Jews to emigrate to Israel. The numbers are not large, certainly not in comparison with the thousands landing each month from the former Soviet Union. Nonetheless, there were reportedly 1,000 immigrants from France in the last year, a 30 percent increase from the year before. In Germany, 46 Jews have told the Jewish Agency this month that they may want to move to Israel, against 1 in October. **********If Mr. Mitterrand had a reaction to Jewish complaints about his recent conduct, he kept it to himself. And from his Government hosts, he heard nothing but praise and voiced hopes that the two countries would return to the close relationship that they enjoyed before. **********Not that the Israelis liked everything that they heard. The French leader reaffirmed his support for a Palestinian state, and told Israel that it had to end its aversion to talking directly with the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********But he spoke softly rather than in a hectoring tone. And in this symbol-minded city, he avoided giving Palestinian leaders all that they wanted by declining to meet with them at their headquarters in East Jerusalem, insisting that they come instead to the French Consulate in West Jerusalem. **********Mr. Mitterrand also denounced the Arab economic boycott of Israel, and, to add some substance to his visit, signed several economic agreements, including French help to modernize Israel's railways."

The South Korean company had previously bought two Canadian reactors, one completed in 1983 and the other still under construction. **********The design of the Canadian reactors is fundamentally different from that of American models. The Canadian reactors run on natural uranium, in which just seven-tenths of a percent of the fuel is uranium-235, the kind of uranium that the reactor can split to make heat. In contrast, American reactors run on ""enriched"" uranium, which is 2 or 3 percent uranium-235. **********When the fuel in an American-designed reactor is used up, it still has more uranium-235 than is present in natural ore. **********South Korea also operates six reactors manufactured by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, as well as several made by Framatome, a French company whose design is similar. **********Running a Canadian-designed reactor on used American fuel would be difficult because the two fuels differ in shape and the used fuel is highly radioactive, making it difficult to work with. But Denny Shiflett, vice president of AECL Technologies, a subsidiary of the Canadian company, said the potential for re-using the spent fuel was of major interest to the Koreans. **********Re-using the fuel will not solve the waste disposal problem, however, because putting the fuel through a second reactor will simply make it more radioactive. **********The new reactors are designated Wolsong 3 and 4, and will join the completed Wolsong 1 and Wilsong 2, which is now under construction, near Kyongju on the country's southeast coast. **********AECL says it has more reactors under construction than any other supplier. Yesterday's announcement makes three in Korea, plus two in Ontario. In addition, Romania is building five, though work there is proceeding very slowly."

When activated, it travels around gathering information, which it saves in a database. Another piece of the program is loaded on each PC and keeps track of what software and equipment can be found at that machine. This local software reports to the server on request. **********Copyright laws make keeping track of what software is present on each PC of increasing concern to network administrators. A licensing fee must be paid for each copy of a program on a network, but without a way to easily monitor what software is where, pirated goods often appear.

Offers More Flights And Cuts Fares at Kennedy,T.W.A. Offers More Flights And Cuts Fares at Kennedy," **********In a move to attract business travelers and make Kennedy International Airport more of a domestic hub, T.W.A. announced yesterday that it would add new morning flights from Kennedy to six big cities. **********Trans World Airlines also said it offer new low fares, like a $99 unrestricted one-way fare between Kennedy and Chicago, compared with $427 for the regular full coach fare. **********The new flights, to start on Monday, will provide round-trip, same-day service between Kennedy and Atlanta, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Washington and Boston, as well as Chicago. **********T.W.A. filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors last month, but Carl C. Icahn, its chairman, said then that the airline would build up its domestic system, particularly at Kennedy, where relatively full planes arrive to feed its international flights but then depart largely empty. **********Domestic flights to Kennedy have generally not been convenient for domestic travelers, since many flights arrive in the afternoon to connect with international flights, most of which leave in the late afternoon and evening. **********Growth at Kennedy has been slowing as many carriers added international flights at domestic hubs like Dallas, Atlanta and Chicago. **********But business at the airport is expected pick up. A group of foreign carriers, including Lufthansa German Airlines, Japan Airlines and Air France, has proposed building a new international arrivals building. And other carriers, like Delta, United and American, have been adding domestic service at Kennedy, but mostly to feed an increased number of international flights. American took over the London routes of T.W.A. last year; United acquired Pan American World Airways' London routes, and Delta took over most of Pan Am's remaining European routes. **********The idea of a domestic hub at Kennedy is unusual since it is harder to get to Manhattan from that airport than from La Guardia or Newark. **********Craig Plavus, the senior vice president of marketing for T.W.A., said the airline would seek to attract travelers on Long Island since they could get to the airport more easily. **********""In effect, they can fly to Chicago, conduct their business and then have return service to Kennedy,"" he said. **********For example, he said, there would be a flight leaving for Chicago at 7:50 in the morning and then a return flight at 5:15 P.M. Powerful Rivals **********T.W.A., however, is taking on powerful carriers like American, United and Delta. Some of them offer much greater frequency, including hourly flights to Chicago, as well as strong frequent-flier programs and newer airplanes. **********Kevin Murphy, an airline industry analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said other carriers would probably not match T.W.A.'s lower fares from Kennedy because such a move would dilute their revenues on many flights to match a small number of T.W.A. flights. **********Even so, he predicted that T.W.A. would attract only a small number of business travelers, since most are loyal to other carriers. **********""They will not break into the core of business travelers that fly the big three, United, American and Delta."" he said. Details of T.W.A. Plan **********T.W.A. plans to offer 13 flights a day between Kennedy and Washington and 11 flights a day between Kennedy and Boston. **********The lower fares that T.W.A. is offering will be unrestricted. A first class upgrade can bought for $50. **********Mr. Plavus said he expected most seats would initially be offered at the lower fares. **********One advantage of the T.W.A. plan is that Kennedy has few flights in the morning, so there should be few air traffic delays and crowding at the Trans World Airlines terminal. **********When T.W.A. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month, it said it had reached an agreement with its creditors to reduce its debt and interest costs, a move that should make it easier for the carrier to reorganize."

Fujimori of Peru moved swiftly today, ordering the roundup of more politicians and labor leaders and sending troops to prisons where terrorist suspects are confined. He also signed sweeping decrees to give the Government of National Reconstruction he had proclaimed a semblance of a legal framework. **********But in an effort to quiet growing international protests over what many here were calling a civilian-military coup, Mr. Fujimori ordered the withdrawal of military and police forces from television, radio and newspaper offices. They were sent there on Monday when Mr. Fujimori, with the consent of the armed forces, assumed virtual dictatorial powers. **********Close associates of the President further sought to mollify foreign critics by telling ambassadors that all but a few of the detained politicians would be released in two weeks and that plebiscites would soon be held to measure the extent of public support for the actions. **********The authorities also released Gustavo Gorriti, an internationally known journalist and expert on the Shining Path guerrilla group. Mr. Gorriti, the author of a three-volume study of the Maoist movement, was seized along with his files and computer records soon after Mr. Fujimori suspended constitutional rule, asserting a need to curb Shining Path's activities more aggressively.. **********""Initially, there has been a lack of understanding on the international level,"" President Fujimori said at a Cabinet meeting late on Monday, adding, ""This is basically due to incomplete information about the measures the Government will take."" **********Late this afternoon,Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller outlined a timetable for the creation of a ""new Peruvian republic."" Ambitious Schedule Outlined **********Within six months, he said at a news briefing, the Government intends to have drafted a new Constitution, and a plebiscite will be held within 12 to 18 months to vote on the Constitution. **********Mr. Blacker Miller said President Fujimori would ""name"" a new Congress but gave no indication when. **********He also said Mr. Fujimori would not stay in power past the expiration of his term on July 28, 1995. **********Still, international protests mounted. Argentina recalled its Ambassador and the United States froze all except humanitarian aid, cutting off assistance projected at $275 million this fiscal year. White House officials said about $45 million in the pipeline from 1991 would also be affected. Japan protested Mr. Fujimori's actions, and Germany said it would reconsider a $161 million aid program. **********The loss of the aid could be devastating for Peru. To make things more ominous, officials of the Organization of American States have been debating whether to order some form of sanctions against Peru, a move that could cripple an already weak economy. **********On Sunday night, in a national address, Mr. Fujimori dissolved Congress, took control of the judiciary and suspended the Constitution. He contended that Congress was hindering economic reforms and that the judiciary was corrupt and impeding the fight against terrorism. **********One of the mysteries that remain unresolved was the fate of Alan Garcia, the former President and the leader of the main political opposition to Mr Fujimori, the Apra party. On Sunday night, troops surrounded Mr. Garcia's house in the Chacarilla section of Lima. **********At first it was thought he was under house arrest. ""But he escaped just at the last minute and is in hiding,"" said one of Mr. Garcia's closest aides, who insisted on not being identified. ""None of us know where he is. He will wait and slowly build a political counter-force to Fujimori."" **********Mr. Garcia was President from 1985 to 1990. His administration ended in disgrace, with inflation rising exponentially during his term. Last year, he was investigated after members of Congress accused him of illegally enriching himself while in office. The Supreme Court, most members of which he had appointed, cleared him on all the accusations. **********In the last few months, he has mounted intense opposition to Mr. Fujimori's policies. President's Actions Endorsed **********The President, in an interview while walking in downtown Lima to assess the effects of his actions on the public, said Mr. Garcia and other top Apra officials would not be released quickly. He did not clarify whether Mr. Garcia was in custody. **********Two days after the seizure of power, in which Mr. Fujimori had the express backing of the military and the police, tanks, personnel carriers and soldiers were deployed outside the Congress building and the Palace of Justice. **********Today, those willing to respond to reporters' questions for the most part endorsed the President's actions. **********""We support what the President did because he is working for the people,"" said Alberto Montero, a chauffeur. ""The members of Congress are crying now because they are out of power, but where were they when we were crying for help."" **********The Fujimori Government's strategy now seems to be twofold: to neutralize the power of Apra -- at least four of the party's leaders are under arrest and warrants are out for others -- and to move decisively against Shining Path. **********A tense scene prevailed today at the Castro-Castro maximum-security prison in Canot Grando, a shanytown outside Lima. At dawn, 500 soldiers and policemen took up positions outside the prison, which houses 450 men and 180 women suspected of being Shining Path members. They live in two cellblocks and control all activities there. The authorities fear weapons and lethal material like acid might be concealed in the cellblocks. **********Troops were also stationed outside the Lurigancho Prison half a mile away, where some three dozen guerrillas are being held. **********The scenes were reminiscent of June 27, 1986, when a strike by jailed terrorists ended in a massacre of 300 in Lurigancho and El Fronton prisons. **********But the actions have yet to stop the killing by the guerrilla group. This afternoon, terrorists assumed to be Shining Path members killed a Peruvian businessman, and on Monday morning two policemen were gunned down. Lawyers Reported Seized **********The country's secret service also appeared to be rounding up people suspected of either sympathizing with the Shining Path or having knowledge of its activities. Three men who identified themselves as members of the Association of Democratic Lawyers, which defends people accused of subversion, said that five of the group's leaders had been taken from their homes by the police since Sunday night. **********Officials at the United States Embassy continued to express anger today about the actions taken by Mr. Fujimori, especially since they occurred on the day that Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, arrived in Lima for talks with President Fujimori. Mr. Aronson canceled his meeting and left for Washington on Monday night. **********Late Monday, President Fujimori swore in a new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Oscar de la Puente. Its first act was to adopt a resolution creating a legal framework for the new Government. It then declared the legislative branch dissolved until an election could be held. It also ratified the complete reordering of the judiciary. **********Government officials said the Justice Minister would soon begin removing judges and prosecuting attorneys and appointing new judges. **********Most newspapers, radio stations and news weeklies had been either censored or placed under military observation, but by late today, most of those practices appeared to have ended. Still, many Peruvian journalists expressed concern that the intimidation would lead to self-censorship. **********Members of the dissolved Congress continued to protest. ""This is nothing less than an outright coup,"" said Pedro Cateriano, a member of Congress's lower house, ""and if we do not remove President Fujimori, we will be put back into the days of dictatorship."" **********When several legislators tried to meet at the Lima Law Association on Monday, they encountered police officers who reportedly roughed up some of them. **********So far those known to be under either house arrest or in jail include Felipe Osterling, president of the Senate; Roberto Ramirez de Villar, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and other members of Congress."

The company filed the plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court here. **********The company, formed in the 1980's through a series of acquisitions, is being hurt by low prices for its products, high raw material costs and the recession. **********Under the terms of the prepackaged plan, Gaylord's bondholders will exchange their subordinated debt for about $378 million in new senior subordinated securities, six million shares of Gaylord class A common stock and 31.8 million redeemable exchangeable warrants to obtain another 31.8 million shares of class A common stock. **********The terms of the exchange are the same under the bankruptcy plan as under the exchange offer, which expired on Friday, the company said."

The pessimists concede only that recession's long winter may be at an end. So this must be the sap-rising season of spring. **********At any rate, a lot of wannabe magazines are out there trying hard to bud. **********One called Volume hopes to do so on Sept. 7. The initial test issue of the hip-hop magazine, a joint venture between Time Publishing Ventures and the film, television and record producer Quincy Jones, is a month away from closing the issue. ""The advertising response has been fantastic,"" said Robin Wolaner, vice president of Time Publishing Ventures. **********The start-up has not been without its difficulties, however. Earlier this month, Russell Simmons, the chairman of Rush Communications and co-founder of the magazine with Mr. Jones, resigned. In a cryptic statement he said that he had envisioned a magazine for the hip-hop generation but that it had ""developed more into a publication for a generation that has been influenced by hip-hop."" The statement was widely interpreted as meaning that the magazine about a black music form had become too white. **********""We've never said this was a black magazine,"" Ms. Wolaner said. ""It's for both black and white readers."" **********Jonathan Van Meter, the editor, was even more emphatic, saying that his staff was insulted by the suggestion that the magazine was ""too white."" **********""There are 7 blacks on an 11-person staff, and all 5 of the top editors besides me are black,"" he said. ""We are very interested in black music and black issues. We're more like a black-influenced Rolling Stone, but it's for anyone who listens to the music."" **********He added, ""What this really comes down to are philosophical differences about how broad and mainstream the magazine should become."" **********Volume will be in direct competition with The Source, a monthly hip-hop culture magazine now in its second year. That magazine just signed on John Singleton, director of the film ""Boyz N the Hood,"" as a contributing editor. Gathering Gossip **********Another embryonic magazine, The Industry, promises to provide gossip about music, movies, media, publishing, advertising and fashion. Its founder and editor in chief, Adam Moss, was editor of the defunct 7 Days and is currently a consultant to The New York Times. **********Seed money for a direct-mail test was provided by several top magazine executives including John Mack Carter, director of development at Hearst Magazines; Christopher Meigher, president of Time Inc.'s New York magazine division; Robin Wolaner, vice president of Time Publishing Ventures; Jack Kliger, publisher of Glamour, and Phillip Moffitt, former editor of Esquire. **********Returns are still coming in from the test and are being integrated into a new business plan that will be shown to prospective investors next month. They include publishing institutions, venture capitalists and foreign investors. **********By presenting itself as both a trade magazine for media executives and a good gossipy read for the general reader, The Industry is toeing a tricky line. Mr. Moss said, however, that he was thrilled with the results of the test, which was sent to trade and consumer lists. **********""We knew the trade lists would be strong,"" he said. ""The big surprise was how well the consumer also polled."" Lauren and Hearst **********Over at Polo Ralph Lauren, a company not exactly known for being adverse to publicity, reticence reigns. When asked what she could say about the new magazine the company is working on, the director of publicity, replied, ""Nothing."" **********""And if you use my quote,"" she added quickly, ""You can't use my name."" **********More informative reports in the trade media say that Ralph Lauren is teaming up with Hearst Magazines to produce a tony life style magazine. It is said to be at least a year from being tested, with Polo and Lauren under consideration as titles. **********If Hearst teams up with Ralph Lauren, it will be the second time in a year that the publishing company has entered a joint venture. Earlier this year it teamed up with Dow Jones & Company to publish a test issue of SmartMoney, a personal finance magazine. The test was deemed successful enough to have a second issue scheduled for the fall. **********John Mack Carter, director of magazine development at Hearst, isn't feeling loquacious, either -- not about the Lauren project and not about whatever it is that Gael Love, former editor in chief of Connoisseur, is working on, which is also the subject of trade media gossip. **********""She is working hard,"" Mr. Carter said. **********Advertising Age says Ms. Love is working on a celebrity magazine prototype to be titled Hello that is described as a cross between Vanity Fair and People, modeled after Tatler, the British publication. Out Is Nearly Out **********Then there's Out, a general interest magazine for lesbians and gay men, which not only celebrates ""coming out"" but is about to do so, in another sense, itself. On June 16, in fact. **********Michael Goff, editor in chief, said the magazine already has 8,000 subscriptions, thanks mostly to the success of a promotional compact disk called ""Get Out."" Another campaign for subscriptions will be made during Gay Pride Week at the end of June. **********The first issue, which will feature profiles and articles on culture, relationships and fashion, will have 104 pages, including 20 pages of advertising. The magazine is being financed by half a dozen private investors from the art and media worlds. **********""The reaction seems to be, 'Wow! You guys are actually pulling this off,' "" Mr. Goff said."

The spot, created by the Lintas New York agency, features scenes of pregnant women drinking alcohol, smoking and taking drugs, during which an announcer urgently warns, ""Everything you do to your body you do to your baby."" **********More and more consumer marketers are augmenting their ads these days with altruistic messages aimed at achieving goals like eliminating hunger, advancing brotherhood or fighting cancer. Companies and Their Causes **********American Express and Best Western International, for example, have a campaign on behalf of the Children's Organ Transplant Society; Members Only, an apparel company, sponsors anti-drug messages, and the Converse athletic footwear maker sponsors AIDS awareness spots. **********""Johnson & Johnson has been caring for mothers and babies for over a hundred years,"" said Phil Crosland, executive vice president of account services at Lintas. ""It's only natural Johnson & Johnson would take up a cause focusing on low birth weights."" **********But as well meaning as these campaigns seem, some people worry that the trend has disturbing implications. They fear that giant corporations will put their money where their vested interests are. **********""Often, messages that get on the air are not just in the public interest, but must be in the private interest of a sponsor,"" said Michael Jacobson, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Commercialism in Washington, which lobbies on issues involving the intersection of commerce and society. **********""You do not see ads for going to the library, or to lead simpler life styles,"" he added, ""because there's no real corporate beneficiary."" **********Critics also fear that traditional unsponsored public service campaigns, which rely on the media to donate advertising space and time, could be squeezed out by their underwritten counterparts. **********For instance, as Johnson & Johnson introduces its commercial, the Advertising Council, which for 50 years has coordinated the ad industry's public service campaigns, is introducing its own spot tackling the issue. In that commercial, created by Grey Advertising Inc. in New York, an announcer compares America's boundless resources with its infant mortality rate, adding that ""every 13 minutes, another infant dies."" **********While the council and Grey hope that television networks and stations will start running the spot today, there is no guarantee. Johnson & Johnson, by contrast, will spend an unspecified sum to insure that its spot will appear during a long list of programs like ""All My Children,"" ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Days of Our Lives."" **********Elenore Hangley, executive vice president of the council in New York, said research indicated that consumers often were more attentive and responsive to a public service ad than a paid ad, ""because of the kind of instructive information it offers, rather than trying to sell you something."" **********Still, she added, on daunting problems like improving prenatal care, ""you really have to have messages coming from many sources, in order to be effective and to achieve change."" **********David Freilicher, a senior vice president at Grey, agreed. ""If the paid component works in service of our spot, that's great,"" he said. ""For industry to get involved might mean that industry will get involved in solutions."" He added that a paid campaign's prominence might persuade publishers and broadcasters to provide more visibility for a similar unpaid campaign. **********The introduction of the paid and the unpaid prenatal-care spots coincides with a ceremony scheduled at the White House this morning by the Department of Health and Human Services to announce a Federal program called Healthy Start. The program, intended to help reduce the infant mortality rate, will focus on cities with high rates of infant deaths. Public-Private Partnership **********Johnson & Johnson devised its campaign to support Healthy Start, said David P. Swearingen, a company spokesman in New Brunswick, N.J., calling it ""a positive partnership between the private and public sectors."" He added that it was a component of a five-year $15 million commitment the company has made to a ""maternal and child health initiative."" **********Likewise, the council's unpaid spot is a component of a larger campaign, a 10-year effort aimed at helping poor children to, as Ms. Hangley put it, ""break the cycle of disadvantage."" **********""It is probably the most ambitious public-service campaign we've ever conducted,"" she said. While the average council campaign gets the equivalent of $20 million a year in donated time and space, she said, ""this is the kind of subject that would get $30 million."" **********Johnson & Johnson's annual ad budget, according to Advertising Age, was $653.7 million in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available."

They were adopted by both organizations before the close of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. **********The Western European Union also decided to draw up plans for a military operation to open a corridor for overland convoys from Adriatic ports into Bosnia and Herzegovina. A United Nations airlift has been flying in food and medicine since the beginning of the month to the besieged population of Sarajevo, the capital. Putting Pressure on Serbs **********But such an operation, which could pit peacekeeping forces against Serbian forces bombarding Sarajevo, would require a new Security Council resolution, and Western leaders here today expressed a continued reluctance to send in troops to defend the relief effort, and an even stronger unwillingness to give direct military assistance to the Bosnian Government. **********""If we were asked, we would say that other methods appear to be preferable,"" President Francois Mitterrand of France said. President Bush said, in an interview for American public television, ""People are reluctant to get bogged down."" **********But support for a new Security Council resolution appeared to be growing here, as a way to pressure the Serbian authorities to call off the attacks. New Leader Flies In **********The pressure appeared to be having some political effect, even if none was yet evident on the ground. Milan Panic, a businessman who immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia and is designated to become the Yugoslav Prime Minister on Tuesday, also flew in today to meet with some of the leaders before they started flying out. **********At a news conference this afternoon, he seemed confused about whether he was to become President or Prime Minister, dismissed the strongly nationalist President of the Serbian republic, Slobodan Milosevic, as having no power, and said repeatedly, ""God help him if he gets in my way."" **********""We must stop the killing,"" Mr. Panic said. ""I want everybody to agree to withdraw the arms, especially heavy arms from Bosnia, under United Nations control."" **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who saw him this afternoon, said that he had told Mr. Panic that the world would now demand deeds from Yugoslavia, not just words. **********The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, said he had told Mr. Panic that Russia would support a lifting of the United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia if it ended the violence, and would help get it reinstated to the security conference, from which it has been suspended until Oct. 14. **********President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who also saw Mr. Panic today, said: ""I believe that he has good intentions. Let us see what happens after he becomes Prime Minister."" An Official Statement **********As leaders scurried to leave the conference, the Finnish chairman, President Mauno Koivisto, gaveled into the record a statement on Yugoslavia suggested by President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, making it an official conference document some leaders said afterward they were unaware they had adopted. **********""The violence and aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia continues,"" it said. ""The prime responsibility for this lies with the authorities in Belgrade."" **********The summit conference, originally foreseen as a giant celebration of the end of the cold war, turned instead into a crisis meeting, to cope with Yugoslavia and try to prevent similar conflicts from erupting elsewhere. **********President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia supported the idea of a European rapid reaction force. ""The most important thing is to get such forces into action not when blood is already flowing, but at the stage when conflicts are intensifying,"" he said, speaking in the hangar-sized exhibition center hall that the Finns provided for one of the world's biggest summit meetings ever. Revivals of Animosities **********Leader after leader warned that unless the nations of the world could do something to stop the violence in the Balkans, ethnic and national rivalries could explode in many parts of the former Communist empire. **********""All the ancient conflicts, wrongs, injustices and animosities are suddenly coming back to life and back to mind,"" President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, which Czech and Slovak nationalism is tearing asunder, said on Thursday. ""The sudden outburst of freedom has thus not only untied the straitjacket made by Communism, it has also unveiled the centuries-old, often thorny history of nations."" **********Before leaving today, President Bush also talked with Mr. Havel, whose days in office are numbered after Slovak nationalists in Parliament blocked his re-election this month. Mr. Bush said that if the country did break up, it should happen peacefully, he told reporters today. **********Twenty-nine countries at the conference signed a treaty setting limits on the size of their armed forces stationed on European territory, following up a 1990 accord pledging them to sizable reductions of tanks, artillery pieces and combat aircraft. Under the accord, Germany can have 345,000 troops, down from more than 500,000 two years ago; France will have a right to 325,000 and Britain can keep 260,000 under arms. **********The United States will have a ceiling of 250,000 soldiers in Europe, though it plans to reduce the actual number to far below that. The Russian ceiling is 1,450,000 and Ukraine's is 450,000."

Chiluba,the son of a poor copper miner whose grass-roots campaign for democracy in Zambia ended the 27-year rule of Kenneth D. Kaunda in October, is in the United States this week to talk about the new face of politics in Africa. President of Zambia for barely 100 days, Mr. Chiluba speaks with the zeal of a missionary. **********""Africa has come a long way,"" the 48-year-old Mr. Chiluba said in an interview on Sunday. ""We're beginning to understand the meaning of a democratic environment, where civil liberties and human rights are observed and respected."" **********Head of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions and the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, President Chiluba is to meet on Tuesday with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council in Florida and on Wednesday with President Bush in Washington. Today, he met in Atlanta with former President Jimmy Carter, an observer for the election that brought Mr. Chiluba to power.  Eyes on the Debt **********Mr. Chiluba said that on this first working visit to the United States and Britain, he is seeking help in bolstering democratic institutions, expanding investment and reducing Zambia's nearly $7 billion debt with Western banks. Mr. Chiluba said the money, borrowed under Mr. Kaunda, was squandered on obsolete Chinese and Soviet-bloc equipment during the cold war. **********As Mr. Chiluba recounted his progression from a young socialist fired by anticolonialism to a committed free-marketer and zealous Christian, he said his life also told the story of post-colonial Africa. **********He recalled that in the late 1950's, ""all of us knew that the enemies of Africa were the Western countries."" To argue with the prevailing mood, fostered by the Soviet Union, ""was to be counted as a counterrevolutionary."" **********""The Soviet Union not only ran out of ideas in recent years,"" he said. ""It ran out of the means to assist the people it had made its friends. There is no way that a modern African country can adopt Communism, wherever it comes from, today. We have gone through the process and learned who our genuine friends are -- and what mankind really wants."" **********President Chiluba was born in the copper-mining town of Kitwe in April 1943. **********""My parents were humble people,"" he said. ""My father was a miner -- not a technician of any kind, but one of the ordinary blasters underground. I learned humility from him. I learned to accept what I was, the child of a poor family."" **********""My grandmother introduced me to Christianity, and I've never regretted that,"" he said. Zambia, with more than 8 million people, has a Christian majority, and the churches there, he said, as in Kenya and most recently Zaire, have moved to the forefront of democratic change. **********""I've lived my life intermittently running away from the Lord,"" he said. ""But in His own loving way, He has brought me back from time to time."" **********Mr. Chiluba said that he strayed furthest in his 20's, when he studied briefly in East Germany and the Soviet Union. This period is glossed over or dropped from most of his biographies. A Lesson From Watergate **********Mr. Chiluba, who later named three of his nine children Mikoyan, Castro and Hortensia (the last for the widow of the Chilean leader, Salvador Allende Gossens), said he switched from ""brainwashing to brainstorming"" in 1973 when he was sent to New York for five months as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. **********He became riveted by Watergate and the public investigation and exposure of President Richard M. Nixon. It was, he says, a crash course in political science, and it left a permanent impression of how power and the people might relate to each other. **********After winning last October's election, Mr. Chiluba said, he sought ""change without revolution,"" allowing Mr. Kaunda (who had once imprisoned him) to retire. He kept some Kaunda appointees in his administration. **********Diplomats and analysts of African politics say that it is still too soon to know how much trouble, if any, Mr. Kaunda's loyalists may cause President Chiluba. The new Zambian leader has also toured neighboring one-party states to assure their leaders that he does not intend to interfere in their politics. **********Many young Zambians, raised in the Kaunda era, are not too sure how to put the new President's message of reconciliation into effect. **********On Saturday, for example, a diplomat at the Zambian Embassy ejected the Angolan anti-Communist guerrilla leader, Jonas Savimbi, from a reception. Mr. Chiluba said he was startled to hear the report, since he had not been consulted before Mr. Savimbi was barred from meeting him."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/12/business/top-infant-formula-makers-charged-by-us-over-pricing.html,Robert Pear,1992-06-12,,1166,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Top Infant-Formula Makers Charged by U.S. Over Pricing,Top Infant-Formula Makers Charged by U.S. Over Pricing," **********The Federal Trade Commission charged today that the three leading makers of infant formula had illegally limited competition in bidding on a nutrition program subsidized by the Federal Government. As a result, the commission said, states administering the program paid higher prices, lost millions of dollars in potential rebates and provided fewer poor people with food aid. **********The second- and third-biggest producers, the Mead Johnson Nutritional Group, part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a division of the American Home Products Corporation, reached settlements on the antitrust charges. They will give the Agriculture Department a total of 3.6 million pounds of powdered infant formula, to be distributed to poor women and children.  Abbott Does Not Settle **********Federal officials said the formula had a wholesale value of $25 million but the companies estimated it at less, because they sell to government agencies for less than wholesale. **********There was no settlement with Ross Laboratories, a division of Abbott Laboratories, which had more than half the United States market for infant formula in 1990. The Government will press civil charges against Abbott in Federal District Court here and in an administrative proceeding before the commission. **********All three companies deny wrongdoing and one, American Home Products, said that while it strongly disagreed with the charge against it, the terms of the settlement ""are less costly than protracted litigation."" **********It was not immediately clear why Abbott rejected a settlement the others accepted. The charges against Abbott were more serious than those made in the complaints against the companies that agreed to settle. **********Although today's charges focused mainly on bidding in Puerto Rico, state officials and consumer advocates said they had seen evidence of activity to reduce competition in many states. **********Abbott makes the Similac infant formula; Bristol-Myers Squibb the Enfamil brand and American Home Products makes a formula called Nursoy. **********Sales of infant formula in the United States exceeded $1.6 billion in 1990. State officials have complained for several years that they could not get truly competitive bids on the product, which they distribute in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC. States run their own WIC programs with Federal money -- $2.6 billion this year -- and must comply with Federal regulations. **********The program, acclaimed as one of the nation's more effective welfare plans, serves nearly one-third of all babies born in the United States and has accounted for roughly one-third of all sales of infant formula in this country. Most of the remainder is bought by consumers in drugstores and other retail outlets without government subsisdies. **********In announcing the charges, Kevin J. Arquit, director of the bureau of competition at the Federal Trade Commission, said: ""Anticompetitive behavior in this industry is particularly harmful. Higher prices caused by illegal conduct deprive babies of a major -- sometimes the only -- source of nutrition during their first months of life. **********""Given that there is only a limited amount of money available to any one state under the WIC program,"" he continued, ""the devastating injury that results from illegal higher prices is obvious. The number of babies able to obtain formula is decreased."" **********Senator Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, said that ""nearly 47,500 infants will get the formula they need, at no cost to taxpayers,"" as a result of the settlements announced today. **********Mr. Arquit said the three companies accounted for more than 90 percent of domestic sales of the product from 1982 to 1990. **********The trade commission charged specifically that Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products sought to limit competition in bidding for WIC contracts in Puerto Rico in 1990. **********""Each of these companies sent some indication of its bidding intentions to its competitors, resulting in changed behavior and higher prices,"" Mr. Arquit said. He asserted that ""Abbott agreed to fix prices by rigging bids"" on WIC business in Puerto Rico in 1990. **********The two other companies are not accused of an agreement or conspiracy. Rather, the commission says, each conducted business in a way -- such as ""signaling"" prices -- that had the effect of reducing competition and raising prices. **********The agency also said Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb had agreed, through an industry group, to discourage consumer advertising of infant formula. Mr. Arquit said that Abbott, in particular, feared that advertising of prices would lead ultimately to stiffer competition and ""significiantly lower profits"" for the company. **********Catherine V. Babington, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said its Similac formula was marketed to doctors and dietitians, but not advertised to consumers. ""We have been consistent in our position that infant formula should be marketed only through health-care professionals because these individuals should be the primary source of information on infant nutrition,"" she said. **********Duane L. Burnham, Abbott's chairman and chief executive, said: ""We have competed responsibly, aggressively and completely within the law. We will continue to vigorously defend this position."" **********Donald G. Harris, president of the Mead Johnson Nutritional Group at Bristol-Myers Squibb, said his company had not engaged in any collusion, conspiracy, bid-rigging or price-fixing. **********Audrey A. Ashby, a spokesman for American Home Products, said her company's ""bidding policies have been and will continue to be fair, independent and in keeping with both the letter and spirit of the law."" Little Market Effect Seen **********Financial analysts who follow the companies said the settlement, which focuses on the government infant formula market, should have little or no effect on the price of infant formula for consumers. ""They are different markets,"" said Neil Sweig, an analyst at Capital Institutional Services Inc. in New York. **********From an investor's point of view, Mr. Sweig said the settlement would have little impact on the huge companies. 'It should mean relatively little, if anything,"" he said. **********Trading in the stock of the infant formula makers was temporarily halted today. When trading resumed after the F.T.C.'s announcement, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 37.5 cents, to $63.25, while Abbott Labs lost 12.5 cents, to $27, and American Home dropped 37.5 cents, to $68.75. **********The two-year investigation by the trade commission was prompted in part by a request from Senator Metzenbaum, who charged in 1990 that infant formula prices had risen in a ""lockstep pattern"" for a decade. **********The commission maintains that in a highly concentrated industry, companies can reduce competition and uncertainty without an explicit agreement, merely by sending ""signals"" of what they intend to charge or offer in discounts. **********Thus, the commission said that in March 1990 Mead Johnson sent letters to state officials in Arizona, Montana, Nevada and Oklahoma, specifying what it intended to bid on new WIC contracts. The states had requested sealed bids, and the company ""knew or should have known"" that the information in its letters would become known to competitors, thus reducing competition, the agency said."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/24/business/fed-approves-merger-of-big-california-banks.html,Andrew Pollack,1992-03-24,,489,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Fed Approves Merger Of Big California Banks,Fed Approves Merger Of Big California Banks," **********The Federal Reserve Board today approved the giant merger of the BankAmerica Corporation and the Security Pacific Corporation, which would create the second-largest bank company in the nation, after Citicorp. **********The approval was the last major regulatory hurdle and clears the way for the acquisition to be completed after a 30-day period. The Fed approval, which came on a 7-to-0 vote after two and a half hours of deliberation, is conditioned on Bank-America's meeting numerous commitments it has made regarding divestitures, financing and investment in low-income communities. **********BankAmerica, California's largest banking company, will buy Security Pacific, the second largest, in the largest banking merger in the nation's history. The stock swap, originally valued at $4.5 billion, would be worth roughly $5 billion, based on BankAmerica's stock price today of $45.625, up 37.5 cents for the day. Security Pacific stock also rose 37.5 cents, to $39.875. The approval was announced after the market closed. Dominating the West **********The new BankAmerica, with about $190 billion in assets, will trail Citicorp of New York in that traditional measure of banking size, but it will tower over its competitors in California. It will also be the largest bank in Washington, Arizona and Nevada. **********Analysts and banking industry executives had expected that the merger, announced last August, would be approved, but approval took longer than for some other recent large acquisitions, largely because the proposed merger has raised antitrust issues. There was fear, particularly in Washington State and Arizona, that BankAmerica would have too large a market share, thereby limiting competition. **********Reflecting the complexity of the issues, the Fed's order approving the merger was an unusually long 95 pages. **********""This has been the most extensively scrutinized merger in the history of our industry,"" BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive, Richard M. Rosenberg, said in a statement. Shedding Some Properties **********In February, BankAmerica reached a settlement with the Justice Department, agreeing to divest the combined banks of 211 branches and $8.8 billion in deposits in five states to resolve antitrust concerns. The Fed's order today provides a breakdown of these divestitures by market. It shows, for instance, that BankAmerica agreed to sell nearly $1.9 billion in deposits in the Seattle market and $1.6 billion in Phoenix. **********BankAmerica, which is based in San Francisco, has said it hopes to save $1.2 billion a year in operating costs by trimming redundant operations. Some of that saving will come by eliminating 10,000 to 12,000 jobs through dismissals and attrition. BankAmerica said today that it expected to take a year to combine the operations of the two banks fully. **********One uncertainty is that Security Pacific, which is based in Los Angeles, has suffered a series of losses because of bad loans. Some analysts have questioned whether BankAmerica, which had its own loan problems in the mid-1980's, is taking on too much risk. But BankAmerica officials insist the deal is a wise one."

""I lived across the street from the presidential palace,"" he said with excitement. ""I fished these waters. I ate corned beef and cabbage every Saturday in a place near here, and the city hasn't changed much."" 70's Look, 90's Optimism **********This sprawling, often elegant city, with discos with names like Satisfaction and Queen Bee, may look much as it did in the 1970's, but the marathon, with 133 runners from 26 countries, represents a real change for a country that reopened its doors to tourists only in 1987. Because of its stumbling economy, Vietnam is eager to rejoin the international community -- to attract foreign investors and foreign loans -- and this event is a way for Vietnam to show its new attitude. **********The field is tiny compared with those for the marathons in New York or Boston, where thousands take part. But for most Americans competing here, especially the veterans, this was a race that for a variety of emotional reasons, they simply could not miss. **********""I grew up with the war in Vietnam -- it was a part of all our lives -- and I wanted to be in this marathon because it was taking place in Vietnam,"" said Paul Gallagher, an American stockbroker who now works in Hong Kong. **********Jim Barker, a former United States Army intelligence officer who served in Vietnam, said, ""I came here for this marathon because I saw it as a chance for reconciliation."" **********Barker, an elite runner from San Jose, Calif., said that Sunday's marathon offered a chance ""for a healing experience, a way to bridge differences, and deal with the very intense emotional traumas we lived through here."" **********From the beginning, this promised to be a quirky, unlikely sporting event in a country where running is a new sport. The sight of aging Americans, Australians and Frenchmen running through the streets in the shimmering Saigon heat has left many Vietnamese openly gawking and pointing. 'Very Happy Time' **********""I saw some foreigners -- very old,"" said a middle-aged shopkeeper who was selling souvenir T-shirts from a small sidewalk stall. ""The foreigners were very old, but still they run. They enjoy it. This is a very happy time for them and a very happy time for us."" **********This marathon, a strange spectacle staged by Vietnamese Communists working with American advisers and using capitalist money from foreign corporations, has old enemies facing each other on a new battlefield: the race course. And most find the combination a heady, happy one, though it is laced with sadness, a sense of poignancy. **********When Anderson and three other disabled American veterans went out on the street, many older Vietnamese, survivors of the war, came up to greet them. Some shook their hands, others introduced their sons and daughters. **********Anderson and other American wheelchair athletes came to compete, and there were able to do so in a preliminary ""fun"" event today. But the Vietnamese organizers decided that because they were not prepared to field wheelchair athletes, only runners would be included in Sunday's race. American veterans had donated three racing chairs to Vietnam's sports ministry in hopes of persuading the Vietnamese to allow the wheelchair athletes to compete. 'A Peaceful Moment' **********A runner from San Mateo, Calif., Linda Shinazy, said she had been opposed to the war and had protested it by writing letters on eye-catching red stationery, ""to anyone and everyone."" **********This little marathon, she said, ""was a chance for me to celebrate peace."" **********""It's a small moment in history, a peaceful moment,"" she said. **********While hundreds of Vietnamese took part in the short ""fun"" races, only 92 will compete in the marathon, and only 8 of them have ever run a marathon before. The course winds through the center of the city, to the gritty outskirts, and into the green countryside before returning to Reunification Hall, the former presidential palace. **********Since the war ended, Vietnam has remained mired in poverty. One official here admitted that while the Communists had ""helped the masses"" take part in more sports, the people literally ""don't have the food, enough calories"" to have large numbers of regular marathon runners. **********""The few Vietnamese who were trying to train were running in running in rubber thongs,"" said Bruce Aitken, the American financial consultant who first suggested the marathon to the Vietnamese. He said that when Adidas, one of the major sponsors of the marathon, donated 1,000 pairs of running shoes, the Vietnamese, ""who are really very competitive people,"" got very interested in training. **********To open the marathon weekend, there were speeches by Communist officials wearing suits and ties and sunglasses. There were firecrackers, silky banners and dozens of red balloons released into the clear blue sky. There was even a live rock band and a special marathon song sung by Tran Tien, whom one Vietnamese explained was ""a very popular singer, known in all of Vietnam."" **********A top Vietnamese sports official said that his country hoped that by staging events like the marathon, ""We will someday be able to host something really big, like the Olympics."" **********In fact, the official, Le Buu, head of the Ho Chi Minh Sports Authority, said Vietnam planned to send a delegation to Barcelona, Spain, for the 1992 Olympic Summer Games. And while he was vague about what Olympic events the Vietnamese would compete in there, he said, ""Definitely we will send a shooting team."""

Institutions often buy into big deals for which there is lukewarm interest, so they will be favored when a hot stock offering comes along. **********""There is stock all over the Street,"" one trader said yesterday. ""People have too much, and that's why more than 16 million shares are back in the marketplace."" One knowledgeable Wall Street executive estimated that about nine million of the shares that traded yesterday were bought by Morgan Stanley.

""The whole market suffered a little bit of exhaustion today, partly because so much money was sucked out of it to go into the G.M. offering,"" he said. **********""I thought it might have been a shade firmer,"" he added. ""This means the syndicate group is in there supporting it."" **********Traders expressed some apprehension that G.M.'s shares could fall slightly when the syndicate group stops supporting, or ""stabilizing,"" the stock's price. **********The offering will add more than $2.1 billion to G.M.'s coffers -- a much-needed injection of capital for the company, which lost $4.5 billion last year."

In the leather satchel at his hip are his spectacles and the pill prescribed by his doctor after a heart attack six years ago. **********Before Sarajevo began to destruct in a war of ethnic armies two months ago, Mr. Unkovic, now Captain Unkovic of the army of the newly proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was a professor of philology, looking forward at the age of 55 to retiring and rereading some of the 3,000 volumes of literature and philosophy in his Sarajevo apartment. Now, he is a recruit in the mobilization of all male Bosnian Serbs under 60, fighting what he regards as a battle not only for Serbian survival here but for Christian civilization in Europe. **********He is a man who would be easy to caricature, a bearded academic who pours sweat when he recalls his battle experiences, who cites Shakespeare and Goethe and Faulkner and passages of ancient Serbian history to explain what motivates him to make night patrols in front-line areas within 500 yards of Muslim Slav positions. But the battle that he is part of here could well decide the fate of Sarajevo and with it what little chance there may be of this city again becoming a meeting place for divergent religions and cultures. **********It is a challenge Captain Unkovic shares with a motley brigade of taxicab drivers, mechanics, hotel cooks, salesmen, construction engineers and company directors who make up the fighting force deployed by Ilidza's ""crisis quarters,"" a military command center Captain Unkovic heads. Fight 'to Defend Our Land' **********His men stop Western reporters to inquire whether the Chicago Bulls made it to the National Basketball Association playoffs, feed bread crusts to sparrows, and go to war in denim jackets, shirtsleeves and street shoes. When the Muslim mortars and cannon start blasting the Serbian positions, the men look frightened and the voices of some come close to breaking. **********""Only a fool is not frightened in circumstances like these,"" Captain Unkovic said at nightfall today as a mortar round exploded about 300 yards from one of the turn of the century spa hotels that serve as the Serbian headquarters. As he strode off through the blacked-out hotel lobby, Captain Unkovic shrugged off the suggestion that it was hardly the work for a man with a history of heart trouble. **********""We have to defend our land,"" he said. ""What you suggest is for grannies."" **********Although the United Nations Security Council has identified Bosnian Serbs and the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav Government as the principal aggressors in the fighting, here in the city of Sarajevo the Serbian position is precarious. Only 28 percent of the population of 560,000 before the war broke out, the Serbs have been reduced to a few scattered strongholds on the periphery of the city, mainly Ilidza on the southwestern outskirts and Rajilovac on the northwestern boundary. **********Also under Serbian control and a key to the current battle is the newly cut ""war road"" that connects Ilidza to the main Serbian military barracks at Lukavica, five miles to the south, and beyond there up through the mountains that ring Sarajevo to the south. On the spurs off this road, on the heights that overlook the city, are numerous Serbian mortar and recoilless cannon positions that have been used to pound the old Muslim quarter in the heart of Sarajevo, causing heavy casualties and destroying many of the city's historic landmarks, including several of its ancient mosques. **********Because Ilidza is the end of the Serbian supply line that runs all the way to Belgrade 250 miles away, and because it abuts Sarajevo's Butmir airport, also under Serbian control, the battle to keep the Muslim Slav forces from overrunning Ilidza has become, in effect, the battle to keep a Serbian foothold in the city. **********In that, the airport is crucial. Although closed and under constant Muslim sniper fire, it has become a key bargaining chip for the Serbs, who are under United Nations pressure to allow its reopening to international relief flights that would carry desperately needed supplies of food and medicine to tens of thousands of Muslim Slavs, Serbs and Croats trapped in the city by the fighting. **********Today, Captain Unkovic and other Serbian leaders insisted that they would reopen the airport if Muslim Slav snipers hold their fire, but United Nations negotiators who arrived here this afternoon seemed likely to find that the matter is not so easy. **********In the past, Serbian military commanders have said that lifting the siege of the city and silencing their hillside guns, as the United Nations has demanded, would solidify the Muslim Slav hold on Sarajevo and effectively end Serbian hopes of reclaiming parts of the city that they want as enclaves for the autonomous Serbian Republic they have declared. **********For Captain Unkovic, success would mean a return to his three-room apartment in the city, abandoned when the war broke out, and reunion with his wife and two daughters, now refugees in the Serbian region of Kosovo. **********Whether his books have survived the widespread looting and pillaging that has devastated much of the city is another question, but there was no hesitation when he was asked what passage from his library he considered most relevant to his new role as a fighter. **********""That's easy,"" he said. ""The Prince's soliloquy in 'Hamlet.' 'To be or not to be, that is the question.' """

Revenue climbed 5.6 percent, to $1.32 billion from $1.25 billion. **********Intel's earnings decline reflects the heated competition in the microprocessor market. It also reflects increased research and marketing costs, noted Rajiv Chaudhri, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. The company's research and development outlays rose 24 percent in the second quarter, while selling, general and administrative expense rose 27 percent. Intel is currently spending about 14 percent of revenue on research and development. **********Intel shares rose 25 cents, to $56.75, in national over-the-counter trading today. **********Mr. Chaudhri said Intel's second-quarter earnings were slightly above his estimate because of a lower tax rate, but slightly below the high end of Wall Street forecasts.

This is the 5 P.M. hydrofoil, Helsinki to Tallinn, and not an empty seat can be found. These days, it seems, everybody's doing the Baltic commute. **********Flowing into Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia by ferry and high-speed launch, prop plane and jetliner, the commuters are a rambunctious assortment of corporate executives and salesmen, con men and smugglers, arms peddlers and tourists -- all travelers to the strange new world along the brittle edge of what used to the old Soviet empire. **********Since the collapse of Communism and the emergence in September of the three republics as independent countries, the Baltics have come to resemble a kind of post-Soviet Casablanca, where the once impregnable borders are now as porous as sieves and anything seems possible, for a price. **********Local officials complain that tens of thousands of Russian soldiers still billeted in the Baltics are selling off their Kalashnikov rifles and other military equipment at whatever the market will bear; counterfeit American and German money has been flooding the region, and crime in Lithuania, according to one recent survey, jumped 23 percent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period last year.  Help Wanted at Borders **********""Drugs coming out of Russia are already a problem, and we really don't have anywhere near enough people to watch the borders,"" said Auskelis Plavins, an official with Latvia's Ministry of Defense. ""We have about 2,000 border guards, and we need at least twice, maybe three times, as many as that."" **********Estonia recently received its first coast guard patrol boat, a donation from the Swedish Government. There are two such boats in Latvia. **********Set on the Baltic Sea, with their backs to Russia, the three republics have served as a kind of east-west crossroads over the centuries. Just as they have once again become a target of Western businesses looking for investment opportunities, they have also emerged as a conduit for anyone trying to move illegal goods and people in and out of the old Soviet republics. **********In February, customs officials in Tallinn seized a shipment of nearly 15,000 Makarov automatic pistols, standard sidearm issue among the former Warsaw Pact armies. Manufactured at a factory in Yaroslavl, 150 miles north of Moscow, the guns were bound for a broker on the Isle of Man, off the English coast, by way of Estonia. Officials said the boxes had been falsely labeled as containing 7,200 sports and training pistols. **********A few months earlier, the police in Estonia seized a shipment of rifles and antitank weapons, presumably sold by Russian soldiers in the region, and destined for Armenian troops in Nagorno-Karabakh, the strife-torn Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan. Passage to the West **********In Lithuania, the state prosecutor complained recently that the nation's ports had become the target of illegal immigrants, many of them African or Asian students studying in Moscow and hoping to sneak into Western Europe by way of the many new air and sea routes connecting the Baltics to Germany, Poland and Scandinavia. **********In May, six Somalis with forged passports were arrested in Lithuania while trying to board planes and ferry boats. In April, said Arturas Palavkas, the state prosecutor, officials seized several Indians, Pakistanis and Vietnamese trying to cross illegally into neighboring Poland. **********Although the Baltic republics have set up their own frontier watch since independence, both along the Baltic coast and their new borders with Russia, they remain within the Russian orbit for most practical purposes. **********There are sometimes no passport or document checks on trains or planes to or from Russia, a circumstance that has enabled American tourists in the Baltics to make impromptu sidetrips to Moscow. **********So many Americans have been turning up in Moscow without the requisite travel documents that the Russians formally complained to Washington, requesting that embassies in the region make it clear to Americans they are forbidden to travel from the Baltics to Moscow unless they have a visa. **********If the Russians are sometimes inconvenienced by the Baltics' leaky borders, so are the Finns. Finland and Estonia are separated by only 50 miles, across the Gulf of Finland, and the Finnish Government said that last year more than 3,000 boats, carrying an estimated 10,000 people, crossed the gulf. Some were smuggling goods, and many lacked adequate travel documents, the authorities said. Logging Many Miles by Water **********For many years, even when Estonia was part of the Soviet empire, there has been regular ferry service between Tallinn and Helsinki. But in the last four years, the traffic has jumped more than five times, to nearly 135,000 passengers in April, from 25,387 in April 1988. Most of the increase came in the last year. **********In addition to the slower ferry boats, at least two lines now provide twice-daily service with Russian-made hydrofoils, white torpedolike boats, which on calm seas can travel at more than 40 knots and make the crossing in less than 90 minutes. **********During the hydrofoil ride, red-suited hostesses sell cans of beer from wicker baskets to passengers in the cabin, whose interior with eight seats across resembles that of an airliner, while a giant television set blasts a steady stream of music from rock-and-roll videos."

Many of these companies are undervalued, the analysts said. **********""The market is still very cool to defense stocks as a group, but you can find some very attractive bargains if you look,"" said Phil Friedman, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. ""Just because a company faces a revenue decline does not mean it has no value."" Mr. Friedman is impressed with restructuring efforts and excess cash flow at General Dynamics, Martin Marietta and Thiokol. **********George D. Shapiro, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, suggests that investors ""look for the companies that have had a reasonably successful record in their diversification, but whose stock price the market has not yet recognized."" **********The contractor that analysts cite most frequently in this vein is the General Dynamics Corporation, which is rich in cash after slashing costs and selling many divisions as it moved to shed all businesses except tactical military aircraft, nuclear submarines, tank and space-launching systems. **********In June, the St. Louis-based contractor repurchased 30 percent of its common shares; in March, it had raised its quarterly dividend by 60 percent, to 40 cents a share. Executives said this week that given its high level of cash they would consider raising the dividend on an annual basis. **********General Dynamics' stock has risen about 40 percent this year, while the industry average has remained relatively flat. Shares of General Dynamics closed yesterday at $83.50 each, down $2, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange; analysts attributed the decline to sales by investors seeking to cash in their profits. **********Molly Roether Salky, General Dynamics' vice president for investor relations, said the contractor's new strategy is to focus on markets where it has virtually monopoly positions. ""Concentrating solely on what we do best in this industry allows us to increase shareholder value,"" Ms. Salky said. ""We don't think bigger is better. We think more profitable is better."" **********But some analysts expressed reservations about General Dynamics' approach. While Mr. Shapiro of Salomon Brothers says General Dynamics has done a good job of restructuring its business and selling off assets, he rates the contractor's stock a ""hold."" One big drawback is that the company relies heavily on Pentagon contracts, he said, receiving more than 80 percent of its revenues from military programs. **********General Dynamics' most profitable program is the F-16 fighter plane, and the Air Force has already drafted budget proposals that provide for a lower rate of F-16 purchases. Cuts in conventional forces stationed in Europe could also bring cuts in the company's M-1 tank program. And yesterday the company said it would cut as many as 660, or 15 percent, of the Space Systems division's workers over the next few months. **********General Dynamics executives have said that they expect modest declines in the company's weapons programs but that those reductions will be more than offset by growth in foreign markets. **********Another favorite of analysts is the Lockheed Corporation, whose stock has risen about 5 percent this year. Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., had about $300 million in excess cash from operations at the beginning of the year. Since then, the contractor, which is expanding into the commercial electronics business, raised its dividend by 6 percent, to 53 cents, and announced plans to repurchase 4 million of its shares. **********""Some military contractors have done well in spite of the downturn in defense spending, but over all there's still not a lot of enthusiasm among investors for this group,"" said Judith L. Bollinger of Goldman, Sachs. ""Everyone is kind of embarrassed to say that they own defense stocks. It's like they are closet General Dynamics owners."" **********Ms. Bollinger expressed optimism that military contractors would increase foreign sales, following the Bush Administration's recent decision to allow the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to sell Saudi Arabia 72 F-15 jet fighters in a deal valued at $5.6 billion. Foreign sales are typically lucrative because contractors have already recovered their investments on the technology. **********In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed finished at $46.625, up 87.5 cents; Martin Marietta's stock closed unchanged at $56.625; Thiokol finished at $17.375, up 12.5 cents, and McDonnell closed at $40, up 12.5 cents."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/11/business/the-media-business-advertising-philips-tries-to-pull-away-from-pack.html,Adam Bryant,1992-11-11,,753,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Philips Tries To Pull Away From Pack,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Philips Tries To Pull Away From Pack," **********PHILIPS ELECTRONICS N.V. must love a challenge. **********The Dutch consumer electronics giant has set out this fall to introduce two revolutionary products -- DCC (digital compact cassette) and CD-I (compact disk interactive) -- and at the same time build recognition of Philips as an innovator. **********The challenge is complicated by the fact that competitors are also pitching new products at a rate that is further cluttering the existing advertising clutter. Few people, it seems, can remember a year when so many new electronic toys were introduced at once, and the inevitable confusion among consumers threatens to hamstring early sales. **********Besides Philips's two new offerings, Sony is introducing a recordable compact disk system, Kodak is pitching a compact disk system for photographs, and a slew of competitors are jockeying for leadership in the field of multimedia compact disks. ""There is a lot out there, I agree with that,"" said Frans Schmetz, Philips's vice president of audio marketing of Philips Consumer Electronics, the American division based in Knoxville, Tenn. **********Philips needs to appear undaunted about the challenges it faces, however. The company has invested plenty in DCC and CD-I, the best arrows in its quiver for a while, and it needs to make some money. After Philips Electronics lost $2.36 billion in 1990, it posted a profit of $668 million on revenues of $31.7 billion last year. But that gain was achieved largely by cutting 32,800 jobs. **********As its name implies, digital compact cassette is a digital version of the ubiquitous audio tape cassette. CD-I refers to a Philips format for multimedia, which is the term for optical compact disks that store audio, text, graphics and video. Philips developed both systems to have what it calls ""backwards compatible,"" so that the DCC player can also play analog cassettes, and CD-I players can also play music CD's. **********With advertising campaigns for both products, Philips is trying to reach the people who like to be first on their block with new gadgets.  ""This is an audience that isn't easily impressed,"" said Michael Keel, Philips's director of advertising. **********To make an impression, the television campaigns for the products are both long on emotion and short on information. The CD-I television campaign mentions the product's full name a few times, but features a dinosaur skeleton, a seal and pinball machines melting into compact disks, using the ""morphing"" technique showcased in ""Terminator 2"" to suggest the disks capture the experience of a museum, arcade and circus. **********The DCC television ads, which broke last Friday on MTV nationally, are far more cryptic, mentioning only the abbreviation DCC but never saying what the letters represent. In the ads, an unknown clear sound drives a clown to paint the letters DCC on his mirror. A monk doing calligraphy subconsciously pens the letters. The system's features are explained in a print advertising campaign. **********Philips is spending more than $30 million on the two campaigns. The CD-I spots were created by Backer Spielvogel Bates in New York, and the DCC advertisements were created by Troon Ltd. in Santa Monica, Calif. **********With its DCC campaign, Philips is hoping to outmuscle Sony, its main challenger in the fledgling field of recordable digital music. Sony will introduce its Minidisk system in December but is sticking to print advertisements, said Mike Vitelli, senior vice president and general manager of Sony's personal audio products division. ""The initial consumers are going to be music enthusiasts, and this is a very effective way of reaching them,"" he said. **********But Philips also has a larger point to make to the general public. The company has played key roles in developing new products, including the analog cassette and audio compact disks. But the relatively low profile of the Philips name has done little to reverse the widely held belief that Sony, the market leader in compact disk products, was the sole inventor of compact disk technology. **********To blow its innovation horn, Philips has adopted ""Another First From Philips"" as its tagline. Whether the theme will make a dent is unclear, as developing a brand name in the dizzying world of consumer electronics is a ""substantial, uphill battle,"" said Robert F. Kleiber, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. Even more unclear is whether Philips's newest products and the host of other new offerings this year will succeed. ""You never know what the marketplace is going to do,"" Mr. Kleiber said."

The fledgling operation offers 57 channels devoted to 15 movies a day to about 3,000 subscribers. **********Mr. Reidy said the company told analysts yesterday that subscribers to the 57-channel system were buying pay-per-view movies at twice the rate of subscribers to a Queens system that offers four channels of pay-per-view. **********Investors had been hoping that pay-per-view television, which allows subscribers to choose from a variety of films, on a film-by-film basis, would spur revenue. The preliminary results indicate that the greater the choice, the more often subscribers will respond. **********Time Warner said earnings at each of its five principal divisions were up. The company said that profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to $611 million, from $505 million a year earlier. The increase was primarily attributable to the performance of the publishing business, where operating profit soared to $64 million, from $1 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. **********The 1991 loss was affected by a $60 million write-off connected to a restructuring of the publishing division. The company said results in the current quarter were prompted by gains in both advertising and circulation. **********Operating profit at Time Warner's music division rose 5 percent to $122 million, from $116 million, while the film division showed little growth, to $121 million, from $120 million. **********The cable division's profit rose 13 percent to $250 million from $221 million, primarily as a result of an increase in basic subscribers. **********At Home Box Office, profit rose 15 percent, to $54 million. The company said the gain resulted from increased pay television earnings, but was offset by start-up costs for Time Warner cable programming and international cable ventures."

Higgins, a Member of Parliament, a poet and one of the most prominent and articulate figures in the country, is gripping what the Irish Establishment considers the wrong end of the stick. **********After the defeat in Denmark last Tuesday of the Treaty on European Union, which promises great economic benefits to Ireland, the 51-year-old Mr. Higgins, who is universally known here as Michael D., is still one of the few national political figures urging his compatriots to vote against the treaty in Ireland's referendum on June 18. **********Polls taken before the Danish vote show that the Maastricht Treaty, named for the Dutch city where it was agreed on in December, would easily win approval here, with the support of the coalition Government of Prime Minister Albert J. Reynolds and the major opposition political parties. These include Mr. Higgins's own Labor Party, for which he is foreign affairs spokesman. **********But the Government has clearly been disturbed by the Danish rejection, fearing that if Irish voters also voted no the other members of the European Community would still find a way to go ahead with the treaty's provisions and that Ireland would lose influence in the community and important subsidies. **********Mr. Higgins has been careful not to gloat. ""As a legal document it is dead,"" he said. ""The June 18 referendum may now be an opinion seeking exercise. But it certainly helps the no vote."" **********Mr. Reynolds told a group of supporters from his Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) party on Friday: ""It is no exaggeration to say that to a certain extent the future of Europe now lies in our hands. We raise the flag for Europe. The Danes are a prosperous people. We cannot afford the luxury of a no vote."" **********The essential argument for the treaty is that it will keep Ireland solidly in the European Community, where its membership since 1973 has produced increased prosperity, partly from trade, partly from community subsidies to its poorer countries. Vote down the treaty, the Government says, and you will imperil Ireland's economic future. **********""The question,"" Mr. Higgins said, ""is whether this is a good version of Europe. Whether there is to be a viable peaceful next century predicated on a humanist agenda, with solidarity, with the rejection of statism, but including the insights of feminism and the ecological movement."" **********He also says he fears that the treaty will force the Dublin Government to curb spending and borrowing for health, education and welfare at a time when there is a world recession and increasing unemployment. **********By European political standards, Ireland is a conservative country. But it also enjoys anomalies, like Mr. Higgins and President Mary Robinson, who was the candidate of the Labor Party, which has only 15 of the 166 seats in Parliament. **********Abortion has become entangled in the referendum because there is a protocol in the treaty that says the European Community will not infringe on Irish abortion law. But there is national dispute over exactly what is abortion law, which once was thought to ban abortion comprehensively, but has apparently been broadened by a recent Supreme Court decision. Both anti-abortion groups and those favoring a liberalization now urge a no vote on the treaty. **********Michael Cuddy, professor of economics at Galway University, said Ireland needed to approve the treaty ""to insure that Europe continues plowing money and investment into the country."" **********He agreed that in a sense Ireland, with the Roman Catholic Church opposing contracepton, abortion and divorce, and with the highest birth rate in the European Community, was in effect asking Europe to pick up the bill for its overpopulation. **********""It's mean, but it's true,"" he said. ""We're saying hey, Europe give us the money and we'll continue to produce the kids, for God."" **********Mr. Higgins disagreed with such a skeptical assessment. Asked what was his view of Ireland's and the world's future, he smiled and said, ""I am encouraged by the absurdity of things."""

Hydrogen peroxide is not new as a treatment for acne, but until now it has been combined with chemicals like benzene to keep it from decomposing rapidly.

It combines the hydrogen peroxide with a polymer called polyvinylpyrrolidone, or PVP, which is widely used as a binding agent in pills and tablets. **********The result is a solid form of hydrogen peroxide, a white powder that can then be mixed with a cream or gel.

Vertical Mall Going Ahead In California"," **********A NEW YORK CITY developer says he is close to getting leases on 50 percent of the space in an office building that he plans to convert into a vertical retail mall at a key intersection in downtown San Francisco. **********Robert Siegel, who with his mother, Joan Siegel, heads a partnership called 400 Post Ltd., bought the five-story structure at the corner of Post and Powell Streets for $27 million in 1990. They proposed to expand it from 78,000 to 96,000 square feet and transform it into a shopping center for five to eight prime retail tenants. **********If the Siegels are successful, every feasible storefront facing Union Square, a public park occupying a full city block alongside the Powell Street cable car line, will have been changed from secondary to prime retailing over the last few years. **********Although the Union Square area has been the city's primary shopping district since the rebuilding after the 1906 earthquake, by 1960 the square itself was fronted mostly by airline ticket offices, branch banks and a few nondescript shops. The better stores were on side streets off the square. **********""Airlines had the space locked up in long-term leases, some of them running 40 and 50 years,"" Mr. Siegel said, adding that United Airlines held a master lease on all of 400 Post. ""We had to buy out the remaining years of their lease to get control of the property,"" he said of United. **********The year before the Siegels bought 400 Post, One Colorado Associates, then known as the Stitzel Company, completed conversion of the former Philippines Airlines Building diagonally across Union Square from the Siegel building. The project, One Union Square, signed leases with Gucci, North Beach Leather and other luxury retailers. Last year, Tiffany & Company took over the Qantas Airlines Building, and Bang & Olufsen replaced another airline ticket agency this past winter. Other tenants on the square include Hermes, Victoria's Secret and Luis Vuitton, as well as Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. **********At the time of the Siegels' purchase, competition for space was so intense that some rents jumped to as high as $300 a square foot annually. Since then, rents have dropped significantly. New leases typically come in between $150 and $200 a square foot, according to Vikki Johnson, vice president of One Colorado Associates. **********""Retailers are much tougher and wiser about negotiating deals,"" she said. ""I don't think we could ever do One Union Square again. Even if the economy improves, I don't expect rents to climb above $200, at least not in the next five years."" **********If she is correct, and several real estate brokers support her view, then the Siegels may be in trouble. Mr. Siegel said he was asking $250 a square foot for the project's 32,000 square feet of ground-floor space (a steep slope along Powell Street allows both the building's first and second floors to claim ground-floor exposure). **********Kenneth Brownell, president of Blatteis Realty, who handled the sale of 400 Post, estimated rents will need to be at least $250 to cover sales, carrying and construction costs. The costs will run high because the structure will be almost entirely rebuilt, with only the two street-facing walls remaining from the original building. **********""Good luck to him,"" said Tom Pullimen, a leasing agent with Knowlton Realty. ""Those rents don't make sense. You can pick up spaces for half the price with much better foot traffic."" **********Mr. Siegel countered that because all the other space around the square was taken by successful retailers, his project would be able to command the rents he was asking. **********""We're the only option,"" he said. ""There aren't going to be any other opportunities to locate on Union Square for years to come."" Mr. Siegel noted that he and his mother had represented such tenants as Ferragamo, Burberrys and Fortunoff and had brought tenants to retail projects in Manhattan, Chicago, Beverly Hills, Calif., and Palm Beach, Fla. Joan Siegel was the original broker for retail space at Trump Tower when it was built in the mid-1980's on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street. **********Still, Mr. Siegel acknowledged that none of the leases he had lined up had actually been signed. A few weeks ago, local press reports had him close to signing a 60,000-square-foot deal with a national bookstore chain, but he would not confirm that. He added that he was in negotiation with several ""boutique-type department stores"" to take the entire building. **********""We've had tenants approaching us, but we only want a very particular type of store,"" Mr. Siegel said. ""This is going to be very high quality, and we're not interested in renting to just anyone. Lining up the right tenants takes time."" **********There have also been reports of liens filed against the property and rumors of imminent bankruptcy. Mr. Siegel denied the rumors. ""We have all the permits in hand,"" he said. ""We're ready to move ahead with demolition of the interior. We're looking forward to a 1994 opening."""

No fewer than nine committees have contributed nearly 200 versions and amendments, including expansion of the assets of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and a requirement that utilities help pay the cleanup costs for uranium enrichment plants. **********The House Rules Committee winnowed out several amendments today, and more are expected to fall out in behind-the-scenes negotiations in the days of debate ahead. Fights Expected on House Floor **********Floor fights are expected on whether to streamline nuclear power plant licensing, allow nuclear waste disposal in Nevada and cancel oil drilling leases in Alaska's Bristol Bay, the Florida Everglades and Keys, and North Carolina's Outer Banks. **********The House bill took a big step closer to White House support and final enactment late last week when Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, dropped his insistence on a provision that would curtail carbon dioxide emissions to halt global warming. He did so after President Bush lent conditional support to an international global warming agreement negotiated in New York. **********As the House bill takes form, Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce, said it would include ""some of the things the President won't like and some things that are closer to his position."" **********He said the White House would resist emerging provisions that would limit oil drilling and require oil companies to set aside oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at times when Congress and the President did not appropriate public funds to buy oil for the reserve. But he predicted that Mr. Bush would be pleased by House tax incentives for promotion of alternative fuels and utility changes that would allow non-electric utilities to enter the business of generating electric power to create more competitition. 3 Top Democrats Battle **********The battle over what form the bill will take on the House floor pits Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and George Miller of California, all committee chairmen, in a tangle for influence. **********The Energy and Commerce Committee, headed by Mr. Dingell, approved an energy bill in March that was similar to a version passed by the Senate the month before. While that measure would not streamline nuclear power plant licensing, as the Senate bill would, it followed the Senate by loosening utility regulations. It also joined the Senate in setting targets on Federal agencies to convert their vehicle fleets to phase in use of cars and trucks that use fuels other than gasoline. **********A month later, Mr. Rostenkowski's Ways and Means Committee put a cap of $2.5 billion on utilities for disposing of the refuse from uranium enrichment plants. **********Without the support of Mr. Rostenkowski, the Republicans and a minority of Democrats on his committee eliminated a provision in the Energy Committee's version mandating oil importers and refiners to set aside 1 percent of their oil production to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The panel also approved a variety of revenue provisions would give tax relief to independent oil and gas drillers and tax incentives for vehicles run on alternative energy sources like batteries. **********The most serious challenge to Mr. Dingell came from Mr. Miller and his Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, which generally favors environmental protection measures. Mr. Miller has proposed to strike out of the Energy Committee's version a provision to allow nuclear waste disposal in Nevada's Yucca Mountain, overriding the state's public health and environmental laws. **********""Some of the turf fighting is getting in the way of energy policy,"" said Bill Magavern, staff attorney for United States Public Interest Research Group, an environmental and consumer organization. ""The battles of turf and ego are preventing the chairmen from reaching agreement on nuclear licensing, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and cleaning up nuclear fuel sites."""

The building was once an electric powerhouse that served the former Federal Reserve Bank building at 10th and Chestnut Streets, which the insurance company now occupies. **********The building is adjacent to the Arden's 150-seat theater, rehearsal studio and offices in a former church community center. It will be used for storage and shops for the Arden and other companies, said Terrence Nolen, an Arden managing director. **********Philadelphia has an ambitious long-term plan for an arts area along Broad Street -- the main north-south corridor -- on a milelong stretch running south from City Hall, in the heart of the city. **********The stretch has been designated the Avenue of the Arts. It has one theater, the Merriam; the Academy of Music, the 19th-century hall where the Philadelphia Orchestra performs; a group of older buildings that house the Pennsylvania Ballet, and a private arts school, the University of the Arts. The university has plans for a new 240-seat theater, to be called the Arts Bank, within a former bank building at Broad and South Streets. **********The main prospective elements of the plan are a new concert hall at the southwest corner of Broad and Spruce Streets, and, on the northeast corner, a new theater for the Wilma Theater Company. Both the orchestra and the theater company are still raising funds for their projects. The nonprofit Central Philadelphia Development Corporation is overseeing the development of the $250 million arts corridor. **********While fund raising proceeds, however, private theater companies are finding ways to expand elsewhere in the city, including in the older structures on the narrow, congested streets close to the Broad Street thoroughfare. The Arden is among them. **********""We needed storage, set and costume shops and a new rehearsal space,"" Mr. Nolen said. ""We thought about having to rent additional space elsewhere in the city because last year we had to cancel several acting classes because of the space shortage."" **********The new building may be used to continue shows that are held over from the primary theater, he said, or to showcase other fledgling theater groups that, like the Arden, used rented space. **********For the insurer, donating the red brick three-story building meant relocating huge stacks of files. But the effort is well spent, said Frederick Anton, the company's president, who sees the company's role as a catalyst for development in an area largely ignored in the city's development boom. **********Vacant buildings and parking lots dot the area between the Independence Hall historic area and the new office towers of the west downtown business corridor. **********""Part of it is our interest in furthering the arts, and part of it is an interest in revitalizing these four or five blocks of the neighborhood around our office,"" Mr. Anton said. ""If you've got the resources, this is an investment worth making. But generally, we don't invest in real estate."" **********The insurance company is among a group of neighboring institutions that include a shopping mall, the Gallery; Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and a large Federal office building. Large undeveloped parcels separate them. Also nearby are the city's principal existing legitimate theaters, the Walnut Street and the Forrest. **********""We've been buying properties in this area for 20 years one parcel at a time, looking to develop adjunct uses for such institutions as the hospital,"" Mr. Anton said. **********The Wilma Theater is to have 300 seats beneath a 175-space garage, built to accommodate the construction of a 30-story hotel tower above it. Designed by Alesker Rieff & Dundon Inc. for the developer, Lobro Associates, the building would ease a parking shortage for an adjacent Hilton hotel that Lobro controls and allow for expansion when the demand for accommodations dictates. **********The new $10 million building could break ground by next spring, said W. Courtenay Wilson, Wilma's managing director. The company would relocate from a 100-seat theater a half-mile away. But it has not yet reached its fund-raising goal of $6.6 million for its share of the new structure. **********""Last year we got two of our largest corporate contributions from the ARCO Chemical Company and the Provident National Bank for $200,000 and up,"" Mr. Wilson said. ""We raised over $1 million in all, but then ran head-on into the recession."" **********The Avenue of the Arts concept also includes a renovation of the historic Ridgway Library building to house the High School for the Creative and Performing Arts at Broad and Carpenter Streets."

Many of the callers mistook the statements tallying their payments for bills. **********The department sent the statement of tax payments to all people who make quarterly estimated tax payments, because every year about 30,000 payments are credited to the wrong taxpayer or the wrong year. Half the time, the department says, these mistakes are the taxpayer's fault and half the time the department's fault. **********So last month the state agency for the first time sent statements that told people how much money the department had recorded for them in 1991. The intent was to alert people before April 15 if the department records failed to show one or more payments, said Karl E. Felsen, a tax department spokesman. **********But many taxpayers thought instead that the department was billing them for the amount that was actually listed as quarterly payments received. By mid-February, 250 calls a day were pouring into the agency, including some from accountants irritated by the calls from clients. **********Four-fifths of the calls were from elderly people who receive stock dividends and bond coupons. **********The culprit was the word balance. The statement said, ""As of the above date, our records indicate that the    balance    in your 1991 estimated income tax account is . . ."" **********Mr. Felsen said the department would make some changes for 1992. ""We're going to get the word balance out of there and we're going to put in big, black letters, 'This is not a bill,' "" he said. Big Tax Bite **********The Democratic plan in Congress to limit corporate deductions for multimillion-dollar executive salaries could result in the combined Federal, state and local taxes paid by the company and the individual totaling more than a dollar for every 46 cents that an executive keeps. **********Under current law, and with only rare exceptions, publicly held companies are able to deduct the amount of each officer's compensation, no matter how great, from the corporations' pretax incomes. Under bills passed last week in the House and this week by the Senate Finance Committee, no more than $1 million in compensation would be deductible for each corporate officer as a business expense if such a measure becomes law. **********This means that not only will the executive pay tax, but so will the company, on compensation over $1 million. A large, profitable company in New York City, for example, would pay about 48 cents in Federal, state and local taxes for every dollar of compensation beyond $1 million, said Stuart Kessler, a Manhattan accountant. **********Since the House bill would also raise the tax rate for individuals on income over $1 million to 38.5 percent from 31 percent, and the Senate Finance Committee bill would increase that rate to 39.6 percent, the $1 million-plus executive would also face a combined Federal, state and local tax rate of up to 54 cents on each $1 of extra compensation, said Mr. Kessler, a senior tax partner at Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Company. The exact tax rate would depend on the executive's deductions. Footnotes *********** More older Americans have begun using Form 1040A, instead of the more complicated Form 1040, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday. The reason is that the form was expanded last year to include pension income. In 1991, the percentage of citizens aged 65 or over using the form quadrupled to 8.4 percent; through March 1 of this year, 11.26 percent of filers using Form 1040A checked the age box, the I.R.S. said. *********** The New York tax department plans to use a new data processing and computer program this summer to start checking whether taxpayers are declaring taxable interest they receive from municipal bonds issued in other states. Half of all the state's taxpayers who own out-of-state municipal bonds treat some or all of the income as free from state taxes, rather than paying tax as they should on those bonds from other states, said James W. Wetzler, the New York State Tax Commissioner. *********** The I.R.S. determined in a memo last year that a 450-pound stash of marijuana found in the wreckage of a fatal crash of a light plane should be taxed as part of the pilot's estate. Henry B. Holmes, an I.R.S spokesman, said that while the agency did not have a precedent, ""It's reasonable to assume that it would be very infrequent -- normally an asset of this nature would be very well concealed."""

Catsimatidis, said yesterday that he had bid for the remaining assets of Braniff International Airlines to speed the assembly of his new airline, Capitol Air Express Inc. **********Capitol Air, which Mr. Catsimatidis said he hoped would begin operating within months, bid $750,000 for Braniff's assets on Monday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Hauppauge, L.I. **********""There's a void in the market,"" Mr. Catsimatidis said. ""If it's done in carefully, calculated manner, there's opportunity."" **********Mr. Catsimatidis, a 43-year-old entrepreneur who started his career by opening a Red Apple Supermarket on Manhattan's Upper West Side 20 years ago, has since built an empire of food stores, gasoline stations, an oil refining company and an aircraft leasing business. He said the airline, a privately owned company based in Reston, Va., would run passenger flights out of New York City. **********Mr. Catsimatidis said he had bid principally for Braniff's government operating certificate because it could shorten Capitol Air Express's licensing procedures by a few months. Braniff's assets also include assorted spare parts and ground equipment in New Jersey, Texas and Florida. **********Since Braniff ceased operations on July 2, all its aircraft have been recovered by leasing companies. Braniff, the third carrier by that name to collapse, offered low-cost flights aimed at leisure travelers. **********Scott Y. Stewart, a lawyer in the United States Trustee's office in Garden City, L.I., said he expected to appoint a trustee this week to investigate what led to the airline's sudden shutdown, but added that so far he had no evidence of fraud. **********Other bids for Braniff's assets may be made next Monday, when a hearing is set in bankruptcy court before Judge Cecelia Goetz in Hauppauge. Because of a $75,000 break-up fee guaranteed to Capitol Air Express, a winning bid would have to top $825,000, Mr. Stewart said. **********One-fifth of the $750,000 bid, or $150,000, will be used to cover staff and other Braniff costs that are necessary to maintain the operating certificate, he said. **********Mr. Catsimatidis said part of his strategy in opening Capitol Air Express was to make use of aircraft that would otherwise remain idle. **********""I also have airplanes to fly,"" Mr. Catsimatidis said, referring to the 20-plane fleet he operates. **********Capitol Air Express represents Mr. Catsimatidis's second effort at a commercial airline operation. In 1984, he acquired a carrier called Capitol Air, but it was forced into bankruptcy later that year. He said the former owner was responsible for tax irregularities that led to the bankruptcy."

If approved by regulators, the sale will meet strategic objectives at Mellon and the American Express Company, Shearson Lehman's parent, analysts said. **********The sale will improve Shearson's bottom line and enable American Express to focus more attention on its core charge card and travel businesses. **********Mellon, which has spent almost five years wading through bad energy and real estate loans, has aggressively expanded revenue from fee-based services under its chairman and chief executive, Frank V. Cahouet. Such services, from overseeing personal investments to managing cash for corporations and handling data processing for smaller banks, supplement the more traditional revenue that banks receive from interest payments on loans. **********For Mellon, ""this was a rare if not unique opportunity to solidify their position in these fee businesses,"" said Thaddeus W. Paluszek, a vice president and banking analyst at Kidder Peabody & Company. **********""The type of price they are paying for this transaction is hefty,"" Mr. Paluszek said, ""but when all is said and done, Mellon will be better positioned in what we perceive as a difficult banking business through the 1990's."" **********For all of 1991, Mellon's service businesses accounted for about 40 percent of the bank's record profits. With the acquisition of the Boston Company, annual revenue from such businesses will increase to more than $1 billion, Mr. Cahouet said at a news conference in Boston yesterday. **********Mellon's news was not well received on Wall Street yesterday, as the price of its shares fell by $1.125, to $40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. American Express rose 87.5 cents, to $22.625 a share. **********Founded in 1865, the Boston Company was bought by Shearson for $50 million in 1981. The company provides administrative, custodial and trust services for mutual funds and pension funds, as well as foundations and charitable organizations. As of the end of June, the company had about $34 billion in assets under management. **********Bankers familiar with the Boston Company's balance sheet say the company is projecting pretax earnings of $130 million for the current calendar year. **********Under the terms of the agreement, Shearson will receive $1.301 billion in cash, $115 million in Mellon Bank common stock and about $367 million worth of 10-year warrants to buy an additional three million shares of Mellon's common stock at $50 a share. **********To finance the purchase, Mellon said it expects to issue about $150 million worth of stock in addition to that being issued to Shearson, another $150 million worth of perpetual preferred stock and about $815 million in senior debt. The bulk of the rest will be raised out of retained earnings over the next three quarters, Mellon said. **********Mr. Cahouet said Mellon expected the purchase to result in one-time after-tax restructuring charges of $112 million. Within two years, some $90 million worth of cost savings are expected from the purchase, he said. **********Upon completion of the sale, John R. Laird, chairman and chief executive of the Boston Company, will step down from those positions, while remaining president and chief executive of Shearson's Shearson Lehman Brothers division. **********W.

Mr. Seddon's Peculiar Money Tree"," **********James W. Seddon wanted to do what he could to build up a college fund for his grandchildren. So he decided four years ago to invest $5,000 for them. With this seemingly straightforward goal in mind, Mr. Seddon began an odyssey that has left him poorer, wiser and with a great deal of bitterness about how investments are marketed. **********In December 1987, Mr. Seddon, a retired executive in Mount Vernon, N.Y., saw an advertisement for the ""Money Tree,"" an investment sold by the David Lerner Organization of Jericho, L.I., that was billed as a way to save for college. Mr. Seddon, who is now 77, met with a Lerner salesman and gave him the $5,000, saying he wanted it invested in the Money Tree for his grandchildren to use over six years beginning in 1996. **********The salesman had provided him with a brochure touting the Money Tree as an investment with maximum safety, high yields, tax-deferred growth and tax-free income. It mentioned insurance twice. The investment was guaranteed by a major insurance company, it said. And, ""in addition to investment benefits, you receive a substantial amount of insurance protection."" **********It was not until a year later, when he received a premium notice for $2,000, that Mr. Seddon says he realized that what he had purchased was a $145,000 life insurance policy on his son. The policy required four more annual premiums of $2,000 each. ""I had made it very clear that I only wanted to invest $5,000,"" he said. ""I am not a rich man."" **********Mr. Seddon went to the White Plains office of David Lerner, where he was told that the salesman he had dealt with was no longer with the company. He talked instead to George Villasi, a senior broker. ""He wouldn't offer me any alternative,"" Mr. Seddon said. **********So Mr. Seddon paid the $2,000 and paid another $2,000 the following year, fearing that otherwise ""I would lose everything,"" he said. In 1990, however, he hired an attorney who ultimately worked out a new arrangement under which more of Mr. Seddon's money was shifted into the investment portion of the whole-life policy and no additional premiums were required. In return, the policy's death benefit was reduced. **********In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Villasi conceded that life insurance may not have been an appropriate vehicle for Mr. Seddon. ""I would agree that it is not what he should have been sold if he wanted just an investment,"" Mr. Villasi said. **********But Mr. Villasi argues that Mr. Seddon should have known he was buying insurance because when he made the initial investment, the North Atlantic Life Insurance Company, also of Jericho, L.I., required a physical exam for his son, who was then 37 years old. He also said that Mr. Seddon received an insurance policy illustration, which projects growth in the investment portion of a policy, shortly after buying in. Mr. Seddon said he understood insurance was involved but that ""it sounded like it was incidental."" **********Although Mr. Seddon did not report the matter to the New York Insurance Department, other consumers with questions about the Money Tree did. ""We have had complaints about David Lerner and we are looking into this,"" said Wayne Cotter, the department's director of research. He said the department is concerned about the ""nature of their promotional material. It looks as though they are putting the investment component ahead of the insurance protection to confuse consumers."" **********The 10-page prospectus ""treats the insurance component as an add-on,"" Mr. Cotter said. In fact, much of the money the customer pays goes for insurance. ""The plan I've looked at shows a fairly small return on investment,"" Mr. Cotter said. ""You could do better with a bank C.D."" **********Martin Lerner, head of the David Lerner Organization, said last week that he was unaware of any state investigation. He said that Mr. Seddon's complaint had been ""successfully dealt with,"" but also added that he was in no position to say that insurance was the wrong vehicle for him. ""When a product is presented, the needs of a client are taken into consideration,"" he said. The Lerner Organization, which only sells insurance, is a sister company of David Lerner Associates, which sells bonds and other securities. Martin and David Lerner are brothers. **********North Atlantic is not involved in the marketing effort, said E. Ernest Johnson, president and chief executive. ""Our people do not get involved in questions between the selling organization and the customers,"" he said. ""We don't have any sense of what they're selling and how they're trying to sell it."" David Lerner is one of about 100 independent marketers selling North Atlantic policies, he said. **********After extensive correspondence with both North Atlantic and Lerner, Mr. Seddon's lawyer, Glenn F. Keegan of Yonkers, reached an agreement two months ago. The death benefit was reduced to $50,000 and Mr. Seddon received a refund of $1,147 from the insurer, bringing his investment to $7,853 plus about $600 in expenses and lawyer fees. **********The illustration for the restructured policy shows that if the cash value portion grows at 7 percent a year, which is not guaranteed, Mr. Seddon could withdraw $2,200 a year for the six years beginning in 1996, or a total of $13,200, for his grandchildren's college. ""I guess we got the best we could out of a bad situation,"" Mr. Seddon said.THE RETICENT INSURER **********The David Lerner brochure promoting the ""Money Tree"" says it is ""guaranteed by a major insurance company"" with the ""highest rating available."" But it does not name the company, hardly a good sign. ""If they put a brochure together without our name on it we have no control,"" said E. Ernest Johnson, president of the North Atlantic Life Insurance Company, the insurer in question. **********In fact, North Atlantic, with about $800 million in assets, is far from being a major company. ""I would call it a mid-sized company,"" said William P. O'Neill, vice president in charge of insurance ratings at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********North Atlantic did have an A+, the highest rating, from the A. M. Best Company until 1989, said Paul E. Wish, a spokesman for Best, the biggest insurance rating agency. But the following year the rating was lowered to contingent A and last year it was lowered again, to A, where it remains. Best's explanation: new business leveled off and North Atlantic showed a modest operating deficit. **********Until recently North Atlantic did not have a rating from the three other major agencies, which charge about $20,000 for their ratings. But last year S.&P.; introduced a set of ratings, called solvency ratings, for insurers that do not request the more thorough analysis. North Atlantic received a Bq, the lowest of these ratings. That means the company ""provides vulnerable financial security,"" Mr. O'Neill said."

""Everyone knows he will run. It's not a question."" **********This week, President Suharto assumes the chairmanship of the 108-nation Non-Aligned Movement, which is holding a summit meeting in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. **********Aides to Mr. Suharto suggest that he would not have accepted the Non-Aligned post if he intended to step down as Indonesian President next year, when a constituent assembly made up almost entirely of Suharto supporters selects the President. **********President Suharto's re-election would mean continuity in a nation that was very near collapse when he came to power in 1965 as the general who put down a botched coup against Sukarno that was blamed on the Communists. **********President Suharto is credited with progressive economic programs that, bolstered by Indonesia's multibillion-dollar annual revenues from oil production, have without doubt improved the lives of most Indonesians. **********While the average income is still only about $600 a year, the economy is growing at an annual rate of more than 6 percent, and international financial organizations credit Indonesia with having done more to assist its poorest citizens than most other developing countries. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is now self-sufficient in rice, the dietary staple, and its population growth has been curbed sharply. **********At the same time, another Suharto term could mean further delays in making significant progress toward improving Indonesia's checkered human rights record or in opening up an authoritarian political system now dominated by one man. **********Business leaders are also concerned that the President's re-election will permit his six children to tighten their control over large segments of the Indonesian economy. And diplomats worry that President Suharto's return to office would only prolong the debate over what is to become of Indonesia when the Suharto era does end. **********""I don't think Indonesia could ever fragment along the lines of a Yugoslavia, but that comparison is sometimes made,"" said a senior Western diplomat in Jakarta, requesting anonymity. ""There are regions of the country that want to break away and are willing to shed blood to do it. Without a strong successor to Suharto, many unpleasant options are possible."" **********Perhaps the clearest evidence of President Suharto's intention to seek another term is his campaign to court Indonesia's powerful Muslim clerics. **********Nearly 90 percent of the population is Muslim, making Indonesia the largest Muslim nation on earth. **********Last year the President and his wife made a highly publicized pilgrimage to Mecca and, according to local news reports, was presented by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia with a gift of a new first name: Mohammed. Like other natives of the central Indonesian island of Java, President Suharto was given only one name at birth. **********The new attentiveness to Muslim affairs was politically astute. Thousands of Muslims have joined in prayer rallies this year in support of the President's re-election. **********The support of the clerics has helped blunt sniping at the President from within the ranks of the Indonesian military. Although President Suharto is a product of the army, many in its senior ranks want him to step aside to make way for a new generation of leaders, including some from the uniformed service."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/15/business/the-executive-computer-picking-the-right-microprocessor-grows-more-complex.html,Peter Lewis,1992-03-15,,1192,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,The Executive Computer; Picking the Right Microprocessor Grows More Complex,The Executive Computer; Picking the Right Microprocessor Grows More Complex," **********The world of microprocessors has changed dramatically, moving from a linear path based on power to a diversity of specialized chips. As chips advance along many different paths simultaneously, the resulting hubbub could leave customers immersed in a great deal of confusion. **********The traditional progression of microprocessing power, from 8086 to 80286 to 80386 to 80486 and beyond, is no longer quite so easy to predict now that the ""me too"" era is ending. **********For years, determining what came next was simply a matter of studying the Intel Corporation, which had the high-end personal computer market to itself. Now Intel has rivals on all sides, and it has responded with lawsuits, strategic alliances and an impressive barrage of innovative chips. **********""In a couple of years you'll have 25 to 50 different choices in microprocessors, just in terms of what the PC is based on,"" said Dean McCarron, vice president for technology at In-Stat Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz., semiconductor market research company. ""And this is just talking about the processor. We haven't even thrown in the choices of vendors."" **********Many companies are seeking to break from the pack (and restore flagging profits) by creating a greater assortment of personal computers, each tailored to specific business requirements. Business PC's may eventually be sold as communications computers, multimedia work stations, graphics and publishing computers, video computers, network node computers, pocket penpad computers, etc. **********Choosing a computer will be easier, Mr. McCarron said, ""if you're a very decisive person.,"" Of course, he added, ""If you're indecisive or easily confused, it's going to be a living hell."" **********As the chips become more specialized, the computers that they power will be marketed for specific uses. So customers need not worry so much about which chip is inside and instead should focus on how well any given computer can perform the particular tasks they have in mind. It will be rather like car shopping, where most buyers concentrate on how safe, economical or spacious a car is, happily ignoring such esoterica as the compression ratio of the engine. **********Executives who once went shopping for a ""386"" computer are now offered several different types of 386-based machines. They come in a variety of speeds, with a variety of special features, from a variety of different chip makers and computer suppliers. **********Consider this. You need a new desktop personal computer and would like either a 386-class machine, currently the industry workhorse, or a 486-class machine, the current top end of the PC line. (This assumes you have ruled out the Apple Macintosh, which is based on the Motorola 68000 family of chips, any of the many RISC-based microprocessors used in scientific and engineering work stations, and older computers based on the outdated 8088, 8086 and 80286 chips.) **********Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., now makes an i386DX, an i386SX, an i386SL, an i486DX, an i486SX, and, as of early March, an i486DX2. (Intel also continues to make the older 286 chip, but openly sneers at it.) Each chip has unique features. The 386 SL, for example, has intelligent power management features that make it well suited for use in battery-powered portables. **********Moreover, each chip comes in several different speeds, measured in megahertz, or millions of cycles a second. The higher the megahertz, the faster the chip processes data (and the more it costs). Megahertz alone is not a reliable indication of performance, but in general a 33-megahertz chip will outperform a 25-megahertz chip. **********Intel's i386DX chip comes in four versions: 16, 20, 25 and 33 megahertz. Its i386SX chip comes in three: 16, 20 and 25 megahertz. The relatively new i386 SL chip comes in 20 and 25-megahertz versions, and the 20-MHz version is further divided into cached and cacheless variations. The i486DX is available at 25, 33 and 50 megahertz. The i486SX comes in 16, 20 and 25MHz versions. **********Customers have had some of these choices for years. But, as in the case of the 386 SL and its power management, Intel is starting to increase the differentiation. **********Last week Intel introduced the i486DX2, a ""clock doubling"" chip that operates internally at 50 MHz, but which communicates with the computer's internal data bus at 25 MHz. The Tandy Corporation uses the 50-MHz i486 DX2 chip in its new Tandy 4850 EP personal computer (base price $2,699), which Tandy says operates about 70 percent faster than Tandy's regular 25-megahertz 486 machine. A 66-MHz i486DX2 is expected soon, and Intel has talked about a 100-MHz chip. **********Intel also recently introduced a low-voltage i486SX, which operates on a power supply of just 3.3 volts, compared with the 5 volts of conventional chips. A series of low-power chips is expected, which, because they do not require big batteries, will enable portable computers to get smaller and lighter. **********And if all that is not enough, Intel is expected to introduce sometime this summer an entirely new family of chips, code-named the P5. Many analysts suspect that the P5 will eventually be rechristened the i586, and there is no reason to believe that it will come in fewer varieties than its predecessors. **********And as they say in those late-night television ads for the razor-sharp knife -- but wait, there's more. If you buy a 386-level PS/2 computer from the International Business Machines Corporation, you may be offered a 386 SLC chip. The 386 SLC is a proprietary chip based on the Intel design, but I.B.M. has souped it up to offer higher performance. I.B.M. initially used the SLC for its Ultimedia PC, but will soon use it as a ""value added"" feature on other PS/2 machines. **********I.B.M. has also demonstrated a prototype of a chip very much like Intel's i486DX2. Intel and I.B.M. have an agreement to share chip technologies for the next 10 years, suggesting that we'll see many more I.B.M. computers with highly specialized chips. **********If you buy a 386SX computer from some other company, there is a one-in-five chance that the chip is made by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale, Calif. Advanced Micro has the right to make and sell clones of Intel's 386 -- not exact copies, but functionally superior, the company claims. Intel responds that customers are moving to 486-based systems anyway. **********Of course, Advanced Micro says it plans to clone the Intel 486 and 486SX chips as well. Soon it will not be the only company cloning Intel's chips. Chips and Technologies Inc. (recently sued by Intel for patent violations, and countersuing on the same charge), Texas Instruments, Cyrix, Nextgen and perhaps others have said they will offer 386-like chips. **********But there is at least a possibility that the 386 chip may be obsolete by the time these companies reach the market. So much innovation is going on that a plain vanilla clone may not be able to generate any profits. **********""You're not getting basically the same chip 20 different ways,"" Mr. McCarron noted. ""Everybody is bringing something to the party. Everybody is going back to the fast and hard rule of the microprocessor industry -- innovate or die."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/09/business/a-quiet-alteration-at-brooks-bros.html,Stephanie Strom,1992-11-09,,1361,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,A Quiet Alteration at Brooks Bros.,A Quiet Alteration at Brooks Bros.," **********When Brooks Brothers installed escalators in its flagship store on Madison Avenue three years ago, it incited something approaching hysteria among its clientele. The offending contraptions, standard fixtures in most stores of more than two levels, became the symbol of unwelcome change at an institution that had stoically upheld the status quo for well over 150 years. **********Today the escalators rarely arouse the attention of anyone other than the occasional repairman, and the revolution they were supposed to portend has failed to materialize. Brooks Brothers has instead undergone an appropriately subdued metamorphosis, evident in Hermes-esque neckwear, stylishly faded sports shirts and stirrup pants hanging unobtrusively alongside the rep ties, button-downs and kilts that are the chain's signature merchandise. **********Its most obvious deference to the times is the liberation of its boxer shorts, now ensconced in help-yourself fixtures instead of discreetly housed under glass counters. Owned by British Retailer **********After four tumultuous years in which economic recession and life-style changes made the nation's oldest retail clothier seem every bit of its 174 years, Brooks Brothers has finally started giving Marks & Spencer P.L.C. a return on the $750 million it spent to acquire the company in 1988. **********In a recent interview, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks & Spencer, firmly set aside the persistent rumor that the British retailer wanted to sell Brooks Brothers. ""We're here for the long run,"" he said, although tartly adding that Marks & Spencer had paid too much for its American subsidiary. **********For the year that ended on March 31, Brooks Brothers' sales rose 4.6 percent to $314 million, an increase that was somewhat better than average compared with other American retailers. But operating profits accelerated 64 percent, thanks to stringent cost controls and computerized inventory management systems. For the first six months of fiscal 1992, through September, operating profits rose 30 percent from the comparable period a year ago, while sales increased about 10 percent. **********""The message today is: we're back,"" said William V. Roberti, president of Brooks Brothers, who nonetheless is still sensitive about the escalators. He refused to have his photograph taken anywhere near them. **********Independent assessments of the chain's status are difficult to obtain. British investment analysts who follow Marks & Spencer say Brooks's parent keeps news about its American stepchild to itself. And since Brooks contributes less than 2 percent to the bottom line and generates only about 3 percent of the British retailer's revenue, they find it easy to ignore. ""I'm quite sure you know much more than us,"" said one analyst at a major British investment bank. Locked Into a Niche **********Retail consultants contend that Brooks's very strength, its lock on the niche market for traditional clothing, is its weakness. They say Brooks has so locked itself into that niche that it cannot respond to changes in tastes. ""They cannot go out of suit,"" said Walter K. Levy of Walter K. Levy & Robert E. Kerson Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm. ""They have no credibility with the updated customer."" **********The chain has also been dogged by questions about the quality of its merchandise and its relevance in a world enamored of deconstructed casual clothes, jeans and Lycra. It narrowly averted a strike by unionized employees this spring, and the weak economy in Japan is buffeting its stores there. **********Most recently, Consumer Reports gave a lukewarm rating to a $595 Brooks Brothers suit called a Brooks Ease, the chain's second-best seller in tailored clothing. While the magazine's panel, which tested 17 men's suits, gave the Brooks suit high marks for tailoring, it did not like the way it dry-cleaned, its finishing details or its price. In fact, the panel preferred $240 and $325 suits from J. C. Penney to the Brooks suit. **********The peppery Sir Richard is undaunted, although irritated, by such adversity. ""Men have got to have a trouser to cover their backsides,"" he said, putting into perspective others' concerns about the impact of currency fluctuations, the weak Japanese economy and declining sales of the tailored suits that were once Brooks Brothers' bread and butter. **********For men who still want a suit but do not want to spend $500 or more, Brooks has developed what it calls the Wardrobe Collection. Using new dyeing techniques that allow it to match different bolts of fabric instead of having to use the same bolt of woven fabric to create a suit, Brooks Brothers has cultivated sales of ""suit separates,"" pants and jackets for men whose waistlines are out of synch with their shoulders or who simply want to mix and match. The Wardrobe Collection, with jackets priced at $270 and trousers for $125, gives Brooks a bridge to customers who are looking for more moderately priced clothes. **********As for Consumer Reports, Sir Richard said, ""I find it utterly appalling and disgraceful that any trade paper, magazine or newspaper can, on the basis of one garment when we sell thousands and thousands, use that garment as a yardstick by which we are judged."" **********Mr. Roberti said the suit used by the magazine to test quality had been made in 1989 in a factory the company no longer used. He said new technology in tailoring and sewing had improved all of Brooks's suits since then. **********And the computerized systems Marks & Spencer has installed to monitor Brooks's inventory, distribution and buying should insure that no suit made in 1989 is available for sale in 1992. In the use of computers to reduce costs and increase productivity, Marks & Spencer is the British version of Wal-Mart, and the parent has shared its expertise with its subsidiary. **********Sir Richard said he had been shocked by how backward the chain had been when Marks & Spencer had acquired it, technologically and physically. On his first visit to the flagship store, he tripped over a hole in the carpeting. **********""We had to maintain all the best traditions of Brooks Brothers and what it stands for, but that doesn't mean we have to keep it dowdy and hidebound,"" he said. ""We want to attract somebody who wants more than a gray flannel suit."" **********Unlike many of its competitors in the tailored clothing business, Brooks has recognized a fundamental shift in the psyche of its customers. Unemployment has affected the ranks of loyal suit wearers in banking, law and financial services, and those who have managed to hang on to their jobs think twice about paying $600 for a new suit. More fundamentally, corporate culture is relaxing, making twill pants and a sportcoat acceptable attire in an increasing number of workplaces. Permanent Taste Change Seen **********""I don't see the suit business coming back,"" Mr. Roberti said. ""The life-style change we're seeing now is permanent."" **********Brooks is keeping step with what it calls the Friday shirt, a less formal shirt with a button-through breast pocket, and items like whimsical ties and soft, pigment-dyed shirts that should generate $1 million in revenue for Brooks this year. The chain introduced varsity jackets, this fall's fashion statement, three years ago, and at $195 the garments are competitive with those The Gap has made famous. **********Therein lies perhaps the most nettling of Brooks' problems: getting its message out to new, younger consumers whose tastes are markedly different from that of their grandfathers. While the Gap has unabashedly used eye-catching advertising to make varsity jackets de rigueur, at Brooks Brothers they have been a well-kept secret for three years, like many of the chain's other gems. **********But Mr. Roberti and Sir Richard shake their heads emphatically when asked whether Brooks will use advertising to draw attention from a new clientele. Mr. Roberti said the chain was instead using thirtysomething models in its catalogues to convey its unbuttoned side and posters in each of its departments to clearly spell out the message that Brooks Brothers clothes have value. **********""We don't spend a whole lot on advertising and marketing -- don't believe in it,"" Mr. Roberti said. ""The downside is you don't get recognized for doing anything."""

The strike is Germany's fir...",647,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Public Employees Strike in Germany,Public Employees Strike in Germany," **********About 2.6 million public service workers officially went on strike over pay in Germany today, setting the stage for wide disruptions throughout the western part of the country beginning with the start of the workweek. **********The strike is Germany's first major labor strife since the reunification of East and West Germany in October 1990 and the first by public service employees in western Germany since 1974. It is a clear reflection of the severe economic pressures on Germany as the Government struggles with the growing costs of unity. **********The strike will primarily affect western Germany. Workers in formerly Communist eastern Germany have separate contracts with lower pay. A Stagnant Economy **********The strike could do significant harm to Germany's economy, which has been virtually stagnant since early 1991, economists said. Since Germany has the strongest economy in Europe, a lengthy strike could also erode economic recovery in other European countries and also reduce the market for American exports. **********The full force of the strike will begin to be felt on Sunday night, union officials said, when public transport service will be curtailed throughout western Germany. The strike is expected to severely disrupt train and street car service, as well as postal delivery and trash collection. Many Government agencies will also be affected. **********""We will show very quickly that nothing runs without public services,"" said Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the Union for PUblic Services, known by its German initials O.T.V. **********The O.T.V., Germany's largst public-sector union, announced this morning at its Stuttgart headquarters that 88.9 percent of members casting ballots had voted to strike in support of their demands for a 9.5 percent pay raise.  The strike vote began last Wednesday. Breakdown of Talks **********Negotiations broke down in mid-April after a panel of independent arbitrators recommended a 5.4 percent wage increase. The unions accepted that offer, but the Government rejected it as too high. **********Union officals said today that government employers would now have to come up with more than the 5.4 percent to compensate workers for their strike losses. The workers will receive a portion of their pay from union strike funds during the walkout. **********Tranportation and sanitation workers account for the bulk of the O.T.V.  membership. **********The railroad workers union also announced the results of its strike vote today, which showed that 97 percent of those who voted favored a strike. **********Postal workers were the first to endorse a strike, announcing their tally Friday and then staging a wildcat walkout at Hamburg's central post office. Postal officials said about 20 tons of mail would be left untouched over the weekend in Hamburg alone. **********Rudolf Seiters, Germany's Interior Minister and the chief government negotiator, called on the unions to return to the bargaining table, but also blamed them for the impasse.Demand for 9.5% Increase **********""The irresponsibly high demand from the union of more than 9.5 percent have prompted excessive expectations,"" Mr. Seiters said. He was referring to the O.T.V.'s demand for a one-time payment of $300 above the 9.5 percent increase. **********While the strike is nominally for higher wages, economists and labor experts view it as a showdown over how western Germany will divide the immense costs of rebuilding eastern Germany's economy and social structure. The dispute pits Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition Government, which is strongly supported by German business, against the nation's labor unions and their traditional ally, the Social Democratic Party. **********Regardless of the outcome, many observers believe the strike may herald the end of the close alliance between government, business and the powerful trade unions that formed the basis of West Germany's post-war economic recovery and political stability."

Hungary's phone system is so creaky that many phones are still hand-crank models from the 1920's, and the network simply cannot handle the volume of calls. **********That is why cellular telephones that bypass the traditional networks have become something of a rage in this capital city. In the last two years, Westel Radiotelefon, the joint venture here of the state-owned carrier and U S West, the regional Bell operating company based Englewood, Colo., has signed up 12,000 subscribers for its cellular service. **********Westel's customers talk on their cellular phones an average of 400 minutes a month, triple the average in Germany and more than four times the average in the United States. **********In many ways, Westel could provide a model for introducing modern telecommunications into the formerly Communist Eastern Europe, putting in place a sought-after service before the Government has time to upgrade the existing land-line telephone network.

Sugar, Westel's managing director, an ebullient engineer with white hair and a tan, who bears a striking resemblance to the fashion designer Giorgio Armani. ""We still have much to learn, but our customers are already almost putting a halo around our heads. Ah, that is good for business."" **********By the end of this year, Westel's cellular telephone coverage will extend to more than two-thirds of Hungary, up from one-third in 1991. That will allow many of the more than 10.5 million people in this country to get their first taste of personal phone service. Many villages have only one telephone, previously housed in the local police station and now -- post-Communism -- found in the church or post office. **********In the countryside, more and more people are hearing on radio broadcasts the chirpy Westel advertising slogan, ""Put down your bicycle! Use your Westel telephone!"" Technical Limits **********But there are problems, too. Westel's network uses frequencies in the 450 megahertz range on the electromagnetic spectrum, because that was the only portion of the radio-frequency band not being used by the military. That frequency is incompatible with both the current analog and coming digital equipment of Western Europe and the United States. **********And because of the limited size of Westel's network, it has a theoretical maximum of about 48,000 subscribers, or less than 5 percent of the 1 million subscribers of the regular phone network. **********And within Hungary, while cellular telephones are highly reliable for calling other cellular telephone users, they have only as much luck as Hungary's regular phones -- a call-completion rate of 40 percent -- when calling the vast majority of homes, businesses and government offices. **********What is more, Westel's cellular phones cost more than $2,500 to buy (triple the most expensive cellular phones in the United States, though about the cost of a regular phone in Hungary) and $1,000 to activate. That is in a country where the average laborer makes about $230 a month. **********Of course, this is also a country where taxes are high, tax evasion is a popular sport, and the all-cash underground economy is Hungary's biggest growth industry. Many more people, in other words, may be able to afford a cellular phone than the official wage data would indicate. **********Sales of cellular phones and service will generate at least $50 million for Westel this year, up from $25 million last year, and the company is well on its way to profitability, despite high start-up costs. It has 220 employees and expects to have 10 sales offices nationwide by the end of the year. **********Demand, no doubt, stems from a dilapidated phone network of 1 million regular phones, 400,000 of which are in Budapest. As in the former Soviet Union, the Communist Party wanted to keep phone service scarce and primitive to facilitate eavesdropping while crimping the flow of communication among citizens. The Party itself had good phone service, known as the ""K"" line (for the first letter of the word for ""central"" in Hungarian). The K line, however, was open to only 4,000 elite subscribers. **********Today, as a result, there are only 2 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants in a country of more than 10 million people, one of the lowest levels of phone penetration in Eastern Europe. By comparsion, France has 50 lines for every 100 people and Sweden nearly 70 -- the highest rate in Europe. **********""So now in Hungary today and especially Budapest,"" said Dr. Geza Gosztony, the wiry, intense chief adviser to the state-owned Hungarian Telecommunications Company, in an interview, ""it is relatively easy for the top officers of concerns to talk to each other, but not to any normal people below them, the ones who do the actual work!"" **********As in other Eastern European countries, Hungary's economy is faltering because of the economic collapse of its principal trading partner, the former Soviet Union. Inflation is still high, currently about 25 percent, but down from 35 percent last year. Hungarians are feverishly trying to increase trade with their main Western trading partners, nearby Germany and Austria. **********An improved phone service is essential to economic growth pursuit -- and the more phones the better for a company like Westel. There was much muttering among Hungarian entrepreneurs recently about a deal for a large Hungarian dairy cooperative that fell through because the potential purchasers, from Italy, were shocked to find there was no telephone or phone lines anywhere nearby. **********Hungary is so backward in terms of telephones that the country's telecommunications officials think the nation has the chance to scrap its antiquated system and leapfrog the current cellular and regular phone technology, once standards and technical approaches that are still being developed by international conferees are settled within the next five years. An Extensive Investment Plan **********Meanwhile, the Hungarian Government plans to spend 112 billion Hungarian forints, or about $1.7 billion at current exchange rates, from government funds and Western loans to modernize the telephone network. The amount constitutes a vast number of Hungarian forints in a country still burdened by $21 billion in foreign debt, the highest per capita of any country in Eastern Europe. **********The network investment is badly needed however, for the introduction of advanced digital switches to replace 40-year-old electromechanical switches, the source of the abysmal call-completion rate. **********Hungary, therefore, is actively looking for European and American financial institutions for investments. ""Are we looking for partners?"" said Dr. Gosztony, the Hungarian Telecommunications official. ""The door is always open."""

I dreamed that the man who invented Muzak invented something else."" **********Sit down, Ms. Tomlin, and sip a chamomile tea. He has invented something else, or at least the company that bears the Muzak name has. Under the company's newly changed ownership, the service will eventually be offered to millions of stores, restaurants, factories, banks and other offices -- in other words, almost every business and government building in the country. **********Muzak now plays in about 200,000 locations in the United States. But a new kind of monster Muzak -- music as well as electronic data messaging and other services -- could be made available to many more locations. ""We see the market as being six million establishments,"" said John R. Jester, president of Muzak. Under New Ownership **********Muzak Limited Partnership, based in Seattle, is the world's best-known provider of business music (Muzak frowns on ""elevator music""). But as part of an ownership change earlier this month, Muzak now wants to be known as ""a high-tech provider of broadcast communications services."" **********Late last month, Centre Capital Investors L.P., an affiliate of Lazard Freres & Company, the Wall Street investment firm, and executives of Muzak bought the privately owned company from Marshall Field 5th, the millionaire scion of the Chicago department-store family, who bought the company in 1986. **********Muzak's management will now own 15 percent of the concern, Centre Capital will own 75 percent, and the balance will be owned by Muzak's banks, including the Union Bank of Switzerland. The purchase price for the management-led buyout was not disclosed, but it is believed to be close to the company's annual revenue. Dun & Bradstreet estimated Muzak's 1991 revenue at $55 million and the number of employees at 465. Data by Satellite **********While 90 percent of its business still involves providing background music, Muzak now beams a variety of business services from two powerful satellites in stationary orbit more than 22,000 miles above North America. **********Leasing capacity on a Hughes SBS-6 satellite and a similar General Electric K-2 satellite, Muzak is now offering a direct-broadcast satellite service to customers like Pepsico's Taco Bell and Associated Wholesale Grocers, a huge buyer for supermarkets. Through small rooftop satellite dishes, Taco Bell can now update prices, process menu changes, even conduct audio broadcasts of the chief executive from headquarters to 1,800 company-owned stores. **********Muzak, a method of transmitting music over electric utility lines, was invented in 1922 by George O. Squier, a retired general in the Army Signal Corps. Intended as a kind of pay-per-listen service, Muzak was quickly eclipsed by commercial radio in the 1930's. The service was then offered to businesses, where it found a small but successful niche. **********But Muzak, the company, has always had trouble distributing Muzak, the music. Eventually abandoning the power-line method, Muzak began distributing its service through tape machines, which because of their constant use, frequently broke down. It also used broadcasts over special FM-radio transmitters, which were expensive to license through the Federal Communications Commission and could broadcast only a few miles. **********Five years ago, however, Muzak began to develop the satellite delivery of its music services, charging customers an installation fee of $200 to $500, and a monthly fee of $45 to $75 a channel. With the satellites, Muzak can now offer its products to nearly every business with a rooftop. Muzak as Motivator **********A dozen channels are available, including adult contemporary. But the most popular channel, making up half of Muzak's orders, is something called Environmental Music with Stimulus Progression. This is the familiar instrumental versions of, say, the Beatles' ""Michelle,"" with a swelling string section instead of the Fab Four. **********The stimulus part comes from the manner in which the sequence of songs is organized to counteract employees' ""fatigue cycles."" Under this form of conditioning, the afternoon shift at a factory, say, hears perky upbeat songs. **********Aided by satellites, Muzak's march will continue, said Mr. Jester, the president. Asked what the world would be like without Muzak, he replied, ""It would be a bleak-type situation."""

On the other, the cellular phones. **********The protests that have shaken Thailand this week may long be remembered, not just for the brutal Government response, but for the way Thailand's middle and upper classes, fast growing and until now largely silent, stepped forward to demand a say in their Government. **********To a degree that few of the protest organizers seem to have expected when the demonstrations began, thousands of Thais have been turning up at anti-Government protests this week, offering the use of the material benefits of their new affluence, mobile phones and fax machines, in particular, to try to make a revolution here. **********Some Thais, in fact, are calling this week's events the ""cellular phone revolution."" **********The cellular phones and fax machines have made it possible for demonstrators to remain in touch even as the Government has tried to crush their protests and cut off their communications. The phone lines of many of the organizers suddenly went dead this week, a problem overcome thanks to the cellular phones. **********""This will not be like Tiananmen Square,"" said a 42-year-old garment manufacturer, although the protesters in China, too, made use of fax machines. **********""In China, there were only the students, and they were too hotheaded and they did not have the support of all of the people,"" he said of the 1989 student protests in Beijing that ended in a Government crackdown and many deaths. ""In Thailand, all the people are joining together. Together, we have great power -- the rich people, the poor people, the young, the old, everybody."" **********He joined with thousands of students late Tuesday night at a demonstration at Ramkhamhaeng University here. **********The Thai middle and upper classes have a reputation that many of their millions of members admit they deserve -- money conscious, status conscious and too often willing to compromise principle so long as their lives are comfortable. **********But the appointment of Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon last month as Prime Minister seems to have changed the way many Thais look at their Government and at themselves. **********Their attitude relates, like so much of Thai culture, to the principle of saving face, of retaining a sense of personal dignity. **********While many Thais could support -- or at least not actively oppose -- a Government dominated by the military, they could not accept the repeated and very public untruths told to them by General Suchinda, who was the nation's supreme military commander until his appointment as Prime Minister last month. **********General Suchinda had promised that he would not accept appointment as Prime Minister only months before he did. He vowed that he would never appoint Cabinet members who had been accused of corruption -- then quickly did. **********""I have lived all my life under governments that were controlled by the military and I have not complained,"" said a 34-year-old American-educated banker, who makes the eqivalent of $25,000 and who until this week had never been to anything resembling an anti-Government rally. **********""I cannot accept that Suchinda would tell the public so many lies,"" he said. ""I have children. What do I tell them about their country if the man who runs their country cannot tell them truth? How can they take pride in Thailand? Every time Suchinda speaks, he insults us with more lies."" **********The banker, whose home fax machine is being used by student demonstrators to transmit the hastily drawn up schedules for this week's anti-Government rallies, was one of several clearly affluent Thais at the rally Tuesday night at Ramkhamhaeng University. **********Most of the crowd was young, which was not surprising for a university rally. But there were several clusters of protesters in their 30's and 40's and 50's, wearing designer clothes and expensive watches and carrying the cellular phones that are a favorite status symbol. Their cars, expensive, late-model and mostly Japanese, were parked beyond the nearby barricades."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/world/manchuria-shows-economic-decay.html,,1992-02-09,,760,,The New York Times,World,News,article,MANCHURIA SHOWS ECONOMIC DECAY,MANCHURIA SHOWS ECONOMIC DECAY," **********Ice-covered old Russian and Japanese buildings are a constant reminder of the foreign intrigues played out here in Manchuria, during past decades when Moscow and Tokyo coveted this vast region in Northeast China. **********Looking at Manchuria these days, one wonders why they wanted it. **********While the region was once the nation's industrial powerhouse, these days the buildings are mostly dilapidated and the vistas are cast in shades of gray. The economy is dominated by huge state-owned companies that specialize in inefficiency, and China's moves toward the market over the last dozen years seem not to have inspired people here as much as dizzied them. **********Along Stalin Avenue here in Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, the street name seems quite appropriate: decrepit gray concrete buildings blend into each other, resembling Russia more than the rest of China. Few apartment dwellers on the ground floor have converted their homes to private shops or restaurants, a common practice in southern China. **********""The way of thinking is different here,"" said a 19-year-old woman who has been lucky enough to get a secure job at a state-owned company. ""In the south, people just want to make money and they start very young at doing business. But here, folks just want a stable job. It's not that we look down on entrepreneurs. We just don't want to go into business ourselves."" **********With its economy dependent on arthritic state-owned companies, Manchuria is suffering from slow growth rates and rising unemployment. The area has almost become an economic backwater, and most Chinese now seem to look in the other direction for economic leadership: to the dynamism of private and collective enterprises in southern coastal provinces like Guangdong and Fujian. **********""Lots of people here are just sitting around, waiting to be assigned to jobs,"" said a 43-year-old laborer in Changchun. ""The factories are in trouble, so they can't take you. Kids want to join the army, because afterward you can be assigned a job. But everybody else is also scrambling to be a soldier, so it's tough to get in."" **********""A lot of folks -- kids mostly -- go down south to look for jobs,"" the man continued. ""You can earn good money down there. If I were younger, I'd go myself."" Lure of Natural Wealth **********The economic problems are perhaps surprising, because the three northeastern provinces that make up Manchuria -- Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang -- are rich in agriculture and in timber, gold, coal and iron ore. The region also possesses what has long been the most productive oil field in China -- Daqing -- although it is likely to be displaced by new oil fields in the far west of the country. **********Lured by this natural wealth, Japan sent troops here in 1932 and set up a puppet state called Manchukuo that lasted until 1945. Then the Soviet Union ""liberated"" the area, occupied it for a year and stripped it of much of its industrial equipment. The Soviets continued to have designs on Manchuria's resources, and the border was heavily militarized after the Sino-Soviet split led to a border clash in the region in 1969. **********When China emphasized central planning, from the 1950's through the 1970's, Manchuria was the nation's pride. Changchun became an auto-manufacturing center, Shenyang was the steel center, and Daqing the oil base. Many of the Communist propaganda heroes -- like ""Iron Man Wang,"" an oilman who symbolized grit, and Lei Feng, a young soldier who loved the party so much that his dreams were of Mao Zedong -- achieved national fame while working in the northeast. **********The economic restructuring in the 1980's was a shock to those lumbering state enterprises that dominate the northeast, for they seemed unable to adapt to market forces. Manchuria's share of China's industrial output has fallen from about 25 percent three decades ago to less than 13 percent today. **********In 1988 and 1989, the young Governor of Liaoning Province made some valiant efforts to introduce market reforms. But those efforts collapsed with the 1989 crackdown and the Governor was transferred. Now there is little sign of any important economic experimentation in the northeast, and the focus of reform these days is on Shanghai and Guangdong. **********Apparently sensitive to Manchuria's economic decline, provincial officials refused to allow a reporter to visit and conduct interviews with state enterprises. After months of refusals, a visit was finally permitted but interviews were allowed only on other topics."

The President has demanded that the Japanese lower barriers to American exports of autos, farm goods and other products. Denies Any Contradiction **********""I don't think it's contradictory at all,"" Mr. Bush said. ""We've never said we're totally pure. We're working for freer and fairer trade, and the Japanese should work for freer and fairer trade."" **********He said that while he would not pledge to end Washington's subsidies of American wheat exports, he would consult with Australia to insure that those subsidies are aimed at markets where American farmers compete with Europeans, not with Australian growers. **********He raised his criticism of Japan's trade policies another notch at the news conference, refusing to disavow a remark by his departing Commerce Secretary, Robert Mosbacher, that Japanese trade barriers have caused an economic recession to deepen in the United States. **********The United States has a $41 billion trade deficit with Japan, and Mr. Bush has argued frequently that increased Japanese purchases of American goods would stimulate domestic growth and create thousands of jobs. **********""The answer to all of this, whether Japanese-U.S. or Australian-U.S., is to get these economies going through expanded trade,"" he said. ""But anytime you have an extraordinary trade imbalance, you'd have to say that contributes to sluggish growth."" **********Earlier, in a speech to Australia's Parliament, Mr. Bush said that plans to close the United States naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines, a major training, repair and supply installation for American forces in the Pacific, would have no impact on Washington's commitment to defend the region. **********""Let me put it plainly: I have served in Asia personally in time of war and in time of peace,"" he said, referring to his Navy service during World War II and his stint as United States Ambassador to China. ""Our role and our purpose as a Pacific power will remain constant. It is important for the people of Australia to understand this. We will remain engaged."" **********Planned cuts in the Pentagon budget and the loss of two American bases in the Philippines -- the other installation, Clark Air Base, was abandoned after it was buried in volcanic ash last summer -- have stirred concern among Pacific allies that the American military shield in the region will erode. **********But Administration officials said this week that they intend to reach new agreements in the region that will spread the defense burden between Washington and its allies. **********An accord signed last year with Singapore, where Mr. Bush is to fly on Saturday, is cited as a model for the new arrangements. American jets are being stationed at an air base there and Singapore military pilots are being trained to fly American jets for their country's own defense. **********Addressing Australia's economic concerns in a meeting earlier today with Prime Minister Paul Keating, Mr. Bush tried to enlist the country in his campaign to lower global trade barriers, suggesting that Asia and the United States together could persuade a stubborn Europe to end a costly war over farm exports. Linking Subsidies to Trade Pact **********Mr. Bush did not make an explicit offer to do what the Australians want most: end American export subsidies. **********But a senior Administration official with Mr. Bush's party indicated on Wednesday night that the White House was prepared to abolish not just those supports, but an entire network of multibillion-dollar farm subsidies should a global agreement be reached to lower trade barriers. **********The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Bush Administration was already studying the removal of some of American farmers' most sacrosanct trade barriers, including laws that protect sugar, rice and dairy products from any serious foreign competition. **********The official said a preliminary Administration analysis had concluded that American farm subsidies and quotas cost American consumers $65 billion annually in higher food and clothing prices. **********The disclosure of the analysis, in addition to Mr. Bush's pledge to insure that subsidies do not unfairly target Australian farmers, suggested that the White House is already taking heed of complaints by Australia and Japan that his Asian tour, billed by him as a crusade for free trade and American exports, was all stick and no carrot. **********Several hundred Australian farmers marched through Canberra today to protest American agricultural policies, and Mr. Keating was said to have given Mr. Bush a personal note stressing farmers' objections to the wheat subsidy program. Official Concedes Point **********In his interview on Wednesday, the Administration official conceded that that point was a valid one. **********""You've got to be fair and honest about trade barriers, and we've got them,"" he said. Should the European Community agree to a global reduction in quotas and subsidies, he said, ""we're willing to take steps to end this game"" of trade protections. **********""But in the meantime,"" he added, ""we're not going to unilaterally disarm."" **********The official said Mr. Bush wanted to convince Mr. Keating that the quickest way to end American trade barriers is to force Europe to abandon protectionist policies that set off a trade war over farm goods in the first place. **********A draft proposal that would require all nations to reduce subsidies and quotas for a variety of commodities by 20 to 36 percent is awaiting trade negotiators in Geneva. Talks on a new worldwide trade agreement have been stalled by disputes over farm exports, but are to resume on Jan. 13. Sending a Signal **********The United States favors using the draft proposal as a starting point for a final agreement, but the European Community is balking at the notion. **********""We'd like to send a signal that the U.S. would like to work from this draft"" to fashion a final accord, the senior official said. ""But it'll take the Asian countries to send a message to the Europeans that they'd better work with it too"" or risk being isolated in future trade negotiations. **********Mr. Bush spent an hour and a half in private talks today with Mr. Keating and his Cabinet, then met for half an hour with Australian farm groups that planned to press him on the trade issue. **********Although Mr. Bush has talked extensively about free trade on his trip, his stated commitment to use the trip to showcase American exports and create American jobs has so far has been invisible. **********Nine of the 21 American business executives who agreed to join Mr. Bush on the Asia visit accompanied him to Australia, but except for a brief drop-by at the Parliament house today they have yet to be seen or heard from. **********Nor has Mr. Bush said much about American business concerns here. In a shift from the President's own emphasis of recent weeks, officials are beginning to stress the importance of strengthening American military and geopolitical alliances, a move that suggests that the White House fears that expectations have been raised too high at home for a Presidential triumph on exports and jobs on this tour."

No Intention of Resigning **********Before the debate, some French opposition leaders who back the treaty urged the 75-year-old President to stay out of the ""oui"" campaign because his present low popularity could lead some frustrated voters to reject the treaty as a protest against his Government. **********But tonight Mr. Mitterrand reiterated that he did not regard the referendum as a plebiscite on his 11 years in power. In contrast to de Gaulle, who left office after being rebuffed in a plebiscite in 1968, he has previously indicated that he will not resign even if France rejects the treaty. **********Adopted at a meeting in the Dutch city of Maastricht last December, the Treaty on European Union is a blueprint for turning the European Community into a major world power by committing the 12-nation bloc to adopt common foreign and security policies and to create a single regional currency by 1999. **********The treaty cannot enter into force until ratified by all community members. Denmark rejected it in a referendum on June 2, and many experts believe it could not survive a French rebuff. Polls last week indicated that French voters were evenly divided on the issue, but two polls made public on Wednesday gave a narrow margin to the ""oui."" **********Chancellor Kohl's acceptance of an invitation to join the debate tonight reflected growing anxiety throughout Europe over the outcome of the French vote, with financial markets already speculating that elimination of the goal of a single currency could bring widespread currency instability in Europe. **********""Every citizen of your country must know that on Sept. 20 you will decide about a piece of our common future,"" Mr. Kohl said tonight, speaking through a translator. ""There are moments of destiny for Europe and this is one. The advice of a friend is: know how to seize this chance."" **********But Mr. Kohl's participation also entailed political risks. French opponents of the treaty protested angrily over foreign intervention in a French internal matter. ""If Mr. Kohl wants to express himself in a debate on a referendum, why doesn't he hold one in Germany?"" Philippe Seguin, the opposition leader who took part in tonight's debate, asked on Wednesday. Raising the German Specter **********Germany has been drawn into France's referendum campaign because both supporters and opponents have tried to bolster their arguments by using the specter of an all-powerful Germany, a Germany with which France has twice gone to war this century. **********French Cabinet ministers have warned that rejection of the treaty would weaken the commitment of Germany to European integration and tempt it to assert its economic might independently. Opponents of the treaty, on the other hand, have argued that the treaty would serve to consolidate German domination of Europe and would subject the French economy to the ""dictatorship"" of a single currency and monetary policies controlled by Germany. **********Addressing French television viewers tonight, Mr. Kohl said he could not understand French fears. ""France has a great and proud history,"" he said. ""France has contributed enormously to European and world culture. Why should France suddenly have an inferiority complex?"" **********Other European leaders have spoken out on the French vote. Spain's Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, and Sweden's Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, both took part in pro-treaty meetings here on Wednesday. But Prime Minister John Major of Britain turned down an invitation to join the debate tonight. **********Broadcast from the auditorium of the Sorbonne University in Paris, the three-hour debate before an invited audience provided the first opportunity for Mr. Mitterrand to deal directly with the fears that the treaty has suddenly awakened in many French voters. **********In the first section of the program, the President took questions from a dozen ordinary citizens -- some in favor of the treaty, some against -- who were selected by a polling company. The most emotional moment came when a 42-year-old farmer, Vincent Tourne, accused the European Community of carrying out ""veritable genocide"" against French farmers. **********Mr. Mitterrand, who spoke in a soft and almost pedagogic manner throughout, responded that, while community agricultural subsidies were being reduced, it was the community that had kept alive French farming. ""Farmers would have disappeared long ago without the community,"" he said. **********In the second section, which preceded Mr. Kohl's 10-minute appearance, Mr. Mitterrand jousted with three experienced journalists. The highlight, though, involved a 45-minute debate between Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Seguin, a 49-year-old neo-Gaullist Senator who has emerged as the main leader of the ""non"" campaign. The Opposition's Arguments **********Mr. Seguin argued that the treaty would give too much power to unelected community technocrats, that it would construct a federal Europe that would sap French sovereignty and that it ignores the needs of the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe. **********Mr. Mitterrand responded point by point, noting that the treaty would increase political controls over technocrats, that France would be willing to cede some functions but not sovereignty, and that the community was open to all European nations ""that are willing and able to join."" **********Whether or not the President won over skeptics tonight, he seemed very much at ease, speaking without notes and often referring in detail to the treaty to rebut his critics. ""I do not seek a personal vote of confidence in myself,"" he insisted. ""I want Europe to be given a vote of confidence."""

The project, called Canary Wharf, is the largest private real estate development under way in the world and is widely believed to be straining the company's substantial financial resources. **********Olympia & York has had to pour more than $1 billion into the first section of the project. But with the sharp downturn in London office values and rents and with vacancies rising, Olympia & York has had trouble leasing it. Still, it has managed to refinance some completed parts of the project.  Due Date of Loan at Issue **********According to court papers filed in London last week, Morgan Stanley, one of Olympia & York's leading real estate financial advisers, is demanding about $240 million for a 500,000-square-foot Canary Wharf building it constructed and agreed in 1990 to sell to the real estate company. Olympia & York has responded that it has another six months before it has to pay Morgan Stanley the money. **********Olympia & York has experienced difficulties with various assets over the last year. The company, which is privately owned by the Reichmann family of Toronto, has moved to raise cash by selling off some of its stocks and other non-real estate holdings. **********Real estate executives contacted yesterday said that given the company's penchant for keeping as much of its financial affairs as far from public view as possible, the willingness of Olympia & York to go to court might indicate that it was trying to buy time before coming up with such a hefty sum for Morgan Stanley. **********Some executives think there may also be wider implications beyond cash problems at Olympia & York. Many corporate tenants who signed letters of intent to move into Canary Wharf office buildings received assurances from Olympia & York that Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston would each own a tower in the complex. They also expected a host of other large corporations to provide a central core of tenants. **********It is not known whether these other tenants and owners were aware that Morgan Stanley had an agreement allowing it to sell its headquarters building to Olympia & York upon completion. **********In the claim filed in the High Court of Justice in London last week, Morgan Stanley Properties Ltd., a unit of the New York investment house, said it had designed and built the Canary Wharf building for its own use. Since about 1987, Morgan Stanley had an agreement with Olympia & York that the real estate company would own the ground lease on the property while Morgan Stanley would own and occupy the building for 25 years. **********In 1990, that deal was changed so that once Morgan Stanley had finished the property and moved in, it had the option to sell the building to Olympia & York. **********That ""put"" option, as it is called, gave Morgan Stanley the right to demand that Olympia & York buy the property for $240 million anytime from Dec. 12, 1991, to June 30, 1992. In November, Morgan Stanley told Olympia & York that it was exercising its option and that it wanted the real estate company to buy the building on Dec. 12. **********So far, Olympia & York has refused and is arguing that the dispute is simply a technical disagreement on timing. Olympia & York says in its court papers that it has until June 30, when it intends to exercise its ""call"" option on the property. Financing the Building **********Morgan Stanley has already moved most of its London operations into the Canary Wharf project but is now left with the carrying costs of the building, which was financed through the assets and cash flow on Morgan Stanley's balance sheet rather than with the usual outside financing. **********Morgan Stanley now wants the court to force Olympia & York to buy back the building, plus pay interest and damages for breach of contract. **********Morgan Stanley executives refused to discuss the lawsuit or the details of their company's contract with Olympia & York. Several real estate executives in New York said the court battle was unusual, in part because Morgan Stanley's real estate finance group often works for Olympia & York on refinancing projects and the two companies have a longstanding business relationship. **********For more than a year now, many New York real estate executives have been saying that Olympia & York has been squeezed for cash because it owns millions of square feet of office space in New York and London, two deeply depressed commercial markets. Olympia & York typically borrows heavily against its properties and is facing large debt financing obligations. **********The company has had to offer very generous deals to get tenants to sign leases in the Canary Wharf project, which is miles from London's traditional business district and which has more expensive rents. By having to offer such incentives as years of free rent, the project has proven quite costly to Olympia & York. **********In 1990, the Reichmanns, the largest owners of New York office space, including the World Financial Center, attracted considerable speculation when they hired Lazard Freres & Company to try to sell 20 percent of their United States portfolio. The sales effort failed, in part because the market had begun to sour. **********Many executives said the family wanted too much money for their debt-laden portfolio of New York office buildings. Recently, one mortgage holder reappraised 60 Broad Street, an Olympia & York tower near Wall Street, and marked down the value of the building by more than 50 percent."

After thousands of years of getting by with animal proteins like blood, waxes and ingredients from plants to glue things together, the human race has applied its rapidly expanding knowledge of chemistry to create a widely diversified multibillion-dollar industry. **********This business has good prospects for continued innovation and growth even though some of its traditional markets, like packaging, may shrink because of environmental concerns. **********""It may be one of the most fragmented industries in the economy,"" said William Broxterman, president of the Chemquest Group, a Cincinnati-based consulting firm. ""It is a market where an unusually broad array of raw materials is used as well as a broad array of formulation techniques."" **********While plenty of adhesive sales these days reflect that one formulation is stealing business from another, industry executives say, there are new markets developing for replacing mechanical fasteners like nails, staples, string and even welds. Adhesives cost from about 15 cents a pound to $50 a pound or more for specialty products. **********Hidden Uses  5 Kinds of Adhesives To Make a Cigarette **********The market for adhesives is growing rapidly, in part because of the improved capabilities of adhesives, but changes in product design are also important. For instance, auto makers trying to save weight are using more plastics, which are often held in place by adhesives, instead of metal parts, which have typically been attached mechanically. The average car has more than 20 pounds of adhesives. **********Even the simplest products often use adhesives in invisible ways. Disposable diapers use them to keep layers of material in place and on the tape that replaces diaper pins. An envelope with an address window is constructed from two different adhesives, not counting the glue that one licks to seal it. A filtered cigarette uses five different adhesives. **********""The average person doesn't realize the extent to which adhesives are involved in their lives,"" said Allan Bergman, general manager of the adhesives division of the National Starch and Chemical Corporation, a Unilever subsidiary that is one of the world's largest adhesives producers. **********The adhesives business is often divided into the pressure-sensitive and non-pressure-sensitive segments. Pressure-sensitive applications, including adhesives used in bandages, tape and labels, typically involve less-permanent bonding than products in which the adhesive is sold attached to some other material as part of a finished product. **********Products using pressure-sensitive adhesives are a $13 billion market worldwide, with $3 billion to $4 billion accounted for by the cost of the adhesives, according to Arthur Higgenbotham, group vice president for tape at the 3M Company, the international leader in the pressure-sensitive segment. **********The non-pressure-sensitive, or structural, adhesives market covers products used in applications ranging from tooth implants and bookbinding to plywood assembly and packaging for microwavable popcorn. Most of the 600 or so adhesives manufacturers in the United States operate in this segment, which requires less capital investment. **********Estimates of the size of the worldwide market range from $8 billion to $13 billion, depending on how it is defined. Henkel of Germany is the world leader, followed by National Starch and two other American companies, H. B. Fuller and the Loctite Corporation. **********The dividing lines between the two segments are beginning to blur. 3M, for example, has pressure-sensitive products it calls semi-structural because they have been used to stick together telephone booths and suspend the ceiling at the United Airlines terminal at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. **********Product Improvement  Modifying Surfaces And Formulas **********Adhesion boils down to ""the quality and quantity of intimacy"" between surfaces, according to Kashmiri Lal Mittal, technical education specialist at I.B.M.'s offices in Thornwood, N.Y., and editor of the Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology. **********Put another way, how thoroughly an adhesive fills all of the nooks and crannies of the surfaces it bonds with and what kinds of molecular or surface attractions it undergoes are the two factors in how it will perform. **********There are numerous ways to improve adhesion. One of the hottest areas of development at the moment, according to Dr. Mittal, is improving bonding by using more acidic adhesives with surfaces high in base compounds. **********Until recently, formulators of adhesives had little information about the acid-base characteristics of widely used substances. They tended to focus on the effects of other variables easily found in technical tables, such as how conducive the surface tension of a compound would be for easy spreading. **********Researchers also work on modifying surfaces to improve adhesion. The top few hundred molecules of a surface -- less than 1 percent of a hair's width -- control its adhesion characteristics. Surfaces can be modified chemically, with lasers or other forms of light, or electrically. **********Figuring out just how good an adhesive is can be a challenge. Although there are a number of standard tests, each one has its critics. There are now more than 250 ways to measure adhesion, Dr. Mittal said. **********The Pollution Pressure  Safer Products, Cleaner Factories **********Environmental regulations and concerns have become a driving force in the adhesives industry in product design and manufacturing. The most obvious area has been in the steady retreat from adhesives that release solvents into the air when applied. **********Not only do the adhesives manufacturers want to use less solvent to comply with Clean Air Act restrictions and other regulations, but so do their customers. John Ray, head of H. B. Fuller's adhesives, sealants and coatings groups, cited a recent case in which a leading potato-chip manufacturer that had been using bags with layers laminated with solvent-based adhesives needed a different formula to be able to expand production at a plant in an urban area. **********Most of the effort to find alternatives has focused on improving the performance characteristics of water-based adhesives. But such adhesives tend to be weaker and less resistant to moisture and heat than solvent-based formulas. **********Manufacturers say they are still struggling to come up with acceptable alternatives for applications like shoemaking. Despite an accelerating decline that has reduced solvent-based formulas to about 12 percent of the market, some manufacturers still find it worthwhile to invest heavily in pollution control equipment that will allow them to continue to make solvents for certain markets. **********Manufacturers are also racing to develop adhesives that do not interfere with the recyclability of the products they are used in. Some have faced heavy investments in waste-water treatment as well. The cumulative impact has been to increase the pressure on small companies to merge or close down. **********There are less definable concerns looming as well. As leading consumer products companies seeking a ""green"" image introduce smaller packages and reusable packages, for example, total demand for adhesives in that huge market segment could fall.  DISCOVERING SUPERGLUE BY ACCIDENT **********The story of how Eastman Kodak's chemical subsidiary in Kingsport, Tenn., stumbled on the cyanoacrylate family of adhesives -- popularly known as superglues -- is a longtime favorite of industrial researchers. **********The first hints came during World War II when Harry Coover, a young chemist in Kodak's Rochester research laboratories, began studying acrylates for possible use in clear plastic gunsights but gave up when they stuck to everything they touched. **********In 1951, researchers at the Tennessee facility were asked to search for a heat-resistant acrylate polymer that could be used to cover the cockpits of jet aircraft. When Fred Joyner spread the 910th compound on the list between two lenses on a refractometer to take a reading on the velocity of light through it, he discovered he could not separate the lenses. His initial reaction was panic at the loss of the expensive lab equipment. Fortunately, his supervisor was Dr. Coover, who realized that the acrylates, particularly the cyanoacrylates, might make powerful adhesives. **********It took seven years to get the first product, called Eastman 910, to market. The product introduction featured an appearance by Dr. Coover on the television show ""I've Got a Secret,"" where a single drop of the glue was used to bond two pieces of a device that lifted him and the host, Garry Moore, off the floor. **********Kodak was never able to capitalize commercially on the discovery, however. It sold the business to National Starch in 1980."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/22/business/at-work-and-now-the-sticky-floor.html,Barbara Noble,1992-11-22,,742,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,At Work; And Now the 'Sticky Floor',At Work; And Now the 'Sticky Floor'," **********THEY are the workers who dispense driver's licenses, take care of the mentally ill and keep the paperwork moving. Some of what they do is the most difficult or aggravating work around -- utterly essential jobs that twirl the wheels of state and local government, yet pay badly and provide little hope of a better future. **********Many of these workers are women, and the glass ceiling that so frustrates their female professional counterparts is for most of them irrelevant, a realization that prompted researcher Catherine White Berheide to offer a more appropriate building part to serve as a metaphor for the occupational frustrations of women. Ms. Berheide, a sociologist of work at Skidmore College in upstate New York, proposes the ""sticky floor"" as an image to encapsulate the plight of hundreds of thousands of women trapped in low-wage, low-mobility jobs in state and local government. ""There are barriers to women at the top, but that's not the only problem,"" she said. ""We're overlooking the bulk of women."" **********Ms. Berheide, in research done for the Center for Women in Government at the Albany campus of the State University of New York and released earlier this month, reports that 55 percent of the three million or so women in state and local government jobs across the nation work in the lowest-paying employment categories. Only a quarter of all men -- and just a fifth of white men -- work in those categories. **********The employees in question are paraprofessionals, like home health care aides and child support workers, and ""administrative support"" or clerical staff. Women of color occupy the lowest classifications in disproportionate numbers: 63 percent of Hispanic women working in local and state government hold lower-level jobs, while the number is 61 percent for African-American women and 57 percent for Native American women, figures that Ms. Berheide believes reveal the persistence of racial barriers, even at government agencies that have worked hard to eradicate them. The ""sticky floor"" includes a third, male-dominated category, service/ maintenance workers, in which men of color are overrepresented. Workers in the three lowest categories typically make less than $20,000, even when they've been on the job full time for as long as 10 years. **********The numbers have improved since 1980, but mostly because of a drop in the relative number of low-paying jobs and not commensurately with attempts to reduce inequality. ""If you think of the efforts since 1965 and the Civil Rights Act, it suggests the problem is more difficult and intractable than anyone thought,"" Ms. Berheide said. ""Occupational segregation is very resilient. It responds to efforts to change it by reconstructing itself in a new way."" **********THAT is at least in part because of something anthropologists, as observers of human behavior, have known and tried to tell economists, mere students of markets, for years: ""women's work"" -- jobs typically filled by women -- is valued less and rewarded less because it is done by women, not primarily because of market forces or the law of supply and demand. **********Ms. Berheide argues that much government work is seen as ""women's work"" in part because it taps skills that are thought of as female: the ability to handle difficult people or to work with children and the elderly. ""We have sets of norms about the jobs and the people who can fill them,"" Ms. Berheide said. ""Who is good at making angry people calm down? Women."" **********Yet ""people skills"" are not in job descriptions. ""We don't recognize or compensate for the grief workers take from the public: angry citizens in line or on the phone,"" Ms. Berheide said. ""They are relatively powerless to do what the citizen wants them to do."" **********Although Ms. Berheide's study is based on data collected from state and local governments by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she thinks it can be generalized to the Federal Government and to large corporations that have the same well-defined career paths and job classifications as government. She warns that the employee's point of entry into an organization sets a career trajectory. Only an employer willing to beat down structural barriers -- and there are some, especially in government -- is likely to provide upward mobility to employees who begin in the lowest categories. ""It requires acknowledging the socio-emotional content of work,"" Ms. Berheide said. ""We have to go outside of the way we've usually thought about these things."""

Of the nation's 11 million adults, 8.6 million have elected to take part, creating the prospect of overwhelming direct involvement in emergent Czechoslovak capitalism. **********Nothing so sweeping has been tried elsewhere in Eastern Europe, although more cautious approaches to privatization have been adopted in Poland and Hungary. Russia and all the other countries of the region will be following the Czechoslovak experiment closely, and the plan could point the way for the other countries of the former Soviet bloc if it succeeds. **********But the dearth of accurate information on companies and the abrupt arrival of hundreds of mutual fund managers peddling some apparently risky deals have caused analysts to warn that the process could degenerate into a fraud-ridden free-for-all. **********With elections looming next month in which Mr. Klaus is a leading candidate for prime minister, the sale amounts to a crucial test of Czechoslovakia's ability to move smoothly to what would be a democratic market economy boasting one of the world's highest rates of individual shareholding. **********Waiting in post offices to submit their books of vouchers, most people seemed confident that they would make money. ""I'm investing in the state bakery because my daughter is an apprentice baker,"" said Marta Ernygeiova, an employee at the Israeli Embassy. ""Moreover, people have to eat bread, so I really don't think the company can go bankrupt."" **********Another woman, Emilia Prochaskova, said she was investing in the brick company where her husband works. She added that her decision was based on the belief that ""privatization should make everyone at the firm a good business person and so earn us all money."" **********Each of these women, like all the 8.6 million people taking part, had acquired a book of vouchers for 1,035 crowns, or $37. The booklet, on sale since late last year, contains slips allowing people to bid a total of 1,000 so-called 'points' for selected shares. Sales of the voucher booklets are limited to one per adult citizen.  Market Auctions Planned **********All the stock on offer initially has the same price of three shares per 100 points. But as offers are examined over the next few weeks, the market will come into play. Oversubscribed shares will not be distributed and will be offered again at a higher price. Meanwhile, the price of remaining stock in companies that have attracted too few bids will be lowered. In all, the process of auctions is expected to take about three months. **********Thus, shares in an attractive company like the renowned Pilsner brewery could end up going at one share, instead of three, per 100 points, but outstanding shares in a polluted and old-fashioned steel mill might end up at a price of six shares per 100 points, with those who already bought at the higher initial price losing out. **********""In the market you win and you lose, and that's what we're teaching,"" said Charles Jelinek-Francis, an American lawyer who is advising the Privatization Ministry. ""This privatization system is the fastest way from here to there and the best way to get people to understand capitalism."" **********But some analysts fear that many of the shadier, more questionable aspects of capitalism may have been encouraged by Czechoslovakia's decision to take such a drastic and sweeping step.  The chief focus of concern has been the unexpected establishment in recent months of more than 400 mutual funds that have been aggressively acquiring the vouchers with promises of fabulous returns. Advertising relentlessly on television, these funds have ended up with about 55 percent of all the voucher points issued. **********People have been encouraged to consign their vouchers to the funds by promises like those from the Harvard Capital and Consulting Corporation, run by the 28-year-old Viktor Kozeny, who was educated at Harvard. His company has guaranteed a 10,000 crown return after one year to anybody handing over his 1,035-crown booklet. Other funds have followed with even bolder promises. **********""What people see is a 10-fold return in a year and a new color television set,"" said Jan Vanous, a Czech American who runs PlanEcon, a consulting concern in Washington. ""But if a lot of investors want to cash out in a year, there would be huge pressure on the funds to sell, and that could lead to absolute panic in a plummeting market."" Funds Poorly Capitalized **********Such fears have been reinforced by the fact that many of the funds are poorly capitalized, and no market-tested estimate of the companies' worth exists. Moreover, the country's proposed stock market, which is scheduled to come into being once the privatization that began today is completed, will still be in its infancy a year from now. **********Mr. Jelinek-Francis said he did not expect any panic because Czechoslovak people were traditionally solid savers and were likely to hang on to their shares. He also said the funds had some cushion because while each booklet of vouchers cost $37, each had a book value of about 30 times that, according to the Government's evaluation of the companies' total value of $9.3 billion. **********But some skepticism about the funds was evident among people making their own choice of companies to invest in. **********""I would not give a cent to the funds because I don't think they will keep their promises,"" said Bozena Frankova, a post office employee. ""If many people want their money back at once, I'm not sure the funds will have the money to pay them off."""

A Farewell to Paternalism"," **********Recruiters and outplacement consultants say they have seen unmistakable signs of a pickup in the job market over the past two months. But many people returning to the work force -- or simply changing jobs -- will find a dramatic change because of the restructuring and recession companies have been through in the last few years: Most of the old paternalism is gone. **********Because the uncertainties of employment -- and the prospects of a long and lean retirement -- are more apparent now, employers have new reasons for wanting employees to take responsibility for their own welfare. A study of 14 corporations released last September by the Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, found that companies ""expect employees to share more responsibility for their careers and future financial security."" **********It is easy to be cynical about companies dumping more responsibilities on their employees. And employees are resisting the change, according to Helen Dennis, co-author of the Conference Board study. But in the long run, it's better for everyone if employees are firmly in charge of their own needs in three areas: career planning, financial planning and retirement planning. **********""It's good for the employer, but it's absolutely critical for the employee,"" said Ms. Dennis, a gerontologist who teaches at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Ms. Dennis, who has worked with more than a thousand corporate executives to help them prepare for retirement, says that those in paternalistic companies often don't make a good transition to retired life. **********In fact, employees in paternalistic companies generally do less to take care of themselves because they believe the company will pick up the slack. ""In paternalistic companies, financial awareness and savings levels are very low,"" said Roger C. Hindman, a partner in the tax technology group at Price Waterhouse in Chicago. **********Many companies are developing tools to help employees make the transition to a higher level of self-reliance. The tools include training programs, software packages to help plan for retirement and financial planning services. For example, the Shell Oil Company in Houston hired Mr. Hindman to give employees retirement planning seminars. ""Most people who come to work for a big corporation like Shell say: 'I don't have to worry, everything will be there when I need it,' "" said Guy Mason, Shell's pensioner relations manager. ""That's not always true and it will not be true in the future."" **********Whether a company is offering assistance or not, employees need to get involved in their own futures, the experts say. **********Dale Winston, president of Battalia Winston International, a New York executive search firm, said she cautions job candidates that they must not expect new employers to plan their careers for them. ""Corporations that used to promote people every two years no longer have the layers to do that,"" she said. ""People have to recognize in the 90's that they must manage their own careers."" **********You must learn to see when you have reached a plateau and figure out a way to make a move that will expand your base of knowledge and expertise. ""The minute you start to see blockages, you have to look outside,"" Ms. Winston said. **********When you do look outside, expect to make a lateral move. ""One change we're seeing is that rarely will a person go to a new company in a higher job level than the old job,"" Ms. Winston said. ""That's not to say you're going to take less money or that your sphere of influence will not be bigger. But you're not going to go from vice president of marketing to general manager."" **********Some companies are willing to send their most talented executives for coaching or counseling sessions to improve their management skills. Although these so-called executive development programs have been around for some time, the focus has changed, according to Edith Rotkopf, a spokeswoman for Beampines Inc., a New York firm that offers the programs. In the past, companies sent executives to repair a management flaw. Today, they are polishing existing management skills. ""They have become 'groom-its' rather than 'fix-its,' "" Ms. Rotkopf said. ""Companies are deciding to invest in those people they have left."" **********If your company is not one of those offering such programs, it will be up to you to do these things on your own. Think through your strengths and weaknesses as a manager. Aim to fill holes in your technical knowledge. And consider whether you might benefit from more computer training or from media training. **********Many companies are beginning to be much more straightforward with employees about what they will provide in benefits, too, rather than shrinking from talking about reductions. ""In the decade of the 90's there will be a lot more realism in employee benefits programs,"" Mr. Hindman said. **********For example, Mr. Hindman uses a software program to help employees of his clients project what they will need for retirement and what they might have available. ""Companies like Goodyear that have been paternalistic in the past tell us that they want to educate their employees because they're not going to be enriching their programs in the future,"" Mr. Hindman said. **********One of the things Mr. Hindman points out to employees is that most pension benefits from private companies are not indexed for inflation. Today, when people spend 25 or 30 years in retirement, that has a tremendous impact on their income level and they must plan for it.AT LEAST THERE'S HELP IN PLANNING **********These days, news about employee benefits almost always means they are decreasing. But here is some good news: Many employers are adding financial planning to their benefits package. **********Eleven percent of the 411 companies surveyed in November by Buck Consultants Inc., a New York-based benefits firm, offer financial planning to employees. Of those who do not, 35 percent plan to introduce it. **********Lawrence R. McCoombe, a Buck consultant, says the typical program focuses on how investments work and how to get the most out of company benefits plans. Most are one-day affairs, offered on company time, to which all employees and their spouses are invited. **********Employers want to educate their employees because they see them making investment mistakes that will erode their quality of life. ""They see employees throwing dollar after dollar into a single, conservative long-term investment without realizing that inflation is going to eat them up alive,"" Mr. McCoombe said. **********The planning sessions are popular with employees, he added. ""Once they find out that it's not a black art and they can understand something like the time value of money, they feel empowered,"" he said."

Now, as frantic negotiations for a new government in Kabul continue in both the Afghan capital and in Peshawar, 150 miles away, radio has become king. **********Every corner of this sprawling city, every rebel party office, every commander's house, has a communications center -- radios manned 24 hours a day in constant contact with commanders inside Afghanistan. **********""Every discussion among leaders in Peshawar is then retransmitted to the commanders inside,"" explained Amin Wardak, a commander from south of Kabul, who was chosen as one of the representatives to remain in Peshawar and who made the first radio contact last week between scores of Afghan commanders and Ahmad ShahMasood, leader of the Jamiat-i-Islami group. **********With scores of guerrilla commanders from different political parties surrounding Kabul, constant communications are needed to disperse rumors and promote dialogue. But the boom in radio communication has also become the unofficial spying and propaganda tool. It is possible to tune into most everyone's conversations and then attempt to decipher the news despite the static. **********Mr. Wardak, like the rest of Peshawar, has one radio he uses to transmit and one radio to listen into conversations. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader of Hezb-i-Islami, an Islamic fundamentalist group, has successfully bolstered his position among Afghans by using the radio to describe battle successes that never occurred, Western diplomats in Islamabad said. News on Cellular Phone **********Communications in Peshawar can be daunting. There are dozens of guerrillas who never leave the walled-in houses that stand on nameless streets at opposite ends of the city. Guards with automatic rifles lounge in the front yards under splashes of purple bougainvillea and rose bushes. **********Between cups of tea and sugared almonds, the guerrillas man the phones for live interviews in Europe and the United States in Pashto, Persian, English and French. **********In Peshawar, meetings do not break until the early morning hours and to ease communications almost everyone carries a cellular phone. Every evening the news is the same: the leaders are deadlocked. **********These powerful Japanese, Chinese and American radios have ranges of more than 4,000 miles. They also come with computerized scramblers for written messages. Mr. Masood communicates two or three times a day with his group's communications center. He also uses it as a link to other commanders inside Afghanistan. But through another center, Mr. Masood also communicates with Mr. Wardak, who represents an organization of more than 300 commanders inside Afghanistan. **********When Jalaluddin Haqqani took Gardez, Mr. Wardak spent one and a half hours on the radio with him. Mr. Haqqani also speaks regularly with Mr. Masood. Although messages are coded, there is no secrecy to live conversations. When Mr. Hekmatyar left secretly for Afghanistan last week, everyone knew within hours that he had gone to Logar province."

Derian, the first Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, has vivid memories of her early days in office. She recalls that she was often resented, ridiculed or ignored, and certainly not taken very seriously. **********""After I had been there awhile, I invited all the other assistant secretaries to a meeting so that I could tell them what it was that I was there to do,"" she recalls. ""It was one of those times when you're talking and people look away, extremely embarrassed at this naive display. They thought, this is going to be some little creampuff here."" **********That was in 1977. A decade and a half later, human rights has moved to the center of foreign policy debate in Washington, spurred by pressures from Congress and a voiciferous lobby of rights and relief organizations. The subject figures in all Congressional debates on foreign aid. Worldwide, few nations are finding that they can defy human rights scrutiny without diplomatic consequences. **********Since 1981, Republican administrations have often been the target of criticism by human rights groups, which charge that Washington has been uneven or inconsistent in raising rights issues because of other policy considerations. Nonetheless, these administrations have drawn the major groups -- Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights -- into their consultations. **********""We see assistant secretaries and desk officers all the time,"" said John G. Healey, head of Amnesty International in the United States. ""Even if we don't get what we want, we're in the mix now. The relationships are warm. They seek, we give. They call, we help."" **********As Americans grow more critical of spending money on foreign aid in hard economic times and the ferment of the post-cold war world presents many new claims for attention, the human rights lobby can enhance its influence. **********""I think one of the best examples of the influence of human rights groups in recent years is China,"" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Asia Watch. ""By criticizing United States policy on China, the human rights organizations have been able to exert some pressure on China itself."" **********Over the last two years, Ms. Jones added, every time China seemed in danger of losing its preferred tariff status with the United States, it would respond to key debates in Congress by releasing some prisoners. **********One of the most sustained campaigns in the waning years of the cold war was on behalf of Soviet Jews and other citizens whose rights were restricted in the former Soviet Union. **********Robert Pastor, professor of political science at Emory University and former Latin American specialist at the National Security Council, says the emergence of democracies in the Western Hemisphere is a tribute to the success of rights campaigns. **********""In human rights, we are really dealing with an international movement of great consequence,"" he said. ""It would be hard to find a country in this hemisphere in which raised consciousness of human rights has not had any effect. Even in the most extreme case of Cuba, Fidel Castro has had to deal with the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and he has had to respond to questions posed not by the United States or the Cuban-American community but by Latin Americans."" **********Not all areas have high human-rights profiles. Many Africans see great needs on a continent where lately, most of the attention has been focused on South Africa. The world has not reacted to hundreds of thousands of Somalis facing starvation and death in factional warfare, said Rakiya Omaar, executive director of Africa Watch. Sudanese struggle to get a hearing for charges that their Islamic Government is brutally suppressing a rebellion in the Christian and animist south. country. **********""In 30 years, human rights has been put on the agenda of the world by the pain of suffering people,"" Mr. Healey said.

Since it hit the fourth grade, however, it has detonated a political scandal in which educators, intellectuals and opposition legislators have all accused the Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of rewriting the country's history to suit its political needs. **********The charges range from rehabilitating Diaz, a man who the critics say was like Mr. Salinas in putting economic reform first, democracy second, to painting warts on the once-heroic peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, a patron saint of those who oppose the President's agricultural changes. The Essence of the Nation **********But even where the changes are minor, they have prompted some reactions strong enough to challenge the notion that the power of Mexico's past has faded with the rapid economic changes that the Salinas Administration has introduced. **********In the new texts for fourth, fifth and sixth graders -- as in Mexican society -- ""what is in dispute is the very essence of the nation,"" exclaimed Luis Javier Garrido, a lawyer and political analyst. **********Education officials say that as part of their long-overdue modernization of the country's public education system, they simply tried to update and improve the texts that are distributed to all private and public schools. If the new books have included a revisionist view or two, they add, it is only because those interpretations have gained currency since the last ones were written in 1972. **********Yet while the Government has backed away from confrontation, promising to rewrite the texts again for next year, the uproar has held stubbornly to he front pages of Mexico City newspapers. **********It has seemed to reinvigorate Latin America's biggest union, that of Mexican teachers, only a few months after some Government technocrats were toasting its decline. It has focused new scrutiny on official procurement practices. And it has clouded the political future of the Education Secretary, Ernesto Zedillo, who had been considered a strong contender for the presidency. **********""There are not a lot of other places where this could go on,"" said Enrique Krauze, a historian and essayist who has joined energetically in the polemics.  A Change in Approach **********Before Mr. Salinas, Mexican Presidents tended to treat the country's history as an essential tool of government. Luis Echeverria, who governed from 1970 to 1976, dedicated each year of his administration to a different historical figure. His successor, Jose Lopez Portillo, identified himself with the white god of pre-Hispanic Indians, Quetzalcoatl. President Miguel de la Madrid, who preceded Mr. Salinas, chose Jose Maria Morelos, the rebel priest who wrote Mexico's first Constitution, as his semi-official hero. **********The previous Government texts, issued under Mr. Echeverria in 1972, set off conservatives with laudatory accounts of Fidel Castro's Cuba, Salvador Allende's Chile, and other causes of the third world. But they included virtually nothing of the revisionist currents that were then gaining strength among students of Mexican history. **********By emphasizing the country's economic modernization under Diaz, critics say, the new histories show a subtle bias toward Mr. Salinas's own priorities. By citing the shortcomings of revolutionary heroes like Zapata, they contend, the books support the Government's recent changes in the land-tenure system that had long been celebrated as a revolutionary achievement. **********The debate has taken little account of the treatment the new books give the Spanish conquest. The earlier social science texts described it as violent and seemingly unjust, but also in some ways positive for the indigenous peoples. The new sixth-grade history book describes the years following the conquest as ""terrible,"" and recounts that for three centuries Indian peoples ""resisted"" efforts to wipe away their cultural traditions. **********The sharpest critics of the books have focused on their depiction of more recent events. Although the texts offer the first mention of the 1968 army massacre of scores of students in Mexico City, for example, the critics note that they avoid mentioning that the Government ordered soldiers to confront the protesters and skirt the still-contentious issue of how many died. No Mention of Fraud Charges **********While a later chapter notes that Mr. Salinas was declared the winner of a hard-fought election in 1988 with little more than half the votes, it skips the fact that many thought he won by fraud. And though the chapter mentions Mr. Salinas's antipoverty program, his educational changes and his restoration of economic growth, it makes no mention of his leftist rival Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the most important opposition figure in the country's modern history. **********Hector Aguilar Camin, a historian who was one of two main editors of the new textbooks, described the dispute over their contemporary history as ""a trivial issue."" **********Like Government education officials, Mr. Aguilar Camin, the leader of a group of intellectuals who often advise and publicly support the Salinas Administration, denied that the books represented official history. But one of the country's leading historians, Jean Meyer, told the news magazine Proceso that the chapter he contributed to the textbooks on 20th-century Mexico was rewritten without his consent to include some of Mr. Salinas's achievements. His co-author, Mr. Meyer said, was Mr. Aguilar Camin. **********In interviews as they wound down with video games from morning classes at the Luis Murillo primary school in downtown Mexico City, consumers of the new sixth-grade books had their own complaints. **********""This book has more pictures than information,"" sniffed Christian Opengo Ruiz, an 11-year-old who aspires to become a veterinarian. She added, ""We are Mexicans; we care about what happened in the past."" **********With prompting, the students did not mention the new historical treatment of Porfirio Diaz, 1968, or Mr. Salinas. There was, however, a consensus that not enough had been written about the ""Boy Heroes,"" the teen-age military cadets reputed to have fallen in 1847 against the invading American troops of Gen. Winfield Scott. (In public speeches this week, Mr. Salinas appeared finally to have found new historical figures with whom to associate: Los Ninos Heroes. 'It Seems Like Sacrilege' **********To some observers, the textbooks controversy has highlighted the fact that while the Salinas Government has gained support for its policies, particularly those dealing with the economy, it continues to suffer from the lack of credibility that plagued its predecessors. **********To others, the episode has underscored a subtle fact of the changes that Mr. Salinas has fostered in Mexico: while his Administration has challenged policies and institutions established after the 1910 revolution, it has taken care to leave many of the beliefs that have held the country together since then alone. **********""Myths that the country and the world have left behind have yet to be demolished in political speech and public education,"" Mr. Aguilar Camin said. ""Today, when what is conventional academic wisdom passes into the public debate, it seems like sacrilege."" **********Yet criticism of the books only begins with their interpretation of the past. **********Educators have attacked their didactic quality. Historians have pointed out errors of basic fact. And political columnists have feasted on disclosures about the deals by which the Government assigned the writing of the textbooks to a foundation run partly by Mr. Aguilar Camin and had them printed without offering the contract for public bid. Accountability Is Noted **********But even some of the critics note that the new histories have been victims in part of political forces that Mr. Salinas has helped to strengthen. **********Twenty years ago, when the country's social science texts were last revised, it would hardly have occurred to many Government critics to insist that the job be opened to public bids. That powerful businessmen, influential academics and corrupt officials would profit was taken for granted. **********""All of this is very symptomatic of the fact that this society is changing,"" Mr. Krauze said. ""People have started to insist on accountability, and I don't think that has happened before."""

Serbian guerrilla forces, together with the virtually all-Serb Yugoslav Army, have overrun more than 60 percent of Bosnia, driving non-Serbs from their homes. **********The mothers and children in the convoy, which was headed for the Croatian port of Split, are ethnically mixed, officials said. **********The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are a mix of 1.9 million Muslim Slavs and 750,000 Roman Catholic Croats, who mostly support independence, and 1.4 million Eastern Orthodox Serbs, who mostly oppose it, especially those in rural areas. **********About 2,225 people have died and 7,660 have been wounded in the republic since the Serbs began their campaign to dismember the republic, health authorities in Sarajevo said today. Another 2,555 were listed as missing. Relief organizations estimate that there are 700,000 refugees. **********Late this afternoon, two armored vehicles belonging to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sarajevo were turned back by Serbian gunmen at a roadblock when the peacekeepers tried to enter Ilidza. They came under artillery fire on their return to their headquarters a few miles away, Sarajevo radio and United Nations officials said.  Threat of Retaliation **********Young men and parents of the children being held threatened to retaliate against Serbs in Sarajevo if the hostages were not released quickly, Government officials said. Many Serbs in Sarajevo support and take part in the defense of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was recognized in early April by the United States and members of the European Community. **********Serbian leaders are demanding the return of the bodies of Serbs killed in fighting around Sarajevo during the last week, as well as the lifting of a blockade around Yugoslav Army barracks in the city and an officers' training school nearby.  Bleakness in Sarajevo **********Three Yugoslav Army barracks in Sarajevo remained surrounded today by ethnically mixed forces loyal to Bosnia, despite an agreement to allow the garrisons to depart on Tuesday, Sarajevo radio said. Repeated attacks on Yugoslav Army convoys have also held up their withdrawal. **********Water and electricity supplies are still disrupted in Sarajevo, which also faces serious food and medical shortages because normal deliveries and aid convoys are not being allowed through by the Serbian gunmen. **********The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has canceled plans to send two large convoys with food and medicine to Sarajevo because of a Serbian attack this week on a Red Cross convoy that left one aid official dead. **********In Geneva today, the International Red Cross said it would temporarily remove its eight-person team from Sarajevo, a city of about 560,000 people.                    --------------------       U.S. Revokes Air Rights **********WASHINGTON, May 20 (AP) -- The United States suspended the landing rights of Yugoslavia's national airline today after the Serbian authorities ignored appeals to permit humanitarian goods to reach victims of the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina."

The company fixed some decoration and trim, but said the suits were groundless and the homes structurally sound. **********Then came last week's hurricane. **********Lennar's stock, which had reached $30.125 last Thursday in anticipation of South Florida's rebuilding, fell $1.625, to $26.625 yesterday, as lawyers announced that more homeowners, their houses ruined by the storm, had joined the suit. Lennar's decline on the New York Stock Exchange came despite the market's strong advance.  When Bad Is Good **********Whatever the case's outcome, Lennar's situation illustrates the perils of Wall Street's penchant for death-and-destruction plays. No matter how macabre the news, traders always look for something to celebrate. Makers of gas masks and poison antidotes, for example, won favor during the Persian Gulf war. **********And after Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida, construction, development and building-supply stocks all surged in anticipation of the rebuilding to follow. Lennar stoked the fires by responding with plans for thousands of new homes and apartments worth at least $100 million. **********But several analysts say traders and brokers have gotten carried away, both in bidding many stocks up and in beating Lennar back down. **********""Emotion got the better of reason,"" said Richard M. Lilly, the research director at J W Charles Securities, the second-largest brokerage firm based in Florida. ""Literally, as soon as I got into the office, I had 100 of this firm's brokers calling me, asking how to profit from the hurricane."" **********Mr. Lilly, whose own house was damaged by the storm, said that several stocks were still puffed up with the recent winds. ""They better be praying for another hurricane next week or they're going to be in a world of trouble,"" he said. **********Louis S. Robles, a Miami lawyer, said that 100 homeowners in the West Kendall section of Hampshire Homes were now taking part in the suit. Five other Lennar developments are likely to join the suit, whose claims could run into tens of millions of dollars, he said. Mr. Robles spoke of inferior wood, nails and bolts, and of roofs only casually attached to homes. **********""We were asking Lennar to fix the properties,"" he said from the telephone in his Jeep Cherokee as he headed toward another Lennar project. ""Now we're asking for a lot more. Plus we want consequential damages, evacuation costs, loss of personal property, personal injury."" **********Lennar responded to the initial complaints by repairing what it called the fascia, or decorative trim, on some homes -- ""not of a structural nature at all,"" said Alan J. Pekor, the company's financial vice president. **********Since the hurricane, he said, the Miami-based company has been occupied with relief efforts, trucking food and water to its damaged developments. ""Our people have been focused on dealing with human needs, not lawsuits,"" Mr. Pekor said. The lawsuit is so lacking in merit, he said, that Lennar will seek compensation for its defense costs. **********Despite the economic slowdown, Lennar's profits rose 55 percent last year to $21 million, mostly from strong results at the mortgage and property-management subsidiaries. **********Some investors say they are paying more attention to the healthy balance sheet than to calamities and lawsuits. **********""I think some people were under the impression that the entire state is devastated, and Lennar gets to rebuild every home they ever built,"" said Katherine A. Collins, a manager at the Fidelity mutual fund group, the second-largest institutional holder of Lennar shares. **********Despite the hurricane damage and lawsuit, she added, ""if you liked Lennar before, there's no reason not to like it now."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/10/business/american-air-cuts-most-fares-in-simplification-of-rate-system.html,Edwin McDowell,1992-04-10,,1502,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,American Air Cuts Most Fares In Simplification of Rate System,American Air Cuts Most Fares In Simplification of Rate System," **********American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, said yesterday that it would scrap the convoluted system of airline fares that has evolved over the last decade. It announced a simplified system that includes only four kinds of fares instead of 16, and will mean lower prices for most business and leisure travelers. **********Other carriers quickly announced similar overhauls; the changes will take effect Monday. **********Under the new system, American will offer only a first-class fare, a coach fare that can be bought anytime before flight time, and two discount fares, one requiring purchase 21 days in advance of travel and another requiring purchase seven days in advance. **********In simplifying its fare system, American is eliminating all but 70,000 of the 500,000 fares in its computerized reservations system -- an 86 percent drop. The resulting reduction in administrative burden will be so large that the carrier expects to save $25 million annually by reassigning about 600 employees to other tasks. **********The change will reduce current coach fares an average of 38 percent and first-class fares 20 to 50 percent. The cuts in discount fares will be smaller, and in a few markets the lowest discount fare will actually be higher than it was before. **********""The whole fares system has become chaotic, inflexible, illogical and unfair,"" Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman and president, said in announcing the new fares in a news conference in New York. ""The system just has not been working."" **********Mr. Crandall, who said that the fare revision was intended to be permanent, not a special short-term offer like many in the past, appeared to be using his position as head of the nation's largest airline to force changes on the industry.  [ Page D1. ] **********The new system cuts a wide swath through the thicket of air fares by eliminating many discounts -- some discreetly offered to companies with many employees -- and other special fares, including those for Government employees, passengers bound for conventions and members of the armed forces. This way, Mr. Crandall said, ""Every customer can get the best price available."" **********The new system, which will be announced in advertisements nationwide beginning today, should also deter cheating by crafty travelers who beat the old system through tricks like buying two steeply discounted tickets that together amount to less than an unrestricted fare and using half of each ticket. **********American announced another significant change. On most flights currently, passengers who buy advance-purchase tickets and do not fly when scheduled can neither obtain refunds nor reschedule. Under the new system, they still cannot obtain refunds but, by paying a $25 service fee, can reschedule, as long as applicable advance-purchase and length-of-stay requirements are met. **********The new fares also apply on flights to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, but not on other international routes, most of which are regulated by foreign governments. Nevertheless, Mr. Crandall said it was American's intention eventually to simplify and reduce international fares. **********American and the other carriers are gambling that the fare cuts will produce an increase in travel that more than offsets the price reductions. The growth in the number of airline travelers has been weak in recent years, partly because of the recession and Persian Gulf war, and airlines that expanded their fleets rapidly have been flying with many empty seats and have slashed fares, suffering large losses in the process. **********Mr. Crandall said that American, which flies 90 million passengers a year, anticipates losing at least $100 million in the next three months because of the new lower fares, but expects to increase earnings by as much as $350 million annually because of the new fare system. **********Those projections anticipate a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in passengers, compared with the 2 percent gain previously projected. They also assume that the economy will grow slowly. **********In the last two years, United States carriers have lost almost $6 billion, and their spokesmen -- the outspoken Mr. Crandall in particular -- have argued time and again that the industry needs to raise revenues. Until yesterday, those attempts took the form of higher fares, especially the higher full fares used by business travelers, who travel on short notice. **********But not only did that strategy widen the disparity between leisure and business travelers, it had the additional disadvantage, in a weak economy, of discouraging business travel. Mr. Crandall said American hoped to reinvigorate the business travel market, especially among small businesses.  Wide Variations **********Corporate air fares averaged 28 cents a mile last year, compared with 26 cents in 1989, according to Topaz Enterprises, an air-fare auditing concern in Portland, Ore. But the price ranged from an average 56 cents a mile for first class to 24 cents a mile for negotiated fares. Mr. Crandall said yesterday that corporate discounts averaged about 38 percent industry wide. **********Analysts and industry executives were quick to praise American's effort. **********""It is a brilliant strategic move,"" said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst with Solomon Brothers. ""In effect, American has said the time has come to bring back the relationship between costs and revenues. Other carriers, and especially the financially weak ones, will have no choice but to go along or go out of business."" **********Continental Airlines, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it would match the new fares but might raise or lower them ""depending on the market."" United Airlines, Northwest and Delta also said they would adopt parts of the new fare system. **********Wall Street responded favorably to the announcements, sending the share price of American's parent, the AMR Corporation, up $3.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, to $71.875. The share price of United's owner, the UAL Corporation, rose by $2.50, to $133.25, and Delta Air Lines Inc.'s rose $1.50, to $60.75. **********Some travel agents had feared that American was planning to lower commissions, which average about 10 percent of air fares, or try to impose commissions based on a sliding scale. But once they learned the details of American's plan, some travel agency executives were pleased, even though lower fares will likely mean lower commissions on individual transactions. **********""Anything that simplifies the fare structure is sure to be helpful,"" said David S. Paresky, the president and chairman of Thomas Cook Travel, which has 320 locations in the United States. ""It helps us respond to what our clients are looking for: lower fares and greater flexibility."" **********Mr. Crandall said American had been spurred by a litany of complaints from business travelers, who disliked the high fares, and leisure travelers, who were frustrated by the many restrictions. He cited a difference of $1,166 in the highest and lowest current round-trip transcontinental fares. **********""Our customers,"" he said, ""no longer feel air travel is a good buy, or even fair."" **********Don Carty, American's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said that 10 percent of American's excursion travel ""is probably people gaming us"" -- that is, circumventing the rules applicable to discount tickets. But the fault, he said, ""is simply because of how aberrant the system is."" Matching the Distance **********Under the new fares, which try to relate fares to distances traveled, American's unrestricted coach fare between New York and Los Angeles will drop from $752 one way to $460, and between New York and Chicago from $427 to $250. American expects that about one-third of its traffic will fly using this fare. **********American's 21-day advance-purchase round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles will drop to $460 from $549, and between New York and Chicago to $260 from $355. The new 21-day fares, which require a Saturday-night stayover, average 49 percent less than American's new unrestricted coach fares, the carrier said, and average about 6 percent less than the 21-day fares that are in effect until Monday. **********However, until yesterday at least, some restricted fares on those routes were lower than the new ones. American, for example, offered a 30-day advance purchase fare between New York and Los Angeles for $398 round trip, requiring a Saturday stayover, and a 14-day round trip for $338, which required a stayover and was valid for travel only on Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. **********American's new seven-day advance-purchase fare also requires a Saturday-night stay and is also nonrefundable. But both advance-purchase fares allow passengers to change their itinerary and reuse tickets, provided they meet the applicable advance-purchase and length-of-stay requirements. **********In a question-and-answer session yesterday, Mr. Crandall said American was mulling future changes, but probably not in its frequent-flier program. And he said the carrier would continue to offer discounts to senior citizens, because ""of the competitiveness of that market,"" and will honor existing corporate contracts until they expire. **********While he did not rule out the possibility that the industry could again begin offering an array of special fares, he said that now, having learned that lesson, ""hopefully we won't repeat it."""

If so, who gets to decide which causes are good enough? **********These questions, rarely joined outside law school classrooms, are the nub of the Federal antitrust suit against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is set for trial in June. And many observers, it is safe to say, will be torn between gut admiration for one of America's great institutions of learning and a nagging sense that only governments should be allowed to fix prices. **********Last year the Justice Department charged that the eight Ivy League universities and M.I.T. had fixed the ""price"" of scholarship benefits by using a common formula for calculating financial need and agreeing not to offer scholarships based on merit. **********Without admitting guilt, the Ivies consented to abandoning the practice. But M.I.T., angered by the attack on the university's reputation and worried that a settlement would inspire private antitrust suits by aggrieved students, decided to go to court. **********There is no real argument over the facts. M.I.T. was indeed one of 23 elite colleges that met each year to hammer out a common student-aid policy. Nor, apparently, is there much dispute over some of the consequences. **********The need-based formula spread aid to a large number of students. In M.I.T.'s case, $20 million was budgeted to offset all or part of the tuition of some 60 percent of the undergraduates. The agreement also eliminated the temptation to bid for the most desirable candidates for admission -- namely, minority students with good prospects, and exceptionally gifted students. **********But beyond this point, M.I.T. and the Justice Department sound as if they are talking about different cases. M.I.T. cannot imagine why the antitrust division cares how a nonprofit institution with a proud record of academic excellence and racial diversity chooses to distribute its charity. The Government, for its part, sees M.I.T. and the Ivies as businesses that have increased fees to customers almost twice as fast as consumer prices have risen over the last two decades. **********When the suit was announced in May 1991, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asserted that students were entitled to the full benefits of price competition -- ""just as they would in shopping for any other service."" What other business, countered M.I.T., would not even try to recover its expenses from the customers? Full tuition, the university notes, is just half the $30,000 average cost of a year's education. **********The one place where the argument is joined is over the impact of collusion on the cost of attending one of the schools involved. The Justice Department's economic consultant, Keith Leffler of the University of Washington, argues that some of the savings achieved in the absence of competitive bidding for students surely must have been diverted to other uses -- anything, say, from faculty salaries to carpeting for administrators' offices. **********But M.I.T.'s consultant, Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago, argues that the elite 23 never used their market power to such selfish ends. And he employs high-powered techniques to buttress his point. His statistical-regression analysis attempts to tease out the sources of variation in average net tuition -- posted fees, less financial aid -- among some 225 colleges during the late 1980's. Various measures of academic quality, exclusivity and regional income seemed to have a large influence on college charges. By contrast, membership in the group that colluded on scholarship aid mattered not at all. **********It is not yet known whether this conclusion will withstand hostile scrutiny in the courtroom. In the view of Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, the statistical analysis is almost beside the point. **********Suppose the Big Three auto makers colluded to raise prices on luxury cars, and pledged to plow the profits into something deemed socially valuable -- say a cheap, fuel-efficient Toyota-buster. Would we want the Justice Department to look the other way, Mr. White asks. **********To Mr. White and Steven Salop, a Georgetown University economist, who was co-author of an analysis of the antitrust case in the Summer 1991 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, the real economic sin was procedural. If a ban on merit-based aid is good public policy, they argue, the policy should be made by the Government -- not by colluding universities. **********Nonetheless, a loss in court could cost M.I.T. dearly if students followed with suits to recover part of their tuition. And if there is one thing almost everyone who has followed this case agrees on, it is that the universities should not be penalized for past aid policies that were never hidden from the Government. If collusion on scholarship aid was bad for society, Mr. Salop asked, ""why did it take 15 years for the Justice Department to intervene -- years in which the colleges dug themselves into a treble-damages nightmare?"""

Ross Love said in an interview before the start here of the group's 83d annual meeting and business conference. ""It's not a mass movement yet, but we're seeing a turn."" **********Mr. Love, who is also the vice president of advertising at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, might be accused of bias, since it was P.& G. that set the wheels turning with a decision last November to cut back on promotion spending on some of its packaged goods. But since then other consumer-product giants have followed suit, including Colgate-Palmolive, Kraft General Foods, Chesebrough-Ponds and Kimberly-Clark. **********""The A.N.A., along with a lot of people in the industry, is pushing hard on this issue of investing in advertising,"" Mr. Love said. ""I see many companies asking the question, 'What do we need to do to build the value of our brands?' The answers are, better products and better advertising. That has changed from 10 years ago, when the answer was to spend some more on promotion."" **********The conference, which carries the theme ""The New World of Advertising"" -- no doubt because it runs through the Columbus Day weekend -- began yesterday at the Homestead and will continue through tomorrow. **********It is, of course, not the only conference that in recent years has pondered this prickly issue of advertising versus promotion. The subject has dominated meetings of advertisers, agencies and media as the economy continues to meander between recession and sluggish recovery. **********The reason is that in hard times, companies like the association's members, which account for almost 80 percent of regional and national ad spending, fervently believe they must sell their products fast, fast, fast. The future, they reluctantly conclude, must take care of itself -- an attitude that, their advertising agencies are eager to assert, only serves to erode what those products mean to consumers. **********The speakers at the conference include Solomon Dutka, chief executive at Audits & Surveys Inc., a New York market research company. During his presentation tomorrow, Mr. Dutka is expected to describe methods for evaluating the effectiveness of advertising, which, he contends, often gets too much credit when sales soar and too much blame when sales sour. **********Mr. Love, who is completing his term as the association's 1991-92 chairman, said promotions centering on price cuts were particularly pernicious. **********""If you go to the store and find that the product you want does not happen to be on sale,"" he said, ""and you pay the full shelf price, you feel cheated. **********""That's not good; that doesn't build brand loyalty. Better to let all your customers have a fair price, not just those who happen to be there when you have deep-cut sales."" **********This marketing strategy is known as everyday low pricing. **********Mr. Love's successor as chairman is scheduled to be elected today. Harry E. Davis, director of communications in the external affairs department at E.I. duPont de Nemours & Company in Wilmington, Del., is expected to become the 1992-93 chairman; he has served as vice chairman for the last year. **********Richard A. Garvey, vice president of marketing at Lego Systems Inc. in Enfield, Conn., is likely to be elected to succeed Mr. Davis and be named 1992-93 vice chairman. **********The conference is expected to draw around 525 people, an association spokeswoman said. About 450 attended last year and about 430 in 1990. It was unclear whether travel plans would be disrupted by the strike at USAir, which serves the Hot Springs area; the carrier planned to resume a full schedule by today."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/10/business/guinness-takes-a-luxury-tack.html,Steven Prokesch,1992-05-10,,1939,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Guinness Takes a Luxury Tack,Guinness Takes a Luxury Tack," **********When Anthony J. Tennant, the Etonian who turned Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. into a world power in spirits and wines, was recruited to work similar magic at Guinness P.L.C. in 1987, the British brewer and distiller was in disarray. Its last chairman, Ernest W. Saunders, had been fired and later jailed for his part in illegally manipulating Guinness's stock price to win the 1986 takeover battle for the Distillers Company, which made Guinness the world leader in Scotch and gin. Distillers had tried to maintain sales volumes of its all-important Scotch business by cutting prices and granting a private label to any distributor who requested one. But that had only eroded market share and the power of its leading brands, which included Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, White Horse and Old Parr. **********Mr. Tennant has abandoned that strategy and in the process has turned Guinness into one of the world's most profitable beverage companies. Only the Coca-Cola Company earns more in beverages. Today, Guinness is indisputably one of the most adept marketers of consumer goods around, a testimony to the power of selling liquor as a luxury rather than a commodity product. **********Since 1987, Guinness's pretax earnings have more than doubled. Last year, when Britain and the United States were mired in recession and the war in the Persian Gulf and fears of terrorism slowed global travel, hurting the all-important duty-free business, Guinness's pretax income rose 13 percent, to 956 million pounds, or nearly $1.79 billion, on sales of just $ 7.6 billion. **********Although Guinness stock is fairly expensive at $11.29 a share, or about 15 to 16 times expected 1991 earnings, many analysts are enthusiastic about its prospects. ""Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"" said Christopher Wickham, an analyst at Lehman Brothers International Ltd. ""You shouldn't be sleeping soundly at night if you don't own the stock."" **********""A lot of companies have risk areas,"" said Derek Brock of Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd. ""This one doesn't."" **********While the Guinness name is still widely associated with the stout dark beer that bears its name, more than 75 percent of its operating profits now come from its spirits division, United Distillers, whose operating profits have more than doubled since 1987, to 749 million pounds, or $1.4 billion, last year. **********This growth is largely the result of acquisitions made by Mr. Saunders and Mr. Tennant. Over the last seven years, Guinness has spent more than $8 billion on spirits and beer producers and distributors. Mr. Saunders bought both Bell's, the leading Scotch in Britain, and Distillers, whose brands include Gordon's and Tanqueray gins and Johnnie Walker and Dewar's Scotches. **********In the last 18 months, Guinness has also purchased America's Glenmore Distilleries, a spirits producer and distributor whose Scoresby is the No. 1 Scotch in California. Glenmore has doubled Guinness's share of the American spirits market to 16 percent. **********It also now owns Germany's leading premium brandy maker, Australia's most popular spirit and Venezuela's largest spirits company. Guinness is still looking for strong regional brands, both for their own potential and for the leverage they provide in marketing mainstay Guinness brands locally. **********Under Mr. Tennant, Guinness has also followed its main competitors by gaining control of most of its spirits distributors, both improving its profitability and its ability to control the pricing and marketing of its brands. Such control was essential for Mr. Tennant to realize his dream of repositioning Guinness's labels as premium brands for which status- and quality-conscious consumers would pay ever more. **********""The brand you drink is very much a demonstration of your life style, of your affluence,"" said Anthony A. Greener, who has driven the spirits division's expansion since 1987 and became Guinness's chief executive on Jan. 1. He becomes chairman when Mr. Tennant steps down at the end of the year at the mandatory retirement age of 62. **********Still, expecting people to trade up to more expensive brands may have been more reasonable in the go-go 1980's than in the go-slow 90's. According to research by Impact International, the drinks industry magazine, volume sales of the top 100 spirit brands fell last year ""for the first time in recent memory."" The Gulf war and temporary problems plaguing some big economies were partly to blame. But David Fleming, Impact's managing editor, said: ""The big question is whether it marks the beginning of a long-term trend."" **********In the United States, the decline in spirits consumption appears to be continuing. In Britain, consumption has long been flat. And in one big growth market, Japan, the economic slowdown seems to be taking a toll. **********Other threats include rising excise taxes on alcohol in the United States and the possibility that taxes could soar in Europe: the European Community is debating how to tax alcohol in the single market after Jan. 1. **********Nor can Guinness count on expanding its spirits business as aggressively through acquisitions. It has the money. ""They could easily spend $2 billion on something,"" Mr. Brock said. **********But the pickings are slim. Guinness now owns 85 percent of its spirits distributors, up from 20 percent when Mr. Tennant took the helm. Guinness would probably be barred from buying any of its major international rivals for antitrust reasons: United Distillers holds about 38 and 30 percent, respectively, of the world Scotch and gin markets. **********An alliance that Mr. Tennant forged with LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet-Hennessey has given Guinness a valuable stake in champagne and cognac. Though it still lacks a major international vodka, none seems available. Grand Metropolitan owns Smirnoff and Popov and also has the American distribution rights to Absolut. **********Guinness leaders confess to ambitions in liqueur and cordial companies. Obvious candidates include giant Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau, Campari Davide and Societe des Produits Marnier-Lapostolle. But many are controlled by families who seem to have little interest in parting with them. **********There has been speculation that Guinness might copy other alcoholic-drinks giants by diversifying into new industries. But Mr. Greener, who is 52, insists that Guinness will stick to spirits and beer. ""We intend to remain as single-minded as ever,"" he said. ""The success of this company is dependent on how well we develop these brands."" **********Moreover, plenty of potential acquisitions remain in beer, he added. ""The opportunities for growth by acquisitions are more likely to be on the beer side."" **********Unlike the spirits business, there are only a handful of international beer brands, including Heineken, Carlsberg and Guinness Stout. Regional brewers are plentiful and acquisition prices, which soared in the takeover wave of the 80's, have since plunged. **********Ranking No. 11 in the world in terms of amount of beer sold, Guinness Brewing is fourth in operating profits, trailing only America's Anheuser-Busch, Japan's Kirin Brewery and Australia's Foster's Brewing Group. Brian F. Baldock, the head of Guinness Brewing Worldwide, cited Guinness's moves in Spain as the kind he would like to repeat. In early 1991 Guinness bought La Cruz del Campo, Spain's largest brewer. The new subsidiary then acquired control of Spain's No. 6 brewer, Union Cervecera, which expanded Cruzcampo's portfolio of brands and its reach into parts of Spain where it was weak. With Guinness's help, Cruzcampo also introduced a reformulated low-alcohol beer. Since the acquisition, Cruzcampo's Spanish share has jumped to 29.7 percent, from 22 percent. **********In the United States, Guinness is taking a relatively cautious approach. Respectful of mighty Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris's Miller, it is focusing on the imported beer segment. In early 1990, it bought All Brand Importers Inc., which raised the number of beers that Guinness distributes in the United States to 10 and more than doubled its share of the import market to 13 percent. **********Even if beer is now more in the spotlight, the glory days aren't over for spirits, Guinness executives stress. They insist that they have only begun to tap the potential of whisky as a luxury item. In Japan, where gift-giving and social drinking are rituals of business life, it has become a custom to give a $75 bottle of 15-year-old Johnnie Walker Gold as an everyday business gift or to pay $400 at an exclusive bar or club for one's own bottle of Johnnie Walker Premier. **********""Scotch is the major motor of our growth, and I'm sure will remain so,"" said Mr. Greener, who, before taking charge of United Distillers, transformed Dunhill Holdings P.L.C. from a cigarette company into a successful luxury fashion concern. **********The LVMH-Guinness alliance has been a big help in Guinness's effort to position Scotch as a prestigious drink. Each owns 24 percent of the other and jointly own 14 distributors, which peddle Guinness's spirits brands alongside LVMH's cognac and champagne in the United States, East Asia, France and Ireland. **********To reduce competition between its brands, Guinness slashed their number, eliminating most private labels, and concentrated its marketing resources on the regional leaders. This effort has enabled Dewar's and Johnnie Walker to to increase its share in the United States. Guinness is also making strides establishing bourbon as a fashionable drink in East Asia with I. W. Harper and in Europe with Rebel Yell. **********Mr. Tennant predicts spirits sales will continue to grow strongly in Southern Europe and will soar in South Korea and Taiwan once trade barriers fall. China and Eastern Europe are potentially big markets, he added. **********""In most of Eastern Europe,"" he maintained, ""the two Western brands that are best known are Coca-Cola and Johnnie Walker. They don't currently have a great deal of money to buy Johnnie Walker but they might one day."" PEGGING GROWTH TO A FABLED STOUT **********Guinness's efforts to expand its beer portfolio globally by buying all or part of local brewers fits neatly into its plans to grow its flagship Guinness Stout. The world's 19th-largest-selling beer by volume, the ""black beer"" is brewed in 42 countries and sold in some 130. **********It is typically much easier for an international brand, especially a specialty beer like Guinness, to penetrate a local market if it is distributed with a portfolio of strong local beers, said Brian F. Baldock, the Guinness deputy chairman who heads the beer business. **********Revival of the brand, which had languished as a drink for mostly older, blue-collar men, began in the early 1980's, when it was repositioned with clever advertising as a fashionable drink for younger professionals. **********""While the world beer market has been growing by about 1 percent a year, Guinness Stout has been growing 5 to 6 percent per annum for the last five or six years,"" Mr. Baldock said. **********Guinness is also counting on improved taste to keep consumption of its stout growing. To that end, it has been investing heavily in refurbishing its breweries and in new dispensing equipment in bars. **********Equally important is the continuing rollout of Canned Draught Guinness, which is sold as Pub Draught Guinness in the United States. Each can contains a device that injects nitrogen into the stout when the can is opened, making it really taste like bona fide creamy draught brew. Draught Guinness went on sale in 1988 in Britain, where it is now one of the top take-home brands. It is now being tested in New York, Boston and Washington as well as Canada, Germany, Spain and Australia. ""Our biggest problem is capacity,"" Mr. Baldock said. **********Guinness is scrambling to get more equipment for installing the device."

Hundreds were arrested over several days as mobs called for the resignation of the President, set fire to buildings belonging to the ruling party and looted shops and offices. **********Reporters are not free to travel to Malawi, where all news reporting is tightly controlled by the Government of Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who 20 years ago appointed himself President for Life. But official radio broadcasts are monitored in neighboring countries. On Friday, Mr. Banda was heard pleading in an address to his nation for a return to tranquility. At Least Age 93 **********""Let us behave like ladies and gentlemen and refrain from damaging property,"" said the President, who is believed to be at least 93 years old. Discussing Mr. Banda's age is outlawed in Malawi, along with long hair and short skirts. **********Officials and Malawian exiles here say that a deep vein of discontent in Malawi began to show itself several months ago with the appearance of a small democracy movement that won the support of the country's Roman Catholic Church. When bishops circulated a pastoral letter on human rights in March, leaders of Mr. Banda's party called for their execution. **********Several religious leaders were interrogated and one, Monsignor John Roche, an Irish citizen, was deported. But the church has maintained its critical stance. **********In April, a labor leader, Chakufwa Chihana, was arrested for calling for democratic reforms. This week, a postponement of his trial brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets of Lilongwe demanding to know where he was. **********Malawi is a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, surrounded by Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique, and its 8.7 million people form one of the continent's poorest and most isolated nations. Since independence from Britain in 1964, Mr. Banda's virtually totalitarian political party has held power.  Cheering Crowds Only **********Party officials, backed by the police, insured that the President never saw any crowd that was not cheering the leader they were told to call Ngwazi, variously translated as the lion, the protector or the great one. Use of his name is not allowed. **********In recent years, President Banda is widely believed to have been under the political influence of his official hostess and companion, Cecilia Kadzmire, and her uncle, John Tembo. Although Mr. Tembo, who carries the title of Minister of State, denies he has political ambitions, many Malawians assume that he will sooner or later inherit the presidency. **********Mr. Tembo was in Washington in April and met with United States officials, including the Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Herman J. Cohen, who told him of American concerns about the restrictions on human rights in Malawi, the State Department said. **********Malawi stands almost alone now in a region where democratic changes have altered several governments, most recently in Zambia and South Africa. **********In a meeting with Mr. Tembo, Mr. Cohen ""called on the Malawi Government to open up the political process and restore constitutionally guaranteed freedoms and allow its citizens the right to freely criticize their government,"" the State Department said. Americans Reported Safe **********Human rights organizations are asking the Administration to put pressure on Malawi when the country's international aid donors meet later this month to consider requests for increased assistance because of a drought and the cost of supporting 900,000 refugees who have fled guerrilla war in Mozambique. **********The State Department says there are 1,217 Americans living in Malawi, including 104 Peace Corps volunteers. All Americans were reported to be safe, officials here say. There are no plans to evacuate them."

Some Surprising Numbers **********The increase of 68,000 reported in nonfarm payroll employment for May was well short of most Wall Street estimates, and the sharp rise in the unemployment rate, to 7.5 percent from 7.2 percent, was a surprise. **********At the same time, economists noted that payroll gains recorded in March and April were revised upward. **********And during May, the factory workweek rose by two-tenths of a percent, to its highest level since 1966. Rather than continue to expand hours, manufacturers at some point soon will probably start hiring more workers, the analysts said. **********""When you have the length of the workweek at its highest level in 26 years and overtime at its highest level since April 1973, that has to be a precursor of more employment later on,"" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. **********The big jump in the unemployment rate raised once again the question of whether the Federal Reserve Board would cut short-term interest rates.  No Fed Action **********The Fed did nothing to fuel such speculation yesterday, as it refrained from open market operations. **********""The political pressures on the Fed are going to be intense,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""But I don't think it will do much to help the economy if they cut the Fed funds rate again. We are in for a period of slow, erratic growth, which is not a prescription politicians like when they are running for office."" **********Prices of outstanding Treasury securities rose by as much as half a point early in the session, but later gave back some of the gains. **********By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10125/32 , up 11/32 , to yield 7.84 percent, compared with 7.87 percent late Thursday and 7.83 percent the previous Friday. **********Among Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10113/32 in late trading, up 15/32 , to yield 7.29 percent. And the 5 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 1001/32 , up 1/8 point, to yield 5.10 percent.  Short-Terms Rates Fall **********Hopes of another Fed easing move helped to push down rates on short-term Treasury bills. **********Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.67 percent late yesterday, down 2 basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.80 percent. **********The decline in interest rates encouraged a number of corporations to price new debt securities, with offerings totaling almost $1 billion."

President Bush personally authorized the retaliation threat in the summer and would almost certainly make the final decision now, but he was campaigning out of town today. **********American officials said the most likely next move would be the imposition of punitive tariffs on a small volume of European exports, as part of a long-delayed plan to punish the European Community and particularly France for subsidies that effectively limit American soybean exports. Threat on Imports **********Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, has threatened to impose import taxes of up to 100 percent on $1 billion of fine wines and other European products. But American officials predicted that the full $1 billion probably would not be imposed all at once. **********The taxes would also not take effect immediately, to give European officials a chance to return to the bargaining table and to protect American importers who have goods on ships headed for the United States. **********In Europe today, community officials insisted that talks with the United States had not broken off, although French and German officials staked out such sharply opposed positions that it seemed Europe had little chance of agreeing on a unified negotiating position. **********""We deny that there has been any suspension of the talks with the United States and we are working on the assumption that we can bring about a solution at short notice,"" said Nicolaas Wegter, the community's top spokesman on trade issues. **********But American officials continued to insist that the European Community had backtracked on Wednesday from previous offers to reduce its subsidies. Were They Kidding? **********Five Administration officials said in separate interviews that they would be willing to resume talking but only if the European Community retracted all of its demands on Wednesday and returned to its negotiating stance of last weekend. ""If the Europeans were to tell us, 'Hey, we were kidding,' "" then the United States would resume negotiations, one of the officials said. **********The world trade talks have been slow and confusing, partly because of squabbles on both sides of the Atlantic. **********Before the collapse of negotiations on Wednesday, James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, and other White House officials, had been pushing the trade negotiators to find a way to come to terms with the Europeans, so that President Bush could use an agreement in his election race against Gov. Bill Clinton. **********The failure of the talks makes retaliation likely, said a Bush campaign official who insisted on anonymity. He said retaliation would appease American soybean farmers and would not be perceived as inconsistent with President Bush's free trade principles because international arbitration panels have ruled twice that the European subsidies were unfair and violated international free trade rules. **********American officials expected the community's Agriculture Commissioner, Ray MacSharry of Ireland, to call Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan this afternoon to discuss whether differences could be patched up. Mr. MacSharry finally called early this evening, but Mr. Madigan had already left for the White House and the two men did not speak. Air Reservations Made **********Mr. Madigan had made airline reservations to fly to Dublin Wednesday night for a full day of negotiations today with Mr. MacSharry, but the reservations were canceled after Wednesday's setback, two American officials said. **********The European Community, and apparently the German Government, are much more divided than the Bush Administration. The French and farm interests in the German Government were happy with the breakdown of talks on Wednesday, while Britain and free traders in the German Government criticized the failure. **********At a news conference in Bonn, the German Economics Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, a strong supporter of a global trade agreement, made his country's most direct attack yet on France for holding up an accord for domestic reasons. **********""There is no longer any reason, objectively, to delay agreement,"" Mr. Mollemann said. ""In substance, the differences are so narrow that they no longer bear any relation whatsoever to the damage that would be caused if the negotiations -- for reasons other than those of trade policy, for reasons that are clearly domestic -- were to fail"

The company already repurchased 12.3 million shares for $929 million, an average of just over $75 a share. This leaves a fund of $4.1 billion to buy shares. Philip Morris's stock closed yesterday at $75.375, up $1. **********With the stock market near all-time highs, this might not seem like the best time to buy back stock. Selling shares would seem more logical, which General Motors did last week to take advantage of a sharp rise in its shares this year. Poor Record for Buybacks **********A flood of buybacks usually follows a sharp decline in the stock market, which is just what happened after the stock market crash in 1987. In the aftermath of such a fall, stocks are undervalued and are relatively inexpensive. **********And, in fact, buybacks in general have not worked out well since the 1987 crash, according to Donald W. Mitchell, a partner in the consulting firm of Mitchell & Company in Weston, Mass. The firm advises companies on the impact of various restructuring steps. **********Mr. Mitchell would not comment on the Philip Morris plan because he had advised the company on this buyback. But in an interview earlier this year he said, ""Repurchases are one of the most poorly understood options available to corporate executives. Most people think that a 10 percent repurchase will produce a 10 percent gain in the stock price -- and it hasn't worked that way since at least 1986."" **********His partner in the firm, Carol Bruckner Coles, added in the same interview: ""In the cases where we've been asked by clients to evaluate a repurchase, we are also finding it would create far less benefit for them. It has been more than three years since a repurchase was indicated as a recommended action."" Benefits Current Holders **********But in Philip Morris's case, the situation is different, according to Kurt Feuerman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. ""This is a company with a large amount of cash on hand,"" he said, ""and a buy back is a tax-advantaged distribution to shareholders. It benefits the existing shareholder by raising the earnings per share if the buyback is done at a low earnings per share."" **********Mr. Feuerman said that over the next five years Philip Morris is projected to have $21 billion in surplus cash after dividends and $36 billion before dividends. He said the other two alternative uses for the cash -- lowering debt and raising the dividend -- were not as attractive. **********He also said that at its current price-earnings ratio, the stock was selling at a 20 percent discount to the average for the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which made the stock a good buy. Philip Morris's current price-earnings ratio is about 13.5. **********What will be the test of the success of the Philip Morris buyback will be the pace at which the stock price rises in the future. If it does, the company will have bought back the stock cheaply, which will enhance its earnings per share and value to the stock holder. **********A spokesman for Philip Morris, Nicholas Rolli, said the buyback ""continues to enhance investor returns and reflects our confidence in the future of the company."""

But the lower-priced segment of the market has come alive, as more powerful machines priced below $2,000 have become commonplace. Compaq's slow responses to the changes led to a management shake-up a year ago, but analysts say a series of new, lower-priced machines introduced on June 15 have revitalized the company. **********The expansion into 400 retail sites operated by CompUSA, Office Depot and Circuit City would not have been possible with the machines priced at $3,000 and higher that dominated Compaq's product list a year ago, said Seymour Merrin, president of Merrin Information Services, a research firm in Palo Alto, Calif. 'More Attuned to the Price' **********Ross Cooley, a Compaq senior executive, estimated that 20 percent of Compaq's sales, or perhaps $750 million, would be to individuals and small businesses next year. Compaq's 1991 sales were $3.3 billion. **********Michael A. Norris, Compaq's new vice president for consumer products, said the company ""is much more attuned to the price position we need to have"" to appeal to small businesses and individuals who buy computers for use in the home. **********Demand for the new Prolinea desktop and Contura notebook-size machines introduced in June has been strong, and Compaq has been unable to keep pace with orders. The buying surge is coming mainly from small businesses and individuals who typically did not buy from Compaq, Mr. Norris said. **********""We see availability for the majority of our products catching up with demand in October,"" when the new distribution pacts with the three retailers begin, he said. Compaq wanted to add the stores by October, Mr. Norris said, because retailers typically register as much as half of all yearly computer sales in the last three months of a year. Reputation for Quality **********Mr. Merrin, the analyst, said that Compaq's new, lower-priced machines and its reputation for quality had given the company an edge in recent months over small ""clone"" makers that lag behind Compaq's technology. The new retailing agreements ""are merely another manifestation of the great metamorphosis that has occurred at Compaq,"" Mr. Merrin said. **********Compaq signed distribution agreements last year with BizMart, an office-products retailer, and with Computer City, a new computer-retailing unit of the Tandy Corporation. ""They are selling every piece of product they can get their hands on, and are asking for more,"" Mr. Ross said. **********Compaq's share price rose 50 cents today, to $33.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

That change should insure that the recently merged Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover will consolidate their credit card operations at a Manufacturers office in Hicksville, L.I. **********If the bill had not passed, legislators said, the credit card operations would likely have been moved to Delaware to take advantage of that state's less stringent banking regulations. Chemical has operated its credit card business from Delaware since the early 1980's. Long Island Sees Benefits **********Bank officials had been so confident that the Legislature would support their cause, however, that they announced plans in November to combine their credit card operations in Hicksville. **********Long Island officials applauded the legislation, which has yet to be considered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, as good news for the stumbling Long Island economy. Hicksville, a commercial center in Nassau County, has been suffering from job losses and lackluster retail sales, and the exodus of more jobs would be a serious blow, officials said. **********But consumer advocates, including the State Consumer Protection Board, immediately condemned the idea as a job-saving gimmick enacted at the expense of millions of consumers. Chemical and Manufacturers have a total of more than 4.5 million card holders nationwide and are by far the largest issuers in the state.  Consumer Protest **********""They're eroding consumer protection with the theory that they're going to be able to able to save jobs,"" said Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. **********The bill also allows banks in the state to charge higher variable interest rates on credit cards than under the current law. Senator Hugh T. Farley Jr., Republican of Schenectady, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the bill's Senate sponsor, said jobs were the prime force behind the measure. **********The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 41 to 16; the Assembly vote was 114 to 26 in favor. Job Impact Assessed **********""We're talking about possibly bringing thousands of other jobs back into this state,"" Mr. Farley said, asserting that New York's stringent laws had already caused many banks to move their credit-card operations to other states. **********But William J. Ahearn Jr., a spokesman for Citicorp, which has credit card operations in South Dakota, Maryland and Nevada, said it was unlikely that the new law would entice his company to return its credit card division to New York. **********""One of the serendipitous things we've found is that we've landed in areas where the work force is terrific, where the cost of doing business is less, and where we can expand horizontally rather than vertically,"" he said. ""I don't know how feasible it would be for us to pick up and move back to New York."""

They appealed to European and American negotiators to resume talks soon and expressed the hope that a balanced global trade agreement could be reached and a separate dispute over oilseed subsidies resolved. **********The statement clearly represented an attempt to balance the widely divergent positions of member states. Since the United States announced its intention to impose the punitive tariffs last week, France has pushed strongly for measures hitting back at American goods, while Germany and Britain have been urging conciliation. **********""How can we accept a negotiation under the menace of unilateral commercial sanctions that are illegitimate?"" Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France declared. But in a sign of unusual tension between Paris and Bonn, Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann of Germany said, ""Political leaders should find a political solution instead of studying ways and means of retaliating."" **********A retaliatory spiral between Europe and Washington would amount to the opening of a trade war while negotiators on both sides of the Atlantic believe that a global trade accord is urgently needed to coax the world economy from its current stagnation. Economists have estimated that an agreement would add $100 billion a year to world output. **********Officials said the community's executive commission had begun work on a possible list of United States exports to Europe that might be the object of European tariffs if no accord was reached before Dec. 6. One official, who insisted on anonymity, said American corn gluten seed was one item likely to appear on the list. **********The threatened American 200 percent tariffs would affect about $300 million of European exports, chiefly white wine. France is the country that would be most affected. It is also the country that, facing a large farm lobby and crucial parliamentary elections in March, has been the most reluctant to make concessions in the long-stalled trade talks held under the auspices of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  U.S. Opposes European Subsidies **********The United States decision to apply the tariffs followed repeated refusal by the European Community to accept any change in its subsidies for the production of oil from seeds. The United States argues that the European subsidies are costing its soybean exporters huge sums in lost markets. **********The issue is not directly related to the GATT talks, but it has further poisoned the already strained relations between the community and Washington. There appears to be little hope of resolving one issue without also settling the other, European officials say. **********The two sides remain divided on a number of questions, but perhaps the most contentious is the degree to which the community's tonnage of subsidized grain exports should be reduced. The United States has been seeking a 24 percent cut, while the European Community has offered 18 percent. **********A possible route to a compromise emerged today. France requested a rapid study by the executive commission to determine the full effects of an agreed reform of the community's agricultural policy. This calls for a cut in grain production of 15 percent next year and a gradual reduction of the amount of land given over to grain farming in the community. **********If the commission study demonstrates that the proposed cuts in exports in an eventual GATT accord would not go beyond what would naturally follow from the community's agricultural reform, then French officials said Paris might be more amenable to a deal. **********In effect, the French Government could then tell the nation's farmers that they were not being asked for any sacrifices beyond those already imposed on them. That just might be politically acceptable to the governing Socialist Party of President Francois Mitterrand."

The documents show the Stasi, ""hired West German criminals to carry out murder contracts in West Germany,"" said Hans-Jurgen Forster, a spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe. **********Western German police have long suspected the former East German Government contracted foreign criminals to kill particularly strident West German critics or prominent defectors before it collapsed in 1990.Evidence From Stasi Files **********The Stasi files have provided dramatic evidence supporting that view, such as the detailed account released today by the Federal Prosecutor's Office of a bungled contract murder in West Berlin in 1975. **********One of the suspects in that case, Josef Tuszynski, whose Stasi code name was Karate, was arrested today in the Hohenschonhausen neighborhood in eastern Berlin, where he had been living since fleeing West Germany in 1983, said Mr. Forster. **********Mr. Tuszynski, 69 years old, will be arraigned in federal court on Friday. Under German law he can be detained for months in investigative custody before being formally charged with a specific crime. **********The 11 other suspects were arrested Wednesday and arraigned today, but the results of their hearings will not be released until Friday, Mr. Forster said. **********On Wednesday, the Berlin police arrested retired Maj. Gen. Karli Coburger, 62, who was the last head of the Stasi's Department 8, and his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Albert Schubert, 68. A 55-year-old colonel in the department was also arrested but his name was not released. 'Special Assignments' **********Department 8 of the former East German secret police was responsible for ""observation and investigation,"" according to Stasi records. Because of its ""special possibilities and capacities,"" it was also charged with performing ""special assignments."" **********Most of the other people arrested are western Germans, the prosecutor's office said. They included Heinrich Schneider, 63, of Frankfurt, who is suspected of attempted murder and acting as a secret agent for the Stasi under the code name Race Driver. **********Mr. Schneider is suspected of heading a ring formed in the early 1970's that included 19 West Germans, many with previous criminal records, who were hired by the Stasi to carry out crimes ranging from theft and blackmail to murder. Some of the members have since died, while others are still being sought by the police. The group is suspected of an estimated 500 killings in the former West Germany, for which it was paid about two million marks, the police said."

Step Supported by U.S. **********The 15-member Council, by a unanimous vote on Monday night, said it ""strongly condemns"" Israel for ordering the expulsions, calling the deportation order a violation of international law. The Bush Administration actively supported the stern resolution. **********The Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese had all postponed the departure of their negotiating teams for the talks that were scheduled to resume today, until after the United Nations vote. **********And today, a Syrian Government spokesman in Damascus was quoted by Reuters as saying, ""After consultations between the Arab parties taking part in the peace talks, it has been agreed that Arab delegates will go to Washington within the next two days to be ready to resume the talks starting from next week."" **********The joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation is expected to fly to Washington from Amman late Wednesday and could meet briefly with the Israelis on Thursday, although the talks will probably not resume in earnest until next Monday. The Israeli delegation has been in town since Sunday. **********""We are here, we are stuck here and we don't know when the others are coming,"" Mr. Ben-Aharon said. The senior Israeli negotiator, who is Director General of the Prime Minister's office, added that Israel cannot tolerate a situation in which each round of negotiations is hostage to the latest events on the ground, particularly since its negotiators are all senior Government officials while the Arab negotiators are in many cases retired diplomats. **********""There are going to be incidents, attacks, countermeasures and even deportations until we achieve a settlement,"" said Mr. Ben-Aharon, adding that the talks must continue on a regular schedule despite these. **********It was Israel, though, that held up the beginning round of Washington negotiations because it wanted those talks held in the Middle East instead. **********The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, today chided the Arabs for not coming on schedule, saying the Administration felt it was ""disappointing that the other parties are not present to begin these important talks."" 'Open for Business' **********She added: ""The facilities here at the State Department that we provided in December, we are providing now. We are ready and open for business. We believe that it is essential that all parties act in their own best interests by continuing the process of direct bilateral negotiations that were launched in Madrid."" **********Miss Tutwiler confirmed that the Bush Administration had granted a one-time visa to Nabil Shaat, a senior adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat. **********Ostensibly, the visa was granted so that Mr. Shaat could give a lecture in Washington, but in effect it will enable him to be in the United States to help advise the Palestinians during the negotiations. To make this possible, the Administration waived a rule banning visas to people connected with terrorist organizations. **********The fact that the P.L.O. was able to induce all the Arab delegations -- Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians -- to hold off going to Washington until the United Nations censured Israel underscored that Mr. Arafat is again exercising substantial influence, not only over the Palestinian delegation but with all the Arab groups. **********When the talks last broke off on Dec. 18, Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon had been engaged in discussions on substantive issues, though without having begun to bridge their wide differences. **********Israelis and the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, however, were caught up in a procedural wrangle about how to organize their talks, and were meeting in a corridor in the State Department rather than entering a formal negotiating room. How to Negotiate? **********At issue was Israel's desire to discuss all matters with a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians, as opposed to the Palestinians' desire to negotiate separately with the Israelis. **********Israel believes that the Palestinian question must be settled in conjuction with Jordan, and not by the creation of a separate Palestinian state. The Palestinians want their own independent entity and believe that the best way to secure it is by meeting with the Israelis alone. **********Before the talks broke up, Israel's chief negotiator, Elyakim Rubinstein, had offered the Palestinians a compromise, which they are still considering. **********The talks would begin with a meeting of the heads of the Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian delegations. Then there would be a full session of all three delegations, followed by separate meetings between the Jordanians and Israelis, and the Israelis and Palestinians, to deal with the separate issues dividing them. **********Under this complex formula, the Palestinian delegation, when it meets alone with the Israelis, would also include two Jordanians and the Jordanians, when they meet with the Israelis, would include at least two people from the Palestinian delegation.                    --------------------       Gaza Killing Is Charged **********JERUSALEM, Jan. 7 (Reuters) -- Palestinians said today that Israeli forces shot a Palestinian to death and wounded 20 others in the occupied Gaza Strip in a clash with hundreds of youngsters who were protesting Israel's decision to expel 12 Arab militants. **********When a crowd started throwing stones at them today, Israeli soldiers and police officers opened fire, hitting and killing Ahmed Abdel Rahman Sheik, 43 years old, said the Palestinians, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said Mr. Sheik had been trying to help youngsters under fire. **********Two Israeli paramilitary police officers were hurt by the stones, said Israeli security officials, who also spoke on condition that they not be identified."

They eat quietly at several tables and leave quickly, ashamed of their poverty. **********The soup kitchen, set up two months ago by the town's rabbi, Zvi Margalit, has received wide attention in Israel, becoming a painful symbol of the country's growing inability to integrate successfully the waves of new arrivals from the former Soviet republics. **********At least 15 soup kitchens like the one in Carmiel have sprung up in Israel's cities, serving close to 2,000 immigrants. Although this is only a small proportion of the immigrants, the very existence of the soup kitchens is viewed by many Israelis as a badge of shame. **********Yitzhak Peretz, Minister of Immigrant Absorption, declared recently that the soup kitchens were unnecessary, were ""causing destructive damage to continued immigration to Israel"" and should be eliminated.  350,000 Immigrants **********When President Chaim Herzog recently proposed setting up soup kitchens for immigrants, he was criticized. Israeli television considered the situation so delicate that it delayed for a week the broadcast of a report on the soup kitchen in Carmiel. **********Carmiel is a microcosm of the immigrant resettlement crisis throughout Israel, which has been struggling to find homes and jobs for more than 350,000 people who have arrived in the last two and a half years. **********About 40 percent of the immigrant work force is unemployed, according to official statistics, and most with jobs are not working in their professions. Fear of joblessness has kept others away, pushing immigration levels to their lowest point in two years. **********Israeli newspapers carry reports of Russian Jews lining up for handouts at open-air vegetable markets, of dozens of homeless immigrants poking through garbage cans and sleeping on the streets of Tel Aviv. **********Carmiel's founders built it as a planned community, complete with an industrial zone to provide employment. But it, too, can no longer supply enough jobs for the immigrants who have increased its population by at least 25 percent. Out of 32,000 residents, close to 7,000 are immigrants, and a third of the immigrant work force in town is idle. **********According to a study by the municipality, many of the jobless are 50 to 65 years old, people who are least likely to be hired and who have the greatest difficulty in acquiring skills needed to start new careers. **********They were the predominant group in the soup kitchen on a recent afternoon, though there were also some younger people at the tables. The young immigrants were the most reluctant to talk, and according to Rabbi Margalit, some visit him privately to collect food donations rather than endure the embarrassment of being seen dining on handouts.  Food Is Donated **********In a corner of the room, Oleg Khatutski and his wife, Lyudmila, ate a spare meal: half a vegetable cutlet, noodles, a piece of herring on bread and a slice of cake with tea, all donated by restaurants and food companies. **********Mr. Khatutski, 50, was a foreman in a ventilator plant in his native Kiev. After half a year in Carmiel, he says, he has been unable to find work. **********""I've been around to the factories, but there are no jobs,"" he said. ""My immigrant grant from the Government is running out, and I have no money to pay my rent and electricity bill. **********""I can't find words to explain to my son why I'm not working, and he can't understand it. It's embarrassing that I can't support him,"" he said. 'I Would Go Back' **********""People should not move here now, because without work they'll have nothing to do. I would go back if I had the opportunity."" **********Aleksandra Tsin, a 32-year-old accountant from Ukraine, said that after eight months in Carmiel she found that she had ""no chance"" to find work in her field. She said her husband, a computer engineer, had found a temporary job as a typesetter, but his earnings were too meager to support their family of four. **********Immigrant families were forced to share apartments to afford rent, Mrs. Tsin said. **********""The situation in Russia is very difficult, but conditions here have to be improved before more people can come,"" she said. ""I've written back to my relatives that they should look at the situation there and here, and make up their own minds whether to immigrate."" **********Ilya Demshak, 54, shielded his face to avoid being photographed at a soup-kitchen table. He said he was a doctor in the Ukrainian town of Donetsk, but could not find employment after more than a year and a half in Israel. **********""I'm ready to do any work, even sweep the streets, but they won't give me anything"" he said. **********A few blocks away at the municipal building, Mayor Adi Eldar said he believed that only 20 to 30 of the people coming to the soup kitchen were so impoverished that they had no money for food. But he conceded that the existence of the soup kitchen was a distressing sign. **********""As an Israeli I'm ashamed that we've reached such a state, but as an Israeli I want to solve the problem, and it can be solved,"" he said. Public Works Jobs **********Mr. Eldar pulled out a plan that he submitted recently to Mr. Peretz, in which he proposed a range of job-generating public works programs for Carmiel. The plan requires Government money, and Mr. Eldar, a member of the opposition Labor Party, said American loan guarantees to Israel were ""critical"" to such projects. **********But that might first require a shift of Government priorities, he said. **********""The highest priority is immigrant absorption, not the development of anything else,"" Mr. Eldar said. **********Rina Grinberg, who heads the local Russian immigrant association, said that while most of the newcomers in Carmiel have been successfully resettled, there are about 100 families that require donations to survive. **********She estimated that the scarcity of jobs would have driven 20 percent of the immigrants if not for a requirement that they repay all Government aid before going abroad. **********""Most of the people would like to stay, but their problem is simply jobs,"" she said. ""They're prepared to compromise on the kind of work, the only thing they want is to make a living. We're just not giving them the chance."""

Can Help New Businesses,Your Taxes; I.R.S. Can Help New Businesses," **********For a fledgling entrepreneur or a moonlighter who hires part-time help, the tax code's reporting requirements for businesses can seem daunting. **********No matter how modest their incomes and expenses, businesses face paperwork that far outstrips what individual taxpayers must deal with every year, from quarterly -- or even more frequent -- filing deadlines for reports to withholding employees' taxes. **********An accountant can help navigate new territory, and in some cases is indispensable. But for the smallest businesses there is nothing in the tax rules so complicated that it cannot be managed single-handedly if care is taken. **********To avoid running afoul of the law, Internal Revenue Service officials and other tax experts say, it is essential to get an early start, making sure all the requirements are understood from the outset. **********Several people starting businesses -- including a house painter, a pair of jewelers and a freelance medical lab consultant -- were found the other day in one place where people can go to unravel the mysteries of small business tax reporting. **********It was a clinic sponsored by the Internal Revenue Service, which runs occasional daylong classes in cities all over the country for this purpose. **********At the clinic, two tax agents presented the basic information about how to organize a small business's tax records. They also passed out a panoply of forms and instruction manuals, and took questions from the audience of about two dozen men and women. **********Although the presentations were somewhat cursory and confusing, they did provide answers to some of the most common questions asked by novice entrepreneurs. Many participants had experienced common problems, and the buzz of background conversation gave the classroom something of the air of a support group. **********The I.R.S. also offers a videotape in which the material for these seminars is presented, allowing viewers to replay some parts and skip others.  Although the videotape alone cannot answer all likely questions, it is better organized and more clearly explained than the live lectures covering much of the same ground. **********The tape can be borrowed at no cost from the public affairs branch of many local I.R.S. offices. It would also be a good idea to pick up a copy of I.R.S. Publication 334, the Tax Guide for Small Business, although like many of the agency's publications this one makes ""Finnegan's Wake"" look as straightforward as ""Winnie the Pooh."" **********The agents who gave the seminar offered to write down complicated questions so that they could provide full answers later; they also made a point of telling everyone in the room where the nearest I.R.S. office is, in case anyone wanted personal attention. **********The seminars cover everything from how to fill out W-2 forms for reporting an employee's income to how to report the receipt of cash payments of $10,000 or more, a prospect that seemed appealing to many of the new business owners in the room. **********The most common problem for new businesses, according to the tax agency, is in failing to withhold taxes properly from the wages paid to employees. Depending on the size of the payroll, tax payments might have to be deposited at authorized financial institutions, like banks, as often as several times a month. Even very small businesses must send withheld taxes directly to the I.R.S. every three months. **********The penalty for failing to make these deposits is equal to 100 percent of the tax, including Social Security and Medicare taxes, so it is vital not to fall behind. **********Simply to avoid the aggravation of the withholding requirement, some businesses try to describe employees as independent contractors, whose pay is not subject to withholding and must be reported just once a year, on Form 1099. But there are legal tests for who is actually an independent contractor and who is an employee; the key one is whether the payer has the right to exercise direction and control over the person being paid. **********The I.R.S. views misclassifications as an area of abuse and is cracking down. Any auditor is likely to question whether payments to an independent contractor were actually wages paid to an employee."

One Fed Hand Against Another"," **********ONE of the most perplexing aspects of the current recession is the failure of aggressive monetary policy to translate into economic growth. One reason for the failure is the way in which one arm of the Federal Government -- bank regulatory policy -- has worked against the other arm, monetary policy. **********As in all slumps, the Federal Reserve has attempted to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates, cutting reserve requirements and increasing aggregate reserves in the banking system. These measures usually lead banks to make more commercial loans to businesses, which can then create more jobs. **********This time, the Fed's strategy is not working. A recent report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation confirms the anecdotal evidence of small-business owners: that banks are investing more in government securities than in commercial loans. According to that report, as of June, banks had more than 21 percent of their assets invested in Treasury securities, the highest percentage since 1973. By contrast, commercial and industrial loans made up only 16 percent of bank assets, the lowest percentage in the past decade. **********Unfortunately, a recent confluence of economic events and banking regulations makes it logical for banks to concentrate so heavily in government securities. Under the Basel Accords, the new risk-based international capital standards, a bank must hold twice as much capital to make a business loan as required for a residential loan and four times as much capital for a business loan as required for a Freddie Mac or a Ginnie Mae security. Yet a bank need not hold any capital when it purchases government securities. **********Business loans carry more risk than government securities and are subject to the scrutiny of occasionally overzealous Federal regulators.  Since the current rate of return on a commercial loan is similar to that of risk-free government securities, it is no wonder that banks consider those securities a more attractive investment than business loans. **********The ongoing reallocation of bank assets into government securities, regardless of the lowering of interest rates, makes plain that our bank regulatory policy and monetary policy are at odds. **********Here, then, are some steps we can take to make commercial lending more appealing to banks: *********** Create a secondary market for commercial and industrial loans. This would serve to increase the profitability and availability of those loans, much as Freddie Mac and Sallie Mae have done for residential mortgages and student loans. *********** Modify the Basel risk-based capital standards to account for the interest rate fluctuation of securities. This would create an environment in which capital requirements for commercial loans and government securities are more balanced, enhancing the appeal of commercial lending. *********** Reduce the leverage capital ratio to a uniform 3 percent to enable banks to increase lending. The current ratio, between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent, places unnecessary constraints on lending. This lower ratio, and the Basel standards, would insure a sound capital base without stifling lending. *********** Extend the phase-in period of the new Basel Accords, particularly for those banks most involved in small-business lending. This would allow smaller banks to adjust to the new standards without the added pressure of the recession. **********In the new Administration, bank regulators and the Federal Reserve must sing the same tune: Stimulating economic growth is our No. 1 national priority. We must reduce the deficit and synchronize our monetary and regulatory policy, so that banks can get back in the business of making commercial loans. If we fail to do so, more economic stagnation and higher unemployment will be the likely, tragic results."

""It's a deterrent to people who block their calls and who could be a pain in the neck,"" said Susan J. Rubin, Bell Atlantic's product manager for Caller ID. **********Often marketed as a deterrent to obscene and prank callers, Caller ID displays the telephone number of incoming callers on a small device beside the telephone. Some consumer advocates, however, regard Caller ID as an invasion of privacy and a way for businesses to record numbers for commercial purposes. Thus, many states require Bell Atlantic and other carriers to allow callers to block their numbers. **********This, of course, led inevitably to anti-anti-Caller ID. People with anti-Caller ID calling a household with Anonymous Call Rejection will now be told that if they want to complete their calls, they must redial without blocking their numbers. Centel, U S West and BellSouth either offer or plan to offer similar services. **********The Bell Atlantic service became available last Friday in Northern Virginia. Virginia callers cannot block telephone numbers, but customers in nearby Maryland and Washington can. The company plans to expand anti-anti-Caller ID to those areas and Delaware between now and September. **********Shares of Bell Atlantic, whose other operating telephone companies include Bell of Pennsylvania, New Jersey Bell and Diamond State Telephone of Delaware, were unchanged yesterday at $44.75 on the New York Stock Exchange."

The Russian court of Peter the Great had an entire troop of Cossacks guard its annual shipment to St. Petersburg. Voltaire contended that the wine, distinguished by an intense honeyed richness, ""invigorates every fiber of the brain."" **********But less glorious times have since befallen the wine, whose famed Aszu variety is made like Sauternes from overripe grapes affected by the Botrytis cinerea, the ""noble rot"" that produces some of the world's best sweet wines. When Hungary became a Communist state in 1948, the best vineyards were seized and entrusted to a revolutionary unit by the name of the ""state wine combine."" **********The Soviet Union became its chief, but not always most discerning, client, taking well over half the production of a wine somtimes called ""the golden aristocrat"". **********""The Kremlin loved the best bottles, but generally Moscow was more interested in the number of litres than their quality,"" said the Tokay combine's general director, Andras Bacso, an enologist manifestly weary of political upheaval on his turf. Staff Cuts Don't Stem Losses **********Now, however, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, that market has disappeared. Other important East bloc markets have shrunk because the countries are penniless. The state company's staff has been slashed to 1,108 from 2,400 over the last two years, but it is still losing money. **********""We have to sell Tokay in the West now, but we lost our image there and the generation which loved to consume this wine is dead,"" rued Zoltan Hegedus, the commercial director. **********Enter the presumed redeemer of all Eastern European lost causes: privatization. But, as countries from Czechoslovkia to Russia are finding, privatization is complicated. **********It requires capital, but the citizens of these former Communist countries generally do not have any. Foreigners, of course, do; but they are not always welcome. Moreover, the property to be privatized belonged to someone before Communism, and that person's family may want to make a claim. **********All these ticklish issues are afflicting the proposed privatization of Tokay, whose sale to foreigners is particularly sensitive because the wine is a revered symbol. ""Tokay is our blood,"" said Janos Pogacsas, a local grower working for the state combine. **********Blood is not easily parted with. Almost two years after embarking on an ambitious plan to sell the best of the approximately 15,500 acres of Tokay vineyards to the private sector -- preferably West European or American wineries or wine merchants with marketing know-how -- Mr. Hegedus conceded that ""frankly the process has become a mess."" **********The initial plan was clear enough. It called for the old famed estates of Hungarian nobles such as the Esterhazy family to be reconstituted and sold as individual chateaus, so imbuing the wine once more with individualism after 40 years in the Communist compressor. **********Ernst & Young, the accounting concern, was called in a year ago to evaluate the 17 chosen estates, with viticultural areas ranging from 100 to 500 acres. Prices -- generally in the $3 million to $5 million range -- were set and potential buyers, both Hungarian and international, invited to take a look. **********But then, in February, Hungary passed a so-called ""compensation law,"" allowing the pre-1948 owners of property to make claims on land or other possessions lost to the Communists. The claims are limited to a maximum value of about $62,000; compensation takes the form of vouchers that can be used to buy property. **********Because claims have been made on many of the Tokay chateaus, sales have been delayed. ""There are more grandfathers and great-grandmothers around than we thought,"" Mr. Hegedus said. The claims and counterclaims are not expected to be resolved before early 1993. **********In addition, many believe that after an initial burst of enthusiasm for privatization the State Property Agency, which oversees sales, has become bogged down in bureaucracy and political hesitation. One Chateau Is Sold **********The sale of one chateau, on which no claims existed, was completed this year. The Hetszollo estate adjoining the village of Tokay was sold to a Bordeaux-based French-Japanese company, Grands Millesimes de France, which paid about $4 million for 75.2 percent of the vineyard. The balance is owned by the state and the municipality of Tokay. **********""We believe we can make a great wine again, but it will take time,"" said Aymar de Baillenx, the company's general director. **********Mr. Pogacsas, the grower, vehemently rejected the notion that the wine had declined in quality. In a candle-lit vault in the fungus-coated cellars where Tokay Aszu is stored in casks for at least six years before being bottled, he uncorked a bottle dating from 1956 -- the year the Soviet Union crushed Hungary's uprising against Communism. It tasted of nectar, rich and autumnal, with a hint of sherry-like dryness lingering in the mouth. **********""I was young when I made this wine and now I am old,"" he said. ""But I know that our future greatness is rooted in our past traditions. If this is ever sold to foreigners, I will rise from my grave to protest."""

They assumed their talented son had spent some part of his last year at Morehouse College in Atlanta applying to graduate schools or looking for a job, as most anxious seniors do. **********No, he told them after the family returned to its hotel from a shopping trip. ""They said, 'Well, this is your last party. After that you're on your own,' "" Mr. Diggs said. **********College graduates are supposed to be cosmically unsettled in this, the year of the worst job market for recent grads in 50 years. So why do neither Derrick Diggs, nor his friend Imar Hutchins, seem in the least bit jittery? **********Perhaps because they know what they want. The pair opted off the future-shock treadmill to develop a national network of private preschools called Freeform Academy -- a kind of shoe-leather, from-the-ground-up version of Chris Whittle's Edison Project. One school with 15 preschoolers is already open in Atlanta. Mr. Hutchins and Mr. Diggs plan to open five more there next fall and, in the next few years, move, as they say, ""concentrically"" from their Atlanta base into neighboring states, up the Eastern Seaboard and across the country. **********Baby boomers, well into middle age and as yet without majors, may want to pause over the example of Mr. Hutchins, 22 years old, and Mr. Diggs, 23. Though they are members of the supposedly lost and forlorn Generation X, their intensity -- if not their discipline -- feels familiar. They would like not merely to start schools, but to transform institutions. **********They have been counseled to go slowly in their venture, to think small, to postpone while they credential themselves. No. ""Now's the time,"" said Mr. Hutchins, who reads the Harvard Business Review to relax.  ""If you feel the fire now, do it. The fire isn't always on you."" **********But, unlike their befringed, be-bell-bottomed 60's counterparts, they view private enterprise as the path to transformation -- and self-sufficiency. **********The two men have an abiding faith in the gospel of entrepreneurialism, instilled by their fathers who owned businesses. In the year before graduation, they talked among friends at Morehouse about possible ventures. Certain existential decisions were made. ""We decided what we weren't going to do, not what we would do,"" Mr. Hutchins said. ""We knew something would come."" What they weren't going to do included going off One of an occasional series on the experiences of recent college graduates.  to any of the prestigious graduate programs or big companies that were courting them. The confidence to take a risky, unconventional tack came in part from their experience at Morehouse, in part from family. **********BOTH were economics majors, both good and active students. Mr. Hutchins, who is from Philadelphia, graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Mr. Diggs, from Wichita, was an honors student and an All-American sprinter for three years. He says, simply, ""I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur like my dad."" When Mr. Hutchins was seven, his father helped him start Imar's Card Company. He went door-to-door in his neighborhood, selling greeting cards his father got wholesale. ""The inventory would be magically renewed when I ran out,"" he said. ""My father set it up so I couldn't fail."" **********Providing opportunities for such ""microsuccesses"" to develop student confidence is an important part of the Freeform Academy curriculum. The idea for a school open to all and oriented to the needs of African-American children was one of several on the menu of the senior-year discussions, suggested by a fellow student, Ayize Sabater. Mr. Hutchins was intrigued, but less with the school than with the potential. ""A lot of people have schools,"" Mr. Hutchins said. ""I said, 'Wait, we don't need one school, we need a hundred schools.' "" Mr. Sabater is now principal of the school and its chief resource in educational philosophy and teacher training. **********The notion that a venture of such magnitude could be successful is so improbable that -- who knows? -- it might work. McDonald's was once a single entity. Mr. Hutchins, the company president, and Mr. Diggs, its chief financial officer, undertook a two-month tour in the fall to take word of Freeform to educational groups around the country. At the moment they are scouting sites in Atlanta for the five schools they intend to open next August. They and six full-time workers are living on nearly infinitesimal draws and a belief in Freeform's future. As they expand concentrically, they plan to increase the number of new schools geometrically. By the time Chris Whittle gets his first school off the ground in 1996, they point out, there should be several dozen Freeform Academies up and running strong. AVERAGE VERSUS EXCELLENT **********FOR now, Freeform Academy is operating on tuition payments ($75 a week), donations, a little startup capital and a lot of sweat equity. Derrick Diggs and Imar Hutchins, the two founders, put in long hours, as do several other full-time employees. Freeform's principal, Ayize Sabater, opens the school at 7 A.M. and goes home at 8 P.M. **********Mr. Diggs and Mr. Hutchins already have in mind some entrepreneurial pitfalls. To control the sirens of unfettered growth, they have delayed plans to open schools outside Atlanta next year. And though they will probably seek venture capital at some point, they decline to think in terms of big infusions just yet. ""That's the least of our worries,"" Mr. Diggs says. ""People is what we need."" **********Describing the type of venture he wants Freeform to be, Mr. Hutchins refers to wisdom garnered from a recent Harvard Business Review. ""An average company fulfills consumer demand,"" he says. ""An excellent company leads consumers to the market. We're trying to see the hidden demand."" He has little doubt it's there. The lone Freeform in existence now has a long waiting list."

For many in the industry, it was the final seal of approval on a technology that remained controversial as long as it was exclusive to smaller, less conservative computer makers. **********But that interpretation does not sit well with Irving Wladawsky-Berger, who is responsible for the supercomputing business at the International Business Machines Corporation. **********""For me to say now we've finally put our seal of approval on this would sound supremely arrogant,"" he said. ""Let's just say we have committed to build a product family of parallel RISC systems that scale up from our RS/6000."" **********RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, is a technology that speeds processing by relegating more tasks to software; the RS/6000 is the name for both a chip set and a computer work station produced by I.B.M. using RISC. **********Dr. Wladawsky-Berger said the impetus to create a massively parallel supercomputer came from RS/6000 customers who were creating a sort of virtual parallel processor by linking multiple work stations. **********""There were people pushing at I.B.M., but they were pushing in many different directions,"" he said. ""Supercomputing is an area where if you get seven smart people together, you get 17 different architectures."" **********""We had lots of bright ideas,"" Dr. Wladawsky-Berger added, ""but what finally set the pace for us was the customers putting their RS/6000's together in clusters."" **********A Cuban native born of Eastern European parents, Dr. Wladawsky-Berger came to the United States in 1960 and went on to earn a master's degree and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago. **********He said he got seduced by computers while working on atomic physics calculations, and joined I.B.M.'s research staff shortly after completing his degrees in 1970. **********""Whenever I get back to supercomputing, I feel like I'm getting back to basics, to my youth,"" said Dr. Wladawsky-Berger, who is 46 years old.

Military planners say more favorable geography and fewer potentially hostile troops with less sophisticated weapons distinguish the clan warfare in Somalia from Bosnia. **********Political leaders here seem eager to draw that distinction, since the United States has resisted using military force in the Balkans and there is concern that doing so in Somalia would set an uncomfortable precedent. It's Not Yugoslavia **********""In the case of what was Yugoslavia, it ought to be clear to everyone that the use of force as a means of bringing that war to an end would require far more in the way of troops and far more in the way of commitment,"" Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said Saturday on CNN. **********The soldiers in Somalia are essentially roving bands of poorly trained young men and teen-agers. With few hills and no forests to hide larger forces, reconnaissance planes, helicopter gunships and fighter aircraft would have a distinct advantage. **********""They could make things uncomfortable for a large, modern force by sniping, setting booby traps and mines,"" one United States military official involved with the relief operation said in a telephone interview from Mombasa, Kenya. ""We could come in with artillery, mortars, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, tanks and armored personnel carriers. We could really deal with them in short order.""  First, End the Thievery **********Military planners envision first establishing regional supply centers to deny the clan fighters the stolen supplies and financial tributes that finance their arms purchases. If they meet resistance, they are prepared to forcibly disarm the Somalis. **********United States forces would turn over control to United Nations troops within four to six months, following the pattern established by the Pentagon in its efforts to bring aid to the Kurds in northern Iraq. **********The aim of the operation would be to secure the ports and airfields and then escort relief supplies to safe havens. United States officials say there are about eight airfields in Somalia with permanent runways; two can accommodate heavy transport planes. In addition to Mogadishu, the main ports are Berbera and Kismayu. **********""By its nature, it's not too significant a military operation,"" said a senior Administration official. ""You move in, take the airfields in a half dozen places, then clear out the roads and establish an environment and let the aid go. And the combat forces could be replaced by peacekeepers. **********""To have had that kind of military operation, that could be repeated as necessary -- I think it would be a pretty good object lesson. It would create a new environment, having mounted an operation like that.""  New Willingness by Clans **********Since Washington's proposal was reported last week, the leaders of two important Somali factions have said they would welcome United States troops. The statements appear to indicate the hope of clan leaders that cooperation now will better position them to wield political control once Western forces withdraw. **********Administration officials say that the figure of 30,000 in some news reports was exaggerated, but that a force of 15,000 to 20,000 is conceivable. The size reflects the doctrine of Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to use decisive force and maintain United States control over any military operation. **********The composition of the force is being determined by Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, the commander of the United States Central Command, who was asked by General Powell last Wednesday to develop a plan. **********It is expected to include a Marine Amphibious Ready Group of 1,800 that is off the coast of India. It had been headed to the Persian Gulf for an exercise, but is being diverted toward the African coast. The force includes four ships and has tanks, 155-mm howitzers and four AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters. Army, Air Force and Navy units are also to be included. **********The Marines are expected to arrive off Somalia this week, initially to provide communications and other logistical assistance to 200 Pakistani peacekeepers who are to join 500 Pakistanis now in Mogadishu."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/21/business/informal-latin-economy-saves-day.html,Nathaniel Nash,1992-03-21,,1348,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Informal Latin Economy Saves Day,Informal Latin Economy Saves Day," **********On every downtown city block here, men and women sit hawking their wares. From Bic lighters to Snickers candy bars to Brut shaving cream to Japanese television sets. **********This helter-skelter commerce is only the most visible part of a vast informal economy that includes home building in Brazil, large parts of the bus system in Lima, Peru, and textile manufacturing in Bolivia. **********Economists say that in the aftermath of a coup attempt in Venezuela earlier this year that has many politicians wondering how to strengthen the democratic process here, this segment of Latin America's economy, once scorned for evading taxes and fees, has become government's best friend. **********The reason: Many Latin governments are in the delicate and lengthy process of reordering their economies, laying off tens of thousands of workers and cutting back on social programs. But that is not resulting in long lines of the unemployed because the informal economy is creating millions of jobs, feeding families and generating some of the most vibrant economic growth on the continent. **********In industrialized countries, such marginal business activity might be shut down and outlawed. But not here. More and more politicians are realizing that letting the informal economy alone buys them much-needed time to attract new foreign investment, modernize industry and find new sources of development, without fear of social pressure that might push them back into the days of military government and subversive terrorist groups. **********""This part of the economy is one of the most socially stabilizing factors in Latin America,"" said Grisela Mendoza, an economist with the consulting firm of Muller & Associates in La Paz. ""These are some of the most robust segments of our economies."" **********Businesses in the informal economy often pay no taxes, have no licenses, offer no social security or medical benefits and sometimes deal in smuggled goods. But they also buttress parts of the formal economy -- so much so that governments are increasingly using a hands-off approach in dealing with the unlicensed, tax-free sector. **********""Governments are finding that many of these companies over time tend to integrate naturally"" with established businesses, said Francisco Leon, an economist with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. **********In Chile, for example, he said many small businesses that do not pay taxes make goods that they then sell to large tax-paying companies. Those transactions separate the informal economy from a pure black market, bolster the industrial sector and help the informal sector to grow and mature. Sharp Recent Growth **********The informal sector, though long a part of Latin American commerce, has grown sharply in the last decade. In Bolivia, economists calculate that if the informal economy did not exist, the country's unemployment rate of 7 percent would jump to 35 percent. **********""I think it's safe to say that if you didn't have the informals you would have riots in the street in many capitals,"" said Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist and former adviser to President Alberto Fujimori. **********A recent study by the United Nations Regional Program for Employment in Latin America and the Caribbean found that employment in the informal sector had risen to almost 35 percent of total urban employment,from 20 percent at the end of the 1970's. At the same time, urban unemployment fell to about 5 percent, from a peak of nearly 10 percent in 1983. **********The informal economy represents up to 40 percent of urban employment in many countries, and in Peru economists say the figure is closer to 70 percent. This implies total employment at close to 40 million. Exact numbers are next to impossible to calculate by the very nature of this sector. **********""You can't afford to crack down on these people,"" Mr. de Soto said.  ""They are in the informal sector because they have no choice. They have no access to credit. They cannot get their business application approved. Or they are just prohibited from opening such a business. They have nowhere else to go. If you start to crack down on them, they are bound to explode into political or violent opposition."" How It's Defined **********How economists define the informal sector varies widely. Most include only companies engaged in legal activities but not registered with the government because of excessive red tape, that do not pay taxes and fees, and do not provide their workers with required social security benefits and health coverage. **********Still others include those involved in contraband trade and even drug trafficking and money laundering. Some economists say contraband trafficking -- excluding the cocaine trade -- accounts for only 11 percent of the sector's economic activity. **********Many companies try to show at least some form of adherence to the laws. The United Nations study, for example, found that in Mexico only 27 percent of its small, informal-sector companies had not at least tried to register with the Government. **********It is precisely the slowness with which government agencies move that leads many companies to work outside the law. Long Waits Are Common **********In Ecuador, for example, it takes 180 to 240 days for a manufacturing company to register with the Government. In Venezuela, it takes up to 310 days; in Guatemala, up to 525 days. **********Brazil, Mexico and Chile all require more than 20 applications before a company can be approved for business. This leads to tremendous start up costs, which make it nearly impossible for small entrepreneurs to follow the rules. **********Moreover, complying with government regulations can be prohibitive. The United Nations labor group found that the cost of running a business in a number of Latin American countries could be as high as 70 percent of the company's annual revenues. **********So businessmen skirt the law. **********In Uruguay, a common practice is getting permission to manufacture, say, cosmetics, a license relatively easy to obtain. The business then manufactures a broad range of industrial chemicals, which it can argue are either integral to cosmetics or an offshoot of that business. 'License Pending' **********In Venezuela, small entrepreneurs often apply for a license to do business and then put in their windows a sign that reads ""License Pending."" **********""They just make the application once and do nothing more,"" said Victor E. Tokman, executive director of the United Nations Regional Employment Program. ""So when the inspector comes around they point to the application."" **********While some have argued that informal sectors are bound to disintegrate because they pay low wages, that contention has been disputed by some economists. Mr. Tokman says that on average, informal-economy wages are roughly comparable to minimum wages in Latin countries. Muller & Associates found that in comparing worker wages in the formal sector with those of the informal sector, the informal-sector workers often earned as much as $7 a month more. **********""In one poll we found that 38 percent of those interviewed said that they preferred the independent work of the micro-entrepreneur,"" the firm said. ""The informality offers a flexibility and independence that the formal companies cannot match."" Formal employment relationships do provide health care, vacation and other benefits, but government clinics provide low-cost health care to all people. Challenge for Governments **********The challenge for Latin governments, as they grow, is to incorporate the informal sectors into the mainstream of their economies, reducing tax evasion and enabling governments to crack down on illegal activities. **********Mr. de Soto argues that while the informal economy offers governments a breathing space, sooner or later these entrepreneurs will get tired of not have legal title to land and businesses and of being locked out of credit. **********""These people are getting very politically active and they are not taking things so easily any more,"" he said. ""If over time they still cannot get a loan, or title to their land, you will find them moving toward guerrilla groups, to the side of certain military factions, to downright criminal activity."""

Shows Library for Data Storage," **********I.B.M., seeking to fill a glaring hole in its $7.2 billion computer data-storage business, yesterday introduced its first tape library system to handle vast storehouses of corporate information automatically. **********The market for the digital tape libraries is booming, as large data processing customers attempt to cope with an information explosion created by new computer applications affecting virtually all aspects of business and government. **********International Business Machines, based in Armonk, N.Y., is entering a business now dominated by Storage Technology, a Louisville, Colo., company that pioneered the complex tape library systems that permit large computer sites to archive trillions of bytes of data automatically on magnetic tape cartridges that are shuttled back and forth by robot arms. **********I.B.M. is hoping to gain ground on Storage Technology quickly by enticing customers with an ambitious software system that integrates all types of storage into a single system, making more efficient use of data storage space. **********""Today's announcement takes away all the doubt about us in tape storage,"" said Ray AbuZayyad, general manager of I.B.M.'s storage products division. **********Modern computer systems have a hierarchy of different types of storage, ranging from the fastest and most risky -- D-RAM, or dynamic random-access memory chips -- to the slowest and safest, magnetic tape cartridges. **********While I.B.M. has remained conspicuously absent from the tape library market in recent years, Storage Technology has grown to $1.5 billion on the strength of its tape library business. In 1991, sale of its robot libraries had grown to more than 57 percent of its total revenue. **********Although the new I.B.M. product will not be available until early next year, analysts said that I.B.M.'s announcement was likely to slow buying decisions by corporate, government, academic and scientific customers. **********""What I.B.M. is trying to do is get in early on the decision cycle,"" said Kathryn Hilton, program director of storage systems research at Infocorp, a Santa Clara, Calif., market research firm. ""They're trying to make people think twice about buying Storage Technology."" **********In an effort to get a jump on I.B.M., Storage Technology announced a faster generation of library systems last week and a smaller system targeted at midrange computers. The company, which has installed about 4,000 tape libraries -- many of them connected to I.B.M. mainframe computers -- timed its announcement to pre-empt I.B.M.'s entry into the market. **********Both companies are trying to grab their customers' attention long before the products will be generally available. I.B.M. said yesterday that its new libraries, which are priced between $395,000 and $851,000 and will store up to 45 trillion bytes of data, would not be in full production until 1993. **********Last week Storage Technology said that its two new products would begin shipping in the third and fourth quarters of this year."

They are looking at their bottom lines and at the array of proposals and manuscripts being offered to them, and, with a sense of restraint forgotten in the acquisitive 80's, they are learning to say, ""No, thank you."" **********As a result, lists are leaner at most publishing houses, with fewer titles being printed. Publishers say they are looking with greater discretion at book outlines, turning away things they probably would have accepted a few years ago. Important Changes **********This appetite control prompted important changes at three publishing houses in the last few months. **********Simon & Schuster dissolved Summit Books and dismissed the imprint's founder and publisher, James Silberman. **********Farrar, Straus & Giroux cut about 15 percent of its staff, including its executive editor, Linda Healey. And the company's president, Roger Straus Jr., said it was no longer expanding its journalistic nonfiction as it had planned. **********And just last week, Bantam Books announced that its publisher, Linda Grey, was leaving her job to start her own imprint within Bantam that would emphasize best sellers, while the house as a whole would be cutting back its book list. **********""The better you can focus and spend your creative energy on your books, the better you publish them and the better they sell,"" said Jack Hoeft, president and chief executive at Bantam, Doubleday, Dell, the parent company. ""I think we can do that better with a tighter list. I think everyone is seeing that now."" **********Like many other industries, publishing went through an age of gluttony in the 1980's. Editors and publishers say they were often not sufficiently discriminating in the books they bought. They piled up acquisitions like so many trophies, sometimes without being sure what exactly they had won. 'Too Many Books Out There' **********""Before, people used to ask, 'Why shouldn't I publish this?' "" said Harold Evans, publisher of the Random House Adult Trade division. ""Now the question they are asking is, 'Why do I have to publish this?' People say there are too many books out there, and it's probably a fair observation. The conventional wisdom is that all publishers should publish fewer titles."" **********Talk of cutting lists usually provokes talk of the worthy books that will go unpublished as a result. But Phyllis E. Grann, the president and chief executive of the Putnam-Berkley Group, said bluntly, ""The books that suffer are the ones you don't need."" **********""I don't think good books are hurting,"" said Mrs. Grann, who made her publishing house a success in part by cutting the number of hardcover titles from some 225 when she first arrived in 1976 to about 75 titles in the early 80's, a number that she has kept fairly steady. **********""I really believe a book that is really good will be published, even if it's a print run of only 4,000 or if it ends up with a smaller house,"" she said. ""But there's a lot of junk that won't get published, and I think that's good."" **********Barry Lippman, president of the adult trade division at Macmillan, said his company also started trimming its list four years ago, going from more than 400 hardcover titles to 300 across five different imprints. This move, he said, has led to increased profits in each of the last three years. **********""There are just so many books one can edit and sell effectively,"" he said. ""People talk about all the books and authors that lose out when you trim lists, but I think they suffer more when you take on too many books and can't publish them well."" **********All of this is not to say that the entire publishing industry is on some communal crash diet. What is going on is mostly nipping and tucking, and several houses have combination austerity and growth programs, with certain divisions shrinking while others are expanding. **********Random House Adult Trade is trimming its list, but its subsidiary, Times Books, is growing. Another Random House division, Pantheon, is reorganizing and expanding, now with the help of Ms. Healey, who joined there as a vice president and senior editor. **********HarperCollins is trimming its adult trade, or general-interest, hardcover list and its Zondervan religious book department, but Harper Business and Basic Books are adding titles. **********William S. Shinker, publisher of the adult trade division at HarperCollins, said his company's procedure for trimming involved keeping meticulous computerized records of books that were bought, by category and expected delivery date. Then at the weekly acquisitions meetings, where editors discuss new books they want to buy, they consult the list and see if, for example, there is a hole on the list for a big nonfiction book being proposed for the spring of 1993. **********If there is room, the book is analyzed more intensely than before for its merit, the track record of the author and the competition. If there is no room and an editor still feels the book is one that the company should publish, ""then we still might go after it,"" Mr. Shinker said, ""but the standards are pretty high, and we simply have to say no more than we used to."" **********Despite the recent upheaval at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, the publishing house's managing director, Roger Straus 3d, discounted all the industry talk about cutting back and said he had ""no deep religious belief in downsizing."" **********""This is one of those trends that everyone always starts talking about when times get tough,"" Mr. Straus said. ""The trouble with downsizing as a concept is if someone could tell up front which books would sell and which wouldn't, it would be brilliant. But since most of us can't really tell, it becomes a dangerous idea that could make things worse."" **********But while nearly everyone in the publishing industry seems to want to lose the literary equivalent of 5 to 10 pounds, not everyone has the willpower. Donald S. Lamm, chairman and president of W. W. Norton, said that although he began an effort to scale back three years ago, the house's list this fall would grow by some 5 hardcover and 10 paperback titles. **********""I thought we were cutting back, but it seems I don't know how to do it,"" Mr. Lamm said. ""There are still a lot of interesting manuscripts out there, and it's hard to break the habit. If something good comes down the road, I just can't say, 'Sorry, we already filled our quota.' You don't slam the door on a good manuscript."""

Four senior health officials, all doctors, are charged with knowingly allowing the blood to be used for transfusions in 1985 even though they had been told it was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. **********Lawyers for the plaintiffs, all hemophiliacs, say the officials failed to destroy the blood stocks and ignored decontamination techniques available outside France. **********On Monday, Thierry Choquot, a 31-year-old hemophiliac, took the stand. Stooping and clutching his notes, he told the court that he would take only a moment since he had not come to argue for recompense or to plead for revenge. What he offered instead was a phrase for the officials accused of knowingly contaminating him and many others. **********""I found a quote from Montaigne that expresses my thoughts,"" he said, his face pale as he reached for words written by the 16th-century essayist. ""Montaigne said that science without conscience is but the ruin of the soul."" **********With that, Mr. Choquot sat down. **********Many in the courtroom turned tense and tearful as a woman dressed in black grieved over her 29-year-old son, lost to AIDS two years ago as a result of transfusions of a contaminated blood-clotting substance. **********""I wanted him to be here,"" she wept. ""How could doctors do this? It is unbelievable."" **********Lawyers representing victims say the tainted blood has already infected at least 1,500 hemophiliacs in France with H.I.V., causing 256 deaths so far. **********The scandal has deeply unsettled a nation that boasts of enjoying the best quality of life and the most advanced medical procedures on the Continent. At the same time, France has the highest incidence of AIDS cases in Europe, with 22,000 people suffering from the disease and an estimated 200,000 people carrying H.I.V.. **********Almost every day, the public reads or hears accounts of the ""trial of collective poisoning,"" as some newspapers call the proceedings at the Palace of Justice on the Ile de la Cite. **********Outside the elegant iron gates of the palace, demonstrators chant ""Assassins!"" and hold up ""Guilty!"" signs, puzzling the tourists posing for pictures and following guides through the courtyards of the historic complex.  Government Accused of Stalling **********Some commentators say the trial has further corroded the French public's faith in Government institutions, which have sweeping powers but are often secretive and lack accountability. Lawyers cite the fact that it has taken four years for the criminal charges brought by the hemophiliacs to come to trial. **********""I have no proof, but many indications that the Government tried to stall this case,"" said Pierre Chaigne, a lawyer for several victims. **********As new details emerged in recent days, lawyers and victims continued to focus on two central questions: How much did the Government know? And why did health officials, if they were aware that much of the national blood supply was contaminated with the virus, order that existing supplies continue to be sold in 1985? **********The four accused officials have argued in their defense that their superiors were also aware of the dangers and that they could not be held responsible because they were part of a bureaucracy in which many other people were involved in decision making. **********Michel Zaoui, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, retorted today in court: ""We are not in a totalitarian system, where to get out of the system you need to be a hero. To get out of democratic bureaucracy you only need to be a man of conscience.""  3 Ex-Ministers Testify **********In the last few days, the court has heard testimony from three Government ministers who were in power in 1985, four years into President Francois Mitterrand's first term. **********Testifying as a witness, Edmond Herve, who was Deputy Health Minister, stunned many in the court by admitting that he knew that most of the blood supply was contaminated with H.I.V. as early as June 1985. Mr. Herve acknowledged that he could not adequately explain why stocks were not withdrawn until four months later. He said he had allowed their use until October 1985 on the advice of experts. **********Laurent Fabius, the former Prime Minister, and Georgina Dufoix, former Minister of Social Affairs, testified last Friday that they had not been informed of the problem and that they did not know that heat treatment, already in use in the United States and Canada at the time, was needed to decontaminate the stocks. But representatives of hemophiliacs have said that they told the Government about the procedure orally and in writing long before use of the contaminated blood was halted. **********People with hemophilia lack the proteins that allow blood to clot, but bleeding can be stanched with clotting factors, each dose of which is extracted from the blood of donors. In the early 1980's, people with severe hemophilia, who used blood proteins several times a week, were almost doomed to infection with H.I.V. **********The Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had warned of the risks involved in administering unheated blood-clotting substances to hemophiliacs in October 1984. In early 1985, the virus was cleansed from the American supply. Lawyers for the French plaintiffs say that while French officials could have bought the screening technology from the United States, they waited until France had developed its own method by October 1985.  Possible Prison Terms **********The defendants are Michel Garretta, who was director of the National Blood Transfusion Center in 1985; Jean-Pierre Allain, who was assistant director; Jacques Roux, a former Director General of Health, and Robert Netter, former head of the Public Health Laboratory. All could face prison terms if found guilty of the charges. **********The plaintiffs' lawyers took the unusual step this week of filing a separate suit in the High Court of Justice charging the three former ministers with poisoning. The court is the only tribunal in France that can try former ministers for offenses committed while in office. **********Americans have also begun questioning whether the AIDS disaster among hemophiliacs could have been lessened with earlier warnings about blood products, and many have asked why the United States will not compensate people with hemophilia who have developed AIDS. The Federal Centers for Disease Control say 70 percent to 90 percent of the 12,000 Americans with severe hemophilia are infected with H.I.V. According to official health statistics, roughly half of France's hemophiliacs have tested positive for H.I.V. **********Some of the most haunting testimony in the courtroom this week came from parents who blamed themselves for bringing hemophiliac children into the world and then, instead of protecting them, naively administered blood to the children that ""carried their death sentence,"" as one father put it. **********Among the parents was a doctor from a small town who told the judges that in his blind trust he himself had prescribed the tainted blood to his 7-year-old son, Mathieu, now 14 and sick with AIDS. **********""Because of his father, Mathieu will never be 18 years old,"" he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/24/business/american-business-starts-a-counterattack-in-japan.html,James Sterngold,1992-02-24,,1720,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,American Business Starts A Counterattack in Japan,American Business Starts A Counterattack in Japan," **********After spending much of the 1980's struggling to survive against its Japanese competitors, Harley-Davidson Inc. has joined hundreds of American companies in doing something that would have seemed unthinkable a decade ago: it is challenging the Japanese manufacturers that almost put it out of business by revving up its sales on their home territory. **********Following an increasingly familiar pattern, the motorcycle maker has acquired the Japanese company that distributed its products, so that Harley can take a stronger hand in expanding its sales network. It has beefed up its staff and it is concluding a deal to market a line of clothing to the Japanese who, despite growing disillusionment with the United States, still have a romantic attraction for the kind of muscular American image the Harley-Davidson name still evokes. **********""If you want to be competitive in this day and age, you have to be a competitor in Japan,"" said Jeffrey Bleustein, Harley's executive vice president. ""It's the most difficult market in the world, and we have some real challenges there, but you have to do it."" Harley's sales here have increased to 3,000 motorcycles a year, Mr. Bleustein said, with the number still rising slowly. **********President Bush's ill-starred visit earlier this year, the carping by American auto makers about their modest exports to Japan and the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from politicians on both sides of the Pacific have heightened trade tensions between Japan and the United States markedly in recent months. **********But the bitter sniping and complaints about the closed nature of the Japanese market have obscured an important fact: a growing number of American companies have decided that the best way to compete with their Japanese rivals at home is to compete with them in Japan. These companies are becoming more assertive here not because that will correct America's $43 billion trade deficit with Japan -- few believe that will happen anytime soon -- but because it is good business. The Time Is Now **********""If you can compete in Japan you will be competitive anywhere,"" said James C. Morgan, chairman of Applied Materials Inc., which has successfully established itself here as a leading producer of equipment used to manufacture computer chips. ""And this is the time to do it. The opportunities have gotten much better."" **********The attractions are simple. With roughly 125 million generally affluent citizens, Japan's market consumes large amounts of imports, and the once-frugal Japanese are becoming increasingly acquisitive, wanting many of the things they did without during years of sacrifice. **********""The Japanese have become voracious consumers of imported luxury goods, and we've been able to do well partly because we are an imported luxury good,"" said H. Chris Killingstad, managing director for the East Asian operations of Haagen-Dazs ice cream, whose sales here have been soaring after big investments by the company. **********And while the United States is languishing in a recession, the Japanese economy is expected to grow by close to 3 percent this year -- a significant slowdown by Japanese standards. **********Some executives add a more strategic reason for the need to increase their Japanese sales. ""Japan is not only a big market, but it is also a very important market in that you can't allow the Japanese to nurture their products there without being challenged, as a kind of sanctuary,"" insisted Arnold Brenner, executive vice president in charge of the Japan business of Motorola, the electronics and telecommunications giant. ""That's why it's so important to crack the barriers that exist and make the effort."" **********Although it can take years to build a significant market presence, most agree that the payday can make it worthwhile -- eventually. **********""Generally profit margins are quite good if you can make it through the first seven years or so and work your way into a solid position,"" said William J. Best, managing director here for A. T. Kearney International Inc., a consulting company. ""Once you get to that point, it's almost obscene what some people make."" **********What the trend underscores is that the long-debated question of whether the Japanese market is open or closed is far more complex than it has often been made out to be, and should not by itself discourage companies. Lopsided Investment Flow **********Unquestionably, foreign businesses here still face some unfair barriers trying to build their operations. Just consider the startling fact that Japanese companies made direct investments abroad in factories, real estate and other business operations between 1985 and 1990 of $239.4 billion, of which $110 billion went to the United States, according to the Bank of Japan. Meanwhile, foreign companies made just $5.3 billion of direct investments in Japan during the same period, only a portion of which were from American companies, according to the bank. **********Many American executives say the interlocking shareholdings that make takeovers all but impossible and the extraordinarily high price of land inhibit investments in Japan. **********Many of the companies that are now increasing their market shares would not be expanding in Japan at all were it not for the efforts of American trade negotiators in attacking barriers. **********For instance, Toys ""R"" Us, the huge toy retailer, was able to open its first store in Japan in December only after the United States forced the Government to ease restrictive laws. **********More and more, though, American companies are not waiting for the playing field to be completely leveled. They are eager to cash in on one of the most vibrant consumer markets in the world. In one sign of the trend, the membership of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan has risen to 2,047 today from 1,345 in 1985. **********A variety of products are making headway, too. Sales in Japan of American-made apparel have risen to $400 million last year from $65 million in 1987. American-controlled companies hold a 16 percent share of the retail gasoline market and nearly 17 percent of Japan's gasoline refining capacity. **********McDonald's is the country's largest fast-food operator. Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley were the second- and the third most profitable securities houses in Japan in the first half of the current fiscal year. Progress Hard to Measure **********American farmers export more products to Japan than to any other market; in fact, American agricultural exports to Japan total more than all agricultural exports to the European countries combined. **********The proliferation of American brands here does not indicate as much progress as some argue, however. For instance, some point to the saturation of Japan with 7-Eleven convenience stores as a sign of the Japanese love for things American. In fact, the American parent company of the chain is now owned by Japanese, after the company fell into bankruptcy following an ill-advised leveraged buyout. Talbots clothing stores are popping up in Japan, but that company is also owned by Japanese. And the lucrative McDonald's franchise here is 50 percent owned by Japanese. **********In addition, some Americna experts insist that in the long term it is not a wise trade-off if the Japanese are eating American hamburgers, while Americans are buying Japanese autos and electronic gadgets, products that are regarded as closer to the cutting edge of technological advancement. But at least in the medium term, more opportunities are opening up, and they are being seized by a variety of American businesses. **********Many companies that have been here for decades lazily allowing Japanese trading companies to sell limited amounts of their goods are revitalizing joint ventures and strengthening their presence. Monsanto and Ralston Purina, for example, have recently ended joint ventures and have taken control of their businesses in Japan. The following are other examples of this trend.: ***********Harley-Davidson has been selling its oversized motorcycles in Japan since 1913, but only recently bought out its distributor so that it could get a better feel for what Japanese consumers want and determine better ways to sell its products here -- making Japan its second-largest market outside of North America. ***********Eastman Kodak began selling its photo products in Japan nearly a century ago, but recently took control of all its joint ventures here to increase sales and make it tougher for its archrival, Fuji Photo Film. Kodak has also built a new research center and is increasing its staff. Given that the Japanese spend roughly twice as much per capita on film products as Americans, this has proved a rich market, said Robert L. Smith, who heads Kodak's photo products business in Japan. **********--Haagen-Dazs ice cream infused its Japan operations with new capital and has spent heavily on new products and on upgrading its shops. Its efforts here have made the Haagen-Dazs label one of the 10 most-respected consumer brands in Japan, according to a trade journal survey. **********""It takes an enormous commitment from the chief executive and the whole board of directors because you have to be ready to lose money for several years,"" said Mr. Brenner of Motorola. ""That's obviously a very scary tactic for a lot of companies. But the question is how do you get U.S. companies to do that?"" **********Mr. Morgan of Applied Materials said he had been angered sometimes listening to the complaints of American executives about Japan's closed markets -- not because they are wrong, but because they often use the criticisms as an excuse not to tackle the market head on. 'Really a Question of Will' **********""It is really a question of will,"" he said. ""You have to keep a strong focus on market access. The pressure has to be constant. But you have to believe it's important for your company to be competitive or you won't have the commitment you need to make it in Japan."" **********Mr. Brenner of Motorola was one of several who said a crisis might actually be useful for motivating American companies to become more committed and show staying power in Japan. ""Americans tend to work better with their backs to the wall,"" he said. ""There are a whole lot of Americans waking up to the fact that their country is not healthy. One of the ways I think we're going to get healthy is to be able to compete with the Japanese on their own turf."""

With facsimile machines now almost ubiquitous in the white-collar world, that question has become so natural that many people never consider the possibility that an office might not be equipped with one. **********Still, despite their speed and convenience, facsimile machines are not a particularly private means of sending or receiving documents. While traditional mail and messages brought by courier arrive in closed envelopes, which most people would refrain from opening without permission, a faxed document arrives fully exposed and can be read by anybody who happens to be near the machine. **********In search of a simple solution, Peter D. Castro, an advertising executive in New York City, has patented a new kind of facsimile paper that is based on a simple adaptation of the ""secret telegrams"" patented by Western Union in the 1940's. **********Mr. Castro, president of Piranha Advertising Ltd., said the old confidential telegrams had a cover over the portion that included the message, and left an open area at the top for address information. Mr. Castro said today's fax machines can easily print images beneath a blank cover, because the images are formed through heat-sensitive imprints that do not require direct contact between the paper and the printer. **********A problem, he said, arises from page length. The old telegraph forms were a standard length, so that the concealed portion would always be sure to cover the confidential material. By contrast, most facsimile machines use continuous rolls of paper and usually cut the page wherever a break in transmission occurs. Because page lengths vary, he said, it is impossible to know where the protective coverings should be placed. **********Mr. Castro's answer is literally to look at the old paper in a new way.  Instead of reserving an open space at the top or bottom of the page, the paper would leave space for the person's name on the right or left margin. Thus, the page can be any length and the covering will never be misplaced. Mr. Castro received patent 5,085,469."

Milken would be a Government witness in the coming securities fraud trial of a former colleague at Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********It would be Mr. Milken's first public testimony about the business activities of Drexel's junk bond division, which he headed, since the Government began its investigation in 1986. **********Any testimony could be crucial to Mr. Milken, who is trying to persuade the court to reduce his 10-year prison sentence for securities fraud. But Roger S. Hayes, Acting United States Attorney, said yesterday that any consideration of reducing Mr. Milken's sentence should be delayed until his testimony had been evaluated. **********Mr. Hayes said Mr. Milken was expected to be a witness against Alan E. Rosenthal, the former head of co nvertibles in Drexel's junk bond department, who was indicted last May on charges of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and pension fund embezzlement. Unusual Position **********The situation puts Mr. Milken in the unusual position of either having to admit that despite his lawyers' statements that he knew of no other crimes committed at Drexel, he was aware of wrongdoing by one of his chief lieutenants, or providing testimony that will be of little help in gaining him a reduced sentence. **********Mr. Hayes's disclosure that Mr. Milken may become a highly visible prosecution witness was in a letter yesterday to United States District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who is considering Mr. Milken's application that his sentence be reduced. Mr. Milken is serving the sentence at a minimum-security prison work camp in Pleasanton, Calif. **********Thus far, Mr. Hayes said in the letter, ""Mr. Milken's cooperation has not resulted in the successful investigation and prosecution of other individuals."" Prosecutors Have a Voice **********Part of the arguments Judge Wood will consider in deciding whether to reduce Mr. Milken's sentence is one offered by prosecutors in which they will evaluate how valuable he has been in obtaining indictments and convictions of Wall Street figures. **********""In practice,"" Mr. Hayes wrote, ""the simple rule has been that only defendants whose cooperation has resulted in successful criminal prosecutions and successful S.E.C. enforcement actions have received substantial sentence reductions."" **********Mr. Hayes cited, for example, Ivan F. Boesky, Dennis B. Levine and Boyd L. Jefferies, each of whom provided testimony or evidence, resulting in either more favorable plea agreements or a prison-sentence reduction. 'Limited Results' **********Mr. Hayes said that defendants whose cooperation produced only ""limited results"" should receive ""only a slight sentence reduction."" Thus far, Mr. Hayes said, Mr. Milken fell into that category, and for that reason has not yet ""merited a significant sentence reduction."" **********In contrast, Mr. Milken's defense lawyers, led by Arthur L. Liman, submitted a motion yesterday in which they requested a reduced sentence based on what they described as his successful cooperation. Mr. Liman said Mr. Milken was cooperating in an S.E.C. investigation, but did not provide any details. **********The courtroom spectacle of Mr. Milken turning against a former colleague could also undermine his claims that he committed no crimes other than those to which he pleaded guilty and his extensive and well-financed efforts to clear his name. **********Prosecutors contend that Mr. Milken had intimate knowledge of Mr. Rosenthal's purported illegal activities, on the ground that he was named a co-conspirator in the indictment against Mr. Rosenthal. **********The indictment contends that the two conspired to confer unlawful economic benefits on a former Drexel client, David B. Solomon, and, in turn, to misappropriate funds from Mr. Solomon's clients. At one time, Mr. Solomon's junk bond company, Solomon Asset Management, was one of Drexel's largest clients, controlling about $2 billion, most of it from pension and employee-benefits funds."

Delta's big expansion in the international airlines business has not been smooth. Delta's executives say Pan Am's deterioration was worse than they had expected. Its planes were run-down and uncomfortable, its employees' morale was abysmal, and poor service had squandered the loyalty of its passengers. **********Ten months later, Delta concedes that in some respects the service to Europe is still not up to its standards. The routes are not profitable, and while the airline has been pouring out money to establish its new international routes, it may not be able to keep spending at such high levels in light of the industry's ruthless competition and weak consumer demand. **********The struggle for passengers on trans-Atlantic routes has been expensive for Delta, but many people believe it had no choice but to seize the opportunity to expand its foreign flights. In the final days of Pan Am, Delta paid $506 million to take over all of the airline's remaining international operations except for those in Latin America. **********Delta, based in Atlanta, needed more overseas routes because its rivals American and United had bought the London routes of Pan Am and T.W.A. ""On a long-term basis, the kind of system that they bought from Pan Am is a big plus,"" said John V. Pincavage, an airline analyst at the Transportation Group Ltd., a New York investment company. ""On the short term it's tough, especially in the current environment."" **********No one expected Delta to make a profit on the routes right away, he added, since they had been losing money for Pan Am. Still, the size of Delta's losses has raised concern. **********While Delta does not break out the results of its international division in its quarterly earnings announcements, the details eventually become known through Government filings. **********In the last three months of 1991, Delta had an operating loss from its international operations, which account for about 20 percent of its traffic, of $127.5 million. The loss on its Atlantic division was $103.5 million. Over all, it lost $187.6 million. **********In the period that ended March 30, the loss in the Atlantic division rose to $112.7 million; it narrowed to $85.4 million in the next three months. Still, Delta's total loss that quarter was $180.2 million. **********Despite the losses, Delta says it has made considerable progress since last November. For starters, it has incorporated 7,800 former Pan Am employees into what the airline likes to call the Delta ""family."" **********This was complicated by the fact that many Pan Am employees had become dispirited. One former Pan Am executive, who insisted that his name not be used, said that in the airline's last months, some employees were stealing from the company to compensate themselves for repeated cutbacks in pay and benefits. **********Procedures to deal with passenger complaints and other operating standards had broken down, he recalled, driving away many of Pan Am's loyal customers. Alluding to Delta's managment, he said, ""They took over something very wounded."" **********RONALD W. ALLEN, the chairman and chief executive of Delta, said that it took his airline three to four months to get the planes it had inherited from Pan Am into shape because they had been neglected so badly. **********Robert W. Coggin, Delta's senior vice president of marketing, said Pan Am had crammed its Airbus A310's with 198 seats, making them uncomfortable for long flights. He said Delta has removed 15 to 18 seats from the planes to increase cabin comfort. **********Analysts say Delta seems to be making progress in refurbishing planes, bolstering employees' morale and winning customers for its international routes. But they say there is a fundamental structural problem that may be harder to overcome. **********The flights it purchased from Pan Am are not as attractive as the trans-Atlantic routes systems that were acquired by American and United.  The two larger airlines have routes to Britain, where the annual traffic to and from the United States is about eight million passengers. **********By contrast, the most important routes that Delta acquired from Pan Am feed into Frankfurt, and the carrier will have a significant challenge in building a thriving hub there. For starters, traffic between the United States and all of Germany is only about two million passengers a year. **********In addition, the competition is intense. Delta, which is not a household word in Europe, must go up against long-entrenched airlines, particularly Lufthansa, the largest airline in Europe and one that is very well run. **********UNDER a bilateral agreement that the United States negotiated with Germany in the late 1970's, there is no limit on the number of American carriers that can fly to Germany. Thus, Delta has a lot of company at Frankfurt, with every major American carrier serving the hub. **********Yet Frankfurt also offers some opportunities. The bilateral treaty provides American carriers with unusual freedom to carry passengers farther once they arrive in Germany. **********Frankfurt in particular is considered a very good hub from which to expand into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, areas that are ripe for growth in traffic. **********Delta already flies on to a number of cities. These include Athens, Bombay, Budapest, New Delhi, Istanbul, Prague, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Vienna and Warsaw. But analysts say there is considerable work to be done in building traffic on these routes. **********Still, the carrier has won respect from its leading German competitor, Lufthansa. ""If anybody can make it work, it's going to be Delta,"" said Thomas Reid, the senior vice president of the Americas for Lufthansa. Delta has always been regarded as strong financially and very tenacious. But, he asks, ""Does Delta have the time and money in the current international environment to do it?"" **********International operations are not the only problem for Delta, of course. In the face of fare wars, its domestic system has also lost money in recent quarters. For the fiscal year that ended on June 30, the company's losses totaled $506.3 million, compared with a loss of $324.4 million a year earlier. As a result Delta has cut capital spending, stretched out delivery of many new airplanes and eliminated jobs. **********Mr. Allen said the airline was reviewing its hubs to see where it can replace full-time shifts with six-hour workdays. Airline operations are traditionally intense during the day and early evening but slack during hours of darkness. By concentrating work into 18 hours a day, the airline should be able to cut costs without seriously decreasing service, he said. **********The steps are a departure for a company that in the past often stuck with expansion plans during downturns and avoided layoffs as a means to reduce costs. But times are now seen as very tough. ""This is not a short-term situation that will correct itself quickly,"" Mr. Allen said. **********Not surprisingly, there are a number of people in the industry who question whether Delta will be able to keep spending the money needed to upgrade its Frankfurt hub and set up new routes out of Germany. **********But the company says it may get some help from political circumstances. In negotations that are expected to be held on a new bilateral treaty between the United States and Germany, Mr. Coggin believes limitations will be put in to make the German market less open. **********He said that when Delta executives were deciding whether to buy the Pan Am routes, they concluded that the airline was faced with an unusual opportunity to get a foothold in the German market and that later opportunities would be doubtful. **********""We took the long-term view that while Frankfurt was somewhat an open access point,"" he said, ""in the long term, it would be much more difficult to get in there."" A MANAGER BEARING HOPE **********WHEN Delta executives realized how much Pan American World Airways had starved operations in Frankfurt to conserve cash, they turned to Dudley Q. Haralson, one of their most experienced station managers. **********When he arrived in Frankfurt in March, he found baggage carts that were so old they would break down and delay flights. An antiquated computer system meant customer service agents faced frustrating delays processing travelers. ""The tools that people needed to make the operations work -- a lot of these were in disrepair,"" he recalled. **********But if the 600 employees that Delta took over from Pan Am were hampered by inadequate equipment in trying to do their jobs, many were also depressed about their careers.""Many had been living without hope,"" Mr. Haralson said in a telephone interview from his office in Frankfurt. ""Delta offered these people hope for the future."" **********Most of the employees are Germans, which has been asset in trying to make a smooth transition. **********In addition, despite the disintegration of Pan Am's service in its last years, the airline had provided many of the workers with sound training. Mr. Haralson said that in its heyday, Pan Am had a reputation for excellence. When problems arose overseas, he said, ""You contacted the Pan American manager."" **********About the Pan Am veterans in Frankfurt, he added, ""They have a degree of international experience that is really hard to quantify."" **********Mr. Haralson needs a strong team, because the Frankfurt operation must excel if Delta is to succeed in Europe. The city will be the jumping-off point to numerous other cities in Europe and even Asia. **********An executive with a rival airline in Germany said Delta had already made impressive strides in restoring a high level of service in Frankfurt. **********The 52-year-old Mr. Haralson, who grew up on a farm in Forest, Miss., started with Delta in 1961 as a part-time worker loading baggage in Dallas while attending Arlington College near by. **********That job ultimately grew into a career that has taken him to Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago and Denver. Before moving to Frankfurt, he was Delta's station manager in Salt Lake City."

Three executives of the company are standing trial on charges of illegally exporting arms manufacturing equipment to Iraq. **********The October 1987 report, which was sent by the British intelligence services to the Department of Trade and Industry, also indicates that Western intelligence agencies had begun to gather information on Iraq's determination to become a self-sufficent weapons producer by buying weapons-making technology and not only finished weapons. **********The report describes Iraq's desire to end its practice of paying inflated prices to the Soviet Union, its main weapons supplier.

Billet Is a Symbol for Yugoslav Problem," **********The quarters chosen for the first United Nations troops to enter Croatia seems like a fitting symbol for the problems the troops will face as they set about enforcing the cease-fire in Yugoslavia's civil war. **********In this quiet town on the west bank of the Danube, the 50 United Nations officers, including a contingent of 20 from Russia, have been using a makeshift barracks on the ground floor of the local school. Down the corridor from the classrooms holding their bunk beds, a pair of doors bearing a heavy padlock lead into a sports hall. **********Seven months ago, one of the worst mass killings of the Yugoslav fighting occurred in the hall. According to Western reporters who visited the scene later, about 200 Serbian militia fighters attacked the hall after midnight on Aug. 1, surprising a large number of Croat national guardsmen and police officers there. **********The attackers trained automatic rifles on the Croats. As in many of the battles across Croatia, there were no official casualty counts, but Western reporters estimated that at least 80 Croats were killed at the school and in an attack on the local police station. **********When reporters visiting from Belgrade asked the United Nations officers about their temporary accommodations, it was clear that the Yugoslav Army commanders who offered the school as a billet had not said anything about the massacre. **********""I don't think they have yet realized just how shocked the rest of the world was by what happened in Croatia,"" one officer said. ""Until they realize that, they are not likely to understand what it is that we've come here to do."" **********So far, the United Nations officers have been in the area only a few weeks, as an advance group for two infantry battalions, one Russian and the other Belgian, that are to start arriving about April 5. But virtually every night, Serbian gunners have traded fire with Croatian forces. **********The village has a new Mayor, Milan Isic, a 44-year-old teacher who fought with the Serb militias, and like many Serbs in Croatia, he appears to believe that the presence of the United Nations forces will guarantee continued Serb control. ""This is a Serb village now,"" he said. **********The Yugoslav Army commander for the region, Col. Gen. Andrija Biocevic, agreed. ""This territory will never become fascist!"" he said, using a term that Serbs commonly use when speaking of the Croatian Government. **********Under the United Nations plan, General Biocevic will be required to pull his troops back across the Danube into Serbia, and to assist United Nations forces in the tricky task of disarming the Serb militias. **********Also under the plan, local police forces in areas under United Nations control are to be rebuilt so that Serbs and Croats serve on the forces in the proportions that they represented in the local population before the fighting.  In Dalj's case, this would mean that about a third of the police officers would have to be Croats. But a visit to the police station suggested that any move to carry out the United Nations plan will face resistance. **********The station was flying Serbian flags when the United Nations officers arrived, and half a dozen Serb officers were lounging in the reception area.

In many large companies, there is a mainframe network surrounded by a proliferation of local area networks with a hodge-podge of operating systems and wiring schemes. Providing simultaneous translation at the Tower of Babel was a minor matter compared with getting a network with S.N.A. (System Network Architecture -- I.B.M.'s mainframe wiring scheme) to talk to one with Ethernet wiring to talk to one with Token Ring or, Noah forbid, to an Appletalk network. **********The job is made somewhat simpler through microprocessor technology known as an intelligent hub, which translates the signals from one kind of network into ones understandable by another. Hubs connect LAN's so that users on a network with one wiring scheme can get data or use peripherals from one with another scheme. **********Hubs are digital versions of the old PBX patch panel telephone rooms. Now, just as a telephone operator sitting at a computer terminal can reroute a phone extension to a new location with a few key strokes, hub technology can switch computer users to different networks. **********One limitation to current hub design is that most can connect LAN's only with one other kind of wiring scheme. The Chipcom Corporation of Southborough, Mass., has developed a hub that lets an administrator mix and match a network with up to three wiring schemes. The hub is called the Online Concentrator. ""Being able to route three different networks through the same hub gives a network manager greater control at a lower cost,"" said Mary Modahl, director of network strategy research for Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. **********Another advantage of the Online Concentrator is that it is really two hubs in one, so that if one crashes, the second can handle the network traffic until the first unit is repaired. This is known as fault-tolerance. **********The Online concentrator handles Ethernet, Token Ring and F.D.D.I. (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) networks. The biggest Online Concentrator sells for $4,250 and can support up to 128 users depending on the wiring scheme. The smallest (which is not fault tolerant) sells for $1,695 and can handle up to 40 users."

Finkelstein as chairman and chief executive of R. H. Macy & Company, the company can settle down to the technical, somewhat dull task of getting itself out of the red and into the black. **********The most immediate chore is the formulation of a five-year business plan outlining how the company intends to operate while under bankruptcy protection. **********""The one advantage of bankruptcy -- particularly for department stores, which have needed to rethink their business for some time -- is that it forces you to reconceptualize and come at things in a different way,"" said Walter K. Levy of Walter K. Levy & Robert E. Kerson Associates Inc., a New York consulting firm.  Providing the Details **********Macy is likely to submit its plan to the bankruptcy court in the next few weeks. The plan is expected to include everything from nitty-gritty details about how much the company will spend on advertising to its anticipated sales and which stores it proposes to close or renovate. **********At the same time, Myron (Mike) E. Ullman and Mark S. Handler, the two Macy executives who will share the titles of chairman and chief executive, will be running the business and hammering out just how they will share their responsibilities. **********Retail industry experts said the appointment of Mr. Handler and Mr. Ullman signaled that the company was more likely to modify and improve rather than radically change its business. Mr. Handler has worked at Macy since 1958, and while Mr. Ullman arrived there less than four years ago, he began making changes at the company last year. **********""They represent continuity,"" said Herbert Mines, president of Herbert Mines Associates Inc., an executive search company in New York, who knows both men. ""If a really different direction is needed there, and I'm not saying it is, they aren't likely to provide it."" **********The business plan, which does not have to be approved by the court, will become the yardstick against which the battalion of lawyers, accountants and other advisers to Macy creditors can measure the department store chain's performance. **********""Everyone is constantly testing how reality matches up to expectations,"" said Sandra A. Riemer, a partner at Edwards & Angell, the law firm that handled the bankruptcy of the L. J. Hooker organization, which owned Bonwit Teller. Need for Realism Is Cited **********She said it was critical that Macy come up with a realistic business plan to establish credibility with its two creditor groups because while the business plan will not require the approval of the court or creditors, elements of the plan, like renewing leases or closing stores, will. **********And the contentiousness of the negotiations to hammer out a plan of reorganization -- the plan that will take the company out of bankruptcy and restructure its balance sheet -- will be inversely related to the track record Macy establishes with its plan. **********Bankruptcy laws give debtors like Macy the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan up to 120 days after the initial bankruptcy filing; 60 more days are granted to seek creditors' approval for the plan. In most cases, the company asks for an extension, and Mr. Ullman has said Macy will do so. Macy made its initial filing in late January. **********To some extent, Macy had already begun revising its business plan when it filed in January. And in some respects it is in better shape internally than Federated Department Stores was when it entered bankruptcy proceedings two years ago. **********Macy, like most of its rivals, had grown fat and sassy during the good times of the 1980's. The debt-ridden buyout that took the company private in 1986 ultimately served as a sort of diet pill because it forced the company to get leaner and meaner in order to generate cash for debt payments. Realigning the Divisions **********In late 1991, Macy announced it would streamline down to two divisions from three. As of February, Macy has had an East and a West division, eliminating its South division based in Atlanta, which had overseen the operation of 22 Bullock's and 26 Macy's stores. The Bullock's chain and the Macy's stores in Texas are now administered by the West division; the Macy's stores in the South are monitored by the East division. **********Besides saving the company $85 million annually, the realignment also eased the introduction of a merchandising system that is supposed to give Macy the benefit of a more centralized buying operation while allowing the accommodation of individual store's needs. **********The system, called ""buyer-planner-store,"" was one of Mr. Ullman's pet projects. Under it, a Macy's store in Alabama, for example, will not stock wool gabardine suits in the spring only to have to mark them down. Instead, it will devote more space to cotton and linen clothes, which its customers are more likely to buy."

Several Kurdish and international relief officials and a journalist reached Kajak today after walking an hour over roads blocked by snow. **********The missiles that shattered the farmhouse complex left a gaping crater more than 15 feet across near several buildings. **********Mr. Qader, the village leader, said that when a group of children spotted the airplanes Sunday afternoon, ""everyone was looking at them and waving,"" thinking they were from the Western coalition forces that have regularly flown patrols over the area since a safe haven was created for Kurds in northern Iraq last spring. **********Mr. Qader said, however, that after circling low over the village, two of the planes fired missiles and the two other planes then strafed the area, killing sheep and other farm animals. **********Mr. Qader said villagers were baffled by the raid.

The invasion led to the Persian Gulf war. **********Under the policy, billions of dollars in American aid was used to try to moderate President Saddam Hussein and turn him into a stabilizing force in the Middle East. And the President has acknowledged that this policy failed.  Three Vital Questions **********But in its zeal to influence Mr. Hussein, did the Bush Administration ignore evidence that some of this aid was diverted to Iraq's buildup of weapons? Did it try to delay indictments of high-level Iraqi officials accused in a United States bank fraud? And did the President's aides lie to Congress in an attempt to conceal the full scope of their failed courtship of Iraq? **********Those are the questions that lie at the heart of the affair. Mr. Bush accuses Congressional Democrats of ""recklessly"" distorting the record for political gain and characterizes his policy as an honest error in judgment. The Administration insists that the policy was widely known and generally accepted as a sound one -- by United States allies in the Middle East and even by some of the lawmakers who are now leading the criticism. **********The Democrats, however, blame the Administration for ""coddling"" the Iraqi leader in advance of his invasion of Kuwait, despite mounting evidence that he was building a formidable military machine even after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988. Had the Administration paid more heed to that evidence, they say, the gulf war might never have been necessary. **********Beyond the heated public statements, this much is known: In the late 1980's, under a Presidential directive to build closer relations with Baghdad, the United States Government permitted the sale of sophisticated American technology and equipment to Iraq, some of which is believed to have been used to build weapons. At the same time, Iraq was allowed to become a major participant in the Commodity Credit Corporation, through which the United States Government cosigns bank loans for poor countries that want to buy American farm products. Taxpayers May Have to Pay **********The financially strapped Iraqis financed some of the food and technology purchases with loans from the tiny Atlanta branch of an Italian bank, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The Iraqis chose this branch, law enforcement officials say, because its officers were willing to take bribes in exchange for making high-risk loans. **********The loans made through the agriculture program, on the other hand, were no-risk, as the United States Government would make good on any that Iraq failed to repay. Congressional critics have said the United States taxpayers will ultimately have to repay hundreds of millions of dollars on defaulted loans. **********The Congressional panels that are investigating various facets of the Iraq policy have turned up evidence that they say suggests that some of those farm loans may have been channeled into military purchases. **********Some lawmakers also maintain that the Government interfered with prosecutors investigating the bribery of the Atlanta bank officials and that it tried to conceal from Congress the extent of Iraq's purchases of technology. **********But they have yet to come up with proof of any wrongdoing by public officials. That is why the House Judiciary Committee is eager for a positive reply from Attorney General William P. Barr about its request for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the charges. Mr. Barr must respond to the request by Monday. He may either approve or reject it or ask for more time for an investigation of his own before deciding. **********What follows is a look at which accusations involve possible criminal violations, as opposed to misguided but legal policy issues. These accusations, involving obstruction of justice and lying to Congress, would be the focus of any independent investigation. The Altered Lists  Changes Uncovered At Commerce Dept. **********The strongest indication that a crime may have been committed involves alterations made on a Commerce Department list of high-technology items approved for sale to Iraq between 1985 and 1990. The list was sent in October 1990 to Representative Doug Barnard Jr., Democrat of Georgia, whose Government Operations subcommittee was investigating exports to Iraq. **********After Mr. Barnard received an anonymous tip that the Commerce Department had tampered with the list, he asked the department's Inspector General to investigate. The Inspector General concluded in a report that both the copy sent to Congress and the permanent record had been changed in 68 instances to delete references to military designations. It can be illegal to willfully falsify documents presented to Congressional investigators. **********In one instance, a description of a 1989 license for frequency synthesizers for a military complex north of Baghdad that made equipment for missiles and atomic bombs was changed to delete the crucial sentence, ""According to our information, the end-user is involved in military matters."" The synthesizers were designed to test surveillance radar at the complex, which was a primary target of allied bombers in the gulf war. **********In another instance, the Inspector General's report said that the deletion of ""military"" to describe the sale of $1 billion worth of trucks to Iraq was ""misleading and unjustified."" **********Senior Commerce Department officials have testified to Congress that Dennis E. Kloske, who was then Under Secretary of Commerce, was solely to blame. But Mr. Kloske, who resigned in April 1991, told Congressional investigators that White House officials and top aides to former Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher supervised the preparation of the list, although he did not actually accuse his superiors of ordering the changes. The Justice Department says that since it is investigating the alterations, there is no need for an independent counsel. The Officials' Role  Lawmakers Charge They Were Misled **********Beyond the Commerce Department list, Democratic lawmakers are also investigating whether Administration officials purposely misled Congress about Iraq policy, either in public testimony, correspondence or conversations, or by withholding documents. **********One line of inquiry involves the Commodity Credit Corporation program through which Iraq made grain purchases. In the fall of 1989 the Bush Administration was locked in a heated debate about whether to go forward with $1 billion in new credits for Iraq. State Department officials argued that the credits were crucial to improving relations with Baghdad. Agriculture Department officials had reservations but wanted to promote American exports. But both the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve were concerned about Iraq's ability and willingness to pay back its debts. Bowing to White House foreign policy concerns, a compromise decision was made to extend the credits in two stages. **********Some lawmakers, like Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Agriculture Committee, believe they were misled when they raised questions about the wisdom of the loan guarantees. **********For example, in late October 1989, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d telephoned Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter urging him to go forward with $1 billion in credits on ""foreign policy grounds,"" according to an internal State Department memo. But Mr. Yeutter assured Mr. Leahy in a letter in February 1990 that foreign policy considerations did not contribute to the decision-making process. **********Other Democratic lawmakers charge that the Administration conspired to mislead Congress by withholding crucial documents. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who has taken the lead in the investigations, has said there was a cover-up formulated in meetings held at the White House by lawyers from various Government agencies to coordinate answers to Congressional demands for documents. He has dubbed the group the ""Rostow gang"" because its chairman was C. Nicholas Rostow, the legal adviser to the National Security Council and a special assistant to Mr. Bush. **********White House officials call the charge absurd, saying that such coordination is routine. But a senior State Department official said that Mr. Baker was indeed upset to learn that Mr. Rostow was trying to control the flow of documents, and ordered Edwin D. Williamson, the legal adviser who represented the State Department at the meetings, to coordinate with no one except Mr. Baker. The Bank Investigation  Did Administration Delay Indictment? **********A third area of concern is whether the Bush Administration illegally interfered with the criminal investigation of the Atlanta branch of Bank Lavoro. Interfering with a criminal investigation can lead to charges of obstruction of justice. **********Specifically, Congress is investigating whether the Administration, in an attempt to keep from embarrassing the Iraqi Government by exposing its role in the matter, delayed for a year the indictment of the man who is accused of being the mastermind of the suspected fraud, Christopher P. Drogoul. Mr. Drogoul has acknowledged taking cash and gifts from companies that did business with Iraq and benefited from his loans to Baghdad. **********Internal documents show that in the months after the bank was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in August 1989 the prosecutors in Atlanta were telling other Government agencies that they could bring indictments within months. In fact, Gail McKenzie, the aggressive prosecutor who has run the investigation from the beginning, had prepared what one official described as a ""bare bones"" indictment in January 1990. **********But the Justice Department did not announce the indictment until late February 1991, one day after Mr. Bush announced a cease-fire in the gulf war. Documents made public in recent months show that the investigation was the subject of high-level discussions in the State Department, with some officials arguing that the case could jeopardize United States relations with Iraq. Ms. McKenzie has acknowledged receiving a phone call early on from a White House aide inquiring about the status of the investigation. **********The White House denies exerting any pressure on prosecutors, and the Justice Department disputes that the indictment was delayed. In interviews, department officials said that prosecutors exaggerated their ability to try the case early because of pressure from the United States Attorney in Atlanta at the time, Robert Barr, who was eager to get the prosecution of the biggest bank fraud case under way before he left office. **********""The only reason we would ever seek an indictment is if we believed we had the evidence,"" said Mr. Barr, a lawyer who is seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate in Georgia. ""Whether I or anyone else was leaving the office was irrelevant."" The Suspect Loans  A Hint U.S. Money Paid for Iraqi Arms **********Beyond the question of interference, some lawmakers have also charged that some of the American farm loans were used by Iraq to buy military equipment -- an explosive charge that would mean that the United States helped pay for some of the weapons it later went to war to destroy. **********In a memo seized on by critics of the Administration's policy, a Commerce Department official, Frank M. Lemay, warned that there was evidence suggesting that some of the loans guaranteed by the farm program may have been diverted into weapons purchases. But no investigation has established that that occurred. And Bush officials note that because of the Federal investigation of the bank, the Administration excluded it from the loan credit program in August 1989. **********Misuse of the loans would not constitute a crime by the Government unless it knowingly took part. Even so, lawmakers say the Administration should have been more alert to the warning signs of Iraq's arms procurement program. Chart: ""What Congress Wants to Know"" In the House HOUSE BANKING, FINANCE & URBAN AFFAIRS  The chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, began looking at loans to Iraq by the Atlanta branch of an Italian bank and came across evidence that he said suggested the bank may have misused United States-backed farm loans to help Iraq acquire military technology. The committee is also investigating Commerce Department licensing of exports of high-technology goods to Iraq, as well as whether the Justice Department tried to delay bringing fraud indictments against the bank, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. HOUSE JUDICIARY  The committee is considering whether to grant a request by Representative Gonzalez for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate whether the Bush policy on Iraq broke the law. HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade The subcommittee is looking at what militarily useful equipment was sold by the United States to Iraq, at the Bush Administration's prewar policy toward Iraq and at the withholding of information from Congress regarding that policy. GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs The panel is investigating American exports to Iraq. Its chairman, Doug Barnard, obtained a Commerce Department list of high-technology items approved for sale to Iraq between 1985 and 1990 and determined that it had been altered in 68 instances to delete references to military applications. ENERGY Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations The subcommittee is investigating why the Department of Energy and the Bush Administration did not do more to prevent the buildup of Iraq's nuclear weapons program. AGRICULTURE Subcommittee on Foreign Agriculture  The subcommittee wants to determine whether the commodity credit program that guaranteed loans to Iraq was part of a scheme to finance Iraq's military buildup and whether that program improperly became an instrument in the Bush Administration's foreign policy. **********In the Senate AGRICULTURE  This committee is also looking at the Commodity Credit Corporation guarantees and their role in the Administration's foreign policy. FOREIGN RELATIONS Senator Jesse Helms, supported by some Democrats, is holding up the nomination of James P. Covey to head a new State Department bureau for South Asia until the department turns over documents relating to Mr. Covey's role in prewar Iraq policy. SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE  The committee wants to know what the intelligence agencies knew about links between the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and the farm credit program, and whether either was involved with Iraq's arms network."

Is Bush Missing a Bet on Trade?"," **********Will the seven-nation summit meeting in Munich this week solemnly reiterate the need to conclude the stalled global trade negotiations, while failing to do so? If so, President Bush will have missed a major opportunity. **********Election-year politics, with jobs and wages center-stage, might suggest caution. Some of the President's advisers are certainly telling him to conclude the talks only after the election. **********But the failure of free-trade opponents in the primaries showed that protectionism does not pay. All the Democratic candidates abandoned their protectionist rhetoric right after the President's Toyko trip. I suspect that the auto executives who went with him unwittingly produced this outcome. Their accusation that the Japanese did not buy American cars because of perfidy and protectionism was implausible. We ourselves prefer the better-made Japanese cars. The empty talk of overpaid Detroit executives made the voters see attacks on Japan as mere cant. **********On trade issues, Bill Clinton is no Dick Gephardt. His economic plan turns on such fundamentals as training and education. **********And Ross Perot? Sure, he sounds protectionist. But his spokesmen are busy correcting that inference. His recent skepticism about a regional free-trade area with Mexico should not translate into opposition to a global trade treaty, especially one that promises to be so sweet for the United States. **********In fact, the President can turn the conclusion of the trade talks into votes. Coming after the Rio Earth Summit, where we stood in the way of progress, a trade agreement would be a clear victory for United States diplomacy. Started in 1986 at our initiative, the talks are on the verge of remaking the world's trading system. The President would finally win credit for having some vision after all. **********The President could also claim substantial gains in exports and income. The draft treaty, reflecting our agenda, extends free-trade rights to services, which we increasingly export; establishes protection for intellectual property, from software to videocassettes, which we invent, and improves access to foreign grain markets for our farmers. In a political campaign, exports translate into jobs and jobs into votes. **********To have this opportunity now and not take advantage of it would be an act of folly. A new Congress would have to be educated. The talks could die from deja vu, cynicism and the world's fracturing into regional trading blocs. The President cannot want his efforts to suffer such a fate."

The army has assumed control of the southern state of Sind, and in the capital, Islamabad, there are rumblings of an even greater role for the military in the country's future. **********A widely hailed program to sell off state-controlled enterprises to private investors, part of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's efforts to restructure the country's hidebound socialist economy, was tainted when the first state bank sold was acquired, not by the highest bidder, but by associates of Mr. Sharif. Shortly afterward, the bank lent Mr. Sharif's family industries $16.1 million to repay other loans provided by state-owned banks. Tensions and Violence **********Sectarian violence in the western city of Peshawar, pitting Sunni Muslims against Shiites, erupted recently, killing more than a dozen people. In other cities where the two groups live together, a wary tension prevails. **********""Even by Pakistani standards,"" said Arif Nizami, the editor of The Nation, a leading English-language newspaper, ""corruption and lawlessness have reached a critical state. There's a growing feeling that if nothing is done about it, then the whole system will collapse."" **********Here in Sind, the political party that has been the central Government's principal ally is said to have operated torture chambers and stockpiled automatic weapons. Beyond the cities, in the forests and plains of rural Sind, violent crime and kidnapping had become so common that virtually no one ventured outside after dark. **********In leaked documents from the army's intelligence wing, the man overseeing Sind's most powerful police agency has been accused of repeated rapes of airline stewardesses, kidnapping, blackmail and running a car theft ring. He has not been arrested because he is the President's son-in-law, according to Government officials. Seeds of Authoritarianism **********Pakistan, an invention of harried politicians and vanishing British colonial authorities, was born in 1947 amid deadly Hindu-Muslim riots, political instability, and the seeds of authoritarianism. Democratic politics never took root as they did in India, economic development was hobbled by the neglect Britain showed the region during the colonial era, and an enduring enmity with India was forged in disputes over water rights and territory. **********A decade of military rule, which ended in late 1988, brought civilian leadership -- first with the prime ministership of Benazir Bhutto and then, 20 months later, with Mr. Sharif. But with civilian leadership came rigged elections, widespread violence and ethnic strife. Despite elections and four years of civilian administration, however, the military and a President who was not elected by a popular vote continue to wield tremendous influence over the politics and policies of this nation of 110 million people. **********Ms. Bhutto, the leader of the opposition, who draws her political base from Sind, has remained restrained in her comments on the army's actions, in part because her party has not been a specific target of the operation. **********Although only the second most populous of Pakistan's four states, Sind includes the country's largest city, Karachi, is the center of its international trade and finance industries, and is where most of the country's limited foreign investment has occurred. **********It is here in Sind -- a state of 26 million people that has been consumed by terrorism, kidnappings, political assassinations and unbridled official corruption -- that many Pakistanis believe the cracks in the country's increasingly fragile civilian Government are most apparent. After the violence escalated through the first part of this year, the army descended on Sind in June, largely displacing the civilian Government, arresting roving gangs and hounding the large urban political party into hiding. **********""There's no effective government in Sind,"" a middle-ranking army officer involved in the army's operations said. More Than 2,000 Arrests **********Beginning in the Sind countryside, army units have arrested more than 2,000 people suspected of taking part in rural crime syndicates. Early in July, the army moved through Karachi, a city of 10 million, closing the offices of the city's main political movement, the Mohajir Quami Movement, or M.Q.M., a central ally of Mr. Sharif, and arresting many of its members. The movement represents the Mohajirs, who moved from India to Pakistan after the two were partitioned in 1947, and who make up the majority of the state's urban population. **********In the course of the operation, the army uncovered a chain of torture cells operated by the party, where dissidents and political opponents were maimed or killed, the army said. **********""The M.Q.M. leadership was responsible for killing not only political opponents, but their own dissidents,"" said Zahid Hussein, a reporter for Newsline Magazine. ""Last year when the M.Q.M. kidnapped an army captain, the army was furious that it couldn't crack down. Now it is."" **********Azeem Ahmat Tariq, chairman of the movement, denied that his organization had engaged in torture. Speaking over a cellular phone from his place of hiding from the army sweep, Mr. Tariq said: ""If they were torture centers, would we have the popularity of the people? Nobody can wipe out a political party that has the powerful mandate of the people."" Police Corrpution **********A Western diplomat here said one reason for the crime and kidnappings in Sind was that large landowners had hired groups of armed thugs, known as dacoits, to protect their interests. ""And I don't think anybody is under any illusions that the police aren't part of the problem,"" the diplomat said. **********Even Sind's Chief Minister, Muzaffar Shah, acknowledged that his state's police were deeply mired in criminal activities. **********But many Pakistanis say that the most disturbing accusations to emerge from the army's crackdown here those against Irfanullah Khan Marwat, the son-in-law of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Mr. Marwat, currently an adviser to the Chief Minister, served as Home Minister, a post from which he controlled the state's police agencies. While in that job, according to army intelligence documents leaked to the local press, he supervised the criminalization of the police and was involved in frequent rapes of stewardesses from Pakistan International Airlines. **********The leaked documents also describe blackmail and extortion of businessmen, and a car theft ring run by the Central Investigations Agency, the state's premier police agency, which Mr. Marwat oversaw. **********For his part, Mr. Shah, the Chief Minister, insisted that Mr. Marwat was not guilty of any crimes. ""There is no material that has been brought to may attention that warrants any action,"" he said. Mr. Marwat has denied the accusations against him. Reflection on Prime Minister **********In Islamabad, however, the deluge of accusations and the discovery of the extent of criminality within the M.Q.M. has badly shaken the administration of Prime Minister Sharif. ""Remember,"" said a senior Western diplomat, ""the M.Q.M. has been part of Nawaz Sharif's Government, and when people are now calling them terrorists, it reflects on him. When the army action began in Sind, he thought it was directed against crime, car thieves, dacoits. But he never thought it would go against the M.Q.M. We see that he's not running the operation, the army is."" **********Indeed, there remains a lingering sentiment for army rule, according to this diplomat, who said that most businessmen would not care ""if the army took over completely tomorrow."" **********""They just want an end to all this crime and terror and corruption,"" the diplomat said."

Yeltsin's chief economic planner opened a new round of grappling with the hostile Parliament today with a warning that unless his spartan monetary policies were restored, the Russian monetary system faced a ""complete crash."" **********The warning by Yegor T. Gaidar, the embattled Acting Prime Minister, served notice that he did not intend to let his economic course be torpedoed by a torrent of new credits issued by the new director of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, who was appointed in June by the Parliament. **********The statement, at the opening of a new session of Parliament, also laid the groundwork for a renewed battle over the economy and over Mr. Gaidar's Government. No sooner did he finish talking than conservative deputies sounded their first calls for his ouster.  'Not Ready to Resign' **********Out in the hallways, Mr. Gaidar said he was not backing down. ""I am not ready to resign,"" he said, adding that he did not believe the legislature had the strength to topple him. ""I don't think there will be any attempts to assassinate my Government. But we shall see."" **********Mr. Gaidar's grave warning coincided with news that the ruble had taken another steep plunge against the dollar in record trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange. The ruble fell to 241 to the dollar, down from 205.5 last Thursday and 162 a month ago. **********The exchange reported a record volume of $68.8 million, compared to $49.7 million last week. Traders cited a sharp rise in fuel prices over the weekend and fears of heightened inflation as reasons for the splurge. Back From Summer Break **********Mr. Gaidar addressed the Parliament as it gathered for its first session after a summer recess. Under its ambitious and increasingly assertive Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, Parliament has evolved into a center of opposition to Mr. Gaidar and his policies. **********In a rapid-fire, 40-minute report on the economic plight of the state, Mr. Gaidar described an economy that had begun showing signs of stability, but that was now battered by a profligate new flow of credits. **********Though he did not mention him by name, it was evident to the deputies that Mr. Gaidar's premiere target was Mr. Gerashchenko, who after being named head of the Central Bank by the Parliament in June has issued more than a trillion rubles in credits. **********Despite the threat of hyperinflation, the credits have been welcomed by industrialists and the conservative majority in the parliament, who have pressed the Government for help to prop up failing state-owned and military enterprises. Easing of Credit **********Mr. Gaidar declared that the relaxation of financial and credit policies since early May, and especially in July and August, had undone efforts to stabilize prices and had sent the ruble plunging against the dollar. **********""This shows that possibilities for financial maneuvering, relaxing the financial-credit policy and increasing the total volume of credits have been largely exhausted, and we shall have to substantially toughen the credit-monetary policy in order to prevent the financial-monetary system from collapsing,"" Mr. Gaidar said. **********Mr. Gaidar's warning and some harsh questions by conservative deputies suggested that the Parliament was headed for another session of head-butting with the Government over economic policy and possibly the makeup of the Government itself. Opposition Assails Yeltsin **********At this session, a declaration published by a newly formed front of ""left and right opposition,"" composed of nationalists on one side and die-hard Communists on the other, indicated that President Boris N. Yeltsin himself is likely to come under fire. Until now, Mr. Yeltsin has been largely spared direct attacks because of his popularity and stature. **********Published in the conservative paper Soviet Russia today, the declaration accused Mr. Yeltsin of seeking ""full autocracy"" and said: ""The main responsibility for the impoverishment of Russia lies not with the interchangeable Government teams, but with the President of the Russian Federation, whose political order they fill."" **********As in the past, the outcome of the session was impossible to predict. Elected in 1990, the Russian Parliament is heavily laced with former Communist officials. In addition, the Parliament has never worked out consistent procedures, making for incessant procedural wrangles, long shouting matches and blatant manipulation by the Speaker. A Bleak Picture **********The economic picture Mr. Gaidar drew was generally bleak, with the exception of reports that the grain harvest was likely to be considerably better than last year's, and that most cities had stored up ample fuel supplies for winter. **********The budget deficit has grown sharply since April and has now become ""threatening,"" he said. It stood at 101.3 billion rubles, or 7.5 percent of the gross national product, in June, and soared to 800 billion rubles by the end of August, much of it from spending on state-owned enterprises, social services, the military and law enforcement. **********Industrial production was falling at an ever faster rate, Mr. Gaidar said. it fell between 13 and 15 percent through June, 21.5 percent in July and 27 percent in August. The cumulative fall for the year was likely to be 20 percent, he said. Privatization Plan Advances **********The privatization of small businesses was moving apace, with 18,000 shops, restaurants and services privatized, he said. But privatization of large-scale enterprises was lagging. **********The increase in prices for energy were likely to stabilize the situation in the fuel and power sector, making for more stability in the entire economy, Mr. Gaidar said. But they were also likely to further increase prices. **********Consumer prices multiplied 15.6 times from August 1991 to August 1992, while earnings rose 10.6 times. **********On the farms, Mr. Gaidar said the grain harvest seemed likely to reach 96 million tons, compared to 89 million last year. But meat, poultry and egg production were all dropping sharply, in part because of fodder shortage after the poor harvest last year and in part because of price structures that make it unprofitable to raise cattle. **********The number of unemployed was expected to reach 1.5 million by the end of the year."

Here Come the New 401(k)'s","Your Own Account;
Here Come the New 401(k)'s"," **********New regulations made final by the Labor Department last Tuesday are expected to stir up the 401(k) marketplace as employers consider whether to offer more investment options in the retirement plans in return for the limited protection against employee complaints that the regulations provide. **********There are two basic types of 401(k) plans. In one, the employer has fiduciary responsibility for acting in the best interest of employees. It can offer whatever investment options it wants, including only company stock, but faces liability if the employees lose money because of bad investment decisions. **********The other type of 401(k) plan relieves the employer of fiduciary responsibility provided it complies with certain rules. The new regulations spell out those rules in detail for the first time. They include offering a minimum of three diversified investment options, quarterly switches between investments and adequate disclosure of the options. The rules, five years in the making, take effect Jan. 1, 1994, but the new plans are already on offer and proliferating daily. **********Employers who choose to comply will no longer be liable in the event of losses from bad investment decisions. But they will still be on the hook for a broad range of things like picking investment managers and making certain the options offered are good ones. **********Consultants expect many employers to change their plans because the regulations come at a time when there is already a lot of ferment in the 401(k) marketplace. On the employee side, the idea is to offer better investment opportunities. For employers, the goal is to cut costs and reduce their own involvement in the plans. **********Two things will happen as a result, predicts R. Theodore Benna, head of the Roseland, N.J., office of Noble Lowndes, benefits consultants, and the person who is credited with inventing the 401(k) plan in 1981. **********More employers will hire outsiders -- like his consulting firm -- to administer their 401(k) plans, Mr. Benna said. These consultants are putting together plans with larger menus of investment options from a variety of different mutual fund companies. **********And employers will offer more services, like daily switches from one fund family to another. ""Rather than 3 or 4 investment options, we're moving into an era where we will see 8 to 12 options,"" Mr. Benna said. **********Up until now, there have been two basic ways for employers to put together a 401(k) plan. The first is to pick the investments -- whether mutual funds or insurance company products or company stock or a combination -- and then hire someone to do the recordkeeping. **********""The employer stays in the driver's seat and makes all the decisions,"" said Trisha Brambley, vice president for retirement plan services in the Newtown, Pa., office of Noble Lowndes. **********The second option is to pick a single fund manager, like the Vanguard Group or T. Rowe Price, to manage the money and do the recordkeeping as well. The advantage to the employer of this ""bundled"" approach is convenience. The disadvantage is that employees have only one fund group to choose from. If they are unhappy with the group's performance, the employer must go to a great deal of trouble to switch to a new company. The employer may also have some liability if the choice is too limited. **********But now there is a third option, courtesy of the consultants. They will put together a group of perhaps six fund companies and allow employers to choose from the entire universe of funds that these families offer. The consultant will also offer daily account valuation and switching between the different fund families. **********Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire, Ill., has already signed up more than 20 clients for its new program, which is built around six mutual fund families. The program also has two managers for guaranteed investment contracts, which feature fixed returns, and a money manager putting together stocks or bonds to match a particular market index. Hewitt will handle the investment transactions on a daily basis directly through the mutual fund companies, according to Gail Kellogg, the firm's head of 401(k) recordkeeping. **********Noble Lowndes has a similar system in place, offering 100 funds from six fund families. Noble Lowndes will use a broker, Wall Street Investor Services, to clear its trades. **********Some experts say that most 401(k) plans will move in this direction. ""Within a couple of years, new technology will make the ability to do this widespread,"" said Brian Ternoey, a principal at Foster Higgins, employee benefits consultants based in Princeton, N.J. **********So far, the major gains from the trend toward more diversified 401(k)'s seem to belong to the smaller mutual fund companies, which now have the opportunity to compete with the industry giants, and the consultants, who stand to get a cut of the booming 401(k) business. **********For employees, it means a confusing new array of choices. But if, like most employees, you've never seriously thought through your 401(k) options and diversified your investments, you may have more tools available to help you now. **********""Companies have been reluctant to do education because of fiduciary concerns,"" said Ms. Brambley of Noble Lowndes. ""Now the time has come for an independent party to educate employees on the basics."" **********Indeed, part of the deal with the consultants is that they will offer investment guidance. Typically, the consultants will provide an 800 number to answer employee questions about all aspects of the plan, including investment options, loans and withdrawals. **********""Along with the choice comes the responsibility to help people deal with the choice,"" said Hewitt's Ms. Kellogg.MORNINGSTAR SETS UP A PLAN **********When Morningstar Inc. -- a young Chicago company that has established a big reputation in the mutual fund rating business -- put in a 401(k) plan last year, it had some lofty goals. **********Because of its business, it wanted a plan with some stellar options. And it wanted to sign up all 170 employees. **********""Our business is mutual funds and we wanted to attract everybody -- the receptionist, computer programmers, graphics people -- into learning about them,"" said Don Phillips, publisher of the ratings services. **********The result may be a model 401(k) plan with eight top no-load mutual funds to choose from and a dollar-for-dollar match from the company. It accomplished its purpose, too, with virtually 100 percent participation at the startup, said Joe Sutton, the company's accounting manager. Furthermore, while most employees in other companies put their money in guaranteed fixed-income investments, which probably won't keep up with inflation, nearly 90 percent of the Morningstar plan is invested in six stock funds."

The sentiment index edged down from 68.2 in December to 67.1 in January, but a decline of a point or so is not statistically significant. **********The report was disappointing, not only to investors but to Federal Reserve officials who were looking for some sign, however slight, that the Fed's latest easing move was having an impact on Main Street. On Tuesday, a rumor that the survey would show a sharp rise in confidence helped the stock market to a hefty rally. **********""There's no great watershed reaction to the Fed's discount rate reduction,"" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, ""Stock market euphoria hasn't swept consumers."" **********This initial look at the way consumers feel about the economy and their own finances in January is based on a telephone survey of about 300 families around the country in the first half of the month -- slightly more than half the total sample. **********The closely watched monthly survey, which economists say tracks current consumer spending reasonably well, is included in the Department of Commerce's monthly index of leading indicators. **********There are several crosscurrents in the January results. Though consumers have become slightly more upbeat about the present, they have also turned gloomier about the future. While the index of current conditions rose to 80.7 percent vs. 78.7 in December, the index of expectations declined to 58.4 percent from 61.5 percent. **********The problem, not surprisingly, is jobs or, rather, the lack of them.  Fifty-seven percent of households expect the jobless rate to climb in the year ahead compared with 47 percent just two months ago. **********Interestingly, 64 percent of the consumers surveyed mentioned hearing news reports of rising joblessness.

""Is it the Commonwealth of Independent States, or is it the Russian Federated Republic? Is it Siberia, and is it the Sovereign Republic of Altai?"" **********Such confusion is not just a question of borders or competing claims of sovereignty. It is psychological and for some even traumatic. As it turns out, the collapse of the Soviet Union lighted a slow fuse that is still burning in the Russian national consciousness, leaving many people feeling robbed of a sense of place, of purpose and of identity. 'An Idea' Is Needed **********For the smaller republics, the union's final demise in December meant the birth of a new state and liberation from Moscow's tyranny. But for ethnic Russians the loss of the union has opened up an old and painful question: Without an empire, or a mission, what is Russia? **********""An idea of Russia is needed,"" Sergei B. Stankevich, an adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin, said in a recently published interview. ""Now it is lacking."" **********The problem dates back to the Russian Empire, a vast continental sweep patched together through wars and treaties by an imperial dynasty that was first ousted and then wiped out by the 1917 revolutions. United by their culture, their church and fealty to the Czar, Russians have never known a nation-state in the West European sense. The very issues involved in the transition are causing President Yeltsin to go to the United States on Monday for talks with President Bush about aid, arms and economic reform. 25 Million in Other Republics **********What is called Russia today -- the Russian Federation, with its 130 nationalities and ethnic groups, its 31 autonomous republics and regions -- was carved out of the old Russian Empire, to make up the core of the Soviet Union. About 82 percent of the 150 million people living in Russia are ethnic Russians, and 25 million more are scattered through the other former republics. **********Unlike Austria, which emerged as a homogenous country after the collapse of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918, Russia is itself still a mini-empire, held together more by inertia than by a common identity. **********""The fact is that Russia is only now building its statehood, something it never had,"" said Oleg T. Bogomolov, director of the Institute of International Economic and Political Studies, who says he fears a trend toward regional separatism as local authorities grab more and more power away from a weakened Moscow. More Painful Than Expected **********The breakup of the union has turned out to be more painful than many Russians had expected. Initially, it was widely seen as another aspect of the collapse of Communism, a way of getting rid of ""the center."" But after a delayed reaction, Russians are only now beginning to understand what it means to live in a truncated country, to see its status a world superpower reduced to one of an ailing regional giant, to be scorned by neighbors they once thought of as ""brothers."" **********People joke bitterly about needing visas to go on summer holidays on the Baltic or Black Sea coasts, about having to change money to go to Ukraine, or about passing through ""customs"" to go to Kazakhstan. ""Did you see my foreign car?"" one Russian asked wistfully, as he pointed out his new Zaporozhets, produced in Ukraine. **********""Russians have an identity crisis,"" a Western diplomat said. ""They haven't come to terms with the idea of Russia within its current borders. Some wanted to see the commonwealth as a stage on the way to a renewed union and expected that the other republics, especially Ukraine, would want to come to a new relationship with Russia. Most people cannot conceive of Russia without Ukraine."" **********Ukraine's bolt for independence is difficult for many Russians to comprehend, given the historic links binding the nations. Furthermore, Ukrainian independence has meant the loss of the Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet -- two icons of Russian history known to every schoolchild from Moscow to Vladivostok. A Cultural Riddle **********It also exposes the riddle of Russian identity, which is more rooted in culture than in geography. The empire left a legacy of many nations sharing one language. The result is a cultural knot that is practically impossible to untie: Nikolai Gogol, for instance, was a Ukrainian who wrote in Russian. The Soviet Encyclopedia calls him a Russian writer, while the Ukrainians claim him as their own. **********Some, like the philosopher Aleksandr Tsipko, a director at the Gorbachev Foundation, argue that today's Russian Federation is a fiction, and thus vulnerable to challenges from within and without. **********""The collapse of the Soviet Union along current internal borders leads not only to the death of the Soviet Empire, but also to the collapse of the state's historic core,"" he wrote in October, at a time when President Yeltsin was pushing the old union out of his way. ""The Russian Federated Republic is not a 'metropolis,' as the British Isles were to the British Empire. It is the heart of the Russian Empire, the place where its boldest imperial conquests were concentrated."" **********In a recent interview, Mr. Tsipko predicted further decomposition, as parts of Russia itself drift away from Moscow, which has neither the power nor the will to hold them. In the meantime, he said, Russian nationalists, feeding on feelings of national humiliation, are bound to grow in strength. **********Mr. Yeltsin's challenge, as he tries to pick his way past the ""national"" questions that keep erupting inside and alongside Russia's borders, is to define Russia's interests. But Russia is not of one piece, nor does it lie within one set of borders. The Chechen republic, a patch of the North Caucasus, has declared its out-and-out independence from the Russian Federation, while the Russian majorities in Ukrainian Crimea and in the Trans-Dniester region, a tiny sliver of independent Moldova, are clamoring to get back in. Mixing Past With Present **********The Communists' antinational policies left other former Soviet republics with arbitrary borders and mixed populations, some of which are now the source of conflict and dispute. But Russia is alone with its vestigial imperial mentality, one that repeatedly confuses the idea of a multinational empire with the interests of a newborn state. **********""People often mix up the Russian Federation of today and the historic Russia, which was the Russian Empire,"" said Otto Latsis, a commentator at the newspaper Izvestia. ""People say the Black Sea Fleet was Russian, but it belonged to a Russian Empire, which consisted not just of Russia but of Ukraine. The problem is that the Russian people and the Russian Government want to see our Russia today as the full heir of the Russian Empire, but this is not so."" **********Without Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic states, Russia's center of gravity has shifted eastward, a fact that Moscow seems to have understood better in recent months as it increased its diplomatic overtures to the new Central Asian states. **********In an interview this week, Mr. Yeltsin brushed aside doubts about Russia's statehood. He said Russia's rich and ancient culture, and not the number of its nuclear warheads, would determine its status as a great power.  ""Today in any corner of the globe, people know what Russia is,"" he said. ""This means Russia has a history, a rich history."" Western Dictation Seen **********But the fact is that without the union or the empire, Russia's standing as a world power has diminished drastically. Not only is Moscow no longer on a par with Washington, but there is also a growing perception that the West is dictating the terms of Russia's recovery. **********Many Russians also have the sense that Russia, by far the largest of the former Soviet republics, has let itself become a punching bag for its neighbors. This sense of humiliation comes on top of the realization -- for many, only a recent one -- that the Communist system under which they lived for seven decades was not only fraudulent but also criminal. **********""In the days of America's Wild West, there was a saying that a good Indian is a dead Indian,"" Mr. Stankevich said. ""We have almost the same: A good Russian is a Russian in tears, repentant, pulling his hair out, showing how bad his country and people are, along with its whole history."" **********Understanding what Russia is is the nation's biggest challenge, Mr. Stankevich said. ""The tragedy is that we don't know our own country,"" he wrote. ""We don't want to know it, and what's more, we are proud of that."""

Accused on June 2 **********Then, a bruised and battered 18-year-old woman appeared June 2 at a police station in Redencao, 1,000 miles northwest of here. She accused the 37-year-old chief of raping her in the back seat of his Chevette, a charge the chief denies. **********""Explosion of savage instinct,"" said the headline in Brazil's largest selling news weekly, Veja, which broke the story on its June 10 cover. ""The chief symbol of ecological purity tortures and rapes a white high school girl."" **********The ensuing uproar has bared Brazilian attitudes toward rape, race and Indian rights. Today, feminists are fighting anthropologists, who in turn are fighting Brazilian press barons for supposedly inciting an anti-Indian backlash. **********The young woman, a Portuguese language tutor for the chief's three children, charged that after a long day of drinking at a barbecue he attacked her and forced her to have sex with him, causing her to lose her virginity.  Granted Numerous Interviews **********The woman, Silvia Leticia Ferreira, has been widely identified by Brazilian news organizations and has granted numerous television and press interviews about the case; she has also allowed photographs of the bruises she said were inflicted in the attack. **********In initial press interviews, Mr. Paiakan admitted, then denied, having sex with the woman. Formally charged with rape, the Indian leader in a police deposition June 19 again denied that he ever had sex with the woman. Instead, he said that his wife, Irekran, grew jealous of the younger woman and raped her with her fingers. **********[ On Tuesday, a presiding judge received a police report that affirmed that Ms. Ferreira's underwear was stained with her blood and with Mr. Paiakan's sperm. ] **********The chief awaits trial while under house arrest in his native village, A-Ukre. A cause celebre in Brazil, the chief's defense has been taken up by a legal team led by Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, a human rights lawyer who is Deputy Mayor of Sao Paulo. Legally a Ward of the State **********Feminists assert that the Kaiapo chief is hiding behind his wife, knowing that she cannot be indicted. Because she does not speak Portuguese and is only vaguely familiar with Western ways, she is legally considered a ward of the state and cannot be tried in Brazilian courts. **********The chief, on the other hand, attended missionary school, speaks Portuguese reasonably well, has a bank account, owns an airplane and a city house, drives his own pickup truck, and has traveled overseas, mostly recently to London last April. **********Many anthropologists fear that the rape charge against the Kaiapo chief is being used to discredit Brazil's Indian rights movement and their foreign backers. Group Founded by Rock Star **********""We are all worried that the Paiakan affair is being used by people who have designs on the wealth of the Indian territories,"" said Olympio Serra, an anthropologist who is president of the Brazilian Rain Forest Foundation, a Kayapo support group founded by Sting, the British rock star. **********Anthropologists say rape is rare among the Kaiapo. Traditionally, rape was restricted to warfare against outside groups. **********""If a rape occurred, it was a reflection of his living among white people,"" said Darcy Ribeiro, a Rio anthropologist. **********Mr. Paiakan and other Kaiapo chiefs are caught between both worlds. Often touted as ""Brazil's wealthiest Indians,"" the 5,000 Kaiapo earn millions of dollars a year in royalties from gold and mahogany extracted from an archipelago of reserves stretching over 42,500 miles in central Brazil. Responsible for nearly half the economic activity in Redencao, the chiefs have second households and often indulge in sexual liaisons with local women. A Rarely Punished Crime **********Traditionally in Brazil, rape is an underreported and rarely punished crime. For example, in nearby Ceara state, 930 rapes against girls under 18 were reported in 1990. Of these cases, only six led to arrests. **********Mr. Paiakan also said he is being persecuted. ""Why aren't gold miners who rape and murder Yanomami women punished?"" he demanded of reporters, referring to northern Amazon tribe whose lands are frequently invaded by gold seekers. ""Is this law only for me?"" **********Marcos Terena, an Indian spokesman, said, ""When a white man rapes an Indian woman, there is never any scandal."" **********In a growing backlash against the Indians, more and more Brazilians say the Government is bottling up vast amounts of timber and minerals by recognizing huge reserves to shelter Brazil's 225,000 indigenous people -- about 1.5 percent of this impoverished nation's population. Under Brazilian law, logging and mining in Indian reserves can occur only with tribal permission and by paying royalties. **********Although daunting legislative hurdles remain before the reserve could be abolished, the vote reflects regional dissatisfaction over setting aside a mineral-rich area larger than Portugal for 10,000 Indians. **********In another action last week, 2,000 settler families invaded a 650-square-mile ranch in a frontier town near Redencao. During the Earth Summit, an Italian oil company, under pressure from Italian and Brazilian human rights groups, gave up its 25-year-old title to the land and announced the return of the ranch to its traditional inhabitants, the Xavante tribe. **********Racial tensions are also high in Redencao, where Paulinho Paiakan maintains a townhouse and a small farm. ""An Indian's place is in his village, a rapist's place is in jail,"" read a banner carried by protesters through streets of Redencao, in early June. **********In reprisal, Kaiapo Indians sacked a store, blocked the airstrip to A-Ukre, and temporarily trapped 3,000 loggers and gold miners on Indian lands. Recalling that Kaiapo Indians killed 22 white squatters in 1981 and rioted at Redencao's hospital in 1990, residents of the Amazon town panicked at rumors that Indians would invade and burn the courthouse. **********To defuse tensions, Redencao's Mayor banned liquor sales to Indians, banned sound trucks by protesters, and arranged the Kaiapo's trial to be shifted to more neutral territory, Maraba, a town 210 miles to the north."

But auto executives said the cut in interest rates that followed the release of the jobless data would help the industry. **********""With the recent reduction in short-term interest rates, we expect to see even stronger vehicle sales in the second half of the year,"" said James B. Fitzpatrick, vice president of marketing at General Motors. More Are Buying American **********Analysts said a ""Buy America"" preference among consumers had helped Detroit's Big Three gain ground against Japanese competitors. G.M.'s Saturn division had a particularly strong month, and in June, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for North American-built cars was the best in 11 months. **********Sales of vehicles built in North America -- which are considered domestically built -- rose a sharp 23.9 percent in the last 10 days of the month compared with the period a year earlier. Car sales rose 15 percent, to 244,473, and light-truck sales gained 40.7 percent, to 157,284. **********The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of North American-built cars for the period of June 21-30 was 7.5 million. For the month, the rate was 6.7 million, up from 6.3 million in May and the same as in June 1991. The monthly selling rate was the highest since July 1991. **********For the entire month of June, sales of all cars and light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, surged 6.2 percent, to 1,268,954, from 1,149,021 last year. June car sales were up 2.5 percent, to 826,942, and light-truck sales rose 14 percent, to 442,012. 'Very Good News' **********""The latest 10 days are very good news, because it means that dealer inventories will be in good shape, and that bodes well for production schedules,"" said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. ""We haven't been able to say that in a while."" **********Sales of G.M.'s domestically produced cars rose 18.4 percent in late June, to 106,857, led by strong increases at all divisions except Chevrolet, which suffered a 3.5 percent decline. Sales of G.M.'s domestic light trucks rose 34.3 percent, to 57,527. **********The Saturn division sold more than 20,000 cars in one month for the first time. At that rate, Saturn could be approaching capacity at its two-year-old plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. **********""We had a tremendous Fourth of July weekend, and we don't have many Saturns in stock,"" said John B. T. Campbell 3d, who owns several dealerships in Southern California. Ford's Taurus Excels **********The Ford Motor Company's car sales rose 30.7 percent in late June, to 61,952, and the company's light-truck sales rose 39.3 percent, to 51,834. Robert L. Rewey, vice president of sales operations, noted that the midsized Taurus, which was redesigned for 1992, had its best sales month since May 1989. **********Ford injected a note of caution by saying unusually strong orders for cars from rental companies had inflated its results. Some rental companies were caught short of cars when airlines lowered fares and caused a surge of travelers, Ford said. **********But Stephen Girsky, automotive analyst for Paine Webber in New York, said Ford's sales to rental fleets would help the company's profits because they reflected genuine demand caused by a greater volume of travelers rather than steep discounting. **********General Motors said it had not experienced a similar phenomenon in its rental sales. **********The Chrysler Corporation, which announces sales on a monthly basis only, said car sales for all of June declined 12.2 percent, to 54,255, while light-truck sales, led by its popular mini-van, rose 23.1 percent, to 101,438. **********""Our total vehicle sales have climbed back almost to where they were two years ago, before the economic slump really set in,"" said Tom Pappert, vice president of sales. Japanese Feel a Pinch **********Japanese auto makers were clearly feeling the effects of their recent price increases and the Big Three's gains in quality. The Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales for the month, including vehicles built in the United States and Japan, fell 5.6 percent, to 61,621. The Honda Motor Company posted an 8.7 percent drop in car sales for the month, to 77,287. **********But the Nissan Motor Company's car sales rose 13.4 percent, to 45,479. Earl J. Hesterberg, vice president of the Nissan brand division, said car sales had been rising steadily since January. The division is about to introduce a midsized car, the Altima; a new mini-van, the Quest, has begun arriving at dealer showrooms. **********Because light-truck sales have gained so much more than car sales -- and the Big Three are much stronger than the Japanese in light trucks -- Detroit has been able to score a significant gain in overall market share. Big Three's Share: 71.8% **********Taking into account cars and light trucks, imported and domestic, the Big Three captured 71.8 percent of all sales in June, up from 69.7 percent of all sales in the month a year earlier. That left the Japanese auto makers with 22.7 percent of sales, including output from North American-based transplants, down from 24.5 percent a year earlier. Other importers, principally from Britain and Germany, sold 5.5 percent of all vehicles, down from 5.9 percent from last year. **********Mr. Campbell, the California dealer, said: ""People are buying American, especially here in Orange County, where the import penetration is usually 60 percent. What that means is, people are giving American cars a look."""

""We were very cautious with the concert sponsorship,"" he said. ""We took a backseat role."" **********But the experience was so gratifying that Mr. Fireman, 47, has made human rights the in-house cause at Reebok, the athletic-shoe maker based in Stoughton, Mass. During the last four years, the company's foundation has given millions to activists around the world. **********Mr. Fireman's latest project is Witness, a program established by the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. The program, which was announced in late March, will provide human rights advocates throughout the world with video cameras, computers and fax machines, so they can record abuses and then send the videotapes to television stations. **********""This is a weapon that activists can use,"" Mr. Fireman said. ""Instead of just a few people watching, there will be millions of eyes that can witness abuses. This could be a powerful deterrent."" **********Reebok will also be continuing to give out its annual Human Rights Awards, which carry a $25,000 prize, to individuals under the age of 30. Reebok so far has honored more than a dozen people, most recently the three Russians killed in the aborted coup in the Soviet Union last year; Abubacar Sultan, national director of the Save the Children Federation, and Ashley Black, an 11-year-old in Marlboro, N.J., who spearheaded a drive to ban hate-related videos in her community. **********In contrast to giving money to a mainstream charity like the Red Cross, Reebok's brand of philanthropy carries the risk that it could easily offend consumers. Indeed, while the awards have generated invaluable publicity for Reebok, they have also prompted many irate phone calls. **********Two years ago, when Reebok honored Shawan Jabarin, a Palestinian activist in the occupied West Bank, the company got angry calls from several leaders of Jewish organizations. **********""They wanted to know how I, who am Jewish, could do such a thing,"" Mr. Fireman said.

In normal operation, it uses diesel only as a pilot fuel to get under way. **********Natural gas has long been recognized as a potentially cheap and clean alternative fuel in trucks, buses and cars. But critics have questioned its safety.

The fuel is known as refrigerated liquefied methane, or R.L.M. **********If the tests with Engine 7890, and a second engine being converted, prove successful, Air Products wants to build from six to eight processing plants in the northern Plains states. That would be enough to supply the 35 or so trains that Burlington Northern sends east each day from the coal fields. **********Each plant would convert the gas to nearly pure methane and cool it into a liquid so condensed that a single tender car would carry enough fuel for two engines to travel 1,700 miles."

For example, assistance might be provided for mothers who need child care; for workers who have elderly parents at home who need care; fathers who want paternity leave to raise children; those who want shorter workweeks, or those who want to share jobs, dividing their workweek in half. **********A study by the Conference Board, a private research organization, entitled ""The Emerging Role of the Work-Family Manager,"" found that most work-family managers were promoted from within companies, usually from human resources departments. **********The study was done by Arlene A. Johnson, a work force researcher at the Conference Board, and Karel L. Rose, who handles work and family programs for Time Warner Inc. Among the 68 companies surveyed were the BankAmerica Corporation, John Hancock and the Xerox Corporation. **********Ms. Johnson said she noticed that interest in having work-family managers began to increase about two years ago. It was then, she said, that she began receiving telephone calls from companies wanting information about writing job specifications for work-family managers. At the same time, she said, she began receiving calls from middle managers interested in such jobs. **********Ms. Johnson estimates that more than 300 companies now have work-family managers and that the number continues to grow. **********The need for such a person on corporate staffs comes at a time when two important trends are converging that affect American workers. **********One trend is that the average manager will probably change jobs at least five times during a career. Few people will remain with their companies for 20, 25 or 35 years, as was typical until a decade ago. That means that workers need to do more of their own retirement planning because they have less chance to build substantial benefits with one company over a period of years. **********The other trend is that companies, in seeking to cut costs, have reduced their contributions to pension funds and health insurance. Ms. Johnson said work-family managers can help workers plan for retirement and health insurance coverage. **********People interested in becoming work-family managers need good communications skills and interpersonal skills like empathy, patience and diplomacy, she said. They also need to be able to plan and think strategically about their jobs, have a good knowledge of a company's culture and the ability to be a self starter. **********One company official reported difficulty filling the position because half of 150 resumes received for the job did not meet his company's criteria; half the respondents had social work backgrounds and half had business backgrounds. **********""I think you have to have a kind of Renaissance person: pragmatic and clear-minded and knowledgable about the people side of work-family,"" said the official, who insisted on anonymity. **********About 71 percent of the work-family managers who responded to the Conference Board study had at least bachelors' degees. Among those with higher degrees, 51 percent had master's degrees in business administration. **********The average salary among 32 work-family managers who attended a meeting sponsored by Ms. Johnson last April was about $56,000 a year. About half of those managers said they were eligible for bonuses ranging from 6 percent to 10 percent of their salaries. **********These managers indicated that they felt positive about their jobs but ""uncertain about the long-range career implications."""

Baker 3d today with a list of commercial scientific projects they were ready to work on if the West would just invest in them. **********In a remarkable encounter, Mr. Baker became the first Western official known to have visited Chelyabinsk-70, a top-secret military nuclear complex near the old industrial city of Chelyabinsk in the Urals. Chelyabinsk-70 and other secret military towns were not listed on published Soviet maps. A Russian official said the numerical suffix on the name was for postal reasons. **********The Russian nuclear bomb designers who greeted Mr. Baker appeared to be almost desperate in their desire to obtain civilian contracts from the West to keep themselves employed now that their own Government has announced major cuts in military projects. Mr. Baker seemed in tune with their desires as he told them of American and German plans to help create a ""clearing house"" for nuclear and other scientists in Russia.  Like a Salesman's Pitch **********Speaking quickly, like a salesman who has only a few minutes to make his pitch, the chief scientist of the Chelyabinsk-70 weapons design center, Yevgeny N. Avrorin, presented Mr. Baker with a long list of commercial products that his scientists could produce if they had Western investors. **********These included industrial diamonds, fiber-optical equipment, nuclear medical equipment and computer software that they hoped might particularly appeal to Japanese electronics companies. 'Remarkable,' Baker Says **********When Mr. Baker's motorcade arrived at the nine-story building in Chelyabinsk-70 where his meeting was held, every window in the structure was packed with scientists, technicians and secretaries, creating a remarkable multi-story tableau of smiling faces and waving hands. The vigor of the reception in sub-zero weather suggested that the Russian scientists saw the United States and the West as an answer to their economic woes. **********""This is every bit as remarkable for us as is it for you,"" Mr. Baker said as he sat in front of a blackboard in a classroom filled with the most senior nuclear bomb designers of the former Soviet Union. **********The scientists said the pay rate at their institute ranged from 857 rubles a month for technicians to 1,500 rubles a month for the top nuclear bomb designers. At one time these were impressive salaries, well above the average of about 300 rubles a month. But with the runaway inflation of the ruble, these salaries are no longer so privileged.  Even with occasional bonuses and subsidized food and housing, the scientists said they were struggling to keep themselves afloat. **********In his prepared remarks at Chelyabinsk-70, situated just east of the Ural Mountains in western Siberia, Mr. Baker told the scientists: ""We know that right now your options at home are limited and outlaw regimes and terrorists may try to exploit your situation and influence you to build new weapons of war. We want to help you find new projects that will allow you to remain in your country and earn a decent living, applying your skills to the cause of science and peace, rather than forging weapons of war."" **********To do that, Mr. Baker said, the United States and Germany, in coordination with Russia, will discuss how to establish ""an international scientific center"" in Russia that might also have branches in other former republics. Clearing-House Role Seen **********""The center would play a clearing-house or facilitating role,"" Mr. Baker said. ""It would receive, review, generate and fund proposals for projects. It would help match projects with qualified scientists and individuals and monitor projects to insure proper use of funds. Actual projects themselves could be carried out by top scientists throughout the new independent states. It would be open to scientists from all the new independent states."" **********Chelyabinsk-70 is one of two nuclear bomb designing complexes in the former Soviet Union, the other being Arzamas-16, situated near the Volga River. A sister city about 20 miles away, Chelyabinsk-65, actually manufactures the nuclear bombs designed here and was visited by a Senate delegation in January. **********The Chelyabinsk district was the site of one of the worst nuclear accidents in history in 1957 -- worse even than Chernobyl, although it was not reported at the time. Some stored nuclear waste exploded, irradiating a wide trough of territory and forcing the evacuation of some 30 villages. **********Mr. Baker flew from Dushanbe, Tajikistan, this morning, where he was on a tour of Central Asian republics, to Yekaterinburg, one of the chief cities in the Urals. From Yekaterinburg, formerly known as Sverdlovsk, he drove for two hours south through a forest of pine and fir trees to Chelyabinsk-70, which consists of about 100 acres of buildings and apartment houses surrounded by double barbed-wire fence. Nods of Approval **********The 30-odd senior scientists gathered for Mr. Baker in Chelyabinsk-70 in the building known officially as the All-Union Scientific Research Institute for Technical Physics nodded their heads in approval at all of his remarks. But before Mr. Baker even began, Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy, and Mr. Avrorin, the chief scientist at Chelyabinsk-70, presented the Secretary of State with what they described as a hasty translation of their own proposals for employment. **********Mr. Avrorin explained that Chelyabinsk-70 is one of 10 closed military industrial cities spread around Russia and employs 16,000 people, about 9,000 of whom are technicians and 7,000 production engineers and scientists. **********""Our institute is well equipped with scientific research equipment,"" Mr. Avrorin said. ""This has come at great expense to our taxpayers, and we understand that now is the time to give this back. We have a huge scientific research potential, and therefore conversion to different types is not so painful. We have no shortage of ideas. But we have no sufficient financing for them."" **********He went on to tell Mr. Baker that the institute is interested in developing cooperation with foreign countries, particularly the United States. **********Mr. Avrorin stressed that he and his colleagues were not looking for handouts and were not begging. **********""It is important not just to have money for living, but also interesting work,"" he told Mr. Baker. **********He said the center had been working to develop synthetic microscopic diamonds that could put an edge on knives that would never have to be sharpened. The center, he said, has also done sophisticated work on fiber optics and various applications of nuclear medicine and nuclear magnetic resonance. He also suggested joint mathematical research between Chelyabinsk and Los Alamos, the American nuclear weapons laboratory in Mew Mexico. **********Beyond seeking investors for such commercial applications, Mr. Avrorin asked Mr. Baker to help provide government guarantees for potential investors, as well as customs and tax breaks to make such deals more attractive. To coordinate the proposals, he suggested ""a bilateral commission"" of American and Russian scientists quite similar to what Mr. Baker was suggesting. No Commitment by Baker **********Mr. Baker did not commit himself in any way, although he promised to study the Russian proposal carefully. He said that an American arms control team would meet him in Moscow on Monday for talks on this subject with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and that at that time they would try to begin formalizing some arrangements for cooperation. **********Vladislav I. Nikitin, deputy director of the institute, told reporters that as far as he knew no former Soviet nuclear bomb designers had been approached yet by foreign powers. He said that for now, leaving Russia for more money abroad did not appeal to the premier scientists working at Chelyabinsk. **********Mr. Nikitin said, ""All the noise about the brain drain is having an influence on the state of mind of our scientists and is now driving this process."" **********He maintained that since 1988, Chelyabinsk-70 has been converting its research to civilian applications and that now roughly 50 percent of its research was military and 50 percent non-military. The problem, he explained, was that conversion to civilian projects was expensive, and without commercial customers there was no way for the institute to cover its costs.  Tour of Laboratories **********After Mr. Baker spoke with the scientists, he toured one of their laboratories, and was shown various experiments involving plutonium, uranium- 235 and tritium. While the buildings in the complex looked neater and more well-built and well-kept than the normal Soviet office block, they still had a 1950's feel about them, and there were few computers to be seen. **********Before leaving, Mr. Baker asked his hosts if they would allow him to be filmed by an American network television crew as he visited a memorial to one of the founders of the Soviet nuclear program that is situated on the grounds of Chelyabinsk. The director said that he was very sorry but that absolutely no filming was allowed inside the gate. It had never been done, he said. **********But as the director spoke, the other nuclear bomb designers sitting around him in the classroom began whispering, ""Let him do it, let him do it."" Finally, the director relented, and all the Russian scientists applauded. **********""See, it is a new day,"" Mr. Baker said."

Instead, they are accumulating surpluses of wheat and corn so that there will be enough feed for the cattle and chickens to last for two years. **********They are building no new houses, buying no new cars, contemplating no new investments. Their children will have to make do with fewer extras like school trips and music lessons. **********""The tendency is to lower incomes for everybody,"" said Moshe Brukental, Hafetz Hayim's general secretary. ""We take no risks in the sixth year."" **********With the Jewish New Year in September, Israel entered the pivotal sixth year of a seven-year agricultural cycle that dates from ancient times and that some Israelis consider as valid today as ever. The Old Testament says the land must lie fallow in the seventh year, and a literal reading of that injunction means that this is the last year for normal planting, pruning and harvesting.  Strict Constructionists **********Hafetz Hayim is among a handful of collective farms that take the Word at its word. And so its members have already started adjusting their economic priorities and work habits to be ready for the sabbatical period starting next September, when they will be able to plant nothing. **********""The land belongs to the Almighty and not to you,"" Mr. Brukental said. ""It's good to be reminded of that -- that there's someone higher than you."" **********No doubt, other Israeli farmers say. But they have economic imperatives to consider as well. **********Leaving farms untended for a year could be ruinous, they say. So in a few months nearly all Israeli farmers, observant or not, are expected to follow past practice and turn control of their lands over to the Chief Rabbinate for symbolic sale to a non-Jew. **********Rabbis have interpreted the biblical requirement as applying only to land in Israel that is held by Jews. The technical and temporary sale of farms to a non-Jew, sanctioned by the rabbinical authorities here for decades, amounts to a theological loophole that permits Jewish farmers to continue working the land as usual, even during the sabbatical. **********It means that for a full year, there is a single person -- usually an Arab -- who holds technical title to virtually the entire country's farmland. Apparently, few Israelis are nervous about it. ""I assure you that it's someone they trust to sell it back again,"" said Moishe Cohen, a senior official of Ha-Kibbutz Hadati, an association of 17 religious-observant collective farms that accept the symbolic sale as necessary. **********From the first large wave of Jewish migration to Ottoman-controlled Palestine in the 1880's, the rabbinical authorities have ruled that scrupulously obeying the Torah in this matter would risk leaving farms desolate and turning fragile settlements into wastelands. And, there are the present-day business considerations. **********""If we were to stop marketing our products to Europe even for one year, we'd be finished,"" said Yonatan Bassi, the Agriculture Ministry's director general. It is no more possible, he said, to observe the biblical mandate unswervingly than it would be to honor a companion requirement that Jews in the seventh year cancel their debts to one another. To date, there has been no detectable rush by Israeli banks to forgive outstanding loans. **********But there are no rabbinical escape clauses for Hafetz Hayim, whose members argue that Zionist principles, in addition to religious beliefs, rule out even a symbolic sale of Israeli soil. That is not to say they leave themselves entirely in God's hands. **********Mr. Brukental says he is well aware that Leviticus 25:21 promises that ""I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years."" But he adds with a smile, ""I can't tell you that it's exactly been like that."" **********In the last ""sixth year,"" the kibbutz farmers tried planting a two-year cotton seed that was supposed to flower on its own during the seventh year, to be harvested once the sabbatical ended. Instead, a harsh winter wiped out the plants. Promoting New Enterprises **********This time, they are not only cutting back the cotton crop but also diversifying their sources of income, with a marine park for tourists and a factory that produces paper products. **********Farmers are not the only ones caught in the seven-year hitch. Symbolic sales or no, about 10 percent of Israeli consumers will refuse out of religious conviction to eat any fruit, vegetables or grain produced next year by Jews in this country. **********So the Government must decide before long what to do, for example, about the 200,000 tons of domestically grown wheat that goes each year for bread -- a bigger problem now because bakeries are under tighter religious supervision. One possibility, albeit a costly one, says Mr. Bassi of the Agriculture Ministry, is to export the entire crop and import a comparable amount of foreign-grown wheat. **********As for fruit and vegetables, religious Jews used to buy them from Arabs during sabbatical years, usually in the occupied territories, but only after rabbinical inspectors personally went there early in the morning to affirm that the harvesting was indeed being done by non-Jews. **********Now, the Palestinian uprising may take its toll, cautions Rabbi Yosef Efrati, a leading expert on sabbatical-year law. ""It's dangerous,"" he said. ""I'm not sure you can get someone to go out there alone at 4 A.M."""

Yeltsin's right to name his officials. **********After a meeting between senior members of Mr. Yeltsin's Government and the Presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies, the two sides said in a statement that ""as a result of constructive discussions, it became possible to narrow the positions and to agree on cooperation in advancing radical economic reform."" **********Today, Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the chief economic planner in Mr. Yeltsin's Government, agreed that the discussions had been ""very constructive."" But Mr. Gaidar again threatened that the Cabinet would resign if he was put in the position of ""rubber-stamping the appearance of reform."" **********The resolution that brought Mr. Yeltsin's officials to loggerheads with the congress was adopted Saturday, after a day of heated debate and innumerable votes. It declared the current course of economic reform unsatisfactory and suggested that the President make substantial changes.  Matter of Timing **********The most provocative provision called on him to propose a new Prime Minister and Cabinet within three months. Mr. Yeltsin, who now holds the Prime Minister's post as well as the Presidency, had offered to step down as Prime Minister, but within six months. The resolution was adopted, 647 to 69. **********Though the difference between the two positions seemed to be just a matter of a few months, the resolution touched the issue at the heart of the legislative session -- control over the course of economic change. **********Mr. Yeltsin and his supporters argue that he and the Government must have full authority and the full backing of the congress to pursue painful economic policies, which include steep price increases and tight money. **********In the view of presidential aides, the congress, in rejecting Mr. Yeltsin's request for an extension of his special powers, was essentially trying to curb his freedom of action. **********Mr. Gaidar, among others, sharply assailed the measure and on Saturday threatened to resign, while Mr. Yeltsin's legislative supporters spoke of calling a referendum or even moving to dissolve the congress.  A Land Where Little Is Final **********The resolution, though formally adopted, was not expected to be the last word. The congress's Speaker, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, delayed signing the document until Monday, leaving time for amendments. And the brief but tumultuous history of Russian and Soviet legislatures gives ample evidence that few votes are final. **********Some legislators privately noted that even if the resolution remained in force, Mr. Yeltsin still had three months to rule by decree, and beyond that had a good chance of naming a Prime Minister of his choice. **********In any case, th President was not thought to be enthusiastic about a referendum or to want legislative elections during a period of economic hardship. Members of the congress were likewise thought not to want to intensify the confrontation any more, or to torpedo the Government or the reforms, since Mr. Yeltsin remains a popular figure in this country. **********It remained unclear whether Mr. Gaidar's threats to resign were tactical, or if he would in fact step down if the congress persevered in its attacks on his programs. Mr. Yeltsin, the central figure in the drama, was not present during the voting Saturday and has made no public statement since."

Case,Judge Won't Intervene In Disputed S.E.C. Case," **********A Federal judge decided late Tuesday not to intervene in a Securities and Exchange Commission case that is becoming a political embarrassment to Richard C. Breeden, the S.E.C. chairman. **********Last week Federal District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer disclosed that a former commissioner, Edward H. Fleischman, had written two extraordinary letters, strongly implying the case was mishandled. Even so, the judge ruled, he would not intervene, because a Federal court would be able to review the commission's final decision in the case, which is expected within six months. **********Mr. Fleischman, long at odds with Mr. Breeden, said in the letters that he would testify about its proceedings in Federal court if he were permitted. Proceedings at the S.E.C. are secret. **********The defendants in the proceeding, two accountants who worked for the Savin Corporation, were suspended for five years by an administrative law judge from practicing before the commission or for working for a publicly held company. The two Coopers & Lybrand accountants, David J. Checkosky and Norman A. Aldrich, were found to have improperly capitalized, rather than written off, losses from Savin's unsuccessful development of a new copier.  Decision Was Appealed **********The administrative law judge's decision has been appealed to the commission. An article in Business Week magazine in February asserted that Mr. Breeden had intentionally delayed the case because he did not have sufficient votes to uphold the sanctions imposed against the defendants. **********Senior officials at the commission who insisted on not being identified have said that Business Week's account was largely accurate, except in some details. **********The officials said that Mr. Breeden did not attend a hearing last year and it was led by Mr. Fleischman. They said that the commission had voted to reduce the sanctions against the accountants, and shortly after their decision one of the commissioners in the majority, Philip Lochner Jr., left the agency. **********On Friday, lawyers at the commission told defense lawyers that they had scheduled a new hearing on the matter to be held in May. **********Mr. Lochner's position has been filled recently by J. Carter Beese, a former Republican fund-raiser and close ally of Mr. Breeden. Mr. Fleischman has not been replaced on the five-member commission, although a leading candidate who has been discussed at the White House is James R. Doty, a close friend and former law partner of Mr. Breeden. Mr. Doty is the agency's general counsel. **********Lawyers for the accountants had asked Judge Oberdorfer to permit them to interview three current and two former commissioners and also for internal S.E.C. papers about the case. **********The judge said that Mr. Fleischman's letters and articles about the case had provided a basis for him to review the accountants' request. But citing the S.E.C.'s representations that the case will be decided within the next six months and all internal agency documents are being preserved, Judge Oberdorfer dismissed the accountants' motion and said the agency's final ruling could be reviewed."

Bad News, Democrat Says **********""This morning's report cannot be read as good news for the millions of jobless Americans who read and took hope from the assertions that a recovery has begun,"" said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, head of the Joint Economic Committee. ""Employers remain cautious about hiring, and the labor market is showing little sign of life."" **********At the White House, Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, gave the kind of circumspect appraisal he has in the past. ""While sales and production have been improving,"" he observed, ""improvements in unemployment generally lag behind. Stronger economic growth and job creation is the Administration's top priority."" **********The reaction of securities markets initially appeared to be one of disappointment, with bonds rising and stocks falling. Later, however, the stock market rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining almost 15 points. This may have reflected the sentiment of more optimistic analysts, who found the March data quite consistent with expectations for steady, if subdued, recovery. **********""I see an emerging momentum of the economy that is still well maintained,"" said Stephen S. Roach, a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, dismissing month-to-month fluctuations in the statistics. ""The dynamics of a self-sustaining recovery are in place."" **********In keeping with the halting recovery that most economists believe is now under way, today's report included bits of good and bad news and a lot that was inconclusive. **********There was no significant movement in the jobless rate for any of the main demographic groups, the length of both the average workweek and of jobless spells held steady and there was no appreciable change in the Labor Department's quarterly tabulation of Americans who have given up looking for a job because they think they would be unable to find one. **********""It's basically a no-change report,"" declared Walter M. Cadette, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company, noting that while there has been little job gain from recent surges in retail sales it is also true that job erosion in general has ended and that the labor force has begun to grow again. **********Among the 11 biggest industrial states, three showed meaningful changes in their jobless rates. The rate for New York, which conducts primary elections Tuesday, fell to 8 percent from 8.9, while Illinois saw its rate fall to 7.8 percent from 8.5. Kennedy Demands Action **********The rate for Massachusetts jumped 1.6 points, to 9.1 percent, causing Senator Edward M. Kennedy to complain that his state's economy ""is far from out of the woods"" and calling on Congress, the Bush Administration and the Federal Reserve to ""do more to stop the recession and insure that a vigorous recovery actually begins."" **********William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee he found it ""noteworthy"" that the 303,000 rise in the labor force last month was the fourth in a row, bringing the total since November to 1.2 million. **********Other analysts said this probably reflected increased optimism about the prospect of obtaining jobs, with about half the 1.2 million having done so. **********Typically, such optimism causes the jobless rate to rise until recovery is well under way but in March the economy generated just enough jobs, 305,000 as measured by the department's survey of households, to absorb them all. **********The ranks of the jobless thus edged down to 9,242,000 from 9,244,000. **********But economists disagreed about how to interpret the household survey's 305,000 job gain, with some dismissing it as statistical quirk in light of a payroll gain of only 19,000 while others regarded it as solid evidence of improvement. **********Taking the latter view, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Bank, said that the household survey showed a 620,000-job gain since last July and, whatever its deficiencies, has proved a reliable predictor in previous business recoveries. He said these numbers, which included an 882,000 March surge without seasonal adjustment, were ""so strong they shouldn't be ignored."""

Yeltsin's disdain for his advice, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has issued a broad attack against the Russian Government, which he said was in danger of losing control. **********In an interview with the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, the former Soviet President went further than he has since his resignation in December in criticizing the political style of his old rival Mr. Yeltsin. **********He accused the Government of excessive secrecy, of shunning its allies, of being too reactive and of using its influence over the press to blank out reports of his recent visit to the United States. **********""The new power is capable of destroying, but it has not yet proved that it is able to create,"" Mr. Gorbachev said in the interview, which was published Friday. **********He denied that he had ever pledged to Mr. Yeltsin, during the long talks that preceded the transfer of power in December, that he would stay out of politics. ""They are making it understood that the best position for the ex-President is to remain silent,"" he said, ""I said, I will not leave politics for the taiga; I will not leave the social arena."" Gorbachev Is Mocked **********Two weeks ago, the old Yeltsin-Gorbachev feud that once dominated Soviet politics flared up again when Mr. Yeltsin, after a meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, mocked Mr. Gorbachev's performance in the United States and challenged the former President to keep his promise to stay out of politics. **********Mr. Gorbachev, in his interview, said he had simply reassured the Russian President that he would not use the Gorbachev Foundation, his new research center, as a political base, and that he would support the Russian leadership's efforts to achieve a democratic transformation. **********""Listen,"" he told the newspaper, ""Yeltsin is not Jesus Christ. He is not the man to whom I must answer."" **********Earlier in the interview, he said that ""conformism and apologias are the worst possible service you can do this Government with its authoritarian tendencies,"" which he said had developed during its ""underground"" political struggle against the central Soviet Government. **********He said the Government regarded advice, even from its allies, as interference. ""This for me is unacceptable,"" he said. Why Was He Ignored? **********The interview, one in a regular series with the popular daily, began with Mr. Gorbachev pressing the reporter on why the Russian press had ignored his trip in the United States. **********He contrasted this with the American press, saying: ""For two weeks, all the American press and the television stations covered the visit. I even had to give an interview in an elevator. At the end, members of Congress rose to greet Gorbachev, and to bid farewell."" **********Mr. Gorbachev said he took the Russian press's silent treatment as a sign of its obedience to the Russian Government. ""I can add that that the Russian Government directly made no small effort to undermine my visit both with the Congress and with the President of the U.S.A.,"" he said. ""Let's say that both the right-wing and the democratic press have been simply unloading on Gorbachev, trying to discredit me, to cause hate and venom against me in society."" **********His miffed tone indicated that Mr. Gorbachev, still hailed in the West, is not entirely reconciled to his new role in Russia, where his departure from the scene has gone unlamented."

That factory produces the midsize Camry model. **********Toyota will also export the components to Japan beginning in 1994. **********The plan was first reported in yesterday's issue of the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun. Toyota's Stengthening U.S. Ties **********""We hope this is the first of many orders,"" Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's vice president for procurement and supplier operations, said yesterday. Neither Mr. Stallkamp nor a Toyota official in the United States could estimate the value of the contract. **********The disclosure is just the latest sign of a strengthening relationship between Toyota and American suppliers. Last week, Toyota said it would operate an office in Lexington, Ky., where it would teach North American suppliers how to improve productivity and quality. **********Component contracts among competing auto makers are by no means unique. The 174 suppliers to Toyota's North American manufacturing arm include Ford Motor and General Motors. But the preliminary contract is the first agreement with Toyota by Chrysler's Acustar components division. **********The contract, however, is not the first such agreement between a Japanese manufacturer and Chrysler, which for many years has sold parts to Mitsubishi. **********Toyota had previously said that expected to buy as much as $3.8 billion in parts and materials annually by 1994, as well as import an additional $1.4 billion in parts and supplies in each subsequent year. Last year, it bought $2.8 billion in supplies from American companies. **********This year, the Georgetown plant will build roughly 240,000 Camrys. By 1994, the plant will be able to produce more than 400,000 vehicles. **********Toyota's pledge is part of a larger effort by Japanese auto makers to buy as much as $19 billion in American auto parts by 1994 and help sell an additional 19,700 American cars annually in Japan. **********The auto makers set the goal in the wake of tense meetings between auto executives in Japan in January, during President Bush's trade mission to East Asia. The executives met again in May in Oak Brook, Ill., for more cordial talks to establish working groups to stimulate the purchasing and distribution agreements."

But as the controver...",1775,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,A Nation's Recycling Law Puts Businesses on the Spot,A Nation's Recycling Law Puts Businesses on the Spot," **********When Germany became the first nation to require business and industry to collect and recycle the cans, bottles, cardboard, paper and plastic used to package their products, government officials hailed the move as a revolution. But as the controversial private recycling system that sprang up to meet that mandate gains momentum, Germans are finding that such pioneering change is neither cheap nor simple. **********The nation's new packaging law set up a process that began last December with the requirement that businesses take back and recycle packaging used in transporting their products, such as the crate containing a bicycle. On April 1, businesses became responsible for collecting and recycling all superfluous packaging, like the cardboard boxes for toothpaste tubes. By next Jan. 1, an average of 50 percent of all consumer-products packaging will have to be recycled; the law dictates higher percentages for glass and other easily recyclable materials and lower ones for plastic and composite materials.  The recycling average for all materials must rise to 80 percent by mid-1995. **********After a rough start, collection is going well and the amount being recycled is rising steadily. Although industry quickly passed its added costs on to consumers through higher prices, there has been little grumbling from the public because of its willingness to support environmental measures. **********But the actual recycling remains problematic. There are not enough plants for some materials, like plastics, and recycling them is often prohibitively expensive. For other materials, like beverage cartons combining aluminum, plastic and paper, no economically viable recycling process exists. While commercially successful recycling of glass and aluminum has been going on for years, low-quality paper and plastics are a problem because the market is already glutted. **********The German Government argues that industry will quickly address these problems because the new law demands it. But the law cannot dictate how the marketplace will react to the surging volume of recycled packaging materials. Some experts fear that rather than becoming a closed, self-sustaining circle, the German system will simply export packaging waste to other countries, disrupting their markets with oversupply. **********When the law was announced, most companies claimed it was unworkable. They changed their tune when Bonn said that unless they came up with a way of implementing the law, the Government would impose a deposit of 50 pfennigs (about 30 cents) on all packaging to promote its return. **********Faced with that, about 600 companies, from Coca-Cola G.m.b.H. and the chemical giant Bayer to small businesses, formed Duales System Deutschland, a private company that works with local governments to collect everything that can be recycled and pass it on to recyclers. It is already scrambling to keep up with the thousands of tons of trash Germans are dutifully tossing into the distinctive **********gelbe tonnen **********, or yellow bins, it provides to any household on demand. **********Most observers think the Duales System will work. Clemens Stroetmann, the State Secretary in the Environment Ministry, who played an important role in developing the law, has no doubts. ""It is working,"" he said. **********If he is right, the law could become a historic high-water mark, indicating where the tide of waste that has risen steadily during the industrial age finally began to ebb.  The law's creators see it as leading to the recycling or reusing of almost all Germany's manufactured products. Already auto makers like Volkswagen and Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, are taking back old vehicles for recycling. **********Given Germany's position as one of the world's leading export nations, the effects of such a revolution could be felt worldwide. A Belgian business whose main customer is in Germany must either adapt to the law or lose its client. Other industrial nations, including the United States, Japan and Germany's European neighbors, are watching closely to see if the law can be a model. France is already crafting similar legislation. **********Germany is Europe's leading waste producer, with 824.1 pounds per capita of household waste in 1987, the latest year for which statistics are available, according to the Federal Statistics Office. (The per-capita figure for the United States, in 1986, was 1,900.8 pounds, according to the United Nations.) **********Enter the Duales System, operating on an annual budget of $1.2 billion. So far, it has distributed its yellow bins to some 40 million people or about half of the German population. By the end of the year, it expects to be serving more than 90 percent. **********The yellow bins are emptied once every four weeks, free of charge. Products intended for the bins carry the Duales System's trademark green-dot recycling symbol; these products include packaging made of aluminum, paper, cardboard, plastic and composite materials like plastic-coated paper. All must be washed before being deposited. **********To get the green dot, packagers pay a fee from one cent to about $2 per product, according to its size and shape. They also must sign a contract with a company that guarantees it will recycle the used packaging. The cost is passed on to consumers as higher prices, averaging a few cents an item. **********""What we are doing is using the market economy to make the producer responsible for the product,"" said Mr. Stroetmann. ""But that also means the ecological price of the product is paid at the point of purchase by the consumer. But that is far outweighed by the long-term benefits for all."" **********International packaging-industry groups and some European Community officials have attacked the German law as a trade barrier that discriminates against foreign goods, and against some materials, particularly plastics. Sony, for example, does not want to pay to haul the materials in which it packs its electronic goods back to Japan. So it is forced to turn to the Duales System, since there is as yet no other company offering the necessary services. Plastic packaging companies, meanwhile, say the law favors glass and aluminum, which are more easily recycled. They claim it is much easier to incinerate materials like plastics to produce energy than to recycle them into new products. **********""Some French mineral water companies, Vittel and Evian, screamed terribly when we announced the law,"" Mr. Stroetmann said. They switched to more easily recyclable plastic and glass bottles ""without much fuss and haven't had any significant loss of market,"" he added. **********""We treat all companies, German and foreign, alike,"" he noted. **********A packaging law under consideration by the 12-nation European Community represents a more serious challenge to the German law because it would ban measures that distort or restrict competition or create barriers to trade in packaged products. The E.C. proposal, which would supersede the German law, sets lower targets, such as requiring member nations to recycle 60 percent of all used packaging materials within 10 years. **********Environmentalists in Germany and abroad contend the German law puts too much emphasis on recycling, rather than alternative packaging materials or reusable packaging. They also feel it puts too much of the financial burden on the consumer. **********""I don't think the packaging ordinance is really preventing anything; this way won't bring success in avoiding creation of packaging waste,"" said Klaus-Dieter Feige, a parliamentary deputy from the Green Party. ""The producers have to offer to work on this as well. They could use no composite materials, for example. But there is no sign of that. The reason is money. Under the current system, the citizens are paying all the costs."" **********But even critics like Mr. Feige concede the collection system is working in cities like Bonn, where 70 percent of households have a yellow bin. Of the 16,400 tons collected in Bonn so far this year, only 2 percent could not be recycled, said Cornel Jeuckens, a Duales System spokesman. **********But collection is the easy part. Sorting trash is a bottleneck that can be eliminated only by adding facilities and people. The Duales System has only 60 sorting plants, although 200 are planned to be in operation by 1995. It is also pressing industries to develop recycling plants and processes. ""The problem is that the plastics industry didn't invest anything in research and development of recycling,"" Mr. Jeuckens said. ""Now they have to catch up quickly."" **********That may not solve the problem. Mixed plastics containing hundreds of chemical compounds can be recycled only into bulky, extruded products where color and quality are low. In contrast, producing new plastic from crude oil remains far less expensive. **********Mr. Stroetmann thinks the problems will sort themselves out as the system is refined. And if the European Community or the United States comes up with a more efficient scheme, so much the better. If nothing else, Germany's packaging law has brought the subject of recycling to the fore in the industrialized world.A FAMILY THAT CONSERVES TOGETHER **********BONN **********For the von Wezyk family in the leafy Plittersdorf neighborhood here, Germany's new recycling law was less a revolution than a logical extension of their ecological beliefs. Like many Germans, they take an active interest in environmental matters and have been recycling glass, paper and batteries for years. In one corner of their yard is a compost heap where they put kitchen scraps. Now, just inside their front gate, is a large, canary-yellow recycling bin. **********The family doesn't mind paying slightly more for many products to finance the Duales System, the private recycling system created to meet business and industry's legal obligation to recycle packaging. **********""The system is reasonable,"" said Ludwig von Wezyk, a 38-year-old systems manager for Siemens A.G. ""I think most of us don't mind paying a few cents more for things as long as the system works. If it doesn't people will get upset."" **********Monika von Wezyk, 33, said ""you notice very fast that about 70 percent of what you throw out is packaging."" She also said ""the bin is very big, very ugly and they could have made it a nicer color."" **********But the von Wezyks use it, religiously. Their two children, have learned what items can go in the bin and that they have to be washed first. **********""The amount of packaging is crazy when you really look at it,"" Mr. von Wezyk said, as 4-year-old Daniel put a plastic cola bottle in the bin. ""Everyone wants convenience and luxury; no one wants to give it up. But we have to do things with more environmental consciousness. We have to consider the consequences."""

The economy remains so weak, however, that many still expect the Fed to lower interest rates after the election. **********Money managers said the falling value of the dollar and the nearness of the election most likely stayed the Fed's hand. ""It is traditional to the Fed's view not to operate before an election if they can avoid it,"" said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston and a former vice president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. **********The central bank's inaction helped the dollar gain sharply yesterday against foreign currencies, allowing bonds, in turn, to make up some of their recent losses. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32 , or more than 40 cents for each $1,000 in face value, to 9722/32 , for a yield of 7.44 percent. Dismal Economic Statistics **********A week ago, a series of dismal economic statistics and the prospect of Fed interest rate cuts had lowered the yield to about 7.31 percent. But that prospect also lessened the dollar's attractiveness to foreign investors. **********Many bond traders expected the Fed to ease after the release of September jobless figures last Friday. While marginally better than predicted, they still showed a loss of 57,000 jobs. With no evidence of action, they shrugged and then waited until Tuesday for a meeting of Fed policy makers. **********As Tuesday and Wednesday passed without the Fed giving interest rates a nudge, traders sharply reversed their direction, dumping the bonds they had enthusiastically stored up. **********Although the timing of Fed actions is not necessarily predictable, economists say that the most likely moments have passed. ""The failure to operate Tuesday, Wednesday and again today indicates that a majority of voting members don't favor any additional relaxation,"" said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter. **********What strategists saw yesterday, however, was an economic landscape that remained as bleak, with bond prices that looked like bargains. The Government's auction of seven-year notes on Wednesday had gone badly, with an average yield of 6.01 percent -- well above where these notes had traded on the when-issued market in the previous days. **********Buyers of these notes had cause to cheer yesterday, as the seven-year yield fell to 5.96 percent. The credit market had the most bounce at intermediate and shorter maturities, where interest rates are more directly affected by the Fed. **********""With the auction behind us, we did see some good retail buying,"" said John C. Spinello, a managing director trading Government securities at Merrill Lynch. **********The credit market continued volatile, tossed by every rumor of a report of a rumor. Prices received an early lift from rumors of imminent Fed easing, retreated as the rumors faded, then gained again as some investors saw the strengthening dollar and thought about the longer term. Declines in some European interest rates aided the value of the dollar and United States bonds. **********Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, was one of the few to say even on Monday that the Fed would not cut its rates. Then, and again yesterday, he cited currency market fears. **********""The desire to maintain stability in the foreign exchange markets after a period of extraordinary turmoil is the main current in the policy debate,"" he said yesterday. ""If a U.S. rate cut had kicked the dollar into a sharp decline, that would have had a detrimental impact on markets worldwide."" High European Rates **********High European interest rates, especially in Germany, and falling rates here have sapped the dollar's value. Mr. Crandall discounted reports that the Fed was delaying rate cuts only to coordinate its move with foreign central banks. **********With short-term interest rates already at 30-year lows, the Fed might want to leave themselves some room in case of a crisis. ""They might want to parse out their ammunition in case of a market break,"" Mr. Soss said, adding that the stock market's rebound from its plunge Monday morning removed the need to start firing now. **********Since Fed officials want to avoid the appearance of responding to political pressures, they will hold off acting until next month, he said. ""It's a matter of getting your candy later, but you're certainly going to get it,"" he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/business/the-executive-computer-where-does-the-600-pound-gorilla-write-data-bases.html,Peter Lewis,1992-04-05,,1176,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,The Executive Computer; Where Does the 600-Pound Gorilla Write Data Bases?,The Executive Computer; Where Does the 600-Pound Gorilla Write Data Bases?," **********The Microsoft Corporation has grown to be a billion-dollar company without any significant success in the data-base market. That could change suddenly now that this largest and most fearsome of software companies has proposed to acquire Fox Software Inc., maker of the highly regarded Foxpro data base manager for DOS, Macintosh and Unix computers. Foxpro is a fast and flashy ""clone"" of dBASE, the most popular data base management program among business users. **********Businesses use data base programs to store and retrieve information from employee records to sales reports to customer lists. More important, they use dBASE and Foxpro as a programming language to develop custom business applications. American companies have invested literally billions of dollars in developing dBASE applications for their data since dBASE appeared in 1981. **********In taking over Fox, a privately owned company in Perrysburg, Ohio, Microsoft is buying its way into the mainstream of this well-established data base developer community and finding another area in which it can go head-to-head with Borland International Inc. Last year, Borland entered the data base for programmers market by acquiring the Ashton-Tate Corporation, the original maker of dBASE. **********So suddenly, after a decade of relative calm, the PC data base world is going to be intensely active. Two of the world's biggest software companies are crossing swords, not only over dBASE but over the next generation of data base programs and programming languages. **********""None of this has anything to do with technology,"" said Adam Green, editor of the Boston-based Green Letter, a publication for dBASE, Foxpro and other so-called X-base developers. ""This deal is all about people and politics. It's about users. What they are going to do is fight over the dBase customer base."" **********It's also about money, of course. Borland and Microsoft are developing new data base programs that are expected to reach the market this year. Borland will have Paradox for Windows, a data base for people who are not programmers, and dBASE for Windows, for people who know the dBASE language. Microsoft will counter Paradox with a Windows product code-named Cirrus, and, for programmers, a Windows version of Foxpro. **********At stake are the hearts and dollars of the programmers who will be developing business applications in the 1990's. Data base programmers tend to make long-term commitments to a product, so each company wants these developers to make a commitment to its programs. **********Assuming the $173 million Fox acquisition goes through this summer as planned, Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., will plug the last major gap in its business application software family. It already has strong positions in spreadsheets, word processing, languages and, of course, the DOS and Windows operating systems. Microsoft has been developing its Windows program for several years, but Cirrus is not dBASE compatible. Other than a simple data base manager built into the Microsoft Works program, Microsoft has not been a factor in business data bases. **********Long the David to Microsoft's Goliath, Borland has a strong position in computer languages, spreadsheets and data bases. Indeed, in the latter it has become the Goliath, with an estimated 70 percent share of the market. **********""The Fox deal is a bigger negative for Borland than it is a big positive for Microsoft,"" said Betty J. Lyder, vice president of Montgomery Securities of San Francisco. ""In relative terms, data base products account for 50 percent of Borland's sales and are critical for revenue growth. Foxpro is important for Microsoft because it completes their product suite, but in terms of revenue, well, they can do $3.7 billion in fiscal '93, and data bases will be maybe $150 million of that."" **********""Once Foxpro for Windows starts shipping,"" Ms. Lyter said, ""Microsoft's share of the market goes from 10 to 30 to whatever, while Borland's goes from 70 to maybe 55 percent."" **********Wall Street analysts translated their fears for Borland's vulnerability into lower earnings projections, and Borland's stock fell sharply after the deal was announced. Trading at $70.25 on March 24, Borland stock fell to $63 the day after Microsoft's announcement, and it has since slipped into the $50's. Microsoft stock slipped $1 the day after the announcement, to $127.50, and has now fallen below $120 a share. (Both stocks are traded over the counter.) **********But Wayne Kernochan, senior analyst for the Yankee Group in Boston, had a different view. ""It is like crossed swords at Microsoft and Borland, and the only point at which the swords touch is the desktop data base,"" he said. ""It's not a strong negative for Borland, just one area where they have competiton. The bottom line is a potential bonus for the end user. There's more competition, and that can't be bad."" **********Borland executives were upbeat. ""This is great news, we think,"" said Philippe Kahn, chief executive of Borland. ""The data base market is now greatly simplified with only two players: Borland and Microsoft. We believe that all this activity will really stimulate the data base arena, and that is good news for Borland and Microsoft, and especially for users and developers."" **********Charles Stevens, general manager of Microsoft's data base products group, also played up the positive. ""Customers will benefit from more competition and innovation in the PC data base market,"" he said. **********All this good cheer and talk of customers aside, both companies acknowledge that there has been bad blood between them. **********""Borland loves a fight,"" said Heidi Sinclair, a Borland vice president. ""The company is psyched and focused. We know how to compete aginst Microsoft and love that Microsoft is the enemy."" Borland prevailed in programming languages, she said, ""and now we're going to do it again in data bases."" **********But Microsoft has a formidable weapon in Foxpro 2.0, the DOS data base manager it is acquiring. Fox has won many awards for its data base program; its problem was a lack of marketing and distribution clout. **********In Foxpro 2.0 ($795 suggested list price), Microsoft has a DOS data base product that has already captured the imaginations of many programmers with its speed and graphical development tools. It is much faster than Borland's latest dBASE IV version 1.5 (also $795). **********Microsoft is also the largest maker of business software for the Apple Macintosh. It has a Macintosh customer list of millions of users and can now offer them a data base product, Foxpro/Mac. Because Foxpro uses the same code base for its DOS, Windows, Macintosh and Unix programs, it will be appealing in companies that use many different kinds of machines. **********But all is not perfect. Judging from comments on electronic bulletin boards where they congregate, Foxpro users are afraid that Microsoft will not make the improvement of Foxpro a high priority. **********To this sort of concern, Mr. Stevens of Microsoft replies: ""The reason we bought Fox was that we have tremendous admiration for their development team, products and technology. The Foxpro development team is going to move to Redmond to join our data base group. We are absolutely committed to X-Base, absolutely and unequivocably behind X-Base."""

When the trades, apparently by a trader accompanied by two customers, were sold off soon thereafter, evidently at the order of board officials, prices rebounded to previous levels. **********Board of Trade officials, who said they were investigating the incident, said they had referred the matter to the United States Attorney's office and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But they provided few clues of their own, leaving traders buzzing over what had happened in their midst. **********In the pits where the trading is done at the board, guests on the floor are not unusual, as they come to observe the tumult that accompanies the commerce on the world's largest commodities exchange. The guests, who are often big customers, are called ""suits"" because their business suits are impossible to miss in the sea of colorful jackets that adorn the traders and distinguish them from each other. **********So the two suits on the floor with a trader at the opening of the exchange yesterday morning at 7:20 Chicago time created no surprise. But their actions did: The suits, who were apparently customers, ordered, and the trader executed, a series of improper trades of Treasury futures and options that by some accounts may have totaled as much as $2.5 billion -- huge by any standard. And they did it in the view of hundreds of brokers and traders. **********Futures and options are financial instruments that play a growing role in world financial markets. They are used by farmers or other businesses to hedge, or protect, against the risk of a price, like the price of oil or the value of the dollar, moving in a harmful direction. These financial vehicles are also used by speculators because they enable them to take huge positions in the market without putting up much money. **********Futures are agreements to buy or sell a commodity or a financial security in the future at a set price. Options give the trader or investor the right to buy or sell a commodity or financial security in the future at a set price but do not require that the transaction be completed. **********According to several traders who watched the transaction develop, the event had the slow-motion quality of a giant accident, with the trader acting on orders from his customer guests beside him on the trading floor. Such orders from the floor are not allowed because they might give customers there an edge over other customers. **********""The guy was standing next to him and the broker leaned over, and then the broker started executing orders,"" said one trader, referring to one guest. **********""He can't do that,"" the trader said he uttered to a colleague as he watched the orders flashed by the trader with the use of hand signals into the trading pits. **********The futures contract on the 30-year Treasury bond fell sharply at first because the improper trade was a combination of futures and options that equalled a huge sell order. **********Security guards and board officials, who were alerted by the size of the trades and, traders said, calls from the pits, arrived shortly and whisked the offenders off the floor. As of last evening, the trader and his guests were still being questioned at the board, officials there said. **********In a statement issued last night, the board did not confirm or deny what occurred on the trading floor. It did say: ""We do not tolerate any improprieties in our markets, and when questions arise, we take quick action to investigate whether any of our rules and regulations have been violated. That was certainly true in this case."" **********That the Chicago Board also notified regulators, reflected a certain vigilance, possibly strengthened by the memory of the Government charges in 1989 of trading fraud in the pits at the board and its neighbor, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The charges led to some guilty pleas and the convictions of several soybean traders. **********For all the witnesses to the transaction, few facts were available about the actual trades, although accounts of what traders saw were being passed around all day. While few accounts named the trader, he was said to be backed by Stern & Company, a Chicago trading and clearing firm. **********No executive from Stern & Company returned telephone calls seeking comment. It has been a member of the Board of Trade since 1970 and its founder, Lee B. Stern, has been a member since 1949. **********Late in the day, Dean Witter Reynolds said that it had assisted in the unwinding -- or the reversal -- of the trade, leaving many to guess at the losses taken in the process. Traders estimated $10 million, but no one really knows. Several traders also speculated that local traders in the pits made millions as the improper trades were unwound because they knew what was going to happen. **********Traders calculated that if about 12,000 futures contracts, with a value of $100,000 each were sold, as the market rebounded, each 1/32 tick in price meant a loss of about $375,000. Within half an hour, the price of the 30-year bond future rebounded half a point -- or 16 ticks -- and then climbed for the rest of the day. **********Some traders expressed surprise that the rule against accepting floor orders was broken, since the customers could have gone off the floor, called in their orders and made the same trades legally. **********The other surprise to some traders was that anyone would be willing to place such a big bet that the Treasury market was going to continue to fall and fall very sharply -- and that interest rates would continue to rise. ""He was selling with both arms,"" said one trader. **********There was also speculation that the trader might have gotten the trade wrong, because it involved both the buying of options and the selling of futures."

As the third of five contingents of rebel soldiers turned in its weapons today and on Friday, the Government began handing out farmland to former combatants. **********In the capital, however, senior United Nations officials were scrambling in a second day of meetings with the two sides to avert a breakdown in the peace plan. The agreement was a result of long and difficult negotiations brokered by the United Nations to end El Salvador's 12-year civil war between American-backed Government forces and the five groups of rebels that make up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. President's Stand at Issue **********Diplomats said the officials were trying primarily to soften the stance of President Alfredo Cristiani, who announced Wednesday night that he would delay Government troop reductions and a sensitive purge of military officers called for under the agreements until the insurgents had fully disarmed. Mr. Cristiani suspended his military actions under the accords in an angry response to a United Nations plan that postponed the rebels' final disarmament from today until Dec. 15. **********Before their meetings began the United Nations officials expressed confidence that the situation might soon be resolved. **********""The President did not say he was not going to do those things,"" said Under Secretary General Marrack Goulding of the United Nations. ""He said he was going to change the timing for doing those things. That's what we are going to talk to him about."" **********But other diplomats and military experts predicted that it would be extremely difficult to reconcile the Government's demand for as much as another year to move military officials in compliance with the plan and the guerrillas' insistence on a delay of no more than a few months. **********A panel created under the accords to purge the officers it found to have been abusive, undemocratic or corrupt has ordered the removal of more than 70 and the transfer of more than 40, people familiar with its still-secret report say. Both the Defense Minister, Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce, and his deputy, Gen. Juan Orlando Zepeda, are named in the report, these people say.  U.S. Official in Warning **********Under a new schedule for completing provisions of the peace agreements, the purge was to conclude by Dec. 15. Three of the five senior rebel commanders, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said they would not press for compliance with that schedule out of concern that the actions ultimately be carried out. But they said they would not allow Mr. Cristiani to take more than another two or three months. **********After threats against rebel leaders, United Nations officials and journalists were issued here in the name of a right-wing death squad, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, issued a blunt warning on Friday. **********""All of these people should be under no illusions about the consequences of such an action,"" Mr. Aronson said in a television interview beamed by satellite to El Salvador. ""The United States and the international community will use every possible law enforcement tool and investigator tool to capture and fully prosecute anyone who commits violence against the peace process."" **********As the most difficult steps under the settlement come due, leaders on both sides have seemed to use sharp public criticism of their adversaries to reassure their own supporters. Accordingly, United Nations officials have sought to focus attention less on what the parties say than what they do. **********On Friday in the mountain village of Guarjila, 40 miles north of the capital, one of the five senior guerrilla commanders, known by the nom de guerre Ferman Cienfuegos, spoke angrily to his troops about Mr. Cristiani's ""warlike attitude"" and the Government's failure to meet its commitment.  'War Doesn't Make Sense' **********When he was finished, about 150 rebel fighters turned in their weapons to United Nations peacekeeping forces. Another 200 or so sometime combatants were also demobilized, receiving certificates that ushered them back into civilian life. **********""We cannot say that this is all over,"" said Jose Ramon, a 26-years-old rebel soldier, referring to the struggle of the insurgents. ""But in this country, war doesn't make sense anymore."" **********Along with scores of full-time combatants like Mr. Morales, a veteran of the entire 12-year war, the rebels demobilized at Guarjila included two dozen peasant girls in skirts and T-shirts, several older men in cowboy hats and a few peasant matrons wearing aprons. **********United Nations military officials said the 1,600 or so rebels disarmed on Friday and today included fewer women, children and older men than had the first two contingents. But the motley character of the group still reflected the decision of rebel leaders to save their best fighters for the last. **********In what rebel officials described as an action to pressure the Government to comply with the accords, over 15,000 people marched through the capital."

In the next vehicle, an 860-pound lemon-yellow tricycle-car made from Kevlar and electrical tape and called The Flash, James D. Worden, who built both cars, was giving Miss Warden hand signals. **********Mr. Worden is a 25-year-old mechanical engineer who lives and breathes electric cars and founded the Solectrica Corporation of Arlington, Mass., to design and make them. Gesturing to Miss Warden, a distant cousin, he held up his hand, palm facing forward. He slowly lowered his fingers until his hand was parallel with the ground. ""Floor it,"" he mouthed. The light turned green and she pulled away. ""Bye,"" he waved. **********The Force started without engine vibration or roar, and, of course, there was no cloud of exhaust behind. But the transmission, which includes a motorcycle chain, made a sound like a small animal being tortured. It picked up speed and sounded like two small animals being tortured. Miss Warden followed instructions, and as the hill went on, strained to keep the accelerator pedal -- don't use the word ""gas"" -- on the floor. ""You can build up your calves this way,"" she said to her two passengers: this reporter and Taylor Kopec, a 14-year-old freshman at the Ethel Walker School, a nearby prep school with its own entry, Sundancer. **********The passengers were a compromise. Cars entered in the race's commuter category must carry passengers, and Ethel Walker students were in demand, because the rules require that passengers weigh at least 60 kilograms, or about 132 pounds, and few drivers wanted to carry anyone heavier, including this reporter, who tipped the race organizer's scale at 90 kilos, or nearly 200 pounds. But the race co-director, Robert H. Wills, told Miss Warden that if she took me she could take Taylor, who weighs 120 pounds. **********It was Day 3 of the Tour de Sol, the Albany-to-Boston race for electric and solar-electric cars, with 39 entries this time, up from four in the first running four years ago, and the competition is getting tougher, a trend that pleases the organizer, the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association of Greenfield, Mass. ""We're pushing the technology, and the drivers learn a lot about their vehicles from the stress we put them under,"" said Dr. Wills, an electrical engineer. **********Wednesday morning's leg, from the Avon Old Farms hotel here to Bushnell State Park in the center of Hartford, is about 13 miles, most of it on four-lane state highways. It would be an easy trip even for these vehicles, most hand-built by engineers, hobbyists and students, except that it starts with Avon Mountain, a 450-foot-high ridge that separates the Farmington River Valley from the Hartford River Valley and is so steep that the police routinely close the road when it snows. **********But The Force, a converted Geo Metro, is optimized for traveling below 40 miles an hour. Race organizers lined up the vehicles in order of their position after two days of racing, and ahead of The Force is another of Mr. Worden's entries, The Force GT, also a Geo Metro, but with a slightly different motor and gear combination, designed for higher speeds but gentler grades. **********The Flash will go far faster than either, but is not built for grades. There will be several prizes when the race is over, and one of them is for this hill. In a strategy session the previous night, while the team tinkered with its cars as all the entries were plugged into a charging station like piglets around a sow, Mr. Worden figured that here was a chance to grab a trophy, even if the hill drained so much from the batteries that The Force had to limp over the rest of the route. **********Most of the cars are equipped with dials or digital meters that show current flow out of the battery, and most drivers lighten up on the accelerators to hold the flow to a certain level. Coming through the foothills of the Berkshire mountains the previous day, some had done quick calculations to match the current flow against the remaining distance. But Mr. Worden was so optimistic about the trip to Hartford that Miss Warden had even been given permission to use the car's radio. **********Strategy in driving an electric vehicle takes several forms. The Tour de Sol is run on public roads, and drivers are supposed to obey traffic signals and speed limits. Red lights and stop signs are a kind of energy tax for electrics, especially if not handled right. But nearly all of them have regenerative braking, meaning that they can convert the momentum of the car back into electricity for storage in the battery. So if the stop sign is visible ahead or the driver anticipates that the light will be red, the strategy is to let up on the accelerator and reverse the role of the electric motor, making it turn motion into electricity instead of the other way around. **********Strategy in this race gets even more complicated, because cars that cross the finish line with substantial charge left in the batteries are allowed to take extra laps, for credit, at the rate of 1 minute deducted from their time for each mile they travel. In theory, a car could violate Newtonian physics and arrive before it left. Conversely, those that break down and have to be towed are charged one hour, plus 20 minutes a mile. So in the second leg, from Torrington to Avon, Sundancer had an official time of 18 hours and The Force, 1 hour and 3 minutes, although neither quite reflected reality. **********Today, however, The Force was going to go on display at the end of the day, with no time for laps, so Miss Warden's object was to burn every bit of available energy. The Aztec, an M.I.T. entry, would not run fast enough to leave time for laps at the end of the day, its drivers had discovered. So they too tried to burn all their energy on the road. **********Sundancer, meanwhile, had a transmission designed for either a lighter vehicle or a flatter course. Lee Zalinger, the physics teacher who built it with 35 students, wanted to give up, but Mr. Worden, who had supplied some of the parts for Sundancer, insisted that it could be fixed. ""He's impossible to say no to,"" Mr. Zalinger said. Ordinarily, the racers have a curfew, 9 P.M. to 5 A.M., but Mr. Worden had spent most of the night with his competitors, regearing their car. To great cheers of students gathered on the sidelines, Sundancer cleared the hill. **********By this time, however, Miss Warden had passed the race official with the stopwatch and the clipboard at the crest, 450 feet above the starting point, and was cruising down the other side, amp meter running backwards as the car turned its potential energy back into electricity in the batteries. She gunned it at the bottom, where Route 44 enters West Hartford, to clear a traffic light and snaked through Bishop's Corner onto North Main Street, an intersection race officials had told the drivers, with a touch of irony, was marked with three gasoline stations. **********Then at a traffic light, a white-haired woman in a powder blue jogging suit tapped on the window. ""Is it for sale or are you just driving it?"" she asked. Miss Warden said Solectria, the company of which her cousin is chairman and research director, was happy to sell them. Miss Warden handed her a glossy leaflet describing the car, which has a price tag of $19,000 to $26,000, depending on equipment. The company has sold 15 since October and has orders for two more. **********For everyday driving, a car like The Force has a top speed of 60 miles an hour and a range of 60 miles between charges. Recharging takes eight hours, and the car can be purchased with a roof-mounted solar panel for supplementary charging. **********Arrival at Bushnell park was delayed by about four minutes when the car had to stop for two school buses unloading children who had come to see the cars. Trip time was 27 minutes, 15 seconds, which would have been respectable in a gasoline-powered car. **********Energy consumed, according to the Radio Shack digital meter on the dashboard, was 12.27 amp-hours, leaving plenty for the afternoon lap out to Storrs. And The Force, when calculations were complete, turned out to be third up the hill, behind Sungo, an entry from the New Hampshire Technical Institute, of Concord, N.H., and The Force GT. **********On Friday, from the finish line in Brookline, Mass., race officials said The Force had come in second in its category, covering 289.5 miles in an adjusted time of 5:59:41. First in the category was The Flash. The Force GT placed first in a different category."

""The global economy respects no borders and these companies are all becoming extensions of one another. It's truly the arrival of the global economic web."" **********In the 1980's, the belief that America was in danger of losing its independent ability to manufacture the most modern computer chips raised great alarm and was the driving force behind the creation of Sematech, a United States Government and industry consortium to develop basic chip-making technology. **********I.B.M. was a leading backer of the effort to create Sematech and also helped support U.S. Memories Inc., a private joint venture of American companies to make memory chips. The company failed in 1990. **********It was also in the 1980's that I.B.M. -- fearful of the growing power of the Japanese -- sought a link with Siemens. The two companies currently manufacture small memory chips at a factory in France and develop larger chips. **********More recently, several changes in the international climate have altered American and European executives' perceptions of the Japanese. **********First, the collapse of the Japanese stock market has limited Japan's access to the huge amounts of capital necessary to build advanced semiconductors. Moreover, several other nations in Asia have entered the semiconductor market, putting added pressure on the Japanese. **********""The costs and risks of developing these chips have become enormous,"" said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute. ""Toshiba has just lost too much money in the memory market. Even the Japanese are feeling the heat."" **********Starting in 1986, I.B.M. had agreed to make display screens for portable and other types of computers for Toshiba. But the agreement to be announced this morning goes much further, representing a commitment to a technology that is likely to be dominant when it becomes available in six to eight years. **********The new chips that will be developed will be able to store 256 million bits of data each, roughly equivalent to 10,000 pages of typed text. That huge capacity is expected to let computer scientists achieve breakthroughs in areas including computer speech recognition, machine vision and computer reasoning. **********The new partnership reflects, in part, the huge cost of developing each generation of memory chips, which are the backbone not only of the computer industry, but also of an increasingly wide variety of consumer products, including televisions, telephones, microwave ovens and video cameras. **********I.B.M. officials say that because of the sophisticated technology needed to make chips, it costs $500 million to build a manufacturing plant capable of making today's most advanced kinds, which can store 16 million bits of information. By the end of the decade, the cost is expected to rise to $1 billion. **********The alliance of I.B.M., Toshiba and Siemens also suggests a fundamental shift in the battle to control the global computer industry, a struggle that has pitted the world's most powerful companies and governments in the last decade. **********""I think that in the past a number of us exaggerated the rate at which the Japanese would continue to progress in controlling semiconductor equipment and process technology and exaggerated the consequences of controlling the semiconductor market,"" said Charles H. Ferguson, an industry consultant and an Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher. **********I.B.M. suffered its worst financial year ever last year and in December embarked on a radical companywide decentralization, freeing its independent businesses to compete more aggressively and to strike deals with other companies. **********In the past, I.B.M. used its semiconductor design and manufacturing ability largely to supply its own needs, but I.B.M. executives have said recently that the computer maker is eager to expand the role of its semiconductor business and to compete with companies that sell their chips on the open market. **********Professor Reich said that as recently as two years ago, he had conversations with European manufacturers, including Siemens, in which executives of those companies talked about joining with United States manufacturers because they feared the Japanese. **********Significantly, the joint development agreement will not involve X-ray lithography, a chipmaking technology in which I.B.M. has a huge investment. **********Until recently, most semiconductor designers believed that it would be necessary to shift from visible light to X-rays to etch the incredibly fine circuit lines of the most advanced memory chips beyond 16 million bits. In the last two years technology advances in the use of ultraviolet light and related techniques have extended the limits of optical lithography. **********Now many semiconductor engineers believe that it will be possible to use ultraviolet light to etch circuits as fine as 25-hundredths of a micron (a human hair is about 75 microns wide), the width necessary to build 256-million-bit chips. **********Several industry executives and policy analysts said that the decision to carry out the research project at an I.B.M. development plant was a victory both for the computer maker and for the United States. In the past, other key development projects between the companies have been carried out in Japan and France. **********Indeed, the most important point, Professor Reich said, is that the development effort will take place in East Fishkill. **********""That has enormous significance for Americans,"" he said."

""There is a campaign under way now to educate donors to Islamic causes, which says: 'we are all for giving money to support Islam, but kindly do not give it to these guys.' ""  Anti-Saudi Feelings **********Throughout much of the 1980's, the Saudi Government approved of the private help and buttressed it with direct Government aid to Muslim movements in the Arab world and Muslim communities elsewhere in Western Europe and Africa. **********The Saudis were convinced that support of Islamic movements abroad would create natural allies of the deeply conservative Saudi regime and form a bulwark against leftist and Arab nationalist governments that were adversaries of Saudi Arabia. **********But in the Persian Gulf crisis a year ago, the Saudis were shocked to find how deeply anti-Saudi some Islamic movements were, including Jordan's Islamic Brotherhood and Tunisia's Al Nahda party. **********Most Islamic movements in the Arab world, from Morocco to Egypt, supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and Baghdad's call for the overthrow of the Saudi royal family. As outlets for the repressed, largely poor Arab masses, the Islamic movements share a deep antipathy toward wealthy gulf Arabs. Funds Hard to Track **********Some, like Sudan's Islamic Front, are moving to establish ties with Saudi Arabia's fundamentalist extremists, who are a growing source of concern here. As in other Arab countries, politicized Islam is finding its way to Saudi Arabia and is being adopted as a means of expression by forces that for various reasons feel excluded by the country's economic and social development. **********The Saudi campaign's prospects for success are uncertain. In a country where millionaires and billionaires abound, it is extremely difficult to track funds. In addition, fundamentalism in its purest, most devout sense is still a venerable cause, one officially endorsed by the Saudi state and Government as the country's only political creed. **********The French magazine Paris Match recently published a photocopy of a $1 million dollar check written several years ago by a Saudi businessman, Youssef Jamil, and made out to Abassi Madani, leader of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria. Mr. Madani has been jailed by Algerian authorities since July, and suppression of his movement has been stepped up since it came close to winning power in elections in December. **********Diplomats said the contribution to Mr. Madani was modest compared with the sums that other, far wealthier Saudis have paid out to various radical Islamic movements. No Exchange Controls **********""The problem is that many leaders and activists in these Muslim movements, when they come here for pilgrimage, make the rounds asking for money to build schools and hospitals back home in Algeria, Jordan, Egypt or wherever,"" said a Saudi official who insisted on not being identified. **********""Most Saudis are pious and observent Muslims and wealthy Saudis are no exception, believing in charitable causes,"" the official said. ""They give money for what they believe to be good and commendable reasons, but the money finds its way elsewhere."" **********Other Saudis said that controlling the process is virtually impossible. There are no exchange controls in Saudi Arabia, and people, including expatriate workers here, are free to transfer as much money as they wish to any place in the world. In addition, billions of dollars in private deposits are kept by Saudis abroad and are impossible to control or monitor. **********The Government's new attitude toward private donations coincides with a far more restrictive attitude toward foreign aid.  'Turning Their Right Pocket' **********Gone are the days when the Saudis would respond to intimidation by writing checks to Iraq -- which received $ 26 billion in Saudi grants from 1980 until the gulf crisis -- or the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********""Some of our officials who opposed this policy used joke that the Arabs of the gulf region, when hit on the left cheek, turned their right pocket,"" said a senior official in the military establishment. ""This isn't happening anymore. This era is over for good."" **********Saudi Arabia has for example suspended financial aid to the P.L.O., Jordan, the Sudan, Yemen, and to some extent to Algeria and Tunisia, countries whose Governments openly supported, or sympathized, with Iraq in the gulf crisis. **********Even aid to friendly countries and Arab allies, like Egypt, has now been channelled to specific projects and in smaller amounts.Saudi Arabia's vast financial reserves -- $40 billlion to $50 billion before the gulf crisis -- have been drained by the war, which cost this country at least $65 billion, according to official figures."

The move was meant to bolster the credibility of the nation's inflation-fighting efforts without choking off economic recovery in Europe or irking trading partners. **********By lifting the German discount rate to its highest level since 1931, but leaving the more important short-term Lombard rate unchanged, the Bundesbank appeared to heed in part calls from other industrial nations for it to refrain from drastic monetary tightening. **********The Bundesbank's policy-setting central bank council raised the discount rate, effective Friday, to 8.75 percent from 8 percent, after an unusually long meeting today, which was attended by Jurgen Mollemann, the German Economics Minister. But the council left the Lombard rate unchanged at 9.75 percent. Both rates were previously changed on Dec. 19, when they were each raised by a half percentage point. **********""With this measure the Bundesbank aims to stem price pressures, monetary growth and excessive growth in credit volume and also to strengthen confidence in maintaining the stability of the mark under the currently difficult situation in unified Germany,"" the central bank said in a statement. **********The German move did not set off a concerted round of rate increases throughout Europe as some experts had feared. Although the Italian, Dutch, Belgian and Austrian central banks quickly followed by raising some of their key interest rates, the British, French, Swiss and Danish central banks announced they would not lift their rates. **********The German action is likely to draw fire from the Bush Administration, which urged Germany at the Munich summit meeting earlier this month to lower interest rates as a means of spurring more rapid European economic growth. **********However, higher German interest rates are likely to serve one of Washington's ulterior goals by further weakening the dollar against other major currencies, thus making United States products more price-competitive abroad and possibly stimulating the economy. **********The Treasury Department declined to respond to the Bundesbank's move. While Treasury officials are eager for Germany to lower its interest rates, they have refrained from criticizing the Bundesbank in recent months because they understand that restrictive monetary policies are a natural response to the nation's huge budget deficit and worse-than-usual inflationary pressures. **********""I would point out that market rates in Germany had already gone up a lot,"" said an Administration official. ""This just closed some of the gap between the official rate and the market rate."" **********Last April, American officials got into an angry spat with Bonn when they urged Germany to rein in its budget deficit. At the economic summit meeting in Munich, however, American officials said they were pleased that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had pledged to place a cap on spending over the next few years to help reduce the deficit. **********American officials say they fear that Germany's high interest rates are pushing up rates throughout Europe, will slow Europe's growth and will ultimately reduce the flow of American exports to Europe.Didn't Move Markets **********The dollar dipped briefly lower on the European foreign-exchange market around the time the German increase was announced. But currency traders said that decline was caused primarily by the almost simultaneous release of data showing that United States housing starts fell by an unexpectedly steep 3.2 percent in June. **********""The Bundesbank's increase did not really move the markets,"" said Dieter Wermuth, the managing director of Caisse des Depots et Consignations G.m.b.H. in Frankfurt. ""It's really a symbolic gesture designed to strengthen their credibility. The restrictive monetary policy they have been following for months is just now bearing fruit. German inflation will be lower in July and the money supply growth will begin to slow later in the year. Everyone is aware of that. This shows they are not letting up."" **********Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, said at a news conference that the discount rate increase was necessary because Germany's money supply growth was much too strong and inflation too high. But he said he did not expect the increase to lead to slower German economic growth. Western German inflation is running at a 4.3 percent annual rate, while inflation in eastern Germany is about 6.5 percent. **********Germany's M-3 money supply has been growing at double the aimed-for rate for most of this year, driven higher by the costs of unification, heavy borrowing by German banks to meet demand for credit and the use of the Deutsche mark as a second currency in many eastern European nations, where local currencies are still viewed with suspicion. **********The German M-3, including cash in circulation and time deposits under four years, grew in May at a 9 percent annual rate, well beyond the Bundesbank's 1992 target range of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent growth. **********""I am not sure the Bundesbank's increase really accomplishes much,"" said A. Gary Shilling, the head of an economic consulting and investment advisory firm that bears his name. ""It looks like they felt something had to be done to limit borrowing by the banks, so they sent a shot across their bows. But they were under intense international pressure not to take any drastic action, like raising the Lombard rate."" **********Mr. Mollemann is believed to have forcefully argued the Bonn Government's case at today's meeting, telling the central bankers that any substanial tightening of German monetary policy would risk alienating Germany's main trading partners and could undermine both the global recovery and the efforts to rebuild eastern Germany's economy. The Bundesbank, like the United States Federal Reserve, is politically independent. **********Despite the gaping divergence between United States and German interest rates -- the Federal Reserve's discount rate was recently cut to 3 percent while the Federal funds rate is 3.25 percent -- economists said they did not see any basic policy disputes between the two institutions. **********""I think the Fed and most other central banks believe what the Germans are doing is right,"" said J. Paul Horne, an economist with Smith Barney International in Paris. ""The European central banks have long accepted that the Deutsche mark is the anchor of their monetary policies. And if growth doesn't pick up, it is always very convenient to blame the slow recovery on the Germans."""

Many of them have been losing market share to companies that are larger or have higher financial ratings. The companies announced their merger in December and were waiting for State Insurance Department approval. **********The merger, of the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, and Home Life Insurance of New York City, comes at a time of turmoil for mutual insurers, which are owned by their policyholders. **********By merging operations to save $70 million a year, the companies' leaders say they hope to reassure regulators and the public about their financial strength. But some critics question whether merging companies struggling with weak commercial real estate portfolios and wary consumers might just create larger companies with bigger problems. **********""From the policyholders' perspective, this is definitely going to reduce costs,"" Terence Lennon, the chief examiner of the State Insurance Department, said. ""This industry became stressed in the 1980's, and now companies are going to have to compete on the basis of cost as they never have before. This shows other companies that a merger can be done."" **********Following another unusual strategy for dealing with mutual insurers' problems, New York is supervising the transformation of the third-largest mutual, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, into a stock company. Equitable is expected to make its initial public offering next month. **********John Gummere, the chairman and chief executive of the Phoenix, and William B. Wallace, the chairman and chief executive of Home Life, said in interviews yesterday that they expected major savings from the reduction of the two companies' work forces of 2,450 to 1,667 by the end of next year, and from the combining of their three computer centers into one. The cost reductions, they said, will eventually result in higher dividends for policyholders and more competitive insurance policies. **********""It will let us build capital, and it will directly benefit our policyholders,"" Mr. Gummere said. **********As one example of the many difficulties the companies faced in getting regulators to approve the deal, they had to agree to make New York the new company's legal home, but also had to agree to give Connecticut most of its jobs. New York's Insurance Department, which is large and considered more aggressive than those of most other states, wanted to maintain regulatory control over the company to protect policyholders. Mr. Gummere said Connecticut officials, including Gov. Lowell P.

Courtis, chief economist and strategist for Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Tokyo. He said Japan's exports could exceed imports this year by $135 billion, well above the levels that followed the 1985 Plaza accord, under which the industrial partners agreed to raise the yen's value sharply to reduce Japan's trade imbalance. Plan for Public Spending **********In Munich, the Japanese Government is expected to tell its counterparts about a new plan to stimulate its economy by increasing public spending by $47 billion or more later this year, which could increase imports. But economists say -- and Japanese officials concede -- that such measures will make only a small dent in the trade imbalance. They say more fundamental changes are needed: Japanese consumers must spend more and the Government must open its markets wider to foreigners. **********Japanese officials say the recent rise in the trade surplus is a result of worldwide economic forces, not specific trade practices. In the late 1980's, while Japan's economy boomed, imports of everything from German cars to French wine and American lumber rose sharply. **********But with the collapse of Japan's speculative bubble economy, imports have started to fall. That decline results in part from the fact that the prices of raw materials that Japan imports, particularly oil, have gone down. Meanwhile, prices of products that Japan exports have gone up, in part because Japan has shifted to making more expensive cars. **********""This is essentially a price-generated change,"" said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist for Salomon Brothers in Asia. He said that the balance of the volume of Japan's imports and exports had not changed much for three years. **********In addition, a new fear is arising that Japan is no longer recycling its surplus to help other nations. **********In the 1980's, Japan used the money it generated from trade to make long-term investments overseas in stocks, bonds, real estate and new factories. Such investment, while sometimes controversial, helped other countries to grow. But in the last year, Japanese companies, having been stung by unwise investments abroad and facing a recession at home, have sharply cut back on these investments. Now, more foreign capital is flowing into Japan than Japanese capital is going out, as foreigners rebuild their positions in Japanese assets. **********Some economists say that unless Japan begins recycling the huge surplus, the world could face a shortage of capital. That could drive up interest rates, perhaps lengthening the current worldwide recession. **********""For Japan, it is very important to recycle the capital that can serve the rest of the world,"" said Makoto Utsumi, a former vice minister for international affairs who is now an adviser to Japan's Ministry of Finance. Japanese investors, he said, have become afraid to take risks. ""The Government should do something to mobilize this money,"" he said. Defending Its Position **********The situation is potentially embarrassing to Japan because the nation has often defended its trade surplus as being a means of accumulating savings for the rest of the world to use. Such an argument is now harder to make. **********But some economists say Japan's importing of long-term capital has not been a problem and will not become one. Instead of long-term investments, Japan is making short-term investments like sending money to foreign banks. Those banks could then make long-term investments, indirectly recycling the trade surplus. **********Japan's surplus jumped more than 60 percent in 1991, to a record $103 billion, and it is heading even higher this year. Its surplus with the United States, $38.2 billion last year, is still significantly lower than it was a few years earlier, but it has started to move up again after years of decline. **********Indeed, in May, Japan's overall trade surplus nearly doubled from the level of a year earlier, while the surplus with the United States jumped more than 50 percent. This is threatening to make Japan's trade practices, and the American response, a leading issue in the Presidential election campaign. **********The Bush Administration, hoping to prevent worsening relations with Japan, recently tried to play down Japan's trade problems, particularly in meetings this week in Washington between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan. The United States has pushed Japan, however, to stimulate its economy to spur spending and imports. **********""The point is not to regard this as a bilateral problem,"" Michael Armacost, the United States Ambassador to Japan, said last week. ""The sluggishness of the world economy affects everybody."" **********But in a sense, Japan's trade surplus is actually a multilateral rather than bilateral problem. After sharp increases in recent years, Japan's surpluses with the rest of Asia and with Europe are now roughly the same size as its predictably large surplus with the United States. **********Just this week, South Korea and Japan signed an agreement aimed at alleviating the Korean deficit with Japan, which has more than doubled since 1989. The deficit with Japan accounts for 90 percent of the deficit of South Korea, a nation that can normally compete quite well in overseas markets. Fewer Goods From Europe **********Japan's trade imbalance with the European Community jumped nearly 50 percent in 1991, to $27.4 billion. Japan's imports from Europe tend to be luxury items like BMW automobiles, French perfume and Scotch whisky, and such imports dropped sharply as stock and real estate prices here suffered a steep decline. **********The surplus with fast-growing countries in southern and eastern Asia grew about 33 percent, to $37.4 billion. A main reason for this is that these nations, which are trying to build up their technology bases, are importing components and sophisticated factory machinery from Japan. **********At the same time, many Japanese companies have shifted some manufacturing to Southeast Asia. Those shifts are an important reason Japan's deficit with the United States is lower than it was five years ago -- more Japanese products are coming into the United States from other parts of Asia. **********Economists say that the Japanese Government's plan to increase public spending, which has not been made final, will not do much to reduce the trade surplus. **********Naoyuki Haraoka, director of the international trade research office in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said his personal estimate, not that of his agency, was that the envisioned spending package might raise imports by $10 billion to $12 billion. ""That is not substantial, compared to $100 billion,"" he said. **********Some economists think the surplus will bring about more pressure for a rise in the value of the yen, which would tend to make Japan's exports more expensive in other countries and make foreign products cheaper for the Japanese. The yen has already strengthened recently to about 124 to the dollar. But there are doubts that any movement of the yen will make much difference, since Japan was able to adjust for the roughly doubling of the yen's value that resulted from the 1985 Plaza agreement. **********Dr. Courtis of Deutsche Bank says the surplus will defy shrinkage. He says that the investments made during Japan's economic boom in new factories and in research and development, and the competitive lift it has provided, will carry the Japanese through the next few years. ""There's no fundamental reversal going to occur,"" he said. **********Some scholars also contend that the nature of trade has changed as companies have spread operations around the globe. A significant portion of trade is now intra-company, as when Toyota in Japan ships parts to the Toyota factory in Kentucky. Under this reasoning, the balance of trade will not change much until American and European companies make similar levels of direct investment in Japan. **********In the long run, Japan's surplus might diminish if the nation consumes more, but such societal shifts are slow in coming. **********Falling real estate prices might reduce how much people have to save to buy a house. But one way to reduce land prices would be to take farms out of production, which might not sit well with Japan's politically powerful farmers. Shorter working hours, another Government goal, would give the Japanese more time to spend their money. But that might require allowing more foreign workers into the country, a policy that many Japanese oppose. **********Japanese officials are fond of pointing out that the trade involves two or more countries and that the United States and other nations need to become more competitive to cut their deficits. ""Japan alone cannot resolve the problem,"" Mr. Utsumi said."

They add that politically, Afghanistan is slipping steadily toward the anarchy that plagues famine-ravaged Somalia. **********""What bothers those of us working for Afghanistan is that the whole country is becoming a major human tragedy, but it is completely forgotten,"" said Ekrem Beirerdinc, Unicef's director for the country, who has been in the United States for meetings at the United Nations to discuss the problems. **********He said that while the world was watching the bombardment of Sarajevo in late August, 3,000 people in Kabul died within 24 hours in a rocket bombardment. About 600,000 to 700,000 people have been driven from the city in recent months. Since June, Mr. Beirerdinc said in an interview last week, he has not been able to use Unicef's office in the Afghan capital and has been forced to work from Pakistan. Aid Agencies Cut Back **********Other international agencies and private organizations have curtailed operations in Afghanistan after attacks on their centers and the looting of equipment and supplies. **********""The situation is quite similar to Somalia,"" said Barnett R. Rubin, an associate professor of political science at Columbia University and head of its Center for the Study of Central Asia. ""There are large numbers of armed men in a variety of groups representing political parties or ethnic or tribal affiliations."" **********""Over the last decade, they have been hyper-armed, mainly because of the cold war but also because of competition for influence between Saudi Arabia and Iran,"" said Mr. Rubin, who recently returned from the region. ""There is no central political authority."" **********""As in Somalia, armed groups are fighting over power and food,"" he said in an interview. ""You can't have food unless you have power, and you can't keep power unless you can feed your followers."" **********Mr. Beirerdinc said that while Afghanistan might be able to fend off starvation longer than Somalia because it is a rich agricultural country, there are certain to be severe food shortages. Health problems are compounded by lack of medicine. **********""Hospitals that had 20 doctors now have one,"" he said. ""All the medicines are gone. Children do not go to school. Not in any of the cities. Nowhere."" **********""Winter is coming, and we need to stockpile food and supplies,"" Mr. Beirerdinc said. ""But donors are not responding."" **********""The tragedy that these people are living deserves a little bit of attention, a little bit of sympathy, a little more commitment,"" he said. Concern About Minefields **********At the Geneva offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there is growing concern over the fate of a million or more Afghans who have returned from exile in Pakistan and Iran to face minefields and unexploded ordnance in their fields as well as clan wars. **********Since the withdrawal of aid from Moscow at the beginning of the year and the subsequent collapse of the Najibullah Government in April, rival ethnic or regional armies have been battling for control of Kabul, which is now held by a weak interim Government that is promising to convene a loya jirga, or traditional Afghan national assembly, at the end of this month. **********The Government is backed by Tajik and Uzbek forces, the target of a renegade Pushtun army led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was once heavily armed by the United States and Pakistan. There have also been destructive encounters in several cities between militant Islamic fighters of the Saudi-backed Wahabi sect and the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim forces. Some groups have access to heavy weapons and aircraft that once belonged to the last Communist regime."

United and USAir said they had no immediate comment. Continental also said it was studying Northwest's move but added, ""We have said all along that fares have been too low."" **********Northwest's latest announcement comes shortly after it lowered fares and fired the first shots in what became an air fare war. On May 26, it announced a two-for-one promotion centered on children's fares. The next day American cut all advance-purchase fares within the continental United States by 50 percent, saying it was defending the integrity of the simplified fare structure it put into place in April. **********Those half-price tickets created huge traffic jams for ticket and travel agents during a 10-day sale. Millions of tickets for travel by Sept. 13 were sold, but the carriers said they would not know until later this summer how much money, if any, they had made on them. **********Northwest has also been active in court, and last week followed Continental's lead in filing an antitrust suit against American, charging ""predatory pricing."" Continental maintained that American would be unable to make a profit on the fares it adopted in April until one or more of its competitors had been driven from the market. **********American denied the charges. **********Northwest's increase would affect tickets bought on or after June 26 and apply to all fare categories equally. No fare rules or restrictions would be affected. **********""This fare increase will help return some rationality to pricing levels,"" said Phil Haan, vice president of Northwest for revenue management.  ""Our full-coach and first-class fares will remain well below last year's levels."" **********Mr. Haan added that full-coach travel between New York City and Los Angeles, at $440, would be 36 percent less than it was last year, and first-class travel would be 9 percent less. **********If the new fares go into effect, unrestricted one-way coach fares from New York to Detroit would be $330 and to San Francisco and Seattle, $462. The seven-day excursion fare, round trip from New York, would be $484 to Los Angeles, $286 to Detroit and $506 to both San Francisco and Seattle."

The wails, she said, are like knives flaying the fragile mental defenses of her 5-year-old daughter, Batel. **********Each one reminds the girl of the air raids a year ago when Iraqi Scud missiles fell on this Tel Aviv suburb, demolishing the Ovadia family's apartment building and leaving Batel with serious, though not irreversible, head injuries. **********""She gets scared all the time, and then she runs to me,"" Mrs. Ovadia said. ""Then she won't sleep at night. I'm sure it's from the war. Even I get scared sometimes, too."" **********So do other Israelis. A year after the Scud attacks and the fears of chemical devastation they produced, some of them, notably children, find that they are still plagued by sleeplessness, edginess, bad dreams and other signs of distress that set in during the Persian Gulf war and have yet to disappear. **********In a recent storm over Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, patients at the Children's Medical Center of Israel were troubled by the thunder and lightning. ""Their first question was whether we were at war with Saddam Hussein again,"" said Dr. Yehuda L. Danon, the hospital director and a former army surgeon general. **********Still, a year after Iraq fired 39 missiles at Israel -- starting last Jan. 18 and continuing until Feb. 25 -- physicians, psychologists and social workers agree that such reactions are the exceptions, serious though they may be. **********For most Israelis, they say, this was the war that never was. **********It was a six-week period of anxiety and terror that came and went, happily with little damage, enabling people to dust themselves off and in short order to resume their lives. Now, experts say, Israelis want to forget. **********""It is as though it has been agreed that there be silence,"" said Dr. Rami Bar-Giora, a child psychologist in Jerusalem. ""Nobody wants to look back and suffer like Lot's wife."" **********As it turned out, the Scuds carried no chemical warheads. The missiles that did land killed two Israelis, although more than 70 others reportedly died from heart attacks and from suffocation after failing to put on their gas masks properly. There were 1,059 recorded injuries. Nearly half were from flying glass, but that total included a significant number of acute psychological reactions. **********Ramat Gan, a city of 130,000 that was one of the hardest-hit locations, has gone far to pick up the pieces, even if Mrs. Ovadia's old building on Abba Hillel Silver Street is still a hole in the ground. **********All but 11 of 4,300 apartments that were damaged have been restored, Ramat Gan officials said. Of 106 familes whose apartments were destroyed, 32 have moved into new homes with city financing, and the others should be taken care of by mid-1993.  Normal Enough for Envy **********Things are so normal, says Eli Sper ling, a city official in charge of helping Scud victims, that residents now indulge in the luxury of envy: ""Why did their building get a new garden and not ours? This new marbletop counter is nice, but can I also get a different faucet?"" **********As for psychological damage, the city's chief of social welfare, Meir Mandelbaum, says there were not enough residents with sustained problems to justify setting up a special unit for them. ""People said basically to leave them alone,"" he said. ""They did not want to reopen those wounds."" **********But in life's game of ""Chutes and Ladders,"" some Israelis have inevitably taken a slide since the war, the only conflict that significantly touched civilians here since the war of independence in 1948. **********Although there seem to be no definitive year-after studies, many psychologists say people who were already burdened with emotional problems have proved the most susceptible to persistent stress symptoms.  The Stress of Inaction **********There are reported cases of recovering alcoholics who started drinking again, of couples with marital troubles who divorced, of high-strung people who now jump higher than ever at loud noises. **********A few months after the war, newspapers reported a rise in family violence, and some psychologists blamed war-related frustration. **********Israeli men trained to go into battle were forced to sit with their families in sealed rooms, helpless to do anything about the missiles because of the Government's decision to refrain from retaliation to keep the anti-Iraq coalition intact. As some psychologists saw it, pent-up anger sometimes exploded into fits of wife-beating and child abuse. **********But others say it is difficult to tell whether increased episodes of violence indeed stemmed from the war or merely reflected new, more rigorous reporting policies. **********""Nobody likes to be a sitting duck,"" said Lieut. Col. Zahava Solomon, an army psyschologist who studied soldiers' reactions last year. ""It can create anger and frustration at a certain point. But I don't think that this resulted in severe psychological trauma.""  Reaction of Holocaust Survivors **********A special reaction comes from the hundreds of thousands of survivors of the Nazi genocide and their children. **********Many survivors -- probably most, some psychologists say -- responded to the missiles as did Shlomo Cohen of Ramat Gan, who escaped in World War II from a Greek town near the Albanian border where nearly all the Jews were killed. **********Only two hours before an incoming Scud severely damaged their apartment building, Mr. Cohen and his wife, Anna, had moved in with their daughter a short distance away. But even that close call did not faze the Cohens. **********""For anyone who went through the Holocaust in Europe, what happened here last year was a child's game,"" Mr. Cohen said. **********Still, psychologists report cases in which the chemical menace of the Scuds brought back memories of Nazi gas chambers and of powerlessness in the face of peril. **********Dr. Shalom Litman, a psychoanalyst with an organization called Amcha, which helps survivors and their children, says the offspring seem to be experiencing the most trouble.  Concerns of 'Second Generation' **********There has been a sharp rise in the number of people from this ""second generation"" who are coming to him for help. ""They have anxiety, nightmares and general concern about what happened to their parents long ago,"" Dr. Litman said. ""They were troubled before all this as well, but the war opened the gates wider."" **********In general, said Dr. Charles Greenbaum, a psychologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israelis discovered that ""we are more vulnerable than we had realized."" Some of his colleagues cautioned that the next great crisis could produce widespread hysteria and social breakdown. **********Many Israelis say that they are seeing a further erosion of confidence in authority. **********The vaunted Patriot missiles of the United States weren't the Scud-busters they were cracked up to be, in the view of some experts. And a postwar report by Israel's State Comptroller said one-third of the Government-issued gas masks might have been defective or otherwise inadequate. While the Defense Ministry dismissed the assertion, saying it was off the mark, it nonetheless has announced that it will distribute new masks this year. **********Many Israelis worry that their entire strategy of deterrence against Arab aggression has been compromised now that they have shown they are prepared in certain situations to take many punches and not strike back. Perhaps with that in mind, Defense Minister Moshe Arens said as the first anniversary of the missile attacks approached that ""if the war had continued another week, Israel would have acted."" **********Gerald M. Steinberg, a military expert at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, says that even though most Israelis supported the no-retaliation policy a year ago, there is little chance of such restraint being repeated. **********In a few instances, losses of confidence struck close to home. **********One girl in Jerusalem continues to have occasional nightmares, the residue of her near-panic a year ago, even though her city was not hit by a missile. **********At one point in the war, her mother was making onion soup, and the terrified girl refused to believe her parents' reasssurances that her eyes stung because of the onions and not because of gas. **********""I think she felt that all the things she trusted in had feet of clay,"" her father said. ""That includes her parents."""

The answer -- Mike Wallace is on the line. **********There are people in the business and financial world who are giving a new answer to the old joke: Bryan Burrough is on the line. **********Mr. Burrough, an investigative reporter at The Wall Street Journal, wrote the best-selling book, ""Barbarians at the Gate"" (Harper & Row) about the RJR Nabisco takeover, with a Journal colleague, John Heylar. He has just come out with a new book, ""Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra"" (HarperCollins), which details the organized attempt by the American Express Company to discredit a former colleague and competitor. **********American Express has acknowledged that it set out covertly to ruin Mr. Safra's reputation as a banker by spreading false reports to newspapers and magazines that he was involved in money laundering and drug trafficking. After making a public apology, the company paid $8 million to Mr. Safra and charities chosen by him as compensation. **********Mr. Burrough, who is 30 years old, received a $1 million advance from HarperCollins for the book, which grew out of a 10,000-word article he wrote for The Wall Street Journal in September 1990. **********One of the main characters in the article and the book, Harry Freeman, a former executive at American Express who now owns his own trade policy consulting firm in Washington, is suing Mr. Burrough and Dow Jones & Company, The Journal's parent, for $50 million, claiming that the article falsely described his role in the campaign against Mr. Safra. **********In an unusual twist to a libel suit, Mr. Freeman and his lawyer, John J. Walsh of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, are charging that in an effort to get a more lucrative book contract, Mr. Burrough recklessly disregarded and distorted the truth in the Journal article. To try to prove their case, they have issued wide-ranging document requests and subpoenas to The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins, Mr. Burrough and his agent, Andrew Wylie. **********""We are going to be examining whether interest in money clouded his judgment,"" Mr. Walsh said. ""We believe it did."" **********None of this frightens Mr. Burrough. This is the fourth time The Journal has been sued because of articles he wrote. In two cases, he prevailed and one case has not been resolved. A spokesman for The Journal, Roger May, said the Freeman suit was ""without merit"" and the company was confident it would win.  Price for Journalists **********Although many business people might think he is seeking targets, Mr. Burrough said his recent success had made him a target, too. **********""It's the potential price that every journalist has to pay,"" Mr. Burrough said. ""These aggressive intimidation tactics and big lawsuits and threats are very popular these days, especially if you're someone with a name. I know this might sound high and mighty, but I'm not going to let that threat stand in the way of getting at the truth."" **********Mr. Freeman, who did not talk to Mr. Burrough for the Journal article but was interviewed at length for the book, said he decided to sue only after he read press reports about Mr. Burrough's advance and HarperCollins's plans to publish some 250,000 copies of the book and promote it heavily. He said that given Mr. Burrough's previous success, this book was likely to become a best seller, which would then become a paperback best seller then possibly a movie. **********""There's no way I could sit still and survive that,"" he said. Questioning the Ethics **********Mr. Freeman questioned the ethics of reporters' writing books about subjects they are in the midst of covering, saying the temptation would be great to create scandals to get better book contracts. ""It shows an arrogance and an abuse of power,"" he said. **********Mr. Burrough dismisses the notion that he became involved in the American Express project with his eye on a big book deal. He said the idea for the article came not from him but from a Journal editor. **********""American Express stymied me every step of the way,"" Mr. Burrough said. ""In fact, I was pretty convinced I couldn't do it as a book because they wouldn't cooperate with me. But then I came upon this structure, to set it up as a mystery, and I only got the book contract after the article ran."" **********""Frankly,"" he added, ""it was too compelling not to go forward and learn more about it and turn it into a book. At one point, someone at American Express said to me, 'This story is a complex mosaic you can never hope to totally figure out.' Well, that's a red flag to any journalist worth his salt. American Express laid down a challenge and I went after it. Finding things out is what I do for a living."""

Eaton had joined the Chrysler Corporation just a year ago, he would have been signing up to rescue a sinking ship. **********But in just the last two months Chrysler's prospects suddenly seem brighter. With $861 million of new equity raised in February, a slew of new models about to roll into showrooms and layers of corporate fat sliced away, the nation's No. 3 auto maker appears poised for yet another of its comebacks. In other words, the task of Mr. Eaton, formerly the head of General Motors' European operations, is to keep several good things going at Chrysler. **********By the time he becomes chairman and chief executive on Jan. 1, he must swiftly head off any political infighting, assemble his own team from Chrysler's cadres and reassure bankers and credit-rating agencies that the auto maker is truly on the mend. **********Failing any of these tasks could be fatal, for Chrysler finally has some momentum after four years of declining profits, and a loss last year, as well as a bitter and divisive two-year power struggle as the company tried to find a successor to Lee A. Iacocca. That struggle could reignite at any moment if Mr. Eaton is unable to assert his leadership and reconcile contending factions.  ""Chrysler managers have been working extremely well together for the past two years -- like a championship basketball team,"" said Ronald A. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. ""I worry how a new star player will affect the chemistry."" **********Most important, Mr. Eaton must learn to manage the fragile chemistry among himself, Mr. Iacocca and Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president and the man passed over for Mr. Iacocca's job, who says he plans to stay at the company. **********David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine, said: ""I think Lutz and Eaton can make it work. But it remains to be seen if Iacocca will let them."" **********Mr. Davis added: ""A real determined effort has to made to stamp out all the backbiting. There's still blood in the water where Lutz is concerned.""  Although Mr. Eaton was a highly regarded engineering executive at G.M., he had relatively little experience as an operating executive deeply involved in making and selling cars day to day. Nor does he have deep experience in sales, marketing or finance. Encountering Success **********Analysts point out that G.M.'s success in Europe was well under way by the time Mr. Eaton arrived, thanks to John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s executive vice president in charge of international operations. Under G.M.'s European management system, Mr. Eaton worked for four years with a small staff in Zurich on strategy, separated from the operating decisions made at G.M.'s Adam Opel headquarters in Germany and the Vauxhall Motors subsidiary in Britain. **********Initially, until Mr. Iacocca departs, he and Mr. Lutz will both have a hand in the sales and marketing of Chrysler's newest models. The Jeep Grand Cherokee, a full-size, four-wheel-drive, four-door wagon, which is scheduled to be introduced next month in New York, promises to provide stiff competition for the popular Ford Explorer utility vehicle. Reviewers have praised its handling, refinement and car-like feel. **********A new line of midsize cars -- selling as the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision -- won raves at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January. Rosy predictions notwithstanding, the new models will help Chrysler only if they can sell at a strong, sustained pace without costly rebates or dealer incentives. The extent of the nation's economic recovery will play a role, but so will effective, coordinated advertising and public exposure. Need for New Pitchman **********With Mr. Iacocca, the quintessential marketeer and pitchman, scheduled to retire from a day-to-day role at the end of the year, Chrysler will need someone or something to fill the void to motivate dealers, fine-tune its pricing and merchandising and add just the right touch to advertise the wares. It might be Mr. Lutz, whose career has focused mostly on sales and marketing. Mr. Eaton may also decide to promote someone from within, or he may look outside the company. **********Chrysler's biggest void may be in finance. Gerald Greenwald, Robert S. Miller Jr. and Fred Zuckerman, senior financial executives whose credibility with lenders helped Chrysler arrange its Government-backed bailout a decade ago, have all left in the last two years. When Mr. Iacocca came to Chrysler in 1979, he recruited those men from the Ford Motor Company. Mr. Eaton said he did not plan a similar recruitment from G.M. **********Meanwhile, Chrysler is caught in a credit squeeze of a different kind, caused by debt ratings that have plummeted to less than investment grade. This year, more than $2.7 billion of Chrysler debt matures, mostly from the finance subsidiary. Since the auto maker cannot borrow at reasonable terms to ""roll over"" the debt, because of its low credit rating, Chrysler must retire the debt with cash generated from installment loans. Chrysler has also chosen to ""bundle"" auto loans and sell them to investors. But as a safety net, the auto maker is renegotiating a $6.8 billion revolving line of credit with a consortium of 150 banks.  Next year, another $1.6 billion of Chrysler debt matures. By then, Chrysler hopes to be basking in the success of new models. If that occurs, investment-grade credit ratings could be restored, paving the way for re-entry into the credit markets. **********John Tierney, chairman of the Chrysler Financial Corporation subsidiary, acknowledged that rarely had negotiations with banks been so painstaking or time-consuming. ""The regulators are leaning on the banks,"" he said. ""Everything gets looked at twice and three times."" **********But he said the departure of senior financial executives had not been a negative factor. ""Chrysler has plenty of experience,"" he said. ""We don't have greenhorns."" **********Moreover, Mr. Miller, the former vice chairman, said when he resigned last month that he would be working with banks on Chrysler's behalf in his new job as an investment banker for James Wolfensohn & Company. **********Bankers, rating agencies and shareholders are sure to be watching Mr. Eaton's moves closely for reassurance that he can keep the auto maker motoring toward recovery. **********If turmoil breaks out, the stage could be set for Mr. Iacocca's return to a larger role than chairman of the executive committee, a role that his confidants say he wanted but that Chrysler's outside directors denied when the board selected Mr. Eaton earlier this month.  In several ways, the ferment at Chrysler could prove explosive. The Big Three have different corporate cultures, and executives who grew up at one company rarely transplant successfully at another. Several Chrysler managers who spoke on the condition of anonymity, as well as Mr. Lutz himself, said they were disappointed when the board hired a G.M. executive over the current president. **********Clearly, Mr. Lutz is seen by many of his colleagues as a ""wounded prince."" When Chrysler revamped, streamlined and speeded up engineering and product development in the spring of 1989 as a response to its sinking market share, Mr. Lutz emerged as symbol and spokesman of the new organization's spirit, arguing for engineering enhancements and styling refinements and often clashing with Mr. Iacocca. In the end, Mr. Iacocca yielded frequently, enhancing Mr. Lutz's prestige in the eyes of many workers. **********Aaron Taylor, president of Local 7 of the United Automobile Workers union, whose members are building the new Jeep Grand Cherokee in Detroit, said: ""Bob Lutz was a guy who took a firm position, but was someone we could work with. Without prejudging Eaton, I'm disappointed, and so are the members."" Greenwald Called First Choice **********Nevertheless, Mr. Lutz is not universally popular. An ego-driven and outspoken man, he alienated many in the company with public criticism of departments and individuals. Several people who said they were familiar with the deliberations of Chrysler directors said that Mr. Iacocca's first choice for chairman was Mr. Greenwald, the former vice chairman and Mr. Iacocca's heir apparent, who resigned two years ago to lead an aborted employee buyout of United Airlines. He now works as an investment banker for Dillon, Read & Company in New York. **********But Mr. Lutz vowed he would not work for Mr. Greenwald, these sources said. So the board, aware that Mr. Lutz had opposition in the company and lacked Mr. Iacocca's support, selected Mr. Eaton as a compromise, the sources said. The directors also decided to limit Mr. Iacocca's role to that of chairman of the executive committee, rather than chairman of the board. **********Mr. Lutz said he would not quit and would do everything he could to make Mr. Eaton's job easier. But a senior Chrysler manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ""They've painted a big bull's eye on Bob's back,"" suggesting that executive recruiters would regard him and some of his supporters as targets for job offers from other companies. **********Gossip in the auto trade press last week already had Mr. Lutz talking to Porsche A.G., the troubled German sports car company, about a job. Mr. Lutz has denied the reports."

Democratic criticism of Mr. Bush's handling of Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait has already tarnished the allies' victory in the war as a campaign asset for the President.  The Leaky Embargo **********In recent weeks, United States intelligence estimates have concluded that Mr. Hussein is strengthening his position in Baghdad with the help of an ever higher volume of critical supplies and other goods entering Iraq from Jordan, in violation of the 22-month-old trade embargo. **********A recent National Intelligence Estimate said that up to 30 percent of the cargo crossing into Iraq from Jordan violates the trade embargo. **********As a result, the White House last week dispatched the Director of Central Intelligence, Robert M. Gates, to Jordan to press for King Hussein's cooperation in placing United Nations inspectors at the Red Sea port of Aqaba to turn back Iraq-bound cargo, Administration officials said. Jordan Changes Direction **********A senior Administration official said Jordanian officials were presented with ""evidence about sanctions violations that originated in Jordan and their significance for Iraq's economy."" **********""We essentially made the case for a strengthened United Nations regime,"" the official continued. ""At the end of the day it was no sale -- the Jordanians felt they couldn't go along."" **********Jordan's position contrasted with its cooperation in the fall of 1990, when United States embassy personnel in Jordan were allowed to take up positions on the border crossing with Iraq, where they lifted the tarpaulins covering Iraq-bound trucks to affirm Jordan's compliance with the embargo. **********Mr. Gates' trip was not announced in advance, but news of his presence in Amman leaked out. C.I.A. officials would not discuss the trip today. **********The senior Administration official, acknowledging the failure of the diplomatic mission, said: ""In the wake of that, we are in the process of thinking what our options are in this particular hole in the sanctions net. No decisions have been made."" Would Search Trucks **********But other Administration officials said the White House was preparing a plan under which United Nations policemen inside Iraq would search the hundreds of trucks that enter from Jordan every week. Food and medicine would be passed; items banned by the embargo -- virtually all other goods -- would be turned back. **********Administration officials said the plan would draw on the authority of existing United Nations resolutions and would not require Jordan's cooperation. The inspectors could be drawn from the United Nations personnel in Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction and monitor Iraq's compliance with other aspects of the cease-fire resolution that ended the gulf war 16 months ago. **********The plan is to be reviewed Wednesday at the White House by senior deputies from major Government agencies. Officials also said three key allies, Britain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, were briefed today on a proposed notification to Baghdad stating that United Nations personnel in Iraq could begin enforcing the embargo. **********Administration officials acknowledged that there was an element of brinkmanship, since the plan would involve interference with vehicles on Iraqi soil and could prove both embarrassing and provocative to Iraq. U.N. Tenacity **********As an added element of urgency, the United Nations today press Baghdad to renew a ""memorandum of understanding"" covering the presence of 1,100 United Nations personnel in Iraq, including 500 armed guards in northern Iraq. The current agreement on protection of the United Nations personnel and their access to all parts of Iraq expires midnight tonight. **********United States officials indicated that there was support among members of the Security Council to maintain the United Nations presence in Iraq, regardless whether Baghdad renewed the agreement. **********Up to now, a multinational naval force in the Red Sea has been intercepting ships bound for Aqaba, Jordan, to stop illicit shipments to Iraq. But these forces have been powerless to stop cargo labeled as bound for Jordan, but which is later trucked to Iraq. **********In his meetings with Mr. Gates, King Hussein was said to have objected to any public cooperation with the effort to choke off supplies to Baghdad, but he pledged a willingness to cooperate in other unspecified covert actions aimed at destabilizing the Iraqi leader. Two-Track Attack **********Testifying today before the Europe and Middle East Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Edward P. Djerejian, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs, referred to the talks in Jordan. **********""They said they could not implement certain arrangements which would involve outside observers,"" he said. **********Asked what steps the Administration was considering to ""ratchet up the pressure"" on Iraq, Mr. Djerejian replied, ""I can't discuss that in open session."" **********The United States has been engaged in a two-track policy against Iraq. **********One emphasizes the trade embargo and inspections to force Iraq to destroy weapons of mass destruction and war-making industries. **********The second track, authorized by a series of secret Presidential findings by Mr. Bush, emphasizes covert steps by the C.I.A. and Pentagon to build an Iraqi opposition capable of fomenting a coup that could topple Mr. Hussein and perhaps receive the backing of allied military forces. The Oil Issue **********King Hussein's stance appears to be driven by domestic politics, as well as by economic fears that Iraq would cut off oil supplies. Iraq sends more than 60,000 barrels of crude oil a day to Jordan in truck tankers that traverse the same desert highway that supplies Baghdad. This oil meets most of the needs of Jordan's severely stressed economy, and has been overlooked by the United Nations commission enforcing the embargo."

The move ends a 21-year relationship with Grey Advertising that was broken off at the behest of Playtex's new parent, the Sara Lee Corporation, which wanted to limit the number of agencies handling its advertising. **********Now that it has won the account over Interpublic Group's Lintas, Saatchi faces another challenge: freshening the image of Playtex Apparel's core brands -- its Cross-Your-Heart and 18-Hour bras -- to bring in new customers while not alienating its faithful buyers. ""We want to broaden our franchise,"" said Lee Chaden, president of Playtex Apparel U.S. **********That will include changing the company's five-year-old tagline, ""The fit that makes the fashion."" **********Mr. Chaden said Playtex had selected Saatchi in February for its $15 million United States account, but delayed the announcement until Playtex's European operations, representing $25 million in business for Saatchi, also signed on. He added that he had been impressed by Saatchi's work on other Sara Lee brands: Hanes and L'eggs Hosiery. ""They did a good job of balancing functional products with the fashion component and emotional overtones,"" Mr. Chaden said. **********To choose a new agency quickly, Playtex did not ask for creative proposals from Lintas and Saatchi when Playtex got in touch with them last December, a month after the formerly private Playtex was acquired by Sara Lee. Mr. Chaden had planned to base his decision on intuition and each agency's creative philosophy, but they both submitted consumer research and thoughts on positioning and strategy. **********Saatchi's office in France will be the lead agency for Europe. The new advertising is scheduled to begin in mid-August on television."

But their inventors say these miniature spheres could make it easier to administer a wide variety of new drugs and genetic therapies. **********Patented this week by a team of scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Pennsylvania State University, the spheres are designed to store delicate proteins, viruses and even living cells without destroying them. **********The most immediate application is likely to be producing pill forms of drugs that now must be given by injection. But the more exotic possibilities are to house genetically engineered viruses, which are being developed to treat genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis. **********Looking even further ahead, the scientists say, the capsules could advance the development of artificial organs like livers or pancreases. The hope is that capsules could someday be used to protect, say, liver cells, which would be transplanted into patients and then literally grow into a functioning organ. **********Microcapsules have been used for decades to release drugs into the bloodstream at a measured rate, because the speed at which the capsule walls break down can be controlled. **********The problem, the inventors say, has been that the process of making most microcapsules is too harsh for proteins or living cells. Many pharmaceutical proteins produced by gene-splicing, for example, can be rendered ineffective by the heat used to produce the capsules. As a result, these drugs must usually be injected directly into the bloodstream. The problem is even more serious for customized viruses and transplanted cells, which must withstand attacks from the patient's immune system. **********The new spheres are made from long-chained molecules called polyphosphazenes, which are dissolved in water. The proteins or cells being encapsulated are mixed with this solution to make tiny droplets. These droplets are then immersed in a bath of either calcium salts or aluminum salts, where they harden. **********One of the inventors, Dr. Robert S. Langer, a professor of chemical and biomedical engineering at M.I.T., said the principal advantage was that the process was so mild it posed no threat to the proteins. In addition, he said, the beads can be reliably tailored so that they admit small molecules, like sugars and nutrients that a cell needs, while barring antibodies that might attack it. **********Patent 5,149,543 was issued to Dr. Langer; Harry R. Allcock, a professor of chemistry at Penn State, and four other researchers. **********Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231."

Condit, the president of the Boeing Company of Seattle, said yesterday that there were differences of opinion within the company on whether a new generation of 600-passenger airplanes was feasible. **********""There is a big debate on the big airplane,"" he said in an interview. **********A major reason for the uncertainty is that most major international carriers are building hubs in cities where giant aircraft are not needed, and, beyond that, they are using smaller two-engine planes, such as the Boeing 767, between major hubs like New York or London. Fragmented Market **********""As you fragment that market you tend to drive toward smaller airplanes,"" Mr. Condit said. **********There is also the problem of saturation at some major airports, such as Frankfurt, though Mr. Condit said airports could handle more passengers than they do now, by improving local transportation, for example. **********Some airline executives also question the need for more 747's, one of Boeing's most successful airplanes, as air routes fragment and carriers turn to smaller airplanes they can more easily fill. **********But Mr. Condit said there would continue to be a need for the 400-passenger 747, particularly on long flights between the Far East, Europe and the United States. Boeing is developing a two-engine giant, the 777, which will be able to carry from 305 to 418 passengers, depending on its configuration. The plane, which is scheduled for delivery in May 1995, is supposed to fill a gap in the Boeing line between the four-engine 747 and the smaller two-engine 767. New Design Approach **********Before he was named president, Mr. Condit was in charge of the 777 development program. He instituted a design approach under which engineers gave up drawing boards in favor of cumputer screens in an attempt to increase efficiency and save on development costs. **********United Airlines ordered 36 of the 777's for $22 billion in October 1990. Boeing now has 106 of the planes on order. **********Airbus Industrie, the consortium of European companies, has two planes that are competing with the 777. Its four-engine A340 can carry 335 passengers and fly heavy loads long distances. The consortium has orders for 127 of the planes from such major carriers as Lufthansa and Air France, and expects to begin delivery in January. **********Its two-engine A330 will also carry 335 passengers, in two classes; 143 of these planes are on order, for delivery in 1995. Both Boeing and Airbus will get a boost in several weeks with an order for 80 to 100 aircraft by the International Lease Finance Corporation. Aviation Daily reported that International Lease's president, Steven Udvar-Hazy, had confirmed the order. **********An industry executive, who did not want to be indentified, said Boeing would get about two thirds of the order, Airbus the rest. **********This comes at a time when many major airlines have been stretching out their orders and trying to cut costs. About one-fifth of the orders for all manufacturers have been cut or delayed."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/28/business/fear-in-caribbean-over-trade-pact.html,Howard French,1992-12-28,,1126,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Fear in Caribbean Over Trade Pact,Fear in Caribbean Over Trade Pact," **********Just out of earshot of the shop-floor bustle of industrial parks here, plant managers fear they will soon be able to detect another sound here: the whoosh of capital drawn toward Mexico by its sweeping new trade agreement with the United States. **********Like many others in the Caribbean basin, they said they thought that the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would allow duty-free movement of goods across the borders of Canada, Mexico and the United States, would give Mexico advantages that would strongly undermine ties between the Caribbean and the United States. Those ties have been building since the early 1980's. **********The agreement, signed by President Bush, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, still requires action in each national legislature to go into effect. And some members of the United States Congress, as well as President-elect Bill Clinton, have stipulated various conditions or amendments they will seek to append to the pact -- making it far from a certainty. **********Nonetheless, the perceived threat is propelling some Caribbean countries to make radical policy changes and perhaps seek free-trade negotiations of their own with the United States in the hope of winning a place in the hemisphere's emerging new trade order. **********But there is fear that with Mexico soon able to offer American corporations cheap labor and transportation and its own large, unprotected market under the new agreement, many of the region's most fragile economies will be hard pressed to compete for trade and investment regardless of the measures they take. Pessimistic Appraisals **********""If you ask any company outside of the circles of people who are already present in the Caribbean where they are looking to invest in the near future, they'll all tell you Mexico,"" James M. McElyea, a vice president of the Wilson Sporting Goods Company, said at a recent annual conference of investors, industrialists and trade officials from the Caribbean in Miami. Far from a lone pessimistic appraisal, his statement on the effects of the new trade agreement was echoed by many people at the conference. **********Since 1984 the Caribbean has enjoyed a preferential trade arrangement with the United States, known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which has allowed companies operating in the region to export goods assembled from American components and raw materials to the United States duty free. **********The Caribbean initiative, unlike the North American agreement, allowed the small countries of Central America and the Caribbean taking part to protect their own fledgling domestic industries even as new, export-oriented businesses were given free access to the United States market. **********Taking advantage of the region's low wages, companies like Wilson and hundreds of others moved in to produce everything from hand-sewn baseballs to electrical switches and underwear in the industrial parks that sprouted in many Caribbean basin countries. **********Largely because of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, many of the countries were soon transformed from simple agricultural or tourism-based economies to increasingly more diverse industrial ones. A Warning on Emigration **********If this process is reversed, many warn, emigration from the region to the United States could explode, as could other problems of concern to Washington, from drug trafficking to political instability. **********Mr. Clinton has sought to allay fears that the United States' special relationship with the region will be crippled by expanding ties with Mexico. ""I have no intention of withdrawing from our historic commitments or our unique opportunities,"" Mr. Clinton said in early December. **********Although they welcomed his address, many Caribbean business and political leaders remain deeply worried. By granting Mexico duty-free access to the United States market, they say, the North American agreement, popularly known by its acronym, Nafta, suddenly pits the Caribbean against a huge, low-cost competitor that many fear they will be unable to match. Equally important for some, the treaty ushers in a model of two-way free trade that many of the region's smaller countries say they could never survive. **********""If you ask us to do that tomorrow you will be tearing down our democracy overnight,"" Ralph Fonseca, a Minister of State from Belize, said of expected calls by Washington for countries in the Caribbean region to abandon tariff barriers protecting their industries and negotiate reciprocal free-trade agreements with the United States. ""In Belize we have done everything we can think of, privatizing our economy and opening up, but if we pursue some academic exercise before Washington has understood our predicament, we will end up nowhere."" Many Are Changing Plans **********Many larger Caribbean countries have already begun to alter their plans in the belief that the North American agreement will radically change the assumptions on which their economies have been built in the last decade. **********""The time of reflection is past,"" said Juan Jose Arteaga, a senior economic adviser in the Government of the Dominican Republic, which has the Caribbean's most industrialized economy. ""This Nafta thing is going ahead, and we will have to move forward very quickly with some major decisions."" **********Many Dominican officials and industrialists say that to remain competitive with Mexico their country will have to speed overhauls of the legal and tax codes, which have already undergone significant change in the last two years. But ultimately, many say, the country will have no alternative to seeking a similar trade agreement with the United States itself, either alone or as part of regional negotiations, which the Bush Administration has said it favors. **********For countries that pursue this route, trade experts say, the stakes will be high. Industries that have thrived behind high tariff barriers will suddenly be subject to competition from large and efficient American corporations. Similarly, local banks and insurance companies will face stiff foreign competition in financial services. Protecting Trademarks **********Washington will also insist strongly on safeguarding intellectual property rights, meaning that manufacturers of everything from soap to pharmaceuticals will be required to respect trademarks and honor licensing agreements in ways that many have sidestepped in the past. **********With hints that the Clinton Administration will insist on stronger environmental regulation and more equitable labor codes in Mexico to win enactment of the trade agreement, many are bracing for change. **********""These are all important themes among our private industrial sector right now, and in the next six months we will see some major decisions on them,"" said Jose M. Ceron Pena, executive vice president of San Isidro Industrial Free Zone, a large park on the edge of Santo Domingo. ""Some people are saying do these things to open up right away. Others are saying do them more gradually. But for us, one of the choices is no longer not opening up at all."""

They just cared for themselves."" **********The debate, which echoes in other countries going through a post-Communist metamorphosis, boils down to this: Can liberal democratic movements like Sajudis survive the pain caused by free-market economics? And what alternative do former Communists, like Algiradas Brazauskas, the winner in Lithuania, offer? Warmed-up socialism with more state control and state subsidies, or some kind of middle course? **********On Nov. 15, runoffs are scheduled in 61 of the 141 contests for seats in the parliament. Even if it is forced to put together a coalition, the Democratic Labor Party, led by Mr. Brazauskas, has already made its comeback. In the balloting, where votes were cast for parties and not for individual candidates, the former Communists won 44.8 percent and the Sajudis coalition 19.8 percent. Is It Russia's Fault? **********President Vytautas Landsbergis said in an interview that the results were ""an expression of people's dissatisfaction about the economic situation and everyday hardships."" But Mr. Landsbergis also blamed Moscow for encouraging the anti-Sajudis vote by slowing down critical supplies of gas and oil to the point where some hospitals were threatening to close. **********Mr. Landsbergis also said Lithuania had been infiltrated by ""brainwashing experts"" from Russian security. **********A decree issued today by Mr. Yeltsin suspending the withdrawal of Russian troops from all three Baltic countries was seen as further proof that Moscow is not a reliable partner. Unlike Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania has given full citizenship to its Russian minority, and on Sept. 8 Vilnius reached an agreement with Moscow on the withdrawal of Russian troops by Aug. 31, 1993. **********Mr. Landsbergis, a music scholar, became chairman of Sajudis in 1988 and led Lithuania to independence with policies that some called intransigent, and others called far-sighted. In the spring of 1989, Lithuania withstood an economic boycott imposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to punish the republic for trying to break out of the Soviet Union. Times Are Hard **********Lithuania is now faced with another round of economic hardships. As of last July, Russia began to demand hard currency for oil and gas shipments to Lithuania and other states that have left the ruble zone. Salaries have been frozen, and many are paid up to three months late. People in Vilnius say they have no hot water, and the temperatures in their apartments hover below 60 degrees. **********If the former Communists win the second round of elections, Mr. Landsbergis said, the country may be forced once again to face East. **********""What I am most afraid of is that the West will turn away from Lithuania, and that Lithuania will be at the mercy of Russia,"" he said. ""Which Russia, we do not know,"" he added, alluding to the ongoing power struggle between old communists and President Yeltsin. **********But among voters, especially in rural areas, the blame for Lithuania's current economic troubles fell not on Moscow, but on Sajudis. ""The simple people know only that before it was warm, and now it is cold,"" said Mrs. Mikutyte, the exhibition organizer. **********Non-Lithuanian minorities, including Russians, Poles and others who make up about 19 percent of the population, had the right to vote; in the two other Baltic states, larger and more politically threatening Russian minorities have been denied automatic citizenship. According to preliminary results, many non-Lithuanians voted for the former Communists, causing fresh resentment among some of the debaters around the makeshift Lenin statue. **********The success of the Democratic Labor Party is also testament to Mr. Brazauskas's personal popularity. An economist by training, Mr. Brazauskas, broke with the central Soviet party in December 1989, when he was Lithuania's Communist party leader, a critical move that laid the groundwork for the referendum for independence in March 1990. **********But his resume does not help with die-hard Sajudis supporters, who worry that Mr. Brazauskas will bring back something akin to old-style communism. At the Lithuanian Parliament building, young Government aides hailed each other in the corridors in the days after the election with a half-joking, ""Greetings, comrade,"" in Russian. **********Mr. Brazauskas, however, has joined in the nationwide call on Moscow to honor its agreement to pull out its 20,000 troops by Aug. 31, 1993, and has said Lithuania will never be a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which groups 11 of the 15 former Soviet republics. Relations with Russia need to be improved, he said at a recent news conference, but he declined to be specific. **********On economic reform, Mr. Brazauskas takes the same line as Civic Union in Russia, a new party that wants to slow the pace of change. **********""We support the idea that there can be no sharp turns, that we cannot do anything at any price,"" Mr. Brazauskas said. ""We have already done that. We have frozen salaries and removed subsidies. Can you imagine how a person receiving a small salary can survive, with world prices coming down upon their heads? A government has to reply to the people's cries."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/19/business/crazy-eddie-s-insane-odyssey.html,Barry Meier,1992-07-19,,2584,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Crazy Eddie's Insane Odyssey,Crazy Eddie's Insane Odyssey," **********For years, television commercials blared that Crazy Eddie was ""insaaaaane,"" but a recent incident in Switzerland suggests that, if anything, the ads understated the situation. **********In late April, Eddie Antar, founder of the electronics chain that collapsed in 1989, went to the police in Bern and demanded help in gaining access to his $32 million bank account. **********Even using the alias under which he had opened the account, he immediately aroused suspicion. The bank had already frozen the account at the request of United States officials pursuing the elusive Mr. Antar, accused of masterminding a huge financial fraud. **********Mr. Antar could not persuade the police to help him, and the ill-advised mission provided the break that led to his arrest last month in Israel. But his nerve in going to the authorities epitomizes Mr. Antar's outrageous audacity, both as a fugitive and as a businessman, when he and others allegedly plundered Crazy Eddie Inc. **********Since his disappearance in February 1990, the hunt for Mr. Antar and testimony in lawsuits have produced a wave of revelations about the company and the man called Crazy Eddie. They suggest that earlier accusations of fraud may have only hinted at the scope of the deception and that Mr. Antar might soon find a special place in the annals of financial crime. **********""This may not be the biggest stock fraud of all time,"" said William McLucas, director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed civil charges against Mr. Antar in 1989. ""But for outrageousness it is going to be very hard to beat."" Some Fancy Footwork **********Even before the company went public in 1984, for example, Mr. Antar was flying to Israel with cash strapped to his body, part of the nearly $7 million he and others skimmed from the company over the years and secretly deposited in Bank Leumi of Israel, according to papers filed in February by the S.E.C. in Federal court in Newark. Money was later funneled back through Panama and blended with the receipts of new Crazy Eddie stores to fool wide-eyed analysts into thinking the chain was growing when in fact it was falling apart, those court documents claim. **********Also, Sam E. Antar, Mr. Antar's cousin and the company's chief financial officer, has recently testified on practices that could serve as a treatise on financial pillage. One technique: When auditors were about to discover that inventory records were faked, Crazy Eddie executives simply threw the documents into a dumpster and claimed they were lost. **********""This was like an organized-crime scam,"" said Howard Hawkins Jr., an attorney involved in the Crazy Eddie lawsuits. ""It was madness."" **********As Crazy Eddie collapsed, newly uncovered documents show, Mr. Antar, who is now 44 years old, was apparently laying the groundwork for a new life. In 1988, soon after the S.E.C. opened its investigation, he quietly went to Israel, obtained citizenship and legally changed his name to Alexander Stewart. During his life on the lam, Mr. Antar spent lavishly, leasing apartments in London and Montreal, and repeatedly returned to this country, according to law enforcement officials. **********Mr. Antar; his brothers, Mitchell and Allen, and a cousin, Eddie Grindi, were all indicted by a Newark grand jury last month, accused of various securities violations involving overstatement of Crazy Eddie's earnings and profiting from stock sales. The charges are similar to those lodged in civil court by the S.E.C. against Mr. Antar in 1989. **********Mr. Antar's unlikely odyssey might seem amusing. But while some investors made fortunes off the Crazy Eddie craze, others lost millions when the stock collapsed in the late 1980's. Separate battles are now brewing over the millions that the authorities have seized from Mr. Antar's secret bank accounts, and over whether the company's accountant, KPMG Main Hurdman, should be held liable for investors' losses. **********Mr. Antar, who is facing extradition, is now in a Tel Aviv hospital being treated for an undisclosed illness and was unavailable for comment, said Jack Arseneault, one of his attorneys, in Chatham, N.J. But Mr. Arseneault said his client has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing. **********""He plans on vigorously defending himself,"" Mr. Arseneault said. ""He left because from his standpoint he was convinced he was not going to get a fair hearing in the United States."" The Action Years **********For much of the 1980's, Crazy Eddie Inc. was a retailing and stock market phenomenon. Its rapid-fire commercials, in which the actor Jerry Carroll appeared as Mr. Antar's frenzied public persona, were a huge success. The company opened 42 stores in the New York metropolitan area and Philadelphia and reached its peak revenue year in fiscal 1987, reporting sales of $353 million. Its stock went public at $8 a share in 1984, then split and soared to $21.625 a share by 1986, making millionaires of Mr. Antar and others in the family-run business. **********But much of Crazy Eddie's success was an illusion. By 1986, the chain was diversifying into ventures that proved unsuccessful and expanding so quickly that stores were cannibalizing sales from one another. **********Even so, Crazy Eddie was reporting glowing financial results, attracting the attention of skeptical securities regulators. In January 1990, Federal Judge Nicholas H. Politan in Newark issued a preliminary ruling in the S.E.C.'s lawsuit that Mr. Antar had schemed to overstate Crazy Eddie's income and benefited by selling nearly $60 million in stock. He ordered him to repatriate that money, which had allegedly been transferred abroad. When he failed to do so, the judge held him in contempt. **********At the time, a Federal grand jury in Newark was conducting a criminal inquiry into Crazy Eddie, and shareholders had filed suits charging Mr. Antar and others with fraud. **********So had Elias Zinn, a Houston businessman, and the Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund, an investment concern.  In 1987, they had taken over Crazy Eddie from the Antar family in a proxy battle and, they claim, discovered that its inventory was overstated by more than $65 million, or about 100 percent. They cut costs, but the chain plunged into bankruptcy in 1989, and the last of its stores closed. **********In February 1990, Mr. Antar surrendered to a United States Marshal, Arthur Borinsky, in Newark to face the contempt charge. A few weeks later, he failed to appear at a court hearing. Investigators from the marshal's office then staked out his residences in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Deal, N.J., a Monmouth County town with a large Syrian-Jewish population, including many Antar family members. But Mr. Antar had carried out an escape long in the making. **********In 1987, Mr. Antar had resigned as Crazy Eddie's chief executive and dropped out of sight amid rumors he was seriously ill. He had also traveled to Israel to declare his intention to become a citizen there, a hope fulfilled a year later. **********As legal woes grew, he had also enlarged his passport collection. In April 1989, he fraudulently obtained a United States passport using the name Harry Page Shalom, according to a complaint filed by the United States Attorney in Manhattan. The real Mr. Shalom, an acquaintance of Mr. Antar, has testified that he has never owned a passport, the complaint states. **********Mr. Antar apparently traveled widely as a fugitive. Law enforcement officials have now determined that he, or someone carrying a bogus passport known to have been used by him, passed at different times through checkpoints in New York, Miami and Montreal. **********""I have little doubt that Eddie was in the United States a lot,"" said Mr. Borinsky, the marshal. What Sam E. Said **********The Federal grand jury in Newark had started looking at possible criminal charges in the Crazy Eddie case as early as 1988. But that inquiry became sidetracked by bureaucratic fumbling and over the issue of which Antar family members were telling the truth. In simple terms, Mr. Antar's father, Sam M. Antar, and brothers were lined up against Mr. Antar and his cousin, Sam E. Antar, Crazy Eddie's chief financial officer. Each side accused the other of lying and of pulling the opposition into the company's fraud. **********Those hostilities were complicated by a long-running family feud that originated with Mr. Antar's divorce from his first wife, Deborah Rosen Antar, with whom he had five children. The couple had separated, reportedly after Mr. Antar had an affair, and his father and other relatives had sided with his wife. **********Initially, Federal prosecutors distrusted Sam E. Antar. He had admitted lying to S.E.C. officials and destroying important documents. But Sam E., now 35, who had joined the company soon after college, had apparently decided to come clean. **********Last August, after his stories started checking out, he pleaded guilty to reduced charges and paid a small fine to settle the S.E.C. case against him. He then provided testimony to Federal officials and lawyers for private litigants that portrayed a web of deception at Crazy Eddie. **********""Sam E. was a financial architect of this fraud,"" said Howard Sirota, an attorney representing former shareholders. (Sam E. Antar's attorney refused an interview request.) **********As most executives meet to discuss goals, Crazy Eddie executives gathered to concoct frauds, Sam E. Antar testified. The aim was to lift share prices by fooling auditors and analysts into thinking inventories were robust and new stores healthy. **********Among the techniques described: Crazy Eddie executives persuaded an electronics buyer to write checks totaling more than $5 million, reimbursing him in various ways, and then counted the money as new-store sales, Sam E. Antar testified. **********Inventory numbers were fabricated -- one store supposedly had 150 large-screen television sets; four units would have filled a room, a Crazy Eddie official testified. **********Trailers full of goods were delivered to Crazy Eddie and counted as assets, but their cost was not bookedas a liability until the next fiscal year; or the merchandise was shipped back after audits had been completed, Sam E. Antar stated. **********The effect of such schemes on the company's bottom line was staggering. In fiscal 1987, Crazy Eddie reported a pretax profit of $20.6 million when in fact the chain had a substantial loss, the S.E.C. has charged. **********Attorneys for Crazy Eddie executives implicated by Sam E. Antar say he has lied before and may be doing so again. But attorneys for the Government and others stand by him.  ""Everything he has told us has checked out,"" said Richard Simpson, an S.E.C. lawyer. The Money Trail **********Some might find sweet revenge in the fact that the money made by Eddie Antar from his sale of Crazy Eddie stock provided investigators with the leads to track him down. **********A large part of that job fell to Mr. Simpson, who was handed the Crazy Eddie case in 1989 in his first week on the job at the S.E.C. Sam E. Antar soon got him started: Eddie Antar, Sam said, had deposited some $43 million from stock sales in Bank Leumi in Tel Aviv. **********In 1990, United States officials requested Bank Leumi's records. ""By the time we got the records, however, much of the money had already moved,"" Mr. Simpson said. Mr. Antar shifted some of the money to other Israeli bank accounts, opened in the name of a dummy Liberian company and a Liechtenstein foundation, Federal court records in Brooklyn show. In tracing other accounts opened by Mr. Antar under aliases, Mr. Simpson found what looked to be a large sum transferred to a Swiss account under the name David Jacob Levi Cohen. **********At the request of United States officials, the account was frozen by Swiss authorities last fall. Mr. Antar hired a Swiss lawyer in a bid to unblock it.  When that failed, he appeared before the Swiss police, as Mr. Cohen. **********According to American authorities, the Swiss police say ""Mr. Cohen"" told an unbelievable tale: that the millions in the account had been legally earned through the sale of gemstones to an Alexander Stewart (another of Mr. Antar's assumed names). **********When the police showed S.E.C. officials the photo in the phony Brazilian passport being used to identify David Cohen, investigators saw their man. **********With Sam E. Antar's testimony now in hand, Mr. Antar and others were charged on June 11 with securities violations. Now that criminal charges had been filed, foreign authorities were ready to pounce. Apparently, upon Mr. Antar's return to Israel, he filled out a re-entry card using the Cohen alias and an address that led investigators to a house south of Tel Aviv, officials said. **********On June 24, soon after he was identified in surveillance photos taken at the house, Mr. Antar was arrested.  Boxes of financial records were also seized. They show, investigators said, that Mr. Antar had incorporated dummy companies in Liberia, Gibraltar and Panama to hide assets. **********Government investigators have identified, in addition to the the $32 million in Mr. Antar's Swiss account, about $23 million in accounts in Israel, Canada and Luxembourg. **********Last week Mr. Antar was transferred at a doctor's request from a prison hospital to a public one. His condition remains undiagnosed, but his legs are shackled and he is under constant guard, his lawyers said. **********A lengthy battle over extradition is likely; under Israeli law, two years could pass before Mr. Antar exhausts his appeals. But bail is currently not possible. ""We are definitely going to resist on various legal grounds,"" said Assaph Caspi, an attorney in Tel Aviv who represents Mr. Antar. **********Meanwhile, a legal donnybrook is brewing over Mr. Antar's riches. Already, various judgments against Mr. Antar in favor of Crazy Eddie investors, Mr. Antar's first wife and state and Federal agencies total about $275 million, said A. Richard Ross, an attorney working with a court-appointed trustee to find Mr. Antar's assets. **********Mr. Ross recently saw Mr. Antar in Israel. ""He was like a character from the Yiddish theater -- the slumped, round-shouldered lost little man,"" Mr. Ross said. ""He was looking for sympathy, but as far as I'm concerned, he was just playing a role."" THE ACCOUNTANTS' TALE **********In lawsuits filed in a Federal court in Brooklyn, shareholders and others have charged that they lost millions because accountants, through incompetence or by design, failed to uncover problems at Crazy Eddie Inc. One example: Accountants for the firm Peat Marwick Main, now known as KPMG Main Hurdman, were allegedly warned in 1987 that top Crazy Eddie officials were looting millions. **********That year, James L. Purcell, a lawyer for Crazy Eddie, learned that an anonymous caller had warned an official at Salomon Brothers, the brokerage house, about rampant fraud at the company, according to court documents. The warning was supposedly relayed to Alfonse Ferrara, Peat Marwick's accountant at Crazy Eddie, lawsuits claim. **********At a 1987 meeting of Crazy Eddie's audit committee, Mr. Ferrara reported that he had investigated certain ""irregularities"" and found nothing, documents show. ""This is the closest thing we have to a smoking gun,"" said Max Folkenflik, an attorney representing some of the claimants. **********But Mr. Ferrara has testified that he was never told about the allegations of theft and thus never investigated them. As for the audit committee report, said Barabara Kraft, a spokeswoman for KPMG Main Hurdman, Mr. Ferrara has said the reference was to an unrelated matter."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/business/a-bank-that-lived-to-tell-the-tale.html,Michael Quint,1992-11-01,,2667,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,A Bank That Lived to Tell the Tale,A Bank That Lived to Tell the Tale," **********The dark days at the Shawmut Bank started in February 1990, when an army of 170 Federal examiners arrived at the bank's main offices in Massachusetts and Connecticut for what would prove to be a six-week audit of Shawmut's real estate loans. **********Shawmut, which had been confident enough to ask the examiners to come a month early, was stunned by the results. The examiners took a much dimmer view of repayment prospects than the bank did. Determined that they would not be accused of the slack supervision that helped topple the savings and loan industry, the regulators forced Shawmut to restate its 1989 results, turning a $202 million profit into a $129 million loss. **********""We were expecting a rainstorm, but they said we should be ready for a hurricane,"" said Joel B. Alvord, chairman of Shawmut, the third-largest bank in New England. **********Things got worse in January 1991, when the failure of the Bank of New England sent shivers through Shawmut's executive suites here. Like Shawmut, the Bank of New England had been deeply involved in real estate lending and had been hit hard by a massive examination of its loans in the early days of 1990. **********""Our customers and other people in the industry looked at us as a twin of Bank of New England, and figured that we were next,"" said Gunnar S. Overstrom, Shawmut's president. **********But Shawmut wasn't next. Today, Shawmut is profitable again, its portfolio of bad loans has shrunk and its prospects have been bright enough to attract new capital. The Banking 'Crisis' **********Shawmut's decline was more extreme than that of most banks, but the way it reversed its slide is representative of what many have done. Among other things, Shawmut began a crash program for dealing with defaulted loans and it tightened its lending standards. It also benefited from a widening spread between the interest rates it pays on deposits and the rates it collects on loans and investments. At Shawmut, that gap now averages 4.16 percent, compared with 3.47 percent two years ago. **********Indeed, the rebound at Shawmut and at scores of other once-troubled banks has been strong enough to convince many analysts that the banking industry is not heading for the kind of crisis that crippled the country's savings and loans. **********Talk of a banking crisis has been getting louder in the closing weeks of the Presidential campaign, thanks in part to a recent academic study, ""Banking on the Brink,"" which predicted up to 1,000 closings in coming years. Ross Perot cited the study in the final Presidential debate when he suggested that the Bush Administration was waiting for Tuesday's election to be over before closing a large number of banks and handing taxpayers ""a $100 billion problem."" **********But many industry experts say the study is misleading because it relies on 1991 data that do not reflect recent improvements and makes overly pessimistic estimates of losses on bad loans. **********At a Senate hearing last week, regulators conceded that some failures will occur after the election because of new rules taking effect Dec. 19 that require weakly capitalized banks to be closed. But the number -- and size -- of the failures will be relatively modest, they said. **********Many analysts agree. ""The crisis is over,"" said Lowell Bryan, a banking consultant at McKinsey & Company, quickly adding, however, that ""it can come back if the economy weakens further."" **********And that's the rub. Having proved that they are strong enough to survive, Shawmut and other banks must still show that they can prosper without taking the kind of excessive risks that marked the 80's. Even those banks that avoided the worst mistakes of the 80's admit they need to make fundamental improvements in how they operate. **********So far, the favorable spread in interest rates has been providing banks with the revenues they need to write off losses from bad loans and still show a profit. **********Shawmut, for example, cut its holdings of troubled loans and foreclosed real estate to $1.07 billion as of Sept. 30, from $1.68 billion in December 1990. The payoff: it started earning small profits in mid-1991. Bad loans have been declining for the banking system as a whole, allowing it to rack up record profits of $15.5 billion in the first half of this year. Recent third-quarter reports indicated that profits are continuing at a record level. **********Banks have also raised a record amount of capital by issuing new common and preferred stock, thereby increasing the cushion available to absorb unexpected losses. Shawmut raised $200 million in a stock offering earlier this year.  Buying Time **********But the favorable interest-rate spreads are only buying time, Mr. Bryan said. To avoid another crisis, he said, the banks must ""wring more profit out of the nuts and bolts of their branch systems, seriously address costs and become better lenders."" **********Indeed, in the heady days of the 70's and 80's, banks routinely grew faster than the economy, and the growth camouflaged a generation of sloppy lenders. **********""The real culprit of bank problems the past few years was the weakness in their credit culture,"" said George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities. ""Banks need to learn that a good defense is better than a good offense."" **********For his part, Shawmut's Mr. Alvord says ""the pendulum swung too far in both directions,"" with bankers failing to curb rash lending in the mid-1980's and regulators reacting with overly harsh treatment in 1990. **********Mr. Alvord, who is 53, came to the fore during the real estate bust of the mid-1970's, when he was put in charge of Connecticut National Bank's sour loans to real estate investment trusts. His success with those loans helped make him president of Connecticut National in 1978. When the bank merged with Shawmut in 1988, Mr. Alvord was named chairman of the new company. **********Yet even with that background, he was unable to avoid the real estate pitfalls of the 1980's. **********Although Shawmut and Connecticut National stopped making new lending commitments to real estate developers in 1988, their outstanding real estate loans still accounted for more than 25 percent of their total loans in 1990, or more than twice the average rate for banks their size. **********Because Shawmut's most serious problems were the result of bad loans, its lending operation quickly got extra attention. To solve the mistakes of the past, Mr. Alvord assigned about 500 people to do little else but work with troubled borrowers and foreclosed real estate. **********To avoid making the same mistakes in the future, Shawmut tightened its lending rules and, last February, hired David L. Eyles, a lending expert with 30 years' experience at Chemical Bank and Mellon Bank, to fill the new position of chief credit officer. **********Mr. Eyles is now pushing many business borrowers to provide the bank with audited financial statements, rather than a set of books prepared by the borrower with no outside review. On another tack, he insists that a borrower's internal covenants -- promises it made to the bank about maintaining its financial condition -- should be put in writing and checked periodically.  'Infernal' Covenants **********""I know that some of our lenders are talking about Eyles's 'infernal' covenants, but I don't care,"" Mr. Eyles said. ""At least they are talking about credit issues."" **********A key part of Mr. Eyles's job is to develop uniform standards for measuring loans that coincide with those used by Federal examiners. This would eliminate surprises like the one in 1990, when examiners told the bank it had $1.05 billion of troubled loans, not $535.6 million, as it thought. **********With uniform standards, for example, a 5-rated loan (a middle-of-the-road rating for small and medium-sized businesses that are Shawmut's bread and butter) would be reviewed quarterly, while a higher-quality 2-rated loan would be checked only once a year. **********The ratings can also point to trends. Mr. Eyles noted, for instance, that loans that drop to 5 from 2 are much more likely to cause a loss than those consistently rated 5. **********Such precision is a far cry from the lending practices of the 1980's. ""The competitive landscape is much different now, with fewer players and a much more rational market,"" Mr. Alvord said. The 80's were marked, he said, by ""an irrational pattern of pricing and credit standards that went beyond the limits of banking."" **********But while a few dozen large banks across the country are now far advanced in numerical ratings of loans, much work remains to be done. **********In theory, the next step is to use the ratings to set appropriate prices for different customers. For example, a loan to a 2-rated borrower might have a lower interest rate than a loan to a 5-rated borrower. **********But only a handful of banks, Shawmut not among them, have made the investment in a system to keep track of all business ties to a customer, and how much profit each produces. A bank that provides a company with cash management and financial advice for mergers could afford to charge a lower rate on a loan than another bank that had no connection to the company except the loan. **********While bad lending decisions brought Shawmut to its knees, its consumer business -- operating through 330 branches -- has been a mainstay keeping the company alive. Though third in size overall in New England, Shawmut has the biggest consumer operation in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. **********Shawmut has not tried to be a leader in new ventures like banking at home or debit cards. Instead, it has built a solid reputation for its early offering of such humdrum products as consolidated account statements and home-equity loans.  Pushing New Services **********Like many other bankers, Mr. Alvord is looking to wring more profit out of the consumer business by offering new services and investments through Shawmut's expensive-to-maintain branch network. **********""Joel saw in the mid-1980's that there was money to be made in consumer banking, even though that was not really a big part of tradition at the bank,"" said Eileen S. Kraus, executive vice president for community banking. **********Like many bankers, Ms. Kraus and Mr. Alvord say the nature of consumer banking is changing, with more demand from customers for help in managing their money. The demand for mutual funds and other investment vehicles is more than just a temporary reaction to low rates on deposits, bankers say. As the baby boomers grow older and become middle-aged savers, banks expect slower growth in lending but more growth in money management services. **********To take advantage of the situation, Shawmut's trust department, which had revenues last year of about $100 million and managed $12 billion of assets, is accepting smaller accounts and making more use of the bank's connections with owners and managers of local businesses. **********""We are blessed with a name that is very well known and a local market that is one of the wealthiest in the country,"" Mr. Alvord said. **********For consumers not wealthy enough to need a trust account, Shawmut is using the trust department as adviser for a new group of mutual funds. Although Shawmut is a late arrival to the mutual fund business, the delay has allowed it to take advantage of a recent ruling by Federal regulators permitting banks to put their names on funds offered to customers. **********""We did a lot of comparison shopping, and decided that rather than just jamming someone else's product into our branches using their sales force, we would take the time to develop a product and a distribution system that we would control,"" said Ms. Kraus.  Looking Ahead **********With the strength of Shawmut's branch system still intact, new managers overseeing corporate lending and an improved financial condition, Mr. Alvord says he is not running scared from the two largest New England banking companies, the Bank of Boston, which recently bought a large savings bank in Hartford, and Fleet Financial of Providence, R.I., which bought most of the failed Bank of New England in 1991. **********""They want what we have,"" he said, referring to efforts by both to expand in Shawmut's markets. **********The acquisitive drive of other banks may hold the key to Shawmut's future. Plans for a merger with Bank of Boston were far advanced in 1991, but fell apart as Shawmut's health improved and advisers to both sides questioned the fairness of the deal. **********But the failure of that deal does not keep many analysts from predicting that another merger lies ahead for Shawmut. Assuming that its loan problems continue to subside, they expect several banks -- including Chase Manhattan and BankAmerica, as well as Bank of Boston and Fleet -- to covet Shawmut's ties to consumers and businesses. **********Mr. Alvord isn't tipping his hand. But he is clearly bullish about the future, predicting ""dramatic increases"" in earnings for the next two years and a 50 percent jump in size -- to $35 billion in assets -- within five. Not bad for a bank whose strategic plan in the last couple of years, according to Mr. Alvord, was simply ""to stay alive.""  TURNING BRANCHES INTO SALES BOUTIQUES **********With 56,000 bank branches scattered around the country, bankers have a delivery network unmatched in breadth by other financial service companies. It is also unmatched in expense. **********While branch closings have become more common lately -- even a consumer-oriented bank like Shawmut has closed 160 in the past four years -- bankers still count on branches as critical to expansion of their consumer business. **********In the selling of mutual funds, for example, ""the bank's customer relationships and branches can be critical advantages, if there is someone at the bank to sit down with the customer and ask the right questions,"" said Michael J. Rothmeier, executive vice president at Shawmut and formerly an executive at the Fidelity Group of mutual funds. **********Mr. Rothmeier says there is plenty of opportunity for banks since no more than 28 percent of the nearly 70 million households with money available for investments are being served by mutual fund companies. **********To make better use of branches as a vehicle for selling and to cut expenses, bankers are eager to reduce the use of branches for ordinary transactions. **********Laura Jean Stuart, a bank consultant in Cambridge, Mass., expects that more banks will begin pricing their products to encourage customers to use the high technology on which banks have spent tens of billions of dollars. For example, by charging lower fees to customers whose paychecks are deposited directly by employers or who use automatic teller machines or the telephone, banks would need fewer tellers. That would leave more branch employees free for sales work. **********THE CREDIT PENDULUM **********As Shawmut and other banks have corrected the lending excesses of the 1980's, they have run into criticism for lending too cautiously, creating a credit crunch that has hurt the economy. **********All three Presidential candidates say they want more bank lending. But there are major differences in the way they would accomplish that goal. **********President Bush would broaden the banks' powers, allowing them to fully enter the securities business, freely branch across state lines, sell and underwrite insurance and be owned by non-banking companies. Many analysts say the benefits would accrue mostly to a few dozen large banks and take years to appear. **********Gov. Bill Clinton would encourage bank lending by ending overly harsh treatment by regulators and through a set of proposals aimed at helping the poorest areas of the country. Using the South Shore Bank of Chicago and other bank-sponsored community development corporations as models, he foresees a network of 100 community development banks. Existing banks would be encouraged to do more lending in poor areas, either directly or indirectly by helping the new development banks. **********Ross Perot has pointed out the contradictory policies of regulators, who exhort banks to do more lending and at the same time impose tougher financial standards that have the effect of discouraging lending. Mr. Perot has also warned that many banks, including some of the largest, are weaker than they appear, but he has not said how this weakness should be corrected."

Baker 3d was presented with a report stating that Iraq was harboring Palestinian terrorists, continuing its chemical and biological weapons buildup and reviving its border dispute with Kuwait, according to a newly declassified State Department document made public today. **********But the memo, which came six months before President Bush issued a formal order to forge closer ties with President Saddam Hussein, also urged Mr. Baker to take a conciliatory stance in his first meeting with a senior Iraqi official a short time later. **********The March 24, 1989, report was drafted for Mr. Baker by his senior Middle East adviser in preparation for a meeting in Washington with Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister. He was described in the memo as ""a unique channel to Iraq's President."" It is the earliest articulation by a senior official that has come to light of the Bush Administration's willingness to smooth over obstacles and problems to improve relations with Baghdad. **********The memo said Iraq ""retains heavy-handed approach to foreign affairs,"" adding that it was reviving a border dispute with Kuwait while also meddling in Lebanon. The memo also said the Iraqis were ""working hard"" to develop chemical and biological weapons as well as new missiles.  Pleased at Close Ties **********But the memo's author urged Mr. Baker to stress how ""pleased"" the new Administration was that the two countries had become closer, and to note that Mr. Bush had told the Iraqi leader in a message that the United States attaches ""great importance to our relations with Iraq."" **********Although the memo, written by Paul J. Hare, the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, included strongly critical language on Iraq's harboring of terrorists, it was much softer in its account of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds just months before and Baghdad's continued development of a military arsenal. **********Mr. Baker was told to repeat the State Department's earlier requests that Iraq deny access to Palestinian terrorists, including Abul Abbas, the man who masterminded the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship during which an elderly American Jew was killed and thrown overboard. Other documents have shown that the State Department during both the Reagan and Bush Administrations had detailed knowledge of terrorist activities by Palestinians based in Baghdad.  Billions in Trade Allowed **********By removing Iraq from the list of sponsors of terrorism in 1982, the State Department paved the way for billions of dollars in American trade with Iraq, and the two Republican Administrations resisted repeated moves in Congress to put Iraq back on the list. **********As for Iraq's use of chemical weapons, the State Department couched its concerns in a positive light, telling Baghdad that Iraq's past use of such weapons was ""very sensitive"" to officials in both the Administration and Congress, and that Iraq's participation in efforts to ban chemical weapons will help its ""reputation in the world."" **********The memo disclosed that Baghdad had asked the United States to delete all specific references to Iraq in bills pending in Congress to impose trade sanctions against it for its chemical weapons' use, but the State Department replied that it would be ""unrealistic"" to ask Congress to do so. 'Strongest State in Region' **********At that time, the State Department was most worried that Iraq was declining to pay compensation for its 1987 missile attack on the frigate Stark in which 37 American servicemen were killed, according to the memo. ""Overcoming this obstacle will give our relationship new strength in the postwar period,"" the memo said. **********It concluded: ""Bilateral relations are thorny but important. Iraq is the strongest state in a region vital to our interests with a powerful army and oil reserves second only to the Saudis."" **********The document was made public in a speech in the House today by Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who has used his position as chairman of the powerful House Banking Committee to lead the charge in Congress against the Administration's policy toward Iraq before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. **********In a related matter in Atlanta, Judge Marvin Shoob of the United States District Court there today rejected a motion to withdraw the guilty plea of a banker involved in arranging billions of dollars in loans to Iraq without the knowledge of the bank's headquarters in Rome. The banker's lawyer, Bobby Lee Cook, had tried to show that Federal agents had pressed his client, Christopher P. Drogoul, to plead guilty to charges that he made unauthorized loans and lied both to his bank superiors and Federal investigators. **********Instead, Mr. Cook charged that the Bush Administration knew about the huge lending and chose to ignore it to further its policy toward Iraq. But Judge Shoob, who has been highly critical of the Government's handling of the case, nonetheless announced that he would proceed with the sentencing hearing of Mr. Drogoul."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/16/world/serbian-snipers-content-to-let-sarajevo-just-bleed.html,Roger Cohen,1992-09-16,,1001,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Serbian Snipers Content to Let Sarajevo Just Bleed,Serbian Snipers Content to Let Sarajevo Just Bleed," **********From the Serbian sniper position known as No. 8, a bombed-out nightclub that has been converted into a heavily protected bunker, there is a magnificent view of this besieged city along the banks of the Miljacka River. **********The Bosnian capital, in which nobody seems to stir, is dotted with the minarets of mosques and the spires of churches, built as expressions of religious faith but now stark symbols of the conflict between Orthodox Christian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims that has ravaged the city. At one end of the panorama commanded by No. 8 there is the yellowish Holiday Inn, and at the other the Bascarsija market district, all perfectly visible through telescopic sights. **********""This is a good position and we fight only to keep it,"" said Sgt. Ranko Cosovic, as he crouched behind a barrier of sandbags and chopped timber. ""We have no interest in attacking lower down."" **********As he spoke, there was the continuous crackle of automatic weapons fire and the regular boom of mortars. With each burst of gunfire, the men called out, ""Sniper! Sniper!"" -- referring to Muslim gunmen beneath them -- and warned their visitors to keep down. 'Why Should We Do More' **********However, during an hourlong visit to the Serbian bunker, perched on the thyme-clad Trebevic Mountain rising above the south side of the city, there was no direct fire on the position and the dozen Serbs present did not use their weapons. **********Sergeant Cosovic's insistence that his men had no interest in attacking down the mountain underscored a fact that is strikingly apparent at Serbian military posts ringing the city. While the position of the Serbs is utterly commanding, the war in Sarajevo does not appear to be one they wish to win in any conventional sense. For example, the Serbian soldiers said they had no plans to attack even vulnerable Muslim-held houses just 150 yards down the mountain, with which they regularly exchange fire. **********A soldier who would give only his first name, Cedo, said: ""We shoot when fired at. This is a commanding position, so why should we do more?"" **********Already holding about 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs seem content to maintain the city as a wound that can bleed a little every time they wish to turn up the pressure on Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic. The forces of Mr. Izetbegovic, meanwhile, appear to have a virtually hopeless task in trying to break out of the city, as they have already tried unsuccessfully to do on the Trebevic Mountain below the Serbian position. **********Since Bosnia gained independence from Yugoslavia in April, its Serbs, who account for 32 percent of the population, have refused to accept Mr. Izetbegovic's Government and have gone to war to fight for the right to govern themselves. They have been backed by the leadership of the Serbian Republic, which dominates the Government of the rump Yugoslavia and its army. Liberally provisioned and reinforced by the Yugoslav Army, the Bosnian Serbs have held Sarajevo under siege since April. Relatives Remain in City **********The men gathered at No. 8 and the building they occupy offer a fair illustration of the broken lives and steadily growing hatred that characterize the Bosnian war. The bunker was converted from a popular nightclub and hotel called the Osmice in which Serbs, Muslims and Croats from Sarajevo used to gather to enjoy live music. **********Now it is little more than a charred ruin, hung with pinups and ammunition belts, packed with machine guns and protected by sandbags and timber cut from the towering pine trees on the surrounding mountain. **********From here, the soldiers look down on their own city and, in some cases, their own relatives, who remain trapped there. One, who would identify himself only as Zeljko, said that he had been obliged to abandon his import-export business in Sarajevo at the beginning of the war and that both his parents were still living in the city near the Skenderia sports complex. **********Asked if this meant he might be firing on his own family, he said with a shrug and a wry smile, ""Yes, in theory this is possible."" **********Sergeant Cosovic has also lived in Sarajevo all his life. He worked in a factory, but joined the army of the self-declared Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on April 17, shortly after the war began. Since then, he said, the fighting has convinced him that no return to the multi-ethnic tolerance with which Sarajevo previously lived is possible. **********""With all the hatred there is now,"" he said, ""the only way to peace is the division of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We Serbs cannot live in a unitary state governed by Mr. Izetbegovic, who wants a Muslim state in the middle of Europe."" **********Along with other soldiers, he suggested that this division would somehow have to include Sarajevo, which would have to create distinct geographical areas of administration for each ethnic and religious group. **********The soldiers, who did not have any heavy weapons although some shoulder-mounted grenade launchers could be seen, said they had not received any visits from United Nations observers. Under an agreement made at a Balkan peace conference in London last month, the Serbs are obliged to permit United Nations monitoring only of Serbian artillery and heavy arms. **********""The tempo is just the same here,"" Sergeant Cosovic said. ""The London conference has changed absolutely nothing."""

The phones are busy, or a caller is left in hold limbo, or when the caller does get through the technician says, ""I'll have to call you back on that."" **********Increasingly, administrators and vendors alike are seeking an alternative to the telephone support bottleneck: the public access database services that are available to anyone with a computer and a modem. The services generally charge for each minute a caller's computer is connected to the service's computers. H. & R Block's Compuserve Information Service, for example, charges 20 cents a minute. **********Compuserve, as well as General Videotex Inc.'s Byte Information Exchange, General Electric's GEnie and Ziff-Davis' Ziffnet, offer a neutral venue for users of a particular software, or range of software from a particular vendor, to solve networking problems. **********Users are flocking to the services because their peers are offering tips, alerts about software bugs and general encouragement about every aspect of networking. Vendors are participating, too, because someone else foots the bill for the equipment and phone lines and the demands on their support staffs is lightened. Much of the technical support comes from other users of the networking software, usually administrators. **********Within each of the services, there are areas called forums or special interest groups devoted to specific topics. More often than not, vendors sponsor the groups. On Compuserve, for example, there are more than 50 forums that deal with networking issues. Every major network vendor has at least one forum. (Novell Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation each have nine.) Some forums, however, are run independently by so-called system operators, known among the cognoscenti as sysops, who have no connection with the vendor. **********In some cases, users moving to a forum or special interest group on one of the services even generate revenues for the software vendor. On Compuserve, for example, part of the caller's connect fee is shared with the vendor. **********""For a company like Microsoft, the royalty check is a drop in their revenue stream. It probably pays for the staff that administers the forums,"" said Sharon McGee, of Compuserve. **********Software and hardware makers also incorporate use of forums into their marketing plans, announcing new versions of software and hardware and promoting new services. Participants in the forums also can exchange messages with each other, posting them for all to read. Complaints and compliments about a company or a product are aired freely, and company representatives often reply, their responses available for all to see."

And Wall Street is a bit nervous about the prospect. **********Last week share prices gyrated and bond prices fell as investor attention began to focus on just what President Bush will propose Tuesday night in his annual State of the Union Address. **********The last time Washington did something about the economy was in the fall of 1990, when Congress and Mr. Bush agreed to raise taxes. In retrospect, that seems dumb from almost any perspective. The budget deficit did not decline -- unemployed workers and bankrupt companies tend to pay less in taxes no matter what the rate -- but the economy did go into what Mr. Bush now describes, in surprising overstatement, as a ""free fall."" **********Now it seems possible that Mr. Bush will reverse course and call for tax cuts. Or maybe he won't. Mr. Bush has never been known as a model of ideological consistency, and now he risks being portrayed by opponents as a President whose only principle is winning elections. With his aides split, the result may be a compromise proposal that will be dead as soon as it is made. **********That might be viewed as good news on Wall Street, where fear runs high that the Government will only make things worse. The consensus view, widely but not deeply held, is that the economy is finally starting to recover anyway, as shown by rising housing starts. **********The economy is not the only thing that Mr. Bush is supposed to fix. The rising cost of health care, which has acted as a tax on the economy and may help to explain the economic malaise, is the other. Unfortunately, Washington seems unclear regarding which of two problems it is supposed to correct: the fact that many people can't afford health care or the fact that health care siphons off an ever-rising share of national income. Most solutions to fix one would hurt the other. **********What may emerge from the debate is a new effort to control medical costs with price controls on suppliers, a proposal that might put a halt to the bull market in health stocks. **********That kind of proposal could do better now because the climate seems more open to some kinds of government intervention in the economy, as was shown by the general approval given to the Government's proposal to intervene to prevent squeezes in the Treasury bond market. If prices are too high for a particular bond, the Treasury will just print a few more bonds. Richard Sylla, an economic historian, compares the idea to Ulysses Grant's decision, after much hesitation, to sell Treasury gold in 1869, breaking Jay Gould's attempt to corner that market. **********Bond market intervention may work, but it could also create problems. Valuable information on Government plans could leak, enriching some traders. To this day, no one knows how Gould learned of Grant's plan to sell gold, but he evidently did. Just before the market crashed, Gould sold most of his gold at high prices."

Consequently, said Walter E. Mattson, president and chief operating officer of the Times Company, no date has yet been set for the sale. Battle for the Suburbs **********The move follows a bruising competition between The Daily News and The Journal and Constitution for readers in Atlanta's affluent and rapidly growing northern suburbs. **********""We are proud of the fine job performed by our employees in Gwinnett,"" Mr. Mattson said. ""They produced an excellent newspaper and fought a tough battle against a very aggressive competitor. Unfortunately, in spite of all their efforts, the newspaper consistently lost money with no hope of reversing those losses."" **********The proposed sale is expected to reduce the Times Company's third-quarter earnings by about $35 million after taxes, or 45 cents a share. The Times Company issued a statement saying that because it had earlier placed a hiring freeze on its Regional Newspaper Group, it would be able to offer jobs at other newspapers in the group to many of the 290 Gwinnett employees. **********""The company had the hope, which proved to be unachievable, that the market dynamics could be changed,"" said Peter P. Appert of C. J. Lawrence, a Wall Street brokerage firm. **********From the time The New York Times Company bought The Daily News in July 1987, the paper grew quickly, almost doubling its average daily circulation to 50,589 at the end of 1991. But the paper did not achieve the financial expectations reflected in the Times Company's investment, a purchase price of $90 million plus $40 million for new offices in 1990. **********The recession held down advertising sales. Growth in Gwinnett County, which had been rapid in the 1980's, started to slow. Responding to Competition **********Also, The Journal and Constitution ""woke up to the competitive threat,"" Mr. Appert said. When The Daily News switched from afternoon to morning publication in May 1988, The Journal and Constitution, which have a combined daily circulation of more than 480,000, increased their coverage of the region to daily from weekly and distributed free newspapers in the area for several days. **********The Daily News, which started daily publication in 1965, began publishing as a weekly in 1898 as The Gwinnett News-Herald. **********The Times Company hired a newspaper broker, Dirks, Van Essen & Associates, to solicit bids for the paper. The Dirks firm spoke with more than 40 potential purchasers, but none wanted to keep the newspaper open, given the competition and market factors."

But the idea that an operating nuclear plant is not competitive with other sources of electricity violates the fundamental logic of nuclear power, which is that plants may be expensive to build but are cheap to run. **********""It used to be that everyone said, once you built it, there wasn't any question that costs were lower,"" said Victor Gilinsky, an energy consultant and former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""Now they are more expensive to run than other plants."" Aging Steam Generators **********In the next few years, at least 10 utilities will need to replace steam generators, which are giant heat exchangers that have shown a tendency to rust and crack, said Gary R. Doughty, an expert on plant life extension with the Nielsen Wurster Group, a consulting firm in Hartford. The job generally runs about $150 million for each reactor. **********Other utilities face questions about the condition of their reactor vessels, the great steel pots that hold the fuel. Years of bombardment by neutrons, the subatomic particles that sustain a chain reaction, are known to make metal more brittle, but the extent of the problem is not clear. **********Some utilities that operate a single reactor may be tempted to pull the plug, he said, because that would allow elimination of an entire division. **********In Rowe, Mass., the owners of the 32-year-old Yankee Rowe reactor decided in February that the plant was too small and too old to justify the investment needed to keep it in service, given the general power surplus in its region. Southern California Edison reached a similar judgment recently about its 24-year-old San Onofre 1 plant near San Clemente, although the plant has not yet been shut. And last year the Sacramento Municipal Utility District decided to shut the Rancho Seco plant as uneconomic at the age of 15. Others around the country were retired in earlier years, some at even younger ages. **********With only a handful of additional plants likely to be finished and no new ones on order, the result could be an accelerated march to the extinction of nuclear power in the United States. Currently, 108 are operating, producing about 20 percent of the nation's electricity. Some of those, however, are doing very well; in 1991, 25 plants set records for themselves in the number of kilowatt-hours produced. **********John F. Ahearne, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now the director of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, said that plants that were not economic were more likely to be shut now than they would have been a few years ago. In the last 10 years, he said, the utilities have come to be dominated by business managers, replacing what he called ""technologists,"" or ""people who were committed to nuclear power because they thought it was just a good thing for this country."" The Bottom Line **********In the view of the business managers, he said, ""the role of a utility is to make money."" They are the people who canceled over-budget reactor construction projects in the 1980's, he said, and they are willing to shut plants now if there are cheaper alternatives. **********The price of oil, which is currently low, plays a small role in keeping the electricity market highly competitive, especially in places like New York, which uses oil for about 20 percent of electricity generation. But nationally, electricity made from oil is less than 5 percent of total generation. **********Natural gas plays a far larger role, because it represents about 10 percent of the utilities' fuel use nationally, and about half the generators recently completed or under construction use natural gas. On the basis of energy content, natural gas prices have been substantially below oil prices recently. **********In addition, overall demand for power has been driven down by recession and by conservation measures, with utilities often subsidizing customers' installation of light bulbs, motors and other devices that will do the same work with less power. Price May Rise **********Some experts believe that as the economy turns around, the demand for power will rise and hence its price. In addition, requirements of the new Clean Air Act will raise the cost of coal-fired power, and if the United States institutes a carbon tax in the next few years to stave off global warming, that would make nuclear power more competitive, too. **********Experts are not sure how many nuclear plants will shut in this decade. The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Ivan Selin, said in a telephone interview that three or four were vulnerable soon. Mr. Ahearne said it could be 10 by the end of the decade. **********Mr. Selin said it was unlikely that any utility would decide to close a plant that was running smoothly and was not in immediate need of any big investment. But if a plant required a large investment, he said, ""that could push it over the brink."" In that category he put the Consumers Power Company's Palisades plant, near South Haven, Mich., which opened in 1971, where the pressure vessel may now be brittle, the same weakness that was suspected at Yankee Rowe; Consumers Power's Big Rock Point plant, in Charlevoix, Mich., opened in 1965, which has no known significant flaws but is by far the smallest still operating, and Rochester Gas and Electric's Robert E. Ginna plant, near Rochester, which opened in 1970 and faces the expensive replacement of its steam generators. **********All those plants are old and fairly small. Mr. Selin said it was far from clear whether the problem would extend into the large plants that entered service in the mid-1970's. But it might, he said in a telephone interview. **********""There are two ways of looking at it,"" Mr. Selin said. ""You can say each is different, and there is no trend, or you can say there's an underlying trend here. The financial people are beginning to worry about an underlying trend."" **********In fact, Lehman Brothers organized a conference for utility investors last month on the question of whether old plants were still economic. It drew two dozen investment managers. **********The Utility Data Institute, a firm in Washington that charts operating costs, reported recently that in 1990 fuel, operating and maintenance expenses at nuclear plants came to $21.89 for one thousand kilowatt-hours produced, about as much electricity as a typical household uses in two months. At a coal plant, the fuel, operating and maintenance cost for the same amount of energy was $20.24. The coal cost was up slightly in 1990 and the nuclear cost down compared with 1989, but nuclear has exceeded coal for the last several years. **********Those figures are an average for all nuclear plants, meaning that some are significantly higher. Relicensing a Question **********The old reactors have a variety of factors working against them. **********Mr. Doughty of Nielsen Wurster pointed out that a plant that was nearing the expiration of its 40-year operating license and needed major investments would have to face the economics of amortizing the expenses over the few remaining years of operation. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has established a policy for granting license extensions, but no plant has yet applied and no one is sure how easy it will be to get one. **********Carl A. Goldstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations arm, said that more plants would probably be found to be uneconomic, but that the point at which a plant should be written off could not be defined until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission made clearer what would be required for a plant to be re-licensed. And nuclear economics could improve, he said, because plant operating and maintenance expenses could decline. **********Mr. Doughty said that investing new money still made good sense for most plants, but that he feared that reactors with 6,000 megawatts of capacity, or about 6 percent of the nation's total nuclear capacity, would shut in the next few years. Reason to Stay Open **********How much is ultimately closed may depend on how state rate regulators handle the costs, said Peter Bradford, the chairman of the Public Service Commission in New York and also a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Bradford, a speaker at the Lehman Brothers session, said a utility with a large investment in a reactor might seek to keep it running so it could continue to collect depreciation, even if cheaper power were available elsewhere. **********That, he said, would create a conflict between the interest of customers, who would want the plant closed, and the interest of the utility, which would want to let it run. The solution, he said, would be to allow utilities to write off plants that had become economically obsolete, and collect the investment from customers. **********""Otherwise, the utility doesn't have the incentive to make the right decision,"" he said."

He said the matter could be resolved ""in the near future."" **********Mr. Honecker, a lifelong Communist who was imprisoned by the Nazis in World War II, was East Germany's principal leader from 1971 until 1989.  He was deposed by his fellow Communists, who were seeking unsuccessfully to salvage their Government in the face of nationwide unrest. **********Mr. Honecker fled to the Soviet Union in March 1991, and nine months later, after the collapse of Communist rule there, sought asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Moscow. **********A Foreign Ministry spokesman said he could not set a date for Mr. Honecker's return, but asserted that negotiations ""have reached a point where a solution is in sight."" **********Mr. Honecker's lawyer, Friederich Wolf, dismissed the reports as ""a flat lie, absolutely crazy."" He said that he spoke with his client this week, and had discussed no new developments. **********But the news agency A.D.N., formerly East Germany's official agency, quoted officials in Moscow as saying Mr. Honecker was expected to return to Germany this weekend. **********Officials in Bonn said Mr. Honecker had accepted the idea that his return was now inevitable, but was demanding that he be allowed to remain free at least until the trial. An arrest order against him is outstanding, but could be revoked by the presiding judge. **********German leaders have been pressing for Mr. Honecker's return since the day he slipped away with the help of allies in Moscow. At the environmental summit conference in Rio de Janeiro last month, Mr. Kohl discussed the issue with President Patricio Aylwin of Chile. According to later reports from Chile, the two men agreed that Mr. Honecker would be asked to leave his embassy sanctuary in July. **********North Korea has offered to accept Mr. Honecker, but the Russian authorities say they will not give him permission to go to the airport unless it is to board a plane for Germany. **********Since Mr. Honecker's flight into exile last year, several former East German border guards have been tried and convicted on charges of shooting citizens who were trying to escape westward. The guards asserted that they were following orders, and newly discovered documents confirmed that a shoot-to-kill order was in effect. **********In an 800-page indictment issued last month, Berlin prosecutors asserted that Mr. Honecker and five other former East German leaders were responsible for killings at the wall. The indictment charged Mr. Honecker, together with former Prime Minister Willi Stoph and the former secret police chief, Erich Mielke, with 49 counts of manslaughter. Mr. Stoph and Mr. Mielke are already in custody. **********In a second indictment, Mr. Honecker was charged with stealing more than $9 million from the Government to pay for imported goods and other items to support his luxurious habits."

Yerxa, the deputy United States trade representative and ambassador to the talks in Geneva, began reaching again for an agreement last Monday as negotiators from the 108-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade met to start reviewing a nearly comprehensive draft text. But the European Community, followed by Japan and Mexico, objected that the proposal went too far in curbing government assistance to farmers. **********The same complaint scuttled a conference of trade ministers in Brussels 13 months ago and has prompted warnings every couple of months since that the entire round of talks, which began five years ago in Uruguay, could collapse. **********""Time is running out on the Uruguay Round,"" Mr. Yerxa said in a telephone interview Thursday. **********Some American farmers, like sugar cane and peanut growers, depend on protection. But most are internationally competitive and have been lobbying Congress for more free trade in food. **********Mr. Yerxa, who is 40, spent 13 years as a staff lawyer for Democrats in Congress and at the International Trade Commission, a semi-independent Federal agency. While a student, he did a series of internships with Senator Brock Adams, Democrat of Washington. **********Apparently, this background has not created problems within the Administration.

The auction is considered by many interest-rate watchers as a good barometer of what banks might be paying their depositors in the weeks ahead. 3-Month Rate at 3.75% **********The average rate on a three-month bill was unchanged at 3.75 percent and the six-month bill rate also remained at the previous week's level of 3.90 percent. **********Robert K. Heady, the publisher of the interest-rate publication, also noted some easing in the recent modest declines, but he does not see an upturn yet. **********""If we begin to receive more bullish news about the economy like this week's leading indicators, then banks' interest rates will turn up,"" Mr. Heady said. ""But one rosy indicator does not a trend make. If the economic news is mixed as it has been over the last couple of months, then rates will remain depressed longer."" Money Market Yield at 3.41% **********Yields at New York area banks were down, but the decline was a little less than the previous week, as the average money market account dropped by 3 basis points, to 3.41 percent. The yield on three- and six-month certificates declined by 2 basis points and 1 basis point, respectively, to 3.52 percent and 3.69 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********Commercial banks, which make up half of the New York area's composite index, slightly lowered the yield of an average money market account to 3.19 percent, down by 2 basis points, and cut those on the average three-month and six-month certificate, by a basis point each, to 3.38 percent and 3.46 percent, respectively. **********Savings banks, which make up the other half of the composite index, made more significant cuts, lowering the average money market account yield by 5 basis points, to 3.62 percent; a three-month C.D. yield by 4 basis points, to 3.67 percent, and a six-month C.D. yield by 3 basis points, to 3.92 percent. Big Cuts in New York **********The sharpest yield changes were among the New York savings banks. First Nationwide dropped 20 basis points from its money matket account yield, to 3.80 percent, and the Anchor Savings Bank trimmed its three-month C.D. yield by 11 basis points, to 3.64 percent. Crossland Savings, for the second time in as many weeks, chopped a quarter of a percentage point off its six-month C.D. yield, to 4 percent. **********For 20 large banks outside the New York market, yields were also down, but less so, with a money market account off by 2 basis points, to 3.27 percent, and a six-month C.D. off a basis point, to 3.63 percent."

Entreaties Aren't Heeded **********After six days of intense, secret negotiations, the Saudis gave up, going away red-faced and empty-handed. The Fed made the charges public. **********The Saudi bank is charged with failing to report purchases of stock in First American Bankshares, the largest bank holding company in Washington, which was illegally and secretly controlled by B.C.C.I. The purchases, made in concert with the bank's former chief executive, Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz, were made from an affiliate of B.C.C.I. and involved loans from National Commercial Bank to people acting on behalf of B.C.C.I. **********American regulators last month ordered National Commercial to close its New York branch. At the same time, the Saudi bank sold off its huge silver holdings in an effort to raise cash quickly, causing silver prices to drop sharply in markets around the world. **********In recent months, the B.C.C.I. scandal has grown from a criminal investigation of a huge fraud by rogue financiers -- perhaps the largest financial fraud ever -- to envelop some of America's staunchest allies in the Persian Gulf. And the diplomatic ramifications have left the State Department and some other American officials queasy. **********In addition to examining the roles in the scandal of some of Saudi Arabia's most prominent businessmen, many of whom have links to the royal family, investigators are now looking at the actions of members of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates. Family members were the principal owners of B.C.C.I. when it was shut down last year. While the family members have portrayed themselves as the biggest victims of the fraud, some investigators have publicly questioned whether they helped to carry it out.  American officials say they are certain that the royal family is deeply shaken, fearful that a scandal could erode confidence in the kingdom's once-unassailable banking system. **********""It is obviously a major banking crisis and a serious problem,"" said one senior Administration official who closely follows the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""They are concerned about what implications it will have for the Saudi banking system as a whole. We have told them their concerns have been noted and the best thing to do is to clean up the whole B.C.C.I. mess."" **********At one point, King Fahd took the highly unusual step of calling in the United States Ambassador, Charles W. Freeman Jr., to express his surprise and dismay that a local prosecutor in New York City had indicted Sheik Khalid, a descendant of the esteemed family that co-founded National Commercial Bank. Until recently, Sheik Khalid was its chief executive. **********The King sought to distance himself from Sheik Khalid, saying that it was unfortunate that a Saudi might have run afoul of American banking regulations, but stressing that the banker's actions had nothing to do with the Saudi Government and banking system, said senior Administration officials who were briefed on the meeting. Ties to Royal Family **********But Sheik Khalid is not just another banker, and National Commercial is not just another bank. Sheik Khalid is viewed as the personal banker to King Fahd; the bank, which is rooted in a decades-old money-changing operation in Mecca, is inextricably linked to the Saudi Arabian economy and its Government. **********At one point, King Fahd made an extraordinary request to Mr. Freeman: would United States banking authorities make an official statement attesting to the strength and independence of the Saudi banking system? Mr. Freeman, uncomfortably, had to say no, telling the King that the United States Government could not interfere in a criminal investigation or publicly pass judgment on the strength of another country's banking system. **********""The Ambassador said that the individual bank has to be judged on its merits,"" one senior Administration official said. ""You can't give a Good Housekeeping seal of approval to it.""  American officials say they have done nothing to interfere with the investigations of other prominent Saudi businessmen and had nothing to do with negotiations that led to a sudden and dramatic plea agreement on Monday by Sheik Kamal Adham, a former chief of Saudi foreign intelligence. **********Dean St. Denis, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the agency had no discussions with the Central Intelligence Agency or the State Department about its investigations of Saudi businessmen connected to B.C.C.I. Peter Earnest, a spokesman for the C.I.A., would say only that the agency has a policy ""of not commenting on the affiliation of any individual or lack thereof with the C.I.A."" Through a spokesman, Edwin D. Williamson, the State Department's legal adviser, declined to comment. **********The C.I.A. has acknowledged that it used B.C.C.I., but has insisted that its involvement with the shadowy bank was confined to legitimate banking activities. Agency officials have declined to discuss details of the involvement, asserting that public disclosure could jeopardize intelligence operations. The C.I.A. first received information in the 1980's about B.C.C.I.'s illegal control of First American. Baker Said to Avoid Issue **********And senior Administration officials and people close to the Saudi Government say both sides are eager to play down the impact of the banking scandal on American-Saudi relations. They note that the issue was not raised when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met privately with King Fahd or when he dined with Prince Saud al-Faisal during a visit to Saudi Arabia in July. **********And, these officials say, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, has not made an issue of the matter in meetings with the State Department and White House.  Other officials and people close to the Saudi Government say the issue is so embarrassing to King Fahd that it would be out of character for him to raise it in a one-on-one meeting with the Secretary of State. Family connections may have inhibited the two princes from speaking out. One defendant in the case, Sheik Kamal, is the uncle of Prince Saud and of Prince Bandar's wife. **********As a measure of the close relationship between the King and the people involved in the case, the lawyers for Sheik Kamal warned American prosecutors that their client would have to get the King's permission before cooperating with an investigation, one law enforcement official said. The prosecutors were unmoved, and the sheik pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to pay $105 million in fines. **********B.C.C.I., which was chartered in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and had branches in 70 countries, was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators of various nations, who accused it of worldwide fraud. Liquidators have been unable to find much of the bank's assets, which were reported to be $20 billion shortly before the shutdown. U.S. Lawyers Indicted **********On Wednesday, the bank's principal American lawyers, former Defense Secretary Clark M. Clifford and his partner, Robert A. Altman, were indicted on charges of helping B.C.C.I. gain control of First American, and of accepting bribes from B.C.C.I. Both men pleaded not guilty. **********Law enforcement officials say the next phase of the B.C.C.I. investigation will focus on other Saudis, including Sheik Abdul Raouf Khalil, an obscure businessman who worked in Saudi intelligence under Sheik Kamal and went on to become a senior member of Saudi intelligence, according to past and present Western intelligence officials. **********The Fed has accused both sheiks of helping B.C.C.I. secretly purchase First American. State charges were filed in New York because First American owned a bank there."

A Business Plan for a Peace Economy"," **********PRESIDENT BUSH and Gov. Bill Clinton both plan to cut military spending. Mr. Bush has said he will reduce it by 20 percent by 1997, while Mr. Clinton aims to cut it by 30 percent. Either cut would be painful. Using figures from this fiscal year's Federal budget and from the Defense Department, I calculate that 1,044,026 jobs will be lost under Mr. Bush's plan and 1,566,044 jobs will be lost under Mr. Clinton's. **********But winning the cold war does not have to be a Pyrrhic victory. The United States as a whole, the states affected by any spending cuts and the nation's industries can and should treat peace as an opportunity for social and economic growth. But to do that they must implement new strategies on the national, state and industry levels. **********The choice the new President will have to make is between using the savings from military cutbacks to reduce the Federal deficit and using it to enhance the nation's competitiveness. In the short term, reducing the deficit will increase unemployment and decrease the gross national product; in the long term, it will increase national savings and investment and stimulate economic growth. **********In the short term, investing in competitiveness will not reduce the deficit, but it will reduce unemployment and increase the size of the economy. It will also result in a stronger America, better positioned to compete against those countries that built up their industries while we built up our military. **********The states most affected by military cutbacks must develop plans of their own. They have two complementary strategies available to them.  States can look at the impending reductions in military spending as opportunities to change their employment mix and to widen their economic base. They can do this by helping existing companies within the state grow, and by persuading out-of-state companies to invest within their borders. **********States can also try to get a larger share of shrinking defense spending by encouraging companies to become low-cost producers and by helping them produce for niche markets. **********Industries faced with cutbacks in military orders must also adopt new strategies if they are to survive. To become more competitive they can: *********** Downsize to meet reduced demand. For example, in the last few years, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and General Dynamics have each cut thousands of workers from the payroll. *********** Convert some production capacity from military to consumer products. This option is often more appealing than it is feasible since military businesses often lack what it takes to compete in the civilian sector, including a widely known reputation, a system of mass distribution and the ability to produce at low cost. But some have the potential to become consumer suppliers. *********** Export, by replacing the American military customer with customers abroad. Except for this change, military contractors could go about their business as they did in the past. *********** Lobby for smaller, more gradual cuts in the defense budget while implementing the other strategies. Military contractors are powerful, knowledgeable and well equipped for effective lobbying. **********CHOOSING among these options will not be easy for governors and industry leaders. It is the responsibility of the incoming President to craft a realistic strategy and set the tone for industry to achieve global economic leadership just as it achieved global military leadership. **********Even more difficult, however, will be implementing each sector's chosen strategy since that requires shifting and coordinating Federal, state and even commercial budget allocations. But if these strategies are followed, Americans may be able to improve their living standards in spite of cutbacks in the military."

It is not related to the annuities sold by mutual funds and insurance companies. **********David S. Rhine, a tax partner at BDO Seidman in New York, called private annuities ""a very interesting vehicle that can solve a number of problems."" He said he had used them for quite a few clients recently. ""It's gotten up a little head of steam in the last six months,"" he said, cautioning, however, that there are financial risks because property is transferred without a lien, so the technique is not for every family. **********Mr. Rhine cited two examples of using private annuities: **********Parents in their 60's want to retire and move south. Their 30-year-old daughter has always loved the family home. She has a good job and can make monthly payments, but she does not have the savings needed for a down payment to buy the home with a bank mortgage. So the parents transfer the house to her, and she pledges an annuity in return. **********""There's a psychological benefit here as well,"" Mr. Rhine said. If the parents had sold the house, which they bought in the 1960's, they would have a capital gain under the tax laws because the sale would have produced much more than the original cost of the house, but not as much as it would have five years ago. **********""People always feel they have a loss when the value has gone down,"" Mr. Rhine said, ""but if the house stays in the family, it softens that blow."" **********In the second example, parents transferred the family business, a hardware store, to their son. After graduation, he went to work for a large company, but after a few years he joined his father in the store and is now ready to take it over. **********The first step, Mr. Rhine explained, is to have the store appraised. Say the fair market value is $500,000 and the parents' cost basis is $200,000, meaning they have an imputed capital gain of $300,000. Based on their life expectancy and a 7 percent interest rate, the son would make annual payments of $44,927, presumably from the cash flow of the business. **********For the parents, $7,042 of that payment over 28 years represents the recovery of the original cost of the business and would not be taxable, $10,563 would be capital gain and $27,321 would be ordinary income. If the parents died in a few years, the son's obligation would end and the business would not be included in their estate. Conversely, a cap can be put on the duration of the annuity so that the son's obligation ends after a set number of years, changing the amount of the payments depending on the number of years. **********The son could take out a life insurance policy in favor of his parents to protect them in case he should die.  But suppose he cannot make the annuity payments because the business fails or for other reasons? **********There is no protection against such risks, Mr. Rhine said. ""And for that reason, I would not do it if the business was the family's only asset,"" he said. Such transactions work best if a family has several assets, faith in their children and a strong desire to keep property in the family, he added. **********""I have several clients who do not need the annuity payment themselves,"" he said, ""and are recycling it, giving it to grandchildren"" to build a nest egg for their college education. **********Some clients are combining a gift to their children with a transfer and annuity, he said. Say a business has a $2 million value, much of it in commercial real estate. Under the tax law, each person can give or bequeath up to $600,000 free of gift or estate taxes. This means that a husband and wife can give their children $1.2 million tax-free, and after their deaths the first dollar of their estates will be taxable. **********The parents can thus transfer the $2 million business to their children who are active in it, giving them $1.2 million of it tax-free and accepting an annuity for the remaining $800,000. What this does is to establish a price for the business based on today's depressed market value and enable the younger generation to keep running it. **********If the parents retained title to the business and left it to their children in their wills, the future value could be much higher, and anything above $1.2 million would be subject to estate taxes of up to 55 percent. In such situations, businesses are often sold in whole or in part to pay taxes."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/23/business/this-just-in-recession-ended-21-months-ago.html,,1992-12-23,,828,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,This Just In: Recession Ended 21 Months Ago,This Just In: Recession Ended 21 Months Ago," **********Here's proof that economics is an inexact science: An official panel of economists determined today that the nation's ninth postwar recession ended a month before they realized it had started. And it took 21 months to sort all this out. **********The dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research declared today that the recession had ended in March 1991 -- the month before it even announced there was a recession.  The committee determined in April 1991 that the recession had begun in the previous July. **********The committee, the nation's designated arbiter of business cycles, set the conclusion of the recession today after examining the Commerce Department's final estimate of gross domestic product for the July-September quarter, now seen as climbing at a 3.4 percent annual pace. This meant that the output of goods and services within American borders regained its pre-recession peak. **********While G.D.P. is only one of several factors governing the designation of economic expansions and contractions, the seven-man committee of professors did not want to formally call an end to the recession until it was certain that this summer's rise would stick. **********Economists think of economic activity as a series of ""business cycles,"" each marked by a period of expansion culminating at a peak and a period of contraction culminating in a trough, or bottom. But demarcating these parts is sometimes tricky, particularly if growth is weak and poses the risk of turning into a further decline. That is why, as a condition for pronouncing a cycle complete, the committee likes to see that output has at least regained the level where it was before it started to fall. **********Third-quarter growth figures showed that G.D.P. had done just that, though the estimates of that growth have varied. The Commerce Department first estimated in late October that third-quarter G.D.P. had advanced at a 2.7 percent pace, stronger than was expected. This gain was revised upward to 3.9 percent last month before being recalculated again and announced today as 3.4 percent, still the best showing in almost four years. **********The biggest factor in the latest revision was a smaller addition to nonfarm inventories -- a $3.6 billion rate of increase instead of the $8.8 billion rate estimated in November. This was considered a somewhat favorable development, since it meant that fresh demand for goods would quickly translate into a need for new production. **********Separately, the Commerce Department reported today that the nation's businesses planned to increase spending on new plants and equipment by 5.3 percent in 1993, compared with a 3.6 percent increase this year. **********Since the prices the businesses pay for plants and equipment are actually expected to decline, spending in real terms would be 7.6 percent, up from 5.4 percent this year and the best performance, if achieved, since 1989.  As a whole, today's figures were taken as additional evidence that recovery has now conclusively become expansion, albeit an expansion that remains less vigorous than is typical, particularly in the creation of jobs. **********""It is very clear the economy is up a notch"" since midyear, said Bernard M. Markstein 3d, senior economist for Meridian Bancorp in Reading, Pa. ""This is definitely the expansion path we've been talking about."" **********Corporate profits, the G.D.P. report also showed, fell less in the third quarter than initially estimated last month. Profits from current production -- before taxes, with adjustments for inventory valuation and capital consumption -- declined $14.3 billion in the quarter after rising $4.4 billion in the second quarter. Last month, profits on this basis fell $18 billion. **********The figures were highly distorted, however, by write-offs and insurance-company losses from Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki.  The G.D.P. report produced no significant surprises, analysts said, though the economic research bureau's decision to pinpoint March as the end of the recession, a footnote to economic history, did raise some eyebrows. Most analysts had assumed it would pick either April or May or perhaps a time during the summer. **********The committee's decision meant that the recession lasted eight months. It was confined to the three quarters for which G.D.P. was negative, the summer and fall of 1990 and the January-March quarter of 1991. **********Since then, the United States economy has posted seven straight quarters of mostly subpar growth, including the one that ends next week.  The March 1991 end to the recession came even earlier than the Bush Administration and most private economists had thought. But economists generally dismissed the notion that a pre-election call of the ending would have made a significant difference at the ballot box. **********""I don't think estimates of the economy do anything to make people change their votes,"" said R. David Ranson, the president of H. C. Wainwright & Company Economics in Boston. The real problem, he added, was that ""Bush produced no jobs."""

Less Than Reportedly Requested **********The amount was less than the $:30 million the Canadian real estate giant reportedly requested. But bankers said the intention was to give Olympia time to try to work out a plan with all of its banks for restructuring the $12 billion of debt. **********About 4.6 million square feet of office space is either completed or in an advanced stage of construction at Canary Wharf. Olympia desperately needs the extra money to complete final work so additional tenants can move into buildings. Olympia has tenants or commitments for about 60 percent of the space. **********""Naturally we are delighted at this demonstration of support for Canary Wharf,"" Gerald Greenwald, Olympia's president, said today of the new money. ""Not only does it enable us to continue the work required prior to the arrival of the next tenants, but it also allows all parties to look beyond the short term and plan for the medium- to longer-term future."" Bankers said they had approved his statement before it was issued. **********The 11 banks have about $:500 million ($893 million) in loans to Canary Wharf; the loans are backed by the development's buildings. The banks include Barclays, Lloyds, Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover, Credit Suisse, Credit Lyonnais, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, and several Canadian banks. **********A smaller group of banks, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, has about $:450 million ($804 million) in loans to the project, which are not backed by the project's assets. **********In the proposal submitted on Thursday to 15 of its main lenders, Olympia offered the banks nonvoting equity stakes of as much as 20 and 30 percent, respectively, in the parent company and the existing phase of Canary Wharf in return for debt-payment relief and $700 million in new credits. Repayment of most of the principal would be extended five years. Most of the new money would be for Canary Wharf. **********""We didn't think it was very revolutionary or offered anything particularly exciting,"" the bank official said. **********Banks often do not like taking equity because it obligates them to stick with the borrower for the longer term. ""Some banks were keener on equity than others,"" the banker said."

Heady, publisher of the rate magazine, says deposit rates are on hold for the moment as banks wait to see President-elect Bill Clinton's strategy on handling the economy. **********""Depositors will see little change in the direction of C.D. yields, with the key Government decisions centering on what stimulants will be needed to spark economic growth and ways to deal with the national debt,"" he said. **********At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates were mixed, signaling an end to a rise in short-term rates that began in early October. The auction is often regarded as a harbinger of bank deposit rate changes. The average rate auction was down slightly for a three-month bill, to 3.26 percent, from 3.29 percent the previous week, while the six-month bill rose to 3.43 percent from 3.37 percent. Little Change in New York Area **********In the New York area, returns were mixed with no changes on an average money market account or six-month certificate of deposit while a slight drop was registered in the shorter three-month certificate. **********Savings banks, which traditionally offer the higher yields, were most active in cutting back on certificates of deposit. The average yield on a three-month C.D. is down 2 basis points, from 2.96 to 2.94 percent, and a six-month certificate is down 3 basis points, from 3.13 to 3.10 percent. **********Two of the largest changes in yields this week occurred at Home Savings of America, where the average money market account yield was lowered to 2.78 percent from 2.84 percent, and Carteret Federal Savings in New Jersey, which dropped the yield on a three-month certificate by 20 basis points, to 3.20 percent. **********Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks remained steady as the average yield on a money-market account remained unchanged at 2.68 percent and an average six-month certificate is up a couple of basis points, to 3.03 percent."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/15/business/free-trade-accord-expected-to-trim-nation-s-food-bill.html,Keith Bradsher,1992-08-15,,2161,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,FREE TRADE ACCORD EXPECTED TO TRIM NATION'S FOOD BILL,FREE TRADE ACCORD EXPECTED TO TRIM NATION'S FOOD BILL," **********For the American consumer, the biggest effect of the new North American Free Trade Agreement will take place in the neighborhood supermarket, where fresh fruits and vegetables will become more plentiful, more readily available in winter and will almost certainly become cheaper. **********The free trade pact that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached this week will, if ratified, eliminate the taxes now imposed on tomatoes, cantaloupes, cucumbers and many other foods imported from Mexico. The taxes, or tariffs, are intended to protect American farmers from imports, and they add significantly to the price of these foods. The accord will also reduce transportation costs by opening long-haul cross-border truck routes to low-wage Mexican carriers.  Cheaper Roses **********The agreement may even lower the cost of romance -- cutting out the 8 percent tax on cut roses from Mexico. **********""You will find a greater availability of fruits and vegetables in your store, and the prices will be lower,"" said Colin A. Carter, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California at Davis. ""There is a saving for consumers -- there's no question -- because many of these products have been protected right now from import competition."" **********A family of four living in a state on the Mexican border could save up to $50 a year on its food bills once the tariffs are eliminated, Mr. Carter said. Families living farther from the border would save less, because high transportation costs mean that fewer Mexican fruits and vegetables are eaten in Eastern and Northern states, he added. **********The Agriculture Department has not yet tried to estimate the savings, said Roger D. Runningen, the department's chief spokesman. ""On certain fruits and vegetables in certain times of the year, we would expect some price reductions,"" he said. Which Farmers Are Angry **********But while shoppers may be pleased, some American farmers are furious.  From Florida and Georgia to California and Michigan, they fear that more competition from Mexico may result in foreclosure signs on their fences. Citrus, peanut and winter vegetable growers are especially upset. **********Ben C. Abatti raises cucumbers, lettuce, asparagus and other vegetables on a 14,000-acre farm near Holtville, Calif., just five miles north of the Mexican border. He competes directly with Mexican farmers in nearby Mexicali, and relies on tariffs of up to 35 percent to offset the difference between American labor costs of $6 an hour and Mexican wages as low as $5 a day. **********""If we didn't have the tariffs today, they'd run us out of business tomorrow, that's for sure,"" Mr. Abatti said. **********Farmers like Mr. Abatti who harvest labor-intensive crops make up a small and vocal minority pitted against the many American farmers who grow crops that do not thrive in the heat and sun of Mexico. They look forward eagerly to selling more corn, hogs and other highly mechanized commodities to its 92 million people. **********John C. Kintzle, who is raising a bumper crop of corn this summer on 980 acres near Coggon, Iowa, said he supported the free trade accord because it would mean more demand and higher prices for his harvests as Mexico eliminates its import limits. ""Any time we can create demand, we're better off,"" he said. ""And we know that with the crop this year, and the new technology, we need all the markets we can get."" **********These differences within the American agricultural community have split farm-state legislators more along crop lines than party lines. Lawmakers representing farmers whose crops are also produced efficiently in Mexico tend to oppose the pact, while legislators from districts that will benefit from access to Mexican markets are more favorable to the accord. **********For example, Mr. Abatti's Congressman, Representative Duncan Hunter, is a Republican who vehemently opposes President Bush's agreement. But Iowa's representatives, including two Democrats, generally support it. **********Free trade in fruits and vegetables could also have an enormous effect on the flow of legal and illegal Mexican immigrants, many of whom find jobs in the United States picking vegetables for lack of comparable employment at home. Mr. Abatti employs up to 700 immigrants at harvest time. As trade barriers fall, it will make sense for some of those workers to harvest crops in Mexico for shipment across the border. **********Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, cited one study this week that showed the free trade accord would persuade 1.6 million potential Mexican immigrants to ""forgo those lower-skilled jobs in the United States and stay at home."" Trade Barriers Consumers Paying For Farm Profits **********Agriculture is the world's most protected industry, and American farmers are no exception. The United States imposes steep taxes on many imports and even more restrictive quantitative limits on imports of peanuts, sugar and dairy products. The tonnage limits restrict peanut imports to an amount that averages out to seven nuts for every American. **********The changes from the new trade pact will be slow because some of the highest taxes will be phased out over 15 years, but the results at the end will be striking. Peanuts, for example, sell for $700 a ton in the United States but only $300 a ton on world markets. **********When the 1990 crop failed in the United States, prices soared. The Agriculture Department removed peanut butter from the school lunch program because it could not import cheaper peanut butter from overseas. **********""I consider it a way in which the peanut growers enhance their incomes at the expense of consumers,"" said Dale E. Hathaway, the director of the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy, a nonprofit research group in Washington. ""They transfer income from peanut eaters to peanut growers."" **********The accord will, over 15 years, waive the peanut-import restriction, which many economists welcome. The growers, however, are understandably hostile, insisting that their peanuts are better than foreign peanuts and more likely to be free from disease and pesticide contamination. **********Danny O. Fillingame, who farms 2,000 acres in Dawson, Ga., with his father, notes that American consumers say in surveys that they want a quality product. ""But they're willing to accept a lot lower-quality product,"" he said. ""In my opinion, it's not fair."" **********Like the peanut farmers, American citrus growers also enjoy considerable protection from imports at the expense of consumers. People who like orange juice pay a stiff price: up to 35 cents in extra taxes for each imported gallon, which also allows Florida growers to charge more for their crop. After heavy lobbying by the growers, the tariff will be phased out over 15 years, the longest possible period under the accord. Against the Pact  California Growers Are Frightened **********When Mrs. Hills introduced the free trade agreement at a White House new conference last Wednesday, she mentioned that consumers would benefit from being able ""to get a cantaloupe a couple of months later than you can get one down at your Safeway this morning."" **********In practice, the United States already waives its 35 percent duty on Mexican cantaloupes during winter months when they do not compete with American producers. But the free trade accord will also eliminate the summer duty over the next 15 years, and American growers are very unhappy. **********Southern California farmers estimate that it costs them nearly $5 to grow, harvest and pack a 24-pound box of cantaloupes, while it costs Mexican farmers just $3.50. Labor is slightly more than half the cost of growing cantaloupes, and American workers earn 10 times as much, including fringe benefits, as workers in Mexico. **********The 35 percent tariff currently balances this difference, at a cost to consumers of about 5 cents extra for a one-pound cantaloupe. The result has been a fierce fight here to keep the tariff -- a fight that puts the fiercely independent and strongly Republican farmers here in a difficult position. **********""Competition is great, and I believe in competition, and I support a great competition with the other guy, but when you can't compete because of dollars and wages, it's just like banging your head against the wall,"" said George C. Stergios, who has a 4,000-acre farm near Mr. Abatti's and who is the president of the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association. **********The Agriculture Department contends that American farmers opposed to the agreement may be exaggerating their troubles. The same growers, of produce like tomatoes, have invested more money than their Mexican counterparts in irrigation and harvesting equipment. The American producers have reduced their costs and thus become more competitive than their Mexican rivals, department officials say. For the Accord Midwest Farmers Anticipate Gains **********Midwestern farmers are counting on the free trade accord to help them earn more money. They hope that by pulling down Mexico's trade barriers, the agreement will make the average Mexican prosperous enough to buy more American products from the Midwest. **********""Instead of eating a diet that is very low on protein and very high on tortillas and refried beans, they'll eat more meat,"" said Steven C. Noah, the director of the Midwest Agribusiness Trade Research and Information Center in Des Moines. **********Before the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980's stunned the Mexican economy, American farmers had a strong market across the border. When Mexico lost much of its oil income, American food sales there fell by 37.4 percent in just three years, to a $1.11 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 1986. **********At that time the Mexican economy started to recover and began to grow even faster than the United States economy. American agricultural shipments across the nation's southern border nearly tripled. **********Throughout the world, people in poor countries tend to buy more American meat and grain as they become more affluent. The pattern has been repeated in Japan since World War II, in the Middle East in the 1970's, and now again in Mexico. **********If Mexico has a competitive advantage in melons and oranges, the United States is an overwhelming rival in hogs and grain. Much of the Mexican landscape is too arid for these commodities, and farmers there have small, inefficient plots. Large tractors and combines are in short supply in Mexico and the winters are not cold enough for long-term grain storage. **********The United States has none of these problems, while it has a highly efficient food storage, processing and transportation system. For example, some wheat that has been stored in grain elevators in North Dakota and Montana by the Federal Government since the late 1950's is still edible. **********Through a complicated system of import licenses, Mexico has prevented American farmers from dominating its food markets -- and perhaps bankrupting hundreds of thousands of peasant corn farmers in southern Mexican states. Under the free trade accord, Mexico will allow the duty-free import of 2.5 million tons of corn a year, an amount roughly comparable to shipments in recent years. **********Any extra shipments will be subject to an initial tariff of 215 percent that will be phased out over 15 years. American corn growers welcome the move because the Federal Government has been cutting its subsidies since 1985. **********""Government support to agriculture has declined since the mid-1980's, and implicit in reduced Government support has been a promise to find new markets,"" said Peter J. Wenstrand, who raises corn on his 1,500-acre farm near Essex, Iowa. ""Any time you talk about increased trade, it helps corn."" The Politics The Farm Lobby Is Deeply Divided **********The North American Free Trade Agreement has split the farm vote in Congress, and eventual approval of the agreement will depend partly on whether this split persists. **********Florida, Texas, California and Hawaii will be hurt the most by Mexican competition because they have very similar growing seasons and crops, and lawmakers from rural areas in these states have been critical of the agreement. But the unusual alliances within American agriculture have also produced some other critics in Congress. **********The nation's severe restrictions on sugar imports, for example, have the support not only of sugar cane growers but also of sugar beet growers and corn farmers, whose product is used to make corn sweetener. Sugar beets are grown in states like North Dakota that would otherwise be expected to support the pact. **********Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, criticized the free trade pact in a speech on Wednesday to members of the American Sugar Alliance, a Washington-based industry group. ""It's unfair, it's outrageous and it's a sellout of American sugar interests,"" he said. **********But other Democrats from farm states have raced to the agreement's defense. ""Right now, if you want to get big applause -- there's a lot of unemployment -- you just say anything against foreigners,"" Representative Neal Smith of Iowa said. ""But that's not responsible."""

Traffic was clogging the northeastern corner of town, and so City Hall decided that a new road had to be built. **********Nothing in Jerusalem is ever that simple. **********You can hardly poke a shovel into the soil of this city without stumbling upon a place where someone lived, or fought, or prayed, or started his journey through eternity a couple of millenniums ago. **********That's exactly what happened when a bulldozer started leveling the ground for the new asphalt road between the neighborhoods of French Hill and Pisgat Zeev. Suddenly exposed were half a dozen or more Jewish burial caves from the Second Temple period, about 2,000 years ago. **********And just as suddenly exposed in the last few weeks were a bundle of complicated emotions, religious beliefs, scholarly theories and political maneuvers, not to mention more than enough animosity to guarantee that, whatever ultimately happens to this road, it will not be paved with good intentions.  All Sides Are Adamant **********City officials are adamant. The road is necessary, they say, and will be built. Archeologists are adamant. The caves must be protected, they say, so they can study the ossuaries, ritual boxes for bones, that are inside. Strictly Orthodox rabbis are adamant. The bones and their boxes are both holy, they say, and may not be tampered with to satisfy academic curiosity. **********While they battle, work on the road has stopped. Tempers go on, though. **********When 16 stone ossuaries were taken from the site last month and held for future research by Israel's Antiquities Authority, Orthodox Jews rioted for several days in the Mea Shearim quarter. **********These were hardly the first ancient bones of contention, as a local magazine put it. But for years, the issue was settled through an agreement between antiquities officials and the Ministry of Religious Affairs that bones would be turned over for ritual reburial after archeologists took a look at them. **********This seems to be the first time that the fight has been extended to ossuaries, suggesting that the stakes have been significantly raised. **********More than a few secular Israelis accuse the Orthodox of deliberately flexing their muscles in the eternal politicking that afflicts both City Hall and the national Government. ""It is definitely a declaration of power,"" said David Mevorah, a curator at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  Rabbis State Their Case **********Not so, the rabbis fire back. This is purely a religious issue, they insist: the dead deserve respect no matter how long ago they lived or how many secrets their remains may reveal. **********""The body is the cover for the soul,"" said Rabbi Menachem Porush, a member of Parliament from the United Torah Judaism party. ""And as the soul is holy so is the body. For us, the boxes are like a part of the body."" **********To underline how serious the issue is, an Orthodox newspaper suggested recently that Israel's latest troubles over spreading violence, including its deportation of 415 suspected Palestinian militants, may have come about ""because of the accusations of the dead who were violently shaken from their rest."" **********Religious Jews protested so vigorously on this issue that, to restore peace, the authorities finally surrendered the 16 containers to the Orthodox, who then solemnly interred them in a modern grave, cementing them over to make sure that this time they stayed put. **********But the dispute did not rest there. **********Although the Antiquities Authority insists it was a ""one-time gesture,"" many archeologists are upset over what they consider a violation of Israeli laws giving the state the right to excavate and hold on to all ancient artifacts. **********""It's considered a bad precedent,"" said Avner Goren, a Jerusalem archeologist. ""Many people feel that if you give up the ossuaries today, why not some other item tomorrow?"" **********Yael Israeli, another curator at the Israel Museum, which has scores of the containers in storage, said: ""There's a lot of information to be gleaned from the ossuaries. From the artwork and the inscriptions, you can get the atmosphere of the period as well as formal data."" **********Swirling about are other arguments: Does the Orthodox position of today square with Jewish burial practices many centuries ago? Are religious dictates more important under Jewish tradition than a new road that might speed an ambulance's path to the hospital and thereby save a life? **********With newly found caves on French Hill still waiting to be explored, archeologists went to the Israeli courts to unearth the recently reburied containers and to protect future findings. Just as determined, Orthodox groups posted young yeshiva students at the road site to make sure that nothing is touched. **********Move the road a few yards, they said. Too complicated, city officials replied. In exasperation, they turned to Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Kolitz of Jerusalem, hoping that he would provide a theological back door for everyone to walk through satisfied. **********The other day the rabbi spoke, declaring that the caves could not be excavated and that the city ought to consider building an overpass that would leave the graves untouched and traffic flowing above them. **********All that produced, however, was a municipal roll of the eyes. An overpass, one official said, would not be ready for another six years -- the urban equivalent of an eternity for Jerusalem's ever-worsening traffic."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/world/even-a-photo-finish-may-not-show-a-winner-in-israel-s-vote.html,Clyde Haberman,1992-06-23,,753,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Even a Photo Finish May Not Show a Winner in Israel's Vote,Even a Photo Finish May Not Show a Winner in Israel's Vote," **********With a final flurry of political attacks and promises, Israel's election campaign ended tonight, a drawn-out affair that neither stirred grand passions nor offered clear insights into what the next government will look like. **********A new batch of opinion polls published today showed the opposition Labor Party leading the governing Likud Party by anywhere from 2 to 12 seats in Tuesday's election for the 120-member Parliament. Some Likud members acknowledged that Labor would probably end up in first place. **********But finishing first and forming a government are not necessarily the same thing in the fragmented Israeli system, which has never produced a party capable of winning a parliamentary majority on its own. **********The polls also showed a virtual dead heat between the two major blocs that would most likely try to form a coalition -- Likud plus right-wing and religious parties on one side, Labor plus left-wing and Arab parties on the other.  No Enthusiasm for 'Unity' **********In the end, Likud and Labor may be forced to live together once again in a revival of the ""national unity government"" that they maintained from 1984 to 1990. This is not an appealing prospect, politicians say. **********""You don't form a unity government as a matter of desire,"" Health Minister Ehud Olmert, a close ally of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said at a political forum. **********Yossi Beilin, a left-leaning Labor member of Parliament, was more blunt, saying at the same gathering that a Likud-Labor coalition was ""a prescription for paralysis"" and that he and like-minded party officials would try to block it. **********They may not prevail, however, especially since there are ample signs that Labor's leader, Yitzhak Rabin, would feel comfortable in an arrangement of some sort with Likud. Mr. Olmert sensed that to be the case, saying Mr. Rabin would ""prefer to sit with me than to sit with Yossi Sarid,"" a major figure in the left-wing Meretz Party whose very name causes true believers on the Israeli right to cringe.  Different Styles **********Mr. Shamir and Mr. Rabin closed their campaigns in different styles, the Prime Minister sitting in his office and exhorting Likud stalwarts by phone and the Labor leader flying by helicopter from town to town in search of voters who had not yet made up their minds. Neither man broke new ground, with each asserting to the end that his party would be the better guarantor of Israeli security and peace. **********In all, 25 parties are running, although only a dozen can expect to enter Parliament, including a few that may just squeeze past the 40,000-vote mark that is expected to be the minimum needed for a single seat. In the main, politicians failed to excite the 3.4 million eligible voters, avoiding detailed discussions of what they would do on urgent matters like the Middle East peace process, relations with the United States and an economy in need of overhaul. **********Some commentators say that after decades of raucous politics, Israelis may now be more like voters in many other democracies, searching less for radical change than for ways to improve their lives at the margins. Meron Benvenisti, a writer and an expert on Israeli-Palestinian affairs, argued that large issues like national security and foreign affairs ""are seen as dilemmas whose solutions are in a distant future and not as immediate political questions."" **********Still, there are clear indications that Israelis, while weary of politics as usual, have not given up on it. **********One sign -- assuming the polls are to be believed at all -- is a surge of support both for Meretz on the left and for a small right-wing party called Tsomet, which is firmly opposed to territorial concessions to the Arabs in return for peace. This ambidirectional phenomenon is pronounced among first-time voters, who apparently are intent on registering a protest vote against both major parties. **********Tsomet, led by a former army general, Rafael Eitan, may triple its parliamentary bloc, from two seats to six, according to the polls. And many political commentators are convinced that this is not because of the territorial issue so much as it reflects a perception that Mr. Eitan is a good-government candidate, eager to change the electoral system and to eliminate privileges for religious parties that are resented by Israel's secular majority. **********The system desperately needs to be repaired, President Chaim Herzog agreed in an interview today, saying ""our society tends to degrade itself"" with its political structure. **********""The system we have is a catastrophe,"" Mr. Herzog said. ""It allows for fragmentation and wheeling and dealing, and gives inordinate power to small groupings."""

But last month, having become convinced that Bill Clinton would win, he sold his drug stocks to buy shares in health maintenance organizations that might profit from Mr. Clinton's efforts to control medical costs. **********""I'm a Bush supporter, but Clinton looks like he's a shoo-in,"" Mr. Alger said. ""Go with the flow, I guess."" **********Like some others on Wall Street, Mr. Alger is directing his vote one way, his money the other. Money managers and traders can vote their hopes, but they must invest their expectations. Clinton Already Accounted For? **********With the voting still three weeks and three debates away, many strategists say that the markets have heavily discounted a Clinton victory already. ""That's been evident for some time,"" said Laszlo Birinyi, president of an investment consulting firm that bears his name. ""That's the market's job to do these things."" **********Mr. Birinyi assembled a list of stock groups -- drugs, tobacco, oil drilling and electronics -- that had done best under President Bush and might profit the most from his re-election. Another list includes companies in areas like environmental cleanup and health cost control that might benefit under a Clinton Presidency. **********Since the Republican convention in August, the Clinton portfolio has outperformed the Bush portfolio by more than eight percentage points, and the broader stock market by more than seven points. **********The Clinton effect is usually harder to measure, since many other factors -- economic troubles, foreign currency turmoil -- continue to roil the markets, as do lingering general uncertainties about the election's outcome, or about what to expect from the winner. **********""The candidates have been so purposefully nebulous in specifying details on their economic programs that it is difficult for any rational man to assess what they're going to do,"" said Ian A. MacKinnon, who directs the fixed-income group of Vanguard mutual funds. **********As the incumbent, President Bush can also make the markets dance. On Sept. 2, he told cheering workers at General Dynamics that he favored the $4 billion sale of 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan, reversing his longstanding opposition. Although the stock showed little immediate response, it has since moved to more than $93 from $77, based on a pending stock buyback as well as the F-16 contract. It closed yesterday at $93.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 37.5 cents. **********Some strategists say that apart from such isolated episodes the election matters so much less than the state of the economy that they are not even bothering to handicap the race. ""Often when a market doesn't act well we can use politics or elections as a reason,"" said Charles I. Clough Jr., the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""The market is dealing with more basic questions."" Foreign Jitters Over Change **********Yet many money managers say that Governor Clinton's rise has shaped their investment decisions, often throwing them on the defensive. They say the dollar's weakness has resulted not only from economic causes, but also from foreign apprehension over the rise of a little-known politician from an obscure state. **********Bond buyers have been trying to avoid the longest maturities, whose value will erode the most, they say, if either a stronger economic recovery or a Clinton spending plan leads to higher interest rates. **********Some investors say the markets have responded so strongly to the Clinton candidacy that nothing he might do as President warrants all the current torment. Mark Rowland, whose Atlanta money management firm bears his name, said that pharmaceutical shares, once the market's leaders, had fallen to rare, bargain prices. In recent days he has been buying shares of Upjohn and Johnson & Johnson. **********Drug stocks have been dropping for other reasons, among them analysts' doubts that rapid earnings growth will continue. But Mr. Rowland said investors' reactions to Mr. Clinton's position had been vastly overdone. Of a fellow Arkansas native, Mr. Rowland said, ""I thank Mr. Clinton for giving me an opportunity to buy drug stocks for the first time in seven years."" **********To understand why many investors are acting as if Mr. Clinton is about to take the oath of office, one should understand that the values of stock, bonds and even currencies manifest their expectations for the future. If investors wake up this morning thinking that I.B.M. stock will be worth $5 a share less the day after the election, it will probably fall that much not over the month, but within moments of the market's opening bell. **********At times, Mr. Clinton's impact has been almost that sudden and dramatic. On Sept. 24 he told employees at the offices of Merck & Company, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, that he favored price controls on prescription drugs. The stock -- already off 20 percent from its highs, partly because of election-induced jitters -- fell $3, to $43.75 that day and the next. Investors had paper losses of more than $3.4 billion. **********The candidate's influence by no means stops at the country's borders. On Oct. 4 he announced his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, with some reservations. The next day, the Mexican Bolsa climbed 65 points, or 4.7 percent, even as most of the world's other major markets plunged. **********By many accounts, the Clinton candidacy has also contributed to the dollar's decline against foreign currencies, although international currency turmoil and the levels of interest rates are undoubtedly larger factors. Thomas J. Berger, the London-based manager of several mutual funds sold in the United States, said that as Mr. Clinton gained strength in late spring and early summer, he expected foreigners to cut back on their investments in the United States, causing the value of the dollar to fall. **********""So many people outside the United States don't know him or understand him, and seem to believe a Democratic President is bad for the economy,"" Mr. Berger said. **********Mr. Berger responded by changing course with his $75 million American Capital Global Government Bond Fund. He went from protecting against 90 percent of the fund's currency risk to just 50 percent, so investors could profit from any declines in the dollar. **********With the dollar recently at record lows against the German mark, he decided that the plunge had about run its course. Now, he said, investors might start to ease their defensive postures. Once they see that Mr. Clinton would promote economic growth, he said, the dollar will be more attractive. Mr. Berger has gone back to shielding his fund against two-thirds of the currency risk, and plans to go higher. **********Many investor jitters come less from fears about Mr. Clinton, who has a level of business support unusual for a Democratic nominee, than from broader political worries. **********On Friday, when the Dow industrials lost 39 points, or 1.2 percent, one reason was traders' fears that Sunday's debate would rock the markets on Monday. ""I don't think anybody wanted to go into this weekend with excess inventory,"" Timothy J. Heekin, the manager of the equity block trading desk at Salomon Brothers, said then. **********On Monday, as the Dow rose 37.83 points, he took the opportunity to sell some more. The debate went about as expected, he said, but the prospect of a new leader continued to aggravate the market's volatility and risks. **********In the credit market, money managers say that Mr. Clinton's prospects might be compounding investors' worries that an accelerating recovery would raise interest rates, depressing bond prices. Mr. McKinnon, the Vanguard manager, has been trying to reduce his risks by shortening the maturities of some investments to the extent that the rules of his mutual funds allow. He is holding Treasury bonds, for instance, that mature in 20 years rather than 30. The longer the bond, the more it usually falls on political worries and higher interest rates. **********The yields on 30-year bonds have reached record levels compared with Treasury notes that mature in two years. This spread results not only from economic conditions, some investors say, but also from the chance that inflation and higher interest rates would follow from a Clinton spending plan. **********Mutual fund investors, chastened by past losses, are shunning long bonds, Mr. McKinnon said. His Long-Term U.S. Treasury Portfolio has taken six years to grow to $913 million, he said, while the year-old Intermediate U.S. Treasury Portfolio, with an average maturity of 7.3 years, has already gathered in $588 million. **********If the level of interest rates already reflects expectations of a Clinton victory, Mr. McKinnon said, other consequences have yet to play themselves out. Any Clinton plan to narrow the deficit by taking more money from the wealthy could meet with investor resistance, he said: ""It assumes that if he raises taxes, people won't switch into municipal bonds,"" which are mostly beyond the reach of Federal taxes."

There have been herbs and flowers to pick, for the teas Sarajevans have been making for centuries, and there has been the glory of the autumn landscape, with russet leaves lending color to the plunging pastures. **********On Sunday morning, when Sakir Dzirlo would normally have been pulling the family Ford out of the garage and loading a picnic, he was on one of the lower hills, standing with 150 other men beside the grave of Mugdim Kadric. **********Mr. Kadric was killed by machine-gun fire on Friday when the auxiliary police unit he had joined was deploying to the front lines of the Sarajevo siege. Mr. Dzirlo had known him since high school, and they were together for the final time last Monday, when Mr. Kadric, who was 46 years old, dropped in at the Dzirlos' apartment for coffee and a discussion of his experiences fighting the Serbian nationalist forces besieging the city. **********Mr. Kadric's concern then, Mr. Dzirlo recalled as he waited for the funeral, was that he had only 400 bullets for each three-day stint at the front, for a machine gun that could fire that many bullets in a minute.  Several Friends Lost **********Losing friends in the siege has become a commonplace, so much so that Mr. Dzirlo spent time wandering among the fresh graves in the Muslim burial ground in Kovaci Park, a mile from his home, spotting the names of several other acquaintances recently interred. **********Emotions seemed under tight control as men, some in camouflage fatigues, others in business suits or jeans, watched the earth being shoveled atop the white sheet covering Mr. Kadric's body. By Muslim custom, few women attended the burial, mostly close relatives. **********The hodza, or Muslim holy man, wasted little time on sentiment, perhaps sensing that most of those present have long since exhausted their tears. **********""What we Muslims are undergoing is genocide,"" he said as he squatted beside the grave, his palms stretched forward and raised upward. ""As we have been reminded by the death we are marking here, this is happening because we lack the heavy weapons we need to defend ourselves. So we must make up for what we lack in weapons with ingenuity and vigilance, or our enemy will slaughter us like sheep with a knife."" **********As soon as prayers were over the mourners hurried away, fearful of the mortar and artillery fire that the Serbian forces, with a clear view of the hillside parks that serve as cemeteries, have often trained on funerals. Many had a busy day ahead, returning to units at the front or preparing their families for the winter weather that is barely a month away.  Wood Disappears **********Mr. Dzirlo, who is 43, is a tightly wound, mustachioed man with an engineer's passion for detail, and he set out weeks ago with his family -- his wife, Amra, 40; their daughters Meliha, 16, and Lejla, 11, and twin sons Mahir and Malik, 14 -- to take every available precaution for the winter. **********Last week, the family bought a wood-burning stove. Their home is normally heated by radiators that use water heated from an electrically fired boiler, but the Serbian forces have cut the last electricity transmission line into the city. **********After the funeral, Mr. Dzirlo drove down to a gallery used by his wife, an architect, where he spent a morning last week sawing a big wooden beam left over from a renovation in 1989. Another, longer beam, left outside as a bench, disappeared a day before Mr. Dzirlo was to have sawed it, and was later traced to a private bakery that is fueling its ovens with chopped-up doors and window frames and parquet flooring taken from buildings destroyed by the Serbian gunfire. **********With the wood transported to the apartment and the new stove lit, Mrs. Dzirlo served what would be a banquet in most Sarajevo homes -- bowls of soup made with noodles saved from before the siege, and slices of pizza made with home-made bread and a topping of tomato puree. Normally, the family survives on one meal a day of macaroni or rice. **********Talk at lunch centered on another guest, Emina Hasimic, who was desperate for news of family members who have disappeared from her hometown, Kozarac, 175 miles northwest of Sarajevo. Kozarac was a predominantly Muslim town in Prijedor County, where a roughly equal balance between Serbs and Muslims fell afoul of the Serbian practice of ""ethnic cleansing."" Seven members of Mrs. Hasimic's family -- including her parents and her 15-year-old son, her brother and his wife and their two children -- were among 1,000 Muslims taken at gunpoint by the Serbian forces in May to a detention camp at the railway station at Trnopolje, south of Kozarac. She has heard nothing from them since.  'Shame for Bush' **********Mr. Dzirlo, who spent hours before the telephones were cut calling senior officials of the United States in Belgrade, demanding that the United States take military action, had heard Mrs. Hasimic's story before. But after the funeral, it was too much. **********""Who knows who will be next?"" he asked angrily. ""Amra? Emina? The children? How many more will die? It is shame for Bush, and for Mitterrand. It is shame for all the world."" **********He fell silent. Moments later, he bounded up, urging the twins to get ready for a trip in search of more wood. **********Back in the jeep, the quest took them by back roads across the city to an area of thickets just west of the United Nations headquarters, only a few hundred yards from the battle zone where Mr. Kadric had died.  The Quiet Is Ominous **********The area was quiet, rarely a good sign in Sarajevo, and as the jeep pulled up it became clear why. Artillery shells began whistling overhead, apparently fired from Serbian positions in Nedzarici, a mile away. Some of the explosions were not more than 100 yards from the jeep, but running for the safety of a bunker near the United Nations building was made hazardous by intermittent sniper fire. When the guns fell silent and it was relatively safe to move, Mr. Dzirlo and his son left the area. **********The road home took him past the home of a friend, Nenad Matic. Mr. Matic, delighted as many in Sarajevo are to discover that friends are still alive, offered glasses of brandy and lemonade. **********""You've survived,"" he said, laughing and embracing Mr. Dzirlo. After a half-second's pause, he remembered something equally joyful. **********""And I've survived, too,"" he said."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/12/business/wall-st-arbitration-programs-criticized.html,,1992-05-12,,795,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Wall St. Arbitration Programs Criticized,Wall St. Arbitration Programs Criticized," **********After a two-year review of the arbitration programs that handle most of the complaints that individual investors bring against Wall Street brokers, the General Accounting Office has concluded that investors cannot be sure of getting a competent and impartial hearing unless improvements are made in the way arbitrators are recruited and trained for their task. **********The arbitration programs now in place do not ""provide a reasonable level of assurance regarding either the independence of the arbitrators or their competence in arbitrating disputes,"" the study said. **********These shortcomings are especially worrisome, the agency said, because of the explosive growth in the number of cases being handled by the industry's arbitration programs -- fivefold in the last decade. Much of the growth has come since June 1987, when the Supreme Court upheld the brokerage industry's right to enforce the mandatory arbitration clauses in many customer account contracts. **********That left most individual investors who had grievances with no choice but to submit them to arbitration panels -- most often, to industry-run panels -- whose findings are not subject to review or to appeal through the courts. **********The 1987 ruling ignited a national debate over how Wall Street handles investor disputes. Several states tried unsuccessfully to enact their own prohibitions against mandatory arbitration requirements. **********The G.A.O. study is to be released today by its sponsors, Representatives John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. It will probably not change minds on either side of the debate. But it did produce intriguing insight into how the process works and identified some unexpected areas of agreement that could bring about changes that would make the arbitration process less mysterious to investors. **********The report leaves unanswered, however, the fundamental question of whether the process produces decisions that are fair to investors and brokers. That would have required the Congressional investigative agency to ""analyze and judge the merits of the facts in each case in its study,"" it said in the report, a task beyond its mandate and resources. **********What the G.A.O. analyzed was whether industry-run arbitration forums, operated by the various national stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, are biased against individual investors, as critics have long argued. Little Statistical Difference **********Its statistical analysis of cases filed between January 1989 and June 1990 found that investors fared about the same in industry-run forums as in independent ones like the American Arbitration Association: They win about 60 percent of the time, but the winners recover, on average, only about 60 percent of the losses they claimed. **********Such analysis ""indicated little about the fairness of individual cases,"" the study acknowledged. In the agency's view, ""The fairness of arbitration cases, regardless of the forum, depends largely on the impartiality and competence of individual arbitrators."" **********On this score, the agency found that arbitration forums lacked the internal controls necessary to insure that arbitrators are adequately trained for today's increasingly complicated cases. The agency also questioned the recruiting and assigning of arbitrators, noting that a few arbitrators had handled a disproportionate number of the cases it reviewed. Other Factors Cited **********Other factors were found to affect how investors fared. For example, investors who hired lawyers were 1.6 times as likely to collect above-average awards than those who did not, and investors whose claims involved less than $20,000 were 3.7 times more likely to collect above-average awards. **********Moreover, investors were 1.4 times more likely to win when arbitrators conducted a formal hearing than when they ruled on the basis of written arguments. **********But while these details offer clues to how the current system is handling large and small claims, and hints on how disgruntled investors can improve their chances of recovering more of their losses, the chief value of the study may be its analysis of where common ground can be found in this acrimonious debate. **********For example, the G.A.O.'s study found widespread support, within the brokerage industry and among investor groups, for Federal legislation to require arbitrators to explain their decisions. At present, arbitrators are not required to offer any explanations -- a situation that investors and their advocates say can foster suspicion, especially among those who win their cases but recover only a portion of their losses. Opposition From Big Firms **********Only the largest Wall Street firms expressed substantial resistance to this proposal, the study found. **********In addition, the agency found support in the industry and among investors for the formation of a single agency to handle arbitration cases, which are now handled by nearly a dozen separate stock exchange and industry forums. **********Again, most of the industry's largest firms opposed the concept, the study reported."

https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/24/business/mutual-funds-an-outbreak-of-rights-offerings.html,Carole Gould,1992-05-24,,903,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Mutual Funds; An Outbreak of Rights Offerings,Mutual Funds; An Outbreak of Rights Offerings," **********Investors have poured record-breaking sums of money into mutual funds in the 1990's so far, and closed-end funds are also enjoying an infusion of new capital. **********These funds are raising millions of dollars by initiating ""rights offerings,"" invitations to current investors to buy additional shares. Rights offerings, which were virtually unheard of among closed-end funds in the 80's, are rapidly spreading. Four offerings came to market last year and seven so far in 1992. **********The use of rights offerings reflects the fundamental difference in the way closed-end funds and mutual funds are sold. Mutual funds, sometimes called ""open-end funds,"" continually issue shares to new investors and buy shares back from existing investors at net asset value, which equals the fund's total assets divided by the number of shares outstanding. As a result, a mutual fund's capitalization is always changing; when investors buy in, the fund issues new shares and increases the number of shares. **********By contrast, closed-end funds usually raise money once, issuing a fixed number of shares when they are set up. After the initial public offering, shares of closed-end funds are listed on exchanges like regular shares of common stock, often at a premium or discount to the value of the funds' securities holdings. **********Until about 1981, most closed-end funds sold at steep discounts to their net asset value. To reduce the huge discounts, fund managers began buying back shares on the open market. **********Today's flurry of rights offerings is the opposite of that share-buyback trend. Many closed-end funds now sell for small discounts or for premiums. With demand for fund shares strong, managers are inviting investors to buy even more shares. The funds increase capital through rights offerings because under law they cannot otherwise sell shares at less than net asset value. **********Fund managers say that with more money to invest, they could take advantage of attractive investing opportunities that are now available. But most financial markets are near all-time highs, and some observers take a different view of the funds' motives. They say rights offerings mostly benefit the funds' sponsors, by increasing the base of capital from which sponsors draw their fees. **********As for the mechanics, offerings have three variables: the number of rights that can be exchanged for shares, the price of the shares and the rules on transferring rights. **********For every share owned, investors receive one right; a specified number of rights entitles the investor to buy one share in the fund at a fixed price. Of the 11 rights offerings in the last two years, four required five rights to purchase one share. The Mexico Fund required only three rights to buy one share; the fund with the most stringent standard, the Royce Value Trust, required 20 rights to buy one share. The ratio is based on how aggressively the sponsor is trying to expand the fund. The fewer the rights required, the more shares that will be sold and the larger the increase in the fund's capitalization. **********The price in the offering also signals the fund sponsors' intent. The closer the exercise price is to the shares' market value, the fewer the shareholders who might be interested and thus the smaller the growth in the fund's capital base. When the price is deeply discounted, chances are high that investors or speculators will buy the offered shares. **********As with any share offering, the problem with a rights offering is that it dilutes the value of the fund's shares. For example, consider a fund with 10 million shares outstanding and with a net asset value and a market price of $25; four rights entitle holders to buy one share at $20. The offering takes in 2.5 million shares at $20, or $50 million. The fund's new size is $300 million. Divide that by 12.5 million shares outstanding for a new N.A.V. of $24. **********Of course, closed-end shares trade on the basis of market price, not N.A.V. But while share price and N.A.V. do not move in tandem, they usually move in the same direction. So if the N.A.V. falls, the share price is likely to decline too, said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a closed-end fund analyst in Miami. **********To insure full participation in an offering, fund sponsors can issue transferable rights, which are traded on exchanges. Thus, investors who do not want to participate can sell their rights. Mr. Herzfeld estimates that 6 percent of investors holding rights for the Mexico Fund offering in April let them expire. For every 100 shares owned, investors lost a maximum of $275, based on the rights' high price of $2.75. **********How should closed-end fund owners respond to rights offerings? If you are pleased with the fund, ""we recommend exercising the rights and if there is an oversubscription, subscribe to as many shares as you are financially able to,"" advised an article in the most recent issue of Capiello's Closed-End Fund Digest in Santa Barbara, Calif. **********Investors who are unhappy with their fund's performance should sell their shares immediately, the newsletter said, because rights offerings put downward pressure on share prices. And if you do not already own shares in a closed-end fund but would like to add it to your portfolio, the best time to buy is shortly after a rights offering because prices are lowest then, it said."

Opposing Iraqi Threat to Expel Aid Officials," **********A new confrontation appears to be looming between President Saddam Hussein and the Security Council as a result of a threat by Iraq to expel about 1,000 United Nations officials working there at the end of this month. **********The United Nations humanitarian relief coordinator, Jan Eliasson of Sweden, had planned to leave for Baghdad tonight in an 11-hour effort to persuade the authorities there to extend the agreement, expiring next Tuesday, under which some 500 United Nations aid workers are delivering humanitarian assistance to needy Iraqis protected by a similar number of United Nations guards. **********But Mr. Eliasson postponed his trip at the last minute after Iraq said it was not ready to receive him. Earlier the Iraqi authorities had asserted that this year-old agreement is now unnecessary, implying that they do not want to see it extended any further and that the United Nations personnel must leave next week. Mission Called Important **********The United States, Britain and France, the three principal partners in the armed coalition that defeated Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, all want the United Nations to maintain its presence in Iraq as does a majority of the Security Council, diplomats say. **********They argue that the United Nations still has an important humanitarian mission to accomplish, particularly among the Kurds in the northern part of the country, who are suffering from an economic embargo imposed by Baghdad, as well as among the Shiite Muslims in the south, where military activities continue. **********The 500 lightly armed United Nations guards, who have established posts around much of the country, also provide a ready flow of information about domestic conditions in Iraq, and their presence may deter further attacks by the Iraqi Army against the Kurds and Shiites. **********Iraq's threat to expel the United Nations comes at a time when Baghdad is sending mixed signals to the outside world, sometimes showing a new readiness to cooperate with the Security Council's peace terms but at other moments exhibiting its old defiance. Agreement on Oil Sales **********At talks that ended in Vienna on Monday, United Nations officials say they finally reached an agreement in principle with Iraq that could allow it to sell some $1.6 billion worth of oil over the next six months to pay for imports of food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies and to start paying compensation for damage caused by its invasion of Kuwait. **********If Baghdad accepts its terms, such an agreement would in effect free Iraq from any dependence on outside charity, meaning that it had no need of further United Nations assistance. But the distribution of food and other supplies imported under this arrangement must still be impartially monitored and the United States, Britain and France want the United Nations guards force to stay on in Iraq to perform this function. **********Iraq has also been cooperating more closely with the Special Commission the Security Council established to oversee the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction, providing basic information about its weapons programs though still refusing to give details of foreign supplies. **********And the commission is now discussing establishing a permanent monitoring body in Baghdad to insure that Iraq does not try to manufacture prohibited weapons again. **********But this month the Security Council issued a statement expressing ""concern"" and ""dismay"" after Iraqi leaders attacked the findings of the commission set up to demarcate its boundary with Kuwait, using language that implied Baghdad still refuses to accept Kuwait's existence as an independent state."

While the season usually brings new sales pitches from the nation's gasoline companies, there seem to be more now than ever. **********Most of those ambitious campaigns are spending tens of millions of dollars to stress a relatively new theme -- cleansing. **********Because of an increased emphasis on pollution reduction and concerns about proper maintenance of engines, the cleansing and detergency properties of various brands of gasoline has become a recurring, even dominating, theme in advertisements. **********""The public has a knack for being right,"" says a television commercial by Ogilvy & Mather Houston for the Shell Oil Company.

Though surreal elements are as common in gasoline advertising as high-test at 29 cents a gallon, the campaign is replete with such imagery. **********At the epicenter of Mobil's campaign is a giant red ""O"" filled with sloshing gasoline, found among similarly huge, though blue, letters that complete the word ""Mobil.""

There were the singing, leaping ""O's"" in 1950's spots for Bonomo's Turkish Taffy, and the ""Oh, oh, Spaghettios"" jingle for the Franco-American canned pasta in the 1960's.) **********Mobil has promoted itself as ""the detergent gasoline"" since 1969 -- some spots from that era feature the comedian Pat Paulsen -- and the new campaign is intended to single-mindedly focus on that attribute. That is why the ""sloshing 'O,' "" as Mobil and DDB Needham call it, which had been making brief appearances at the end of Mobil's commercials, has now been made the star of the new campaign. **********""We're seeing some of our competitors associate themselves with detergency,"" said Dan Spada, advertising manager at the United States division of the Mobil Oil Corporation in Fairfax, Va. ""So we wanted to reinforce our association with it."" **********The unusual appearance of the sloshing ""O"" ads does more than separate Mobil from rivals' campaigns, said Charlie Piccirillo, executive vice president and creative director at DDB Needham. ""There's a lot of wonderfully beautiful car photography"" in the $5 billion worth of automotive advertising running every year, he added, ""and we wanted something that would cut through that as well."" **********Mobil plans to spend about as much on advertising this year as it did in 1991, said Larry J. Iannuzzelli, executive vice president and business unit head at DDB Needham. According to the Leading National Advertisers tracking service, Mobil spent almost $18 million last year, compared with $9.5 million for Shell, $9.8 million for Sunoco and $18.9 million for Amoco. Texaco Inc. is the category's spending leader, at $29.6 million."

At Liz Claiborne Inc., the largest publicly traded clothing manufacturer, profits in the quarter edged up 1.4 percent. **********Following are details of the two earnings reports: The Limited **********Profits at the Limited rose to $200.3 million in the quarter ended Feb. 1, from $172.2 million in the corresponding period last year. Sales increased 20.7 percent, to $2.1 billion, compared with $1.74 billion in the corresponding period last year. **********But the company's strong fourth quarter was the exception for 1991, which was difficult for all retailers. Leslie H. Wexner, the Limited's chairman, said he was disappointed in his company's overall results. **********""Sales, margins and earnings were below our expectations and the year was clearly impacted by missed opportunities,"" Mr. Wexner said. **********Express, a contemporary women's clothing store that last year racked up its first $1 billion sales year, and Victoria's Secret, a lingerie boutique, continued to be the bright stars in the company's constellation of divisions. **********""The merchandising at Express is very innovative and exciting,"" said Margo McGlade, a retail analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ""The choice of colors, fabrics and prints that they're using in their clothing is very appealing."" **********Ms. McGlade and other analysts said the Limited Stores division continued to suffer from a change in merchandising and marketing strategy that began last year, when the company decided its flagship unit should start appealing to a more sophisticated, career woman. **********""They're still trying to reinvent themselves,"" said Heidi R. Steinberg, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ""They need to be consistent in pursuing that target career customer, and to some extent, the repositioning has put them into competition with Liz for that customer."" **********The Limited's earnings in 1991 grew 1 percent, to $403.3 million, from $398.4 million in 1990, while sales increased 17 percent during the year, to $6.2 billion, from $5.3 billion. Its stock closed at $30.875 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, unchanged from Friday. Liz Claiborne **********Earnings at Liz Claiborne for the quarter ended Dec. 28 moved up slightly to $56.5 million, from $55.7 million in the fourth quarter last year. Sales increased 13.3 percent, to $530.7 million, from $468.2 million in the corresponsing period last year. The company dominates the market for moderately priced women's apparel distributed through department stores. **********The company reported a gain despite setting aside $3.4 million for potential losses from the bankruptcy of R. H. Macy & Company last month and the weakest market for women's apparel in years. Deborah Bronston, a textile and apparel manufacturing analyst at Prudential Securities, said real purchases of women's apparel was down 2.3 percent last year, after posting gains throughout the 1980's. **********""The underlying reason that Liz Claiborne continues to take market share in a persistently weak economy like this is that it sells very well at retail,"" Ms. Bronston said. **********She expects the company to grow about 11 percent this year, although if the economy picks up sharply, it could grow as much as 20 percent. **********For the year, Liz Claiborne's earnings increased 8.2 percent, to $222.7 million, from $205.8 million in 1990. Sales soared 16.1 percent in 1991, to $2 billion, from $1.7 billion in 1990. The stock closed yesterday at $41.375, down $1.625 on the Big Board."

By increasing gas taxes, or by imposing fees on gas-guzzlers and paying subsidies to those who buy efficient cars, the current regulatory approach could be strengthened or replaced, the panel suggested. **********The research panel, completing a two-year review, estimated that the technology already existed to increase the average fuel efficiency of passenger cars -- now 27.5 miles a gallon, about that of the popular Ford Taurus station wagon -- to as much as 33 by 2001 and 37 by 2006. **********But it said practical considerations, like the cost of adopting the changes, might reduce the potential for improvement. What is technically possible might not be politically correct, it said. **********The National Research Council is an arm of the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, which examine technical issues on behalf of the Federal Government. The panel's chairman was Richard A. Meserve, a partner in the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, and it drew its members mainly from university and industry engineering laboratories. **********Both sides in the debate contended that the report supported their positions. **********""This is clearly a major defeat for the Naders and the Bryans,"" said Jerry R. Curry, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sets automotive performance standards. He was referring to the consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, sponsor of a measure calling for setting gas mileage standards at 40 miles a gallon by 2001. **********William Noack, a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation, called the report ""a valuable contribution."" He said it supported the auto maker's contention that ""if fuel economy is to be regulated, it should be done as flexibly as possible,"" and preferably by Mr. Curry's office, not by Congress. **********But David Hamilton, a spokesman for the United States Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy group, called the study ""a vindication for all the people who have been saying that significant improvements in fuel economy are possible."" **********A spokesman for Public Citizen, an organization founded by Mr. Nader, said the group was pleased by the report, especially because it played down suggestions that fuel efficiency could be obtained only by compromising vehicle safety. **********For its part, the panel said that neither the agencies that set current standards nor the Congressional committees contemplating changes had enough information available for making sound decisions. **********""It is inescapable that Congress and the governmental agencies are attempting to regulate an industry of tremendous importance to the U.S. economy in the absence of sufficient information from neutral sources on which to base such regulation,"" the panel's report said. **********And it warned that if the standards were set impossibly high, serious damage could be done to the already unhealthy auto industry. Citing 'Serious Defects' **********The report said the existing system for setting standards, which averages the mileage of each manufacturer's cars and requires them to meet an annual target, has ""serious defects,"" chiefly that it disregards the fact that many people do not want to buy smaller cars or otherwise pay for costly improvements in fuel efficiency. But it said that Senator Bryan's proposal was ""perverse"" and ""could be unfair"" because it seeks percentage improvements that set the highest efficiency standards for those manufacturers that already produce the most fuel-efficient cars. **********And in the end, the panel, dodging the very question it had been commissioned to answer, put squarely back into the Government's hands the divisive question of just how efficient cars should become over 15 years. **********""The determination of the practically achievable levels of fuel economy is appropriately the domain of the political process, not this committee,"" the panel said. The Committee's Role **********Two years ago, the committee was instructed to make its best judgment of what level of fuel economy was both technically feasible and otherwise practical. The Bush Administration repeatedly denounced efforts in Congress to legislate big efficiency increases, urging lawmakers to await the academy's report. **********Today Mr. Curry, the Transportation Department official in charge of setting fuel efficiency standards and otherwise regulating the auto industry, said putting this burden on an independent panel had been a ""cowardly approach."" **********He endorsed the main findings of the committee, including its criticisms of the current regulatory approach, which he has long criticized, and said the findings were consistent with his views that only modest gains in efficiency could be made without sacrificing other goals. **********Addressing one of the most contentious issues, the panel said its estimates of efficiency gains could be achieved with only small costs in safety. The auto industry and the Administration have said that cutting weight to achieve greater fuel efficiency would make cars less safe, but the panel said average weight reductions would be less than 10 percent. **********The Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a lobbying group sponsored by automotive and other groups, said the report supported the group's argument that consumers would not support more stringent fuel economy rules. **********The report estimated that adopting all currently available fuel-saving technologies would cost $500 to $2,500 for each passenger car, depending on the model."

Others saw the vote as a political barometer, a victory for nationalism over religious fundamentalism. **********A coalition supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization defeated backers of two increasingly popular Islamic groups, Hamas and the Islamic Holy War. The P.L.O. coalition won because it united mainstream and opposition factions that joined forces to prevent an Islamic victory. P.L.O. List Wins 67% **********The P.L.O. list won 67 percent of the vote; Hamas, 32 percent, and the Islamic Holy War, 1 percent, according to results reported by the university. More than 90 percent of the 2,400 students voted. **********The elections were strictly supervised to prevent disruption. Polling stations were monitored by university staff members, and guards at campus gates checked visitors' identity cards. A discreet distance away, Israeli soldiers manned checkpoints. **********Outside campus buildings plastered with pictures of P.L.O. leaders and militants killed or jailed in the Palestinian uprising, knots of students listened to competing factions peddling political wares. **********A supporter of the Hamas list said he wanted to see an Islamic state in what is now Israel and the occupied territories. ""We're against peace talks and we want to dump autonomy,"" he said, referring to proposals for interim Palestinian self-rule now under discussion at the Middle East peace talks.  Pointing Out the Differences **********An Islamic Holy War backer struggled to explain how his group differed from Hamas. Competing for the first time in university elections, the Holy War faction attracted a small group of campus militants. ""We're not running to win,"" one said, ""we're running to show that we exist."" **********Ignoring the Middle East peace talks in its campaign polemics, the P.L.O. group papered over ideological differences with a general message. ""Our one enemy is the occupation,"" said Fahmi Zaarir. ""We are for national unity, self-determination and an independent state."" Occasional Violence in Past **********The relaxed politicking contrasted sharply with Bir Zeit's troubled past, when violence occasionally flared among rival factions and between students and soldiers sent to break up nationalist protests. The university recently reopened after a closing imposed by Israel for 4 1/2 years because of the Palestinian uprising. **********With several faculty members on the Palestinian negotiating team, Bir Zeit is viewed in the West Bank as a ""national institution"" training the intellectual leadership of a future Palestinian state. **********As the election day drew to a close, the university spokesman, Albert Aghazarian, could hardly conceal his satisfaction that the voting had gone off without a hitch. Speaking Hebrew in a television interview, he sent a message to Israelis who might doubt the Palestinians' political maturity. ""I'm pleased,"" he said, ""that we've reached this level."""

""And the weekend after Thanksgiving was good and indicative of what we think will be a slowly improving environment.""  Analysts said a number of factors contributed to the poor results early in November, including unusually warm weather in certain parts of the country, which hurt sales of fall and winter merchandise, and consumer preoccupation with the Presidential election. **********""Anybody who spoke to these companies early in the month knew then that it was painfully weak,"" Edward A. Weller, a retail analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said. ""But Thanksgiving was good, and we have a strengthening trend."" **********Even though some underlying economic trends continue to suggest a sputtering recovery -- employment and wage growth both continue to be moribund, for example -- conditions are markedly better now than they were a year ago. That, analysts said, is one reason they are upbeat about the Christmas selling season. **********An index of same-store sales at 18 retailers compiled by Alex. Brown & Sons rose just 1.8 percent last December. **********Because of the year-to-year comparison and because two extra selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas fall in December, ""I think December sales will look unusually good,"" Robert F. Buchanan, an Alex. Brown analyst, said. **********Indeed, if sales ""aren't up substantially, it's a bad sign,"" Mr. Buchanan added, noting that a gain of 5 percent or less would not be good news for retailers or the economy. **********""The environment has picked up some,"" Mr. Buchanan said, ""but it is still tough. It's not like shoppers are walking around with a lot of cash out there."" **********Among individual retailers, analysts said they were particularly impressed with results posted by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., whose same-store sales rose by 7 percent last month; by the J. C. Penney Company, whose sales rose by 5.1 percent, and the Limited Inc., where sales were up by 8 percent. **********Chains whose results were poorer than expected were led by the Gap Inc., whose same-store sales were up just 1 percent in November. Lower Prices **********""The Gap had a disappointing month,"" Mr. Weller at Montgomery Securities said. ""Part of that is related to the fact that the merchandise they sold was moved at much lower prices than they had planned."" **********The Gap's results also disappointed investors, and the price of the company's stock slid by 75 cents a share, to $35.375, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********In addition to the Gap, some analysts said sales results posted by the Woolworth Corporation were unexpectedly bad. **********Same-store sales at Woolworth fell by 1.1 percent in November from a year earlier. **********The drop in sales may have surprised some outsiders, but Mr. Weller said the decline probably did not raise many eyebrows or concerns within the company. **********""Some retailers had been expecting soft sales because they ran so many promotions a year ago,"" he said.

Profits Are Up 6.7% In Quarter," **********Fueled by strong sales in the United States and overseas, the Procter & Gamble Company yesterday reported profits for its second fiscal quarter that were better than expected, sending the company's stock up by more than 5 percent. **********For the three months that ended on Dec. 31, Procter & Gamble's net earnings totaled $523 million, up by 6.7 percent from the $490 million reported in the comparable period in 1990. **********The company's earnings per share rose by 8 percent, to $1.47 from $1.36, and sales totaled $7.50 billion, up by 9.4 percent from $6.85 billion. **********Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said the higher earnings and sales resulted from ""broadly based unit volume growth in the United States and international businesses."" Lower Profits Expected **********The stock jumped $5.50 a share, to $102.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, because Wall Street analysts had expected the company to post lower profits for the quarter. The consensus estimate had been about $1.36 a share. **********The gains came despite what Procter & Gamble's chairman, Edwin L. Artzt, characterized as ""continued recessionary market softness"" in the United States. He said sales in the United States rose by 5 percent in most major product groups. Mr. Artzt said the company's international business grew at double-digit rates for the first six months of the fiscal year. **********""They are gaining market share in every market they compete in,"" said Joseph H. Kozloff, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ""P.& G. is out there hurting people,"" he added, referring to the company's competitors in the coffee, diapers and detergent business. **********Analysts said Procter & Gamble was finally beginning to benefit from its heavy spending in new products and advertising throughout the recession. The company's spending hurt profits for the last 12 months. Last year, for example, the company introduced a new line of diapers and spent heavily to promote them. **********""They didn't really pull back when other companies did,"" said Jay H. Freedman, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. ""It's pretty well documented that companies that are willing to bite the bullet and invest wisely through a recession tend to pick up share."" **********Because of the continuing investment, Mr. Kozloff of Smith Barney said P.& G.'s earnings were poised to improve, predicting a series of quarterly earnings increases. ""Procter is getting ready to explode on the upside,"" he said."

Youth unemployment now stands at 40 percent, 35 percent of the town's 45,000 inhabitants are immigrants and crime is rampant. This helps to explain why the extreme rightist National Front won 34.9 percent of votes here in regional elections last March. **********""The weight of these problems means it is hard to interest people in Europe,"" said Paul Picard, a Socialist who is the town's Mayor. ""They want to talk about local problems. It's difficult for them to think 10 years ahead. They think of today and tomorrow."" **********A European Community flag in the corner of his office confirmed the Mayor's own European credentials, but he says he suspects he is in a minority. ""One way people have of telling politicians to pay attention to their local problems is to vote against the treaty,"" Mr. Picard said. Too Close to Call **********With no poll results permitted in the week before the referendum, the last campaign poll released today gave a narrow advantage of 53 percent to 47 percent to supporters of the treaty among decided voters. But even the Government, which is hoping that voters support the treaty, concedes that the outcome is too close to call. **********What is already clear, though, is that many voter intentions are being shaped by reasons that have little to do with whether the treaty -- and its plans to give the 12 nations of the European Community a single currency and a common foreign and security policy -- are good or bad for France as a whole. **********Rather, many ordinary French are viewing both the treaty and Europe through the far narrower prism of their own hopes and fears. And for them, conceptual debates about sovereignty and monetary union often seem irrelevant compared to whether or not they believe their lives will get better. **********In the countryside around Mantes-la-Jolie, a town 40 miles west of Paris, hundreds of handwritten roadside signs confirm the pessimism of French farmers, who are angry over European Community plans to reduce agricultural subsidies. The European union treaty in fact makes no mention of farming, but their no vote is a certainty. Protests Throughout France **********""No to Maastricht,"" some signs read, referring to the Dutch city where the treaty was signed last December. Others echo fears of foreign competition: ""Japanese cars, Taiwanese electronics, American wheat, French unemployment."" And similar protests can now be found throughout France. **********In Mantes-la-Jolie, where three people died in clashes between police and children of Arab immigrants last year, confidence in the future is equally hard to find, not only because of racial tensions, but also because unemployment is still rising. **********""The local Renault and Peugeot car factories that used to employ 30,000 people each now only have jobs for 8,000 or 9,000,"" said Jean-Pierre, the manager of a local cars parts who declined to give his full name. ""Is this going to change with Europe? Things will get worse, I'm sure."" **********Certainly, with the French economy sliding into recession and many businessmen blaming high German interest rates for the high price of borrowing money, few people here expect ratification of the European union treaty to bring a surge of new investment and fresh job opportunities. Nationwide, unemployment is 10 percent. 'Too Fast and Too Soon' **********Didier Simond, the president of the region's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said a poll of his members showed that they were evenly split on the treaty, but his own view was that France was not ready for it. ""It is too fast and too soon,"" Mr. Simond said of the European Community's new blueprint. **********His particular concern, though not an issue in the referendum, relates to plans to eliminate France's borders with its community neighbors when a single regional market goes into effect next January. ""In a town like Mantes-la-Jolie, which is a victim of immigration, it's worrying to have no police controls at borders,"" he said. **********Fear of new immigration, not only from North Africa but also from Eastern Europe, is expected to result in many no votes in other towns and cities that account for many of France's 3 million immigrants in a population of 55 million. Yet probably no town in France has a concentration of immigrants comparable to the neighborhood of Val-Fourre here. **********Less than two miles from the town center, 20,000 people of immigrant origin -- some born in France, others now French citizens -- live in crowded public housing. And because most youths leave school at 16 with no hope of finding work, drug peddling and petty crime often spills out of the area. A 'This Europe Is for the Rich' **********Among its residents who can vote next Sunday, however, yes posters proclaiming that ""Europe is Prosperity"" bring cynical laughs. ""The referendum is not interesting for us,"" Mounir Nait, who runs a youth recreation center, said. ""This Europe is for the rich. I'm interested in what is happening to me. And nothing will change."" **********Karim, who refused to disclose his surname, is a rare son of Algerian parents who acquired a good enough education to find work as an accountant. But he too sees nothing for Val-Fourre in the European treaty. ""Anyway, I refuse to vote for a state like France,"" he said. ""It has no interest in us."" **********In contrast, Georges Kerouane, an Algerian-born French citizen who runs the local chapter of France-Plus, an organization that helps immigrants, said he would vote yes because of a plan to create a European citizenship. ""We may not be accepted as French in France, but we will be outside France,"" he said. **********Oddly, here as elsewhere in France, the same reasons are often to given to justify both yes and no positions -- the treaty will and will not help economic growth, it will and will not bring greater security, it will and will not enable Europe to face American and Japanese competition, and so on. Charlemagne vs. Prussia **********Mr. Picard, the 48-year-old Mayor of Mantes-la-Jolie, even mentioned immigration as a reason for backing the treaty, arguing that only a united Europe could help develop North Africa. ""Until people can live well in their own countries, we'll never stop them from coming here,"" he explained. **********Sometimes, though, people give unorthodox reasons for their votes. Hunters, for example, fear that the European Community will curb their activities. Customs officers fear that they will lose their jobs. Students see a better chance of studying abroad. **********Chatting on a sidewalk here, a local doctor and a local notary, who both refused to give their names, explained their different votes. ""Yes, because it's the only way to stop re-creation of the old Prussian empire,"" the notary said. ""No,"" the doctor retorted, ""because I will only accept a united Europe like that of Charlemagne -- one ruled by France."""

The two companies must secure financing within two weeks or Child World will be forced to liquidate its remaining 71 stores. And analysts said that some toy manufacturers had already written off losses from Child World, and harbored little interest in seeing Child World resuscitated. ""Toy manufacturers have been extremely patient with the two companies, and they've just about run out of patience,"" said Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody. **********A spokesman for Mattel Inc., however, said the company had not fully written off the money it is owed by Child World, and he predicted Mattel would lose up to $10 million if Child World went out of business. For Mattel, the combination of Child World and Lionel would be a positive step. ""We believe Child World is a viable entity,"" said Glenn Bozarth, the spokesman. **********W.

""It will be difficult,"" he said yesterday in a telephone interview from his office in Avon, Mass. He cited a number of reasons why the merger would make financial sense, including lowered operating and advertising expenses. **********If the talks fail, the closing of 71 Child World stores would add roughly 50 percent to the sales of Toys ""R"" Us in markets where the two companies compete, said Edward L. Eyring, an analyst at Argus Research. Toys ""R"" Us stock rose 75 cents, to $32.50, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. When Child World, the nation's second-largest toy retailer after Toys ""R"" Us, filed for bankruptcy on May 7, the company said it would close 54 of the least profitable of its 125 stores. It said the remaining stores were operating profitably, but the company lacked its needed credit line. **********Mr. Jacobson added that the closing of Child World and Lionel's Kiddie City stores would have little impact on the toy manufacturers' sales, as stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target have increasingly emphasized toys in recent years. **********If the two companies prove unable to secure financing, Lionel would continue to operate its 71 stores. Last year, Lionel received debtor-in-possession financing that will guarantee it a $55 million credit line through June 1993. It closed 30 of its 101 stores last year, and the remaining stores are profitable, said George Padgett, senior vice president and general counsel. **********Child World and Lionel almost merged in 1987, but their deal fell apart when the stock market crashed."

Propelled by new shows like an animated version of the Caped Crusader's exploits, as well as growing demand from marketers to reach the nation's youngest consumers, advance sales of commercial time on children's television programming for the 1992-93 season have been strikingly robust. **********In the advance market, which began earlier this month, advertisers and their agencies have been clamoring for a chance to buy spots on weekday and Saturday-morning fare like ""Batman: The Animated Series"" on the Fox network, ""Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles"" on CBS and ""The Ren and Stimpy Show"" on the Nickelodeon cable network. **********While sales for the overall television market remain sluggish at best, it is estimated that the children's market will reach $475 million to $500 million, up 5 to 6 percent, which would match or perhaps slightly exceed last season's strong performance. **********""All you need is one new account to goose it up,"" said Joseph D. Abruzzese, senior vice president of network sales for CBS in New York. ""There is a lot of pent-up demand."" **********That demand reflects the perennial needs of marketers of toys, sugared cereals, sports trading cards and other products to reach the 36.3 million children ages 2 to 11. **********But a growing force in the marketplace are marketers of other products -- apparel, athletic shoes, fast food, packaged foods and video games -- who have begun to sell directly to children. Among them are giant advertisers like Burger King, Kraft General Foods, Levi Strauss, McDonald's, Pizza Hutand Reebok International. **********""The tremendous strength in the kids' marketplace comes from recognizing kids as influencers,"" said Art Heller, executive vice president and director of media services at Griffin Bacal in New York, who buys for clients like Hasbro, the toy maker, and Sports Graphics, which sells backpacks. ""Whether kids directly have disposable funds or whether they have a strong influence on parents' purchases, companies are competing for that audience."" **********Harvey Ganot, executive vice president of advertising and promotion sales at the MTV Networks in New York, owner of Nickelodeon, added that today's children were ""a lot more worldly."" **********Children nowadays are much more fashion- and trend-oriented than previous generations, which would gladly play with hand-me-down Hula-Hoops or tote their older siblings' ""Brady Bunch"" lunch boxes to school. **********That factor helps explain why Nickelodeon is spending $40 million to augment its lineup of tried-and-true cartoon series with three new ones including ""Ren and Stimpy,"" which updates animal cartoons like ""Tom and Jerry"" in the same satiric, hip way that ""The Simpsons"" updated ""The Flintstones."" **********A particularly powerful performance in the advance market has been turned in by the Fox Broadcasting Company, which has booked slightly more than $100 million in sales, said Jon Nesvig, senior vice president for sales. **********Fox's stellar performance is due in no small measure to the ""Batman"" series, which will run on most Fox stations at 4:30 P.M., Eastern time. Advertising Age reported that the price of a 30-second spot on ""Batman"" ran as high as $50,000, a record for children's programming. **********NBC has also added some spice to the children's market by replacing cartoons with live-action sitcoms like ""California Dreams"" and game shows like ""Double Date"" that would appeal more to ""tweens,"" children 9 to 14, and teen-agers. **********One executive was skeptical. ""There isn't $30 million worth of teen money in the marketplace,"" said Jon Mandel, senior vice president and director of national broadcast at Grey Advertising in New York, who buys time for clients like Kraft General Foods, Hasbro and M & M/Mars."

As a result, even sophisticated customers have become befuddled when the pay telephone summarily rejects the card number from their own long-distance company. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company kicked off a new controversy last year when it issued a new calling card. The company boasted that its card allowed customers to make calls just by dialing zero, the phone number and their credit card number. Trouble was, this ""zero plus"" dialing did not work on about one-quarter of pay phones that use long-distance companies other than A.T.& T., and many customers were furious. **********Rivals complained that A.T.& T. was trying to put subtle pressure on pay-phone companies and hotels to sign up with A.T.& T. to avoid getting angry customers. Competitors complained that A.T.& T. had failed to properly tell customers that they could reach the network from any pay phone by dialing a toll-free number or a special code. **********The F.C.C. is hoping to write rules requiring all pay phones to use computer data bases that allow them to verify card numbers from any company. In the meantime, it ordered A.T.& T. to immediately begin to ""educate"" its customers on how to use the special codes. A company spokesman said A.T.& T. would ""continue its commitment to educate customers."""

With the President-elect advocating spending at least $20 billion for each of the four years of his Administration on such projects, many on Wall Street say several steelmakers are bound to benefit. **********But which? The large, integrated steel companies, whose products are directed largely at the auto and appliance industries, seem less likely to benefit than several smaller mini-mill companies. For one thing, mini-mill companies generally have the advantage of producing only a few products, compared with the integrated mills' supermarket approach. For another, the mini-mills produce steel with lower-cost operations, using melted scrap, in less-populated areas, often with a lower-paid, nonunion work force. **********For companies whose products are linked directly with highway and bridge construction, many analysts expect a bonanza. And nothing excites them more than the companies that produce the steel bars that reinforce concrete in highway construction, a product known as rebar. ""Much of the entire steel industry is in a position to benefit from Mr. Clinton's plan on infrastructure spending, particularly producers of concrete reinforcing bar,"" said Aldo Mazzaferro of C. J. Lawrence. ""Plate and structural steel producers will benefit, too, but less so than makers of rebar."" **********At the top of many analysts' lists is Birmingham Steel, an Alabama company where rebar accounts for about 65 percent of output. Its stock, after trading in the mid-20's for much of the summer, climbed above 30 after the election and rose as high as 32 last week. ""I think it's a reflection of the expectation that the highway legislation under Bill Clinton will be expanded,"" Mr. Mazzaferro said. **********But other factors are contributing to the rise of Birmingham Steel stock. The company, some analysts note, is coming to the end of a capital expansion and cost-reduction program that will enable it to produce 40 percent more steel with nearly 20 percent lower operating costs. Mr. Mazzaferro expects the company's earnings to increase to $2 a share for fiscal 1993 and $3.30 for fiscal 1994, from $1.66 in fiscal 1992, which ended June 30. **********John E. Jacobson, president of Jacobson & Associates, a consulting firm, said he anticipated gains by the Nucor Corporation as a result of any increase in infrastructure spending. Nucor, the largest mini-mill producer, is in a strong position, he said, because it produces rebar as well as structural steel, some of which is used in bridges. **********""Because of their position as a large player, the wide scope of their products and their emphasis on the structurals and bars,"" Mr. Jacobson said, ""they stand to benefit more than other companies from a national federally induced boost in infrastructure spending."" **********Indeed, Nucor stock already reflects such optimism. After trading in the low- to mid-50's for much of the summer, it reached 73 last week. **********Some analysts attribute Nucor's gains to several long-term factors, particularly the company's rapid move into the flat-rolled sheet-steel business, the bread and butter of the larger integrated companies. Sheet steel -- which goes into cars and appliances -- makes up half the nation's steel output. And Nucor's move into that arena has been tooled with a low-cost process that produces sheets cast from thin slabs, greatly reducing the steps needed to make the final product. **********The chairmen of Birmingham Steel and Nucor are far more cautious in their assessments. ""I doubt it will make an impact on our business, or the steel business for that matter, for the near future,"" said James A. Todd, chairman of Birmingham Steel. F. Kenneth Iverson, chairman of Nucor, said much the same. **********Analysts beg to differ. ""Nucor is the ultimate growth stock, even without any infrastructure spending,"" Mr. Mazzaferro said. ""The driving force is their ability to gain in the sheet market. It's the single largest market in steel, 50 percent of steel consumption. They made one million tons last year, and in 1993, they will double that to two million. I expect them to increase that to four million to five million tons of sheet by 1995. Nucor is the best-performing stock that I follow -- 25 a share in 1989 and it's 70 right now. I believe it's on its way to 100 to 130 in 1994."""

The ban follows the release of a two-year investigation by labor unions into the support that the agency has provided for investment promotion boards in Central America and the Caribbean. **********At a press conference on Friday, union officials charged that an A.I.D.-subsidized organization in El Salvador, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development, had lured American apparel manufacturers by taking out advertisements in American trade magazines. One of the advertisements showed a woman, identified as Rosa Martinez, sitting in front of a sewing machine. **********""You can hire her for 33 cents an hour,"" the ad promised. A senior A.I.D. official acknowledged in an interview that the agency had given $100 million to the organization since 1984, but contended that only 6 percent of the money had been used for attracting foreign investment to El Salvador. **********The A.I.D. official, who insisted on anonymity, said the rest of the money had been spent on economic studies and small-business development projects. But Charles P. Kernaghan, who headed the investigation on behalf of 21 unions, said he had found little evidence in El Salvador that those other projects were receiving any money. **********A Salvadoran Government official said American businesses ""could move anyway, and it happens to be they chose El Salvador."" **********The results of the unions' investigation were first reported on Sept. 27 by the CBS News program ""60 Minutes."" **********The ban approved by the House-Senate conference committee was actually one of the mildest responses proposed. A California Democrat called for banning A.I.D. from providing any money to free-trade zones and foreign investment promotion boards in poor countries. And a group of 28 other representatives went even further, calling for the agency's $500 million in annual operating expenses to be cut off until the accusations were investigated. **********A.I.D. officials had no reaction today to the prohibition, which is likely to become law when the foreign-aid bill comes up for final votes in the House and Senate, probably on Monday. **********Union officials and sympathetic members of Congress have so far focused their criticism narrowly on A.I.D. But by highlighting the issue of job losses from international competition, many of them also hope to strengthen their position for an effort next year to block Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********The trade ministers of the United States, Canada and Mexico are scheduled to initial the free-trade pact on Wednesday at a ceremony in San Antonio to be attended by President Bush. **********Unions are using the A.I.D.'s financial support as the basis for a broader attack on the Administration's foreign assistance philosophy of encouraging trade in addition to paying for conventional aid projects, like building schools or providing immunization injections. **********Representative George E. Brown Jr., Democrat of California, said at a press conference with union leaders on Friday that A.I.D. should limit its private-sector projects to helping small businesses. **********The senior A.I.D. official pointed out that American exports to Central America and the Caribbean ballooned in recent years, making them two of the few regions in the world where the United States has a trade surplus. The United States ran an overall trade deficit of $66.3 billion last year. **********Part of the increase in American exports to Central America consists of American fabric shipments. Central American and Caribbean nations are allowed to import American-made cloth, assemble it into garments and ship the garments to the United States free of the quotas and most of the import taxes."

But Gerber, the undisputed king of the $1 billion baby-food market, loses 10,000 gurgling, happy consumers a day. Why? They grow up and defiantly reject a diet of rice cereal and strained peaches. **********So, in an ambitious plan to more than double its pool of potential customers, the Gerber Products Company will soon market a new line of vegetables, snacks and stews that it hopes will appeal to the more sophisticated palates of 2- and 3-year-olds. **********But whether those children's parents will buy enough of the new product to justify Gerber's decision is far from certain. Despite its 72 percent share of baby-food sales, Gerber has a spotty record in its past efforts to expand beyond the bib brigade. Nature vs. Nurture **********For the last 10,000 years or so, babies, once they develop teeth, have survived by graduating from milk and infant gruel to eating most of the same foods consumed by their parents and older siblings. **********When told about Gerber's plans for toddler food, called Gerber Graduates, some nutritionists, parents and others were quick to criticize the idea as an example of marketing gone amok. **********""It is a completely unnecessary product,"" said Kate Clancy, a professor of nutrition at Syracuse University. ""It gives parents the impression that they are incapable of providing the right kind of food for their kids."" **********But Gerber executives dismiss such criticism as potshots from nutritionists living in a fantasy world, where parents are in the kitchen making homemade apple sauce and fresh steamed vegetables for their child each meal. **********""Maybe those nutritionists' children have been eating fruit,"" said Steve Poole, a Gerber spokesman, ""but most kids are eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and SpaghettiOs and things that are not appropriate for them. I think those nutritionists are living in world that is somewhat false."" **********Gerber executives have high hopes for the product. **********""It is the most important thing that we have launched since we basically invented the category of baby food in 1928,"" said James T. Smith, Gerber's president. **********Mr. Smith said the Graduates rollout would be the most expensive product introduction in the company's history, although he would not disclose the marketing budget. Gerber, based in Fremont, Mich., will run its first network television advertising in several years when it introduces the product nationally this fall, he said. **********The new line, whose 23 dishes include diced green beans, Cheerios-like cereal, turkey stew and baby-sized low-sodium hot dogs, will cost about $1 each. **********Sales of Gerber's basic baby foods have been climbing steadily for the last few years, with sales last year of $650 million in the United States. But the company expects the Graduates line to add $400 million to $500 million a year in five years. **********""We are trying to get people to feed baby food earlier and trying to get mothers to stay on baby food longer,"" Mr. Smith said. ""We think it is nutritionally better for the child. It's obviously good business for us if we can extend that age."" Stock Is Favored **********Analysts familiar with the new food line are recommending Gerber stock, which closed yesterday at $62.125, down 37.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. If nothing else, said John M. McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential Securities, the company's near-monopoly position in the existing market merits more recognition from investors. **********The company is planning to start shipping Gerber Graduates to some grocery stores at the end of the month, with national sales planned for the fall. **********Although Gerber says that consumers have requested such transitional foods for toddlers, the early informal reaction outside of Wall Street seems lukewarm. Informal Poll of Parents **********When told about the plans for toddler cuisine, few parents said it was the answer to their prayers. **********""Anything I eat, he'll eat,"" said Liz Marte, the 20-year-old mother of Timothy, an energetic 19-month-old in Manhattan. ""I don't think he would like a hot dog in a jar."" Her own diet includes pasta and chicken, she said. **********There is no need for such products, said Wendy, a 31-year-old mother, sharing a lunch-time cheeseburger and fries at McDonald's with her 2-year-old daughter, Loren. ""She'll eat anything now,"" said the mother, who would not give her last name. **********No one is criticizing the nutritional content of Gerber Graduates, but Dr. Clancy and others say they are concerned that the new line will inflate the food bills of lower-income families, who tend to buy more baby food than more affluent consumers. **********""Families that are lower income are already stretched,"" said Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington.  ""To saddle them with the added costs of food that they could easily prepare themselves is abusing the marketing system."" **********Even a Gerber study shows that baby food is more expensive per serving than fresh food prepared for a baby. Many of the entrees are also slightly costlier than similar servings of existing packaged foods, like Cheerios. The Real-World Defense **********Still, the company says the higher cost of baby food is more than offset by its convenience and nutrition. **********In the real world, Mr. Poole said, the alternative to the low-sodium foods offered in the Gerber line, was a dinner of ""chicken wings or pork chops."" **********Regardless of the initial reaction to the new foods, some health advocacy groups say that expanding the baby food audience is far from the worst marketing threat to lower-income families. These groups point to the huge amount of liquor and cigarette advertising directed at poor people. **********""Baby food is a good product,"" said Jane Delgado, president of the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations, in Washington. ""There are so many unhealthy products, we need to focus on those,"" she said, arguing that tobacco companies are the single largest sponsor of parades, street fairs and other events in Hispanic neighborhoods. **********It is ""intellectual imperialism,"" she said, to suggest that poor people could not make a reasoned judgment about whether the new line of baby foods made economic sense for them. **********""Poor people make choices every day,"" Dr. Delgado said. ""People will not make choices that aren't to their benefit."" **********She noted that fresh produce was often more expensive in poor neighborhoods, and that in families where the mother worked, it was unrealistic to think that fresh food could be prepared at each meal. She also said poor people typically shopped only once a week, making canned food more attractive. In Search of New Mouths **********Gerber's enthusiasm for the new Graduates line may be tied to the company's strong need to find new growth markets, so to speak. The birth rate in the United States is expected to stay flat for the rest of the decade and the company already has 72 percent of the baby-food market in this country. **********For the year ended March 31, Gerber Products had $1.2 billion in sales and profits of $127.5 million. **********In the 1970's, the company tested Singles, a line of food for adults that was sold in baby-food-type jars. The line flopped, in part, Mr. Poole said, because the name Singles reminded elderly customers that they were eating alone. **********The company also introduced the Chunky line of products for toddlers, in 1982. That has not sold very well either, and it will be largely phased out in favor of Graduates. **********Gerber has also moved down the age ladder, entering the infant formula market several years ago by licensing the Gerber name to the Mead Johnson division of Bristol-Meyers. **********Beech-Nut, a division of Ralston Purina and a distant second in the baby food market, said it was watching the Graduate line with interest. Responding to the Gerber test marketing, Beech-Nut started selling its Tabletop line of microwavable dinners for toddlers in 1990. **********But Beech-Nut said it had no additional plans to pursue older kids. ""We are continuing to focus on the infants,"" said Elmer Richars, a spokesman for Ralston Purina in St. Louis. **********Gerber justifies its premium prices by pointing out that the products are specially designed for ""little hands and mouths."" For instance, the Graduates juice boxes are much narrower than regular juice boxes, making them easier to hold. And its pretzels are designed to crumble rather than to break into sharp edges when bitten. **********That was not enough for Toni Bernstein, a Manhattan mother of two children under 3 years old. ""In a pinch, I might pick one up,"" she said. ""But I wouldn't be a regular user."""

End of a Monopoly **********Nevertheless, the entry of Texas Instruments and others into what had been an Intel monopoly does mean Intel's profit margins will suffer. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has also entered the market for 486 chips, and Chips and Technologies Inc. has introduced a 386-compatible chip. **********Intel shares fell more than 4 percent today, closing at $49, down $2.25, in over-the-counter trading. Advanced Micro shares took an even bigger hit, losing more than 10 percent of their value, closing at $15.625, off $1.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Also on the Big Board, Texas Instruments slipped 87.5 cents, to $36.625. **********Intel said on Wednesday that it would cut the price on its 20-megahertz 486SX chip from $282 to $119 in a move intended to make this chip the standard for mass-market personal computers that now use the 386 chip. **********The move also appeared intended to blunt the success of Advanced Micro's 40-megahertz 386DX chip, which has been gaining market share at Intel's expense. With added memory, the higher-speed 386 is comparable in performance to the 486SX. **********""Intel got hit with a classic double-whammy,"" said Drew Peck, an analyst with Donaldson, Lukfin & Jenrette, referring to the price cuts and the Texas Instruments announcements. Overreaction on Price Cuts **********On the price cuts, however, he said the market had overreacted. ""No one has paid $282 for a 486SX since it was introduced; no one has paid more than $139 in the last six months,"" he said. ""Intel was basically stating the obvious about four months too late."" **********On the gray market, where chips are resold by unauthorized distributors and brokers, the 25-megahertz 486SX now sells for $105, Mr. Peck said. There is no market for this chip at the retail price because customers either opt for the more expensive, but more functional, 486DX or the smaller and less expensive 386DX from either Intel or Advanced Micro. **********Advanced Micro plans to ship 486SX and 486DX chips by the end of the year. Texas Instruments and Cyrix said they were producing sample chips now and would ship in volume by September. While their initial chip is nominally comparable to a 486SX, additional derivatives are planned, which will most likely include a 486DX clone. Response of Advanced Micro **********Advanced Micro said it would continue to meet Intel's prices while offering either higher-speed or more powerful versions of its chips. Intel's price cut ""appears to be a move to revive a bankrupt strategy,"" said Ben Anixter, Advanced Micro's vice president for external affairs. ""We're still dealing with somebody who's trying to regain their monopoly."" **********Cyrix announced its Cx486SLC microprocessor on March 30, and was promptly sued by Intel. But by teaming with Texas Instruments, which has a comprehensive patent cross-licensing agreement with Intel, Cyrix hopes to circumvent Intel's claim. Texas Instruments, which is known for its aggressive patent litigation, has said it will support Cyrix in court. **********Advanced Micro recently won an arbitration ruling giving it the right to produce the 386 chip, but still faces an Intel suit on microcode, the software embedded in the chip, and is vulnerable to potential suits on the 486. Intel has also sued Chips and Technologies to block shipments of its chip."

More questions arose later that morning at an informal gathering she attended with other artists and writers who organized the first demonstrations in Bratislava against Communist rule in November 1989. The protests were part of the peaceful revolution that unseated the Communist Government. **********""We thought, 'Should we have another revolution?' "" Ms. Krnacova said. ""It looks as if Meciar and Klaus are heading towards splitting this country up, and we don't want that.""  Seeking a Confederation **********While most of the more than 4.5 million ethnic Slovaks say their republic is disadvantaged in its federation with slightly more than 10 million people in the Czech republic to the west, few are calling for an outright break. **********A poll conducted in April by Bratislava's Center for Social Analysis showed that 17 percent of the people in Slovakia favored an independent Slovak state. And the elections this month and interviews with dozens of Slovaks indicate that most are looking for a middle way, in which Slovakia could loosen its ties to Prague but preserve a common nation. **********""I think most of our people are for one common state as long as a few things are changed,"" said Andrej Sarvas, an architect who was taking his two children to a nearby park today. ""But Slovakia needs to have a strong political force to stand up to the Czechs."" **********The question facing both Czechs and Slovaks is how far their links can be loosened before a single country ceases to exist. **********Mr. Meciar, whose Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won roughly one-third of the vote in the election, has not called for an independent Slovakia. But many people, including Slovak critics and Czechs, say that is virtually what he is demanding in his talks with Mr. Klaus's Civic Democratic Party. **********In addition to the international recognition of Slovakia as a ""sovereign state,"" Mr. Meciar wants Slovak representation abroad and the dissolution of the federally run television station, which he says is biased. Mr. Klaus has said he must have either a strong Federal Government or a complete break, a step that he and Mr. Meciar seem to be daring each other to take first. **********""Our people have made a great error in voting for Meciar, and now they are slowly realizing it,"" said Marta Gluchich, an elderly woman who attended church services this morning. ""Nobody knew what he really wanted."" **********Indeed, several Slovaks said that they were confused by the agreements the two parties had reached. For 24 hours after the announcement of the agreement on Saturday, Czechoslovak television repeatedly played a tape of Mr. Meciar and Mr. Klaus reading their agreement, leaving it up to the viewer to decide what it all meant. **********In Slovakia, where unemployment is nearly 12 percent -- three times the rate in the Czech republic -- and rising, newspapers have rarely tried to analyze the economic consequences of an independent Slovakia, journalists said. Patronizing Attitude **********Relations between the republics, from the Slovak point of view, are hampered by the fact that Prague is nearly 200 miles from the border of the Slovak republic. Though Czechs and Slovaks can understand each other's languages and many have intermarried, Slovaks maintain that most Bohemians are patronizing toward them. **********""They say, 'You're nice, your landscapes are beautiful but you'll be ruined without Prague,' "" said Ivan Vlaciha, the director of Slovex Consulting and Trade Service, Slovakia's main foreign trade consulting firm. **********Mr. Vlaciha said that in the last few months, he had begun to imagine that an independent Slovakia with its own capital might in fact help the region attract foreign investment. Such investment has flowed into Slovakia far more slowly than into Prague, where most of the foreign trading companies were based before the revolution. **********A few Slovaks say they feel no misgivings about the wisdom of a split or confusion about what the politicians are driving at. **********""Agreement on a government between Meciar and Klaus? There was no agreement, and that means it was a split,"" said Josef Bernard, a retired lawyer. ""And that's fine because the Czechs have always oppressed us and it's time we're on our own."""

But investors may be in for a nasty shock when rates finally kick up. **********Here's how it works: The funds, betting that rates will not rise, ""borrow"" by issuing short-term preferred stock at a low, fixed rate and then reinvest the proceeds in longer-term issues with a higher yield. That way, the funds lock in higher yields on a larger amount of money, thus greatly increasing the fund's overall return. **********The flip side is that if they bet wrong and rates rise, the damage is magnified. **********Leveraging ""gives you more bang for your buck, so you come out ahead of the game if you're on the right side of the interest-rate move,"" said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami analyst who specializes in closed-end funds. **********Leverage is the tool of choice today among closed-end funds. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, mutual funds can issue only common stock. But closed-end funds can issue preferred shares as well. **********Closed-end equity funds also use leverage, often to increase capital gains in rising markets. But the vast majority are income funds, both tax-free and taxable, which use leverage to let them pay bigger dividends. **********For example, in 1991 the Nuveen Municipal Value Fund returned 11.44 percent, while the Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund, similar except that it uses leverage, returned 15.75 percent. **********In a typical example, a leveraged bond fund would issue preferred shares priced in units of $50,000 or $100,000 and maturing in 7 or 28 days. Underwriters distribute the shares mainly to institutional investors and wealthy individuals. The preferred shares usually have a high quality rating, and today would pay an annual rate of about 3 percent, competitive with other short-term rates. **********Proceeds from the sale of the preferred shares are invested in longer-term bonds yielding about 7 or 8 percent. The difference in rates goes to the fund's shareholders in the form of a higher yield. The bigger the difference between short- and long-term rates, the more valuable leverage becomes. **********By law, funds can borrow an amount equal to 50 percent of net assets, but most leverage no more than a third of their portfolios. **********The yield advantage has proved immensely popular with investors seeking refuge from historically low interest rates. Today, more than half of all closed-end funds use leverage, and these hold $38.6 billion in assets. But experts say most new shareholders have turned a blind eye to the built-in risk. **********What people forget -- everyone from small investors to the ever-leveraged Donald J. Trump -- is that betting with borrowed money can cut both ways. Gains are magnified, but so are losses. Because most leveraged closed-end funds are relatively new, they have not yet encountered a market cycle of rising rates, which would prove rocky indeed. **********Once the value of the underlying portfolio slips, the price of a fund's shares declines more sharply than would prices of nonleveraged funds. It works this way: Assume a closed-end fund owns $100 million worth of bonds paying 10 percent. If long-term rates rise to 11 percent, Mr. Herzfeld calculates, the portfolio would be worth $90.9 million, which translates into a drop in the fund's share price from $10 to $9.09. Now assume that a similar leveraged fund owns the same bonds but has also issued $50 million of preferred shares. When rates rise one point, the value of the portfolio falls to $136.4 million. Subtracting the preferred $50 million -- a fixed commitment -- leaves common stockholders with $86.4 million, or $8.63 a share, Mr. Herzfeld said. **********Rising short-term rates will also reduce the dividends paid by leveraged funds, said Anthony N. Maltese, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. How much dividends fall depends on how much of a cushion a fund has built up, how much of its dividend is created by leveraging, and how often rates on the preferred shares are reset. **********And there is another danger. Because the funds have been so profitable, prices have been bid up. Prices of closed-end funds, which are listed on stock exchanges, are set by supply and demand, so shares can trade at a premium or discount to the value of the securities the funds own. The average premium on the taxable funds is now 4.4 percent, and 2.4 percent for the tax-free funds. When rates begin to rise, the funds will lose both income and net asset value more quickly than nonleveraged funds, and as that happens, the leveraged funds' premiums will probably erode or slip to a discount as investors head for the exit. **********Mr. Herzfeld concludes that ""a leveraged fund selling for a premium is a very dangerous investment."" For his part, Mr. Maltese tells investors, ""The biggest risks are in funds whose market prices have been bid up because of high yields."" But he adds that if you can find a fund not trading at an inflated price, ""you can still achieve a yield pickup without taking excessive risk."""

Milken and hundreds of other former Drexel Burnham Lambert executives may provide a wedge for an out-of-court settlement of the case. **********The Resolution Trust Corporation, which is seeking to recover millions lost on high-risk junk bond investments in the savings and loan crisis, appears to be pressing for the acceptance of a $1.3 billion settlement that was rejected last week by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, lawyers involved in the negotiations said yesterday. **********""One wants to do it and one doesn't,"" a lawyer in the negotiations said, speaking on condition of anonymity and adding that as the rift developed, all sides were trying to take advantage of it to get a settlement. **********The position of Resolution Trust, the agency created to help the F.D.I.C. manage the savings and loan bailout, is one of the first instances where it has been able to put its own stamp on a policy issue of common concern with the Federal insurer. Until about a month ago, when a new law took effect that made it more independent, Resolution Trust shared the same board with the F.D.I.C. and was far less likely to have dissented on an important issue. **********""It's a big deal to have these two agencies, who had been joined at the hip a month ago, now going their separate ways on a public issue,"" the lawyer said. **********On Thursday, the F.D.I.C., in its oversight role for the savings and loan industry, rejected a deal negotiated by its lawyers that would have left Mr. Milken in control of a family fortune and would not have forced the Drexel defendants to disclose details about their net worth.  Disclosure an F.D.I.C. Concern **********At the time, it was not clear where Resolution Trust stood. It had favored the settlement at the outset, but withheld final approval pending the F.D.I.C.'s decision. A Resolution Trust spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the agency's position. **********The F.D.I.C.'s rejection of the settlement followed criticism in Congress and from other regulators. **********One theory is that Resolution Trust would have received far more of the $500 million that the two agencies stood to share from the $1.3 billion deal, since 90 percent of the claims that the Government filed against Mr. Milken are for failed savings and loans that Resolution Trust took over, and only 10 percent are from institutions that the F.D.I.C. oversees. **********In addition, the new law that restructured Resolution Trust gives its chief executive, Albert V. Casey, more influence over decisions within his agency than William Taylor has as chairman of the F.D.I.C., which has a more active board. **********In hopes that Resolution Trust does not change its stand before this afternoon, when a court hearing on the settlement is scheduled in Federal District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for Mr. Milken and the other executives have indicated that their clients will disclose more information about their financial means. **********Specifically, they now seem willing to disclose information about Mr. Milken's net worth, which is believed to be about $1 billion, and some limited information about the net worths of some of the other Drexel executives. **********While the concessions were said to please Resolution Trust, the F.D.I.C. has taken a harder line. **********""My own assessment,"" said the lawyer, ""is at 2 o clock on Monday, you'll have a deal"" with Resolution Trust and possibly both agencies."

Gnehm, called recent reports casting doubt on the reported atrocities ""smug and cynical,"" ""revisionist"" and ""outrageous."" **********The Ambassador harshly criticized two human rights groups, Amnesty International and Middle East Watch, and news organizations for saying since the war that their investigations had failed to substantiate the reports. A Young Woman's Account **********Accounts of babies being removed from incubators to die were widely reported before American forces expelled the Iraqis from Kuwait and lent emotional power to the Bush Administration's and the Kuwaiti Government's oratory as the allies prepared to go to war. But since the war, the unproven assertions have been questioned frequently. **********The dispute was revived last month when it was disclosed that a young Kuwaiti woman who had testified in 1990 before a Congressional caucus, tearfully describing infanticide at a hospital, was the daughter of Kuwait's Ambassador in Washington. Although her account was not disproved, its credibility was questioned in an article on the Op-Ed page and in an editorial in The New York Times, and in other news accounts. **********Kenneth Roth, director of Middle East Watch, responded to the cable today by saying that his group could not absolutely rule out isolated cases of baby-killing, but that painstaking research last year had disproved reports of widespread infanticide. **********""We can say almost certainly that there was no mass theft of incubators and no mass killing of infants,"" he said. **********Amnesty International, after initially accepting the accounts, said last April that upon visiting Kuwait to interview doctors and inspect cemeteries, its investigators ""found no reliable evidence"" to support the accounts. U.S. Names 2 Doctors **********Mr. Gnehm's cable named two doctors and a nurse who gave embassy officials detailed first-hand accounts of Iraqis killing babies at two hospitals. The State Department asked that the names of these witnesses be kept private. **********The cable also cited corroborating testimony from ambulance and cemetery workers who told of handling the remains of scores of infants. **********The cable reported eyewitness accounts of two incidents in which eight babies died. **********A health worker at Al-Adan Hospital, the cable said, recounted arguing with Iraqi soldiers who demanded that babies be removed from incubators and respirators. One baby died ""almost immediately"" and four died within 24 hours, according to this account. **********Two health workers at Al-Jahra Hospital, the cable said, reported that an Iraqi military doctor had ordered 12 babies removed from the neonatal intensive care unit on Aug. 26. Eight were removed from incubators and two from ventilators. Two died that day and another later, it said. **********But Mr. Roth said that Middle East Watch had interviewed about two dozen health professionals who had worked in all of Kuwait's maternity hospitals throughout the occupation, and that despite many second-hand reports, ""no one we spoke to was able to confirm any instance in which the Iraqis had taken incubators or left babies to die."" **********He said the human rights group had not talked to the three medical workers mentioned in Mr. Gnemh's cable. **********Ambassador Gnemh said the embassy was told that approximately 250 babies might have been buried in mass graves at Al-Riqqa cemetery in Kuwait in August and September 1990. **********Mr. Roth sharply disputed this, saying that Middle East Watch investigators had thoroughly examined the records at Al-Riqqa, which appear to have been meticulously kept."

With inflation pushing 30 percent a month and hostile legislators poised to sabotage the transition plan when they convene next month, many analysts think it is time for reformers to beat a tactical retreat. ""There is no escape except to work with the gradualists,"" concluded Padma Desai, an economist with the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. **********But President Boris N. Yeltsin's Western advisers, in particular, Jeffrey Sachs, draw a starkly different conclusion. Mr. Sachs acknowledges that ""the antibodies to change are stronger"" in Russia than in Poland, where a parallel leap toward free markets is apparently succeeding. The Harvard economist, however, puts much of the blame for Russia's wobbly start on an uncontrollable central bank, a shortage of hard currency worsened by penny-wise foreign donors and a ""military industrial complex"" with disproportionate influence over legislators. **********Russia's shock therapy is the most daunting test yet of a prescription for rejuvenating state-dominated, inflation-prone economies. The idea is to break habits and expectations very quickly, stabilizing prices, privatizing property and creating a secure framework for competitive markets before the old guard can mobilize resistance. **********Russian reformers, led by Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Guidar, have certainly delivered the shock: ""They've destroyed the old system"" of production and distribution that functioned without markets, observed Richard Ericson, the director of the Harriman Institute. The question, though, is whether it has been therapeutic. **********Most prices have been freed, blowing away the buying power accumulated in the Gorbachev years when wages raced ahead of productivity. State orders, which relieved enterprises of the job of finding customers, have been slashed. And Moscow is gearing to sell or give away three-quarters of publicly owned capital by the end of 1993. **********But after some initial successes in cutting the budget deficit in the first half of 1992, the mechanism for controlling inflation has broken down. The central bank of Russia, which answers only to Parliament, has extended hundreds of billions of rubles worth of credit to white elephant enterprises that made nothing anyone wanted to buy. **********Meanwhile, rubles printed by other former Soviet republics have been honored as currency in Russia in order to prevent the breakdown of inter-republic trade. And hard currency earnings from exports have continued to implode, driving down the exchange value of the ruble to levels that make it impossible to finance imports of everything from shoes to spare parts. By almost everyone's reckoning, Russia is on the precipice of hyperinflation, in which the ruble will become useless as a currency and the decline in production will accelerate. **********To Ms. Desai the lesson is clear: Mr. Yeltsin must deal with the parliamentary coalition of enterprise managers and former Communists led by Arkady I. Volsky, who share his fear of the nationalist right. That would require more cautious privatization, as well as a temporary restoration of subsidized state purchases to prop up big employers. Even Stanley Fischer of M.I.T., who has been closely identified with the shock therapists, argues that provisions must be made to prevent the collapse of very large enterprises. **********George Soros, a Hungarian-American mutual fund wizard who runs nonprofit foundations supporting democracy in Eastern Europe, adds a different perspective to the gradualist view. The Yeltsin Government's power has deteriorated beyond easy repair, he believes -- ""decrees are signed and nobody pays attention."" Hence the practical strategy for preventing the return of authoritarian rule and statist economics is to decentralize reform, allowing regions to muddle through on their own while sustaining a safety net for the masses with direct aid in hard currencies. **********But Mr. Sachs argues that the current crisis is more political than economic. Neither real wages nor production has fallen as far as in Poland during the shock, he notes. Moreover, much of the loss consists of worthless goods -- weapons or obsolete industrial machinery. **********He estimates that the jobs at risk represent, at most, 15 percent of the work force, numbers that ought to be absorbed into the service sector within a few years. In his view, the keys to successful transition are to regain control of the ruble and to persuade a majority of Russians that retreat from reform is a ticket back to planned mediocrity. **********The scary part is that everyone is flying blind. It is hard to predict either Russians' willingness to sacrifice in the name of democratic capitalism or the capacity of private enterprise to fill the vacuum left by the collapse of state production. **********What both shock therapists and gradualists seem to agree on, though, is that the scarcity of foreign aid in the last year has both reduced foreign leverage and raised the odds against a soft landing. ""The West has just got to get its act together,"" Mr. Fischer said, ""and very soon."""

Now two exchanges are engaged in a battle to see which one can come up with a biotech industry option contract that can win it a share of the excitement. **********The first salvos were fired this week when both the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange announced proposed contracts. The Amex got the first press release out, but the Chicago exchange was the first one to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to trade the options. S.E.C. Approval Seen **********It appears likely that the S.E.C. will approve them simultaneously, probably in two or three months, setting up a battle over market share in a market that may not be big enough to support even one index. Some options contracts intended to match the performance of the entire stock market have been big successes, but those on individual industries, among them computers and precious metals, have been moderate successes at most. **********There is at least one precedent that might suggest now is not a good time to invest in biotechnology stocks. The first industry index options, on a high-technology index, were proposed by the Pacific Stock Exchange on June 24, 1983. That was almost the exact market top in such stocks for several years. Much of the excitement had gone before the options began trading in October. **********So far, however, biotech investors have prospered. The Chicago biotech index is up 5.8 percent for the week, while the Amex index added 10.2 percent. **********The two indexes are similar, but have different stocks and are computed differently. If it matters whether an individual investor can easily match the index by purchasing stocks, then the Chicago index may have the edge. On the other hand, the Amex index can boast that it would have been the better performer over the last half-year or so, according to calculations by The New York Times. **********As with any option, an investor paying a small amount of money would be able to buy a call option that would rise in value if the level of the index rose sharply before the option expired. Or an investor could buy a put option, which would soar if the level of the index fell rapidly. One contract on the Amex index would control about $24,000 worth of stock, while one contract on the Chicago index would control shares worth about $21,000. **********A key difference between the two indexes is that the unquestioned star of the biotech industry, Amgen Inc., is included in the Amex index and excluded from the Chicago one. Amgen is by far the largest company in the industry, with a market value of $9.8 billion at the end of last year. Unlike most of its competitors, it has products on the market and is posting profits. **********""I do not think you are representing the industry if you leave Amgen out,"" said Nathan Most, the Amex's vice president of new products. **********But Richard DuFour, an executive vice president of the Chicago Exchange, countered: ""Our index focuses on the smaller emerging companies. That is where the growth is, where the excitement is."" **********The two indexes share eight stocks. The Chicago index, which has 20 stocks, is computed in the same way as the Dow Jones industrial average, with the share prices of all the stocks added together and divided by a divisor that will change when any stock splits. In industry jargon, the index is price weighted. As a result, a $1 change in the price of Scimed Life Systems, which ended trading yesterday at $90, would have the same effect on the average as a $1 change in Greenwich Pharmaceuticals, which closed yesterday at $16.375. Thus an investor who wanted to exactly match the index could buy an equal number of shares of each stock. **********The Amex index, which includes 15 stocks, is set up to include an equal value of each of the 15 stocks. An investor who put $1,000 in each stock on the day the index was started would match the performance of the index until the index was next recalculated. That is to happen on the third Friday of the last month of each quarter, when a series of options will expire. **********At that time, the portfolio will again be rebalanced to include an equal value of each stock. Effectively, that would mean selling shares that went up a lot, and buying more shares of companies that performed poorly. **********The Amex index includes the newest public company in either index, Medimmune, a company that is trying to develop antibodies that would fight the virus that causes AIDS. That stock, which went public on May 8 at $9.25, closed yesterday at $49. **********The earliest date for which both indexes can be computed is June 21, when the Amex index could first be balanced including all its stocks. A comparison of the two indexes, based on calculations by The Times, shows that from then through yesterday, the Amex index was up 98 percent, while the Chicago index rose 66 percent. By contrast, the S.& P. 500-stock index rose 11 percent. **********The exchanges will promote the index options as ways to participate in industry growth, while reducing the risk of owning any one stock. Since June 21, Xoma, which is in both indexes, is down 14 percent and is the worst performer. By contrast, North American Vaccine, which is in the Chicago index, has more than quadrupled. **********Still, the risk of investing in this sector was demonstrated on Nov. 15, when biotech stocks showed sudden weakness. Blamed for helping to push down the entire market, the biotech stocks fell much more than the overall market. That week, the S.& P. 500 dropped 2.6 percent, while the Amex options index would have dropped 17.6 percent and the Chicago index would have fallen 8.3 percent."

Krajina County leaders, gathering in Belgrade this weekend, said they stood firm in their longstanding opposition to unilateral disarmament of the region's local militias, the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army from Krajina and the placement of peacekeeping forces through Krajina rather than in the corridor between Croatian and Serbian forces. **********At a news conference in Belgrade today, Mr. Babic asserted that Serbian and Yugoslav leaders had used old-time Communist ""police methods"" and ""torture tactics"" in meetings this weekend aimed at forcing Krajina's leaders to accept the United Nations plan. He said the Serbian and Federal authorities would not be able to force their will on the people of Krajina even though the region is economically dependent on Serbia. **********In Zagreb today, Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, said he was confident that peacekeeping forces would be sent to Yugoslavia, but he said that with or without them, Croatia would reclaim ""every square inch"" of the Serbian-held territories."

Indeed, the cross-country flight has become something of a holy grail. **********Now, the elusive target is coming into view. New semiconductors, software and battery technology promise to double the battery life of notebook computers to six hours or more, rather than the current two hours to five. **********Such computers ""will become available this year and take off in 1993,"" said Gil Russell, a senior applications engineer in San Jose, Calif., for the Samsung Semiconductor Company of South Korea, a chip supplier. And K. C. Murphy, vice president of applications and strategic marketing for Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a microprocessor manufacturer based in Sunnyvale, Calif., predicted, ""By 1993 we're really looking at the eight-hour color portable."" **********Many users do not care much about the nitty gritty of the technology inside their computers -- as long as the battery lasts long enough to be convenient. Nevertheless, competition is so intense in the personal computer business that computer buyers are likely to be bombarded in the coming year with advertisements related to battery life, just as they are now besieged by claims about microprocessor speed. So it doesn't hurt to know what is at stake. Chief among the new developments is a shift to computer chips that run on 3.3 volts of electricity rather than the traditional 5 volts. This is part of a huge shift in technology that has been under way for years but has been given fresh impetus by the importance of the notebook computer business. **********Advanced Micro, which makes 386 microprocessors that can be used in computers made by the International Business Machines Corporation and compatible models, is already advertising some chips that run on the lower voltage. The Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., the main provider of microprocessors, will come out with its low-voltage parts later this year. **********Shifting to 3.3 volts should mark a major change in portable computing. But experts say that to maximize the advantages, the entire portable computer must operate at that low voltage, not just a single chip. ""To make 3.3 volt a reality, more than just a processor has to support it,"" said Bret Berg, product manager for portable systems marketing at AST Research Inc., a computer manufacturer in Irvine, Calif. **********The microprocessor is not alone, however. Memory chips and peripheral logic chips that run at 3.3 volts are also appearing. But the biggest power mongers in the computer -- the liquid crystal display with its back-lighting and the disk drives with their spinning motors -- will require higher voltages, at least until 1993 or 1994. **********Mr. Berg of AST said that late this year hybrid machines would appear that will combine some low-voltage parts with the usual 5-volt parts, offering some significant power savings. Machines with virtually all low-voltage parts will appear in 1993, he said. **********Another technology that could increase battery life is the replacement of disk drives with memory chips, which have no moving parts. The usual memory chips lose their contents when the computer's power is shut off, which is one reason disk drives are required in the first place. But new chips known as flash memories can retain their information without power. **********Conner Peripherals, a leading disk drive maker based in San Jose, Calif., said last week that it would team up with Intel to develop such so-called solid-state disks. Sundisk, a Santa Clara, Calif., startup company, announced a similar product a week earlier. But these solid-state disks are expected to be much more expensive per byte of storage than hard disk drives and will appear mainly in tiny pocket computers where small size and low power consumption are of the utmost importance. **********Software could also help in power management. Right now, computers attempt to preserve battery life by shutting down computer pieces that seem idle at the moment. But the computer does not know what full application is running on the computer and therefore sometimes operates in the dark in trying to decide what to shut down. A new Advanced Power Management specification proposed recently by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., and Intel will, in effect, allow the computer operating system and the application software to better communicate what they are doing to the computer. A spreadsheet, for instance, could give the computer information to distinguish between being truly idle and in the midst of a long calculation, when full power to the processor must be maintained. **********This software, which will work on any 386 or 486 microprocessor, is expected in the next revision of Microsoft's Windows program and its DOS 5.0 operating system. Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, a newsletter, said he expected Advanced Power Management to result in up to a 25 percent increase in battery life, providing that such applications software as spreadsheets and word processing programs are modified to take advantage of it. **********Other improvements should come from batteries that offer longer life than the nickel cadmium batteries typically used today. The Toshiba Corporation of Japan and the Compaq Computer Corporation of Houston are among those computer makers starting to use nickel hydride batteries in some models. These batteries appear to promise somewhat longer life. Some other new types of batteries might appear in the next year or so offering even longer life. AER Energy Resources, a startup company in Atlanta, is developing an air-zinc battery that it says can last several times as long as a nickel cadmium battery. **********Such technologies will certainly result in various improvements in battery life. Most consumers will be told by manufacturers what the battery life is likely to be, and can look at reviews in personal computer magazines for verification. **********But buyers should keep in mind that battery life also varies with the way the computer is used. Andrew Seybold, editor of Andrew Seybold's Outlook on Professional Computing, a newsletter published in Brookdale, Calif., said company claims tend to be 10 to 20 percent higher than what a typical user might actually experience. **********In making their claims, he said, companies might use optimistic assumptions about, for instance, how often the disk drive is used. **********Mr. Seybold also cautioned that even when batteries last long enough for a cross-country flight, it might be wise to take along a spare. Batteries, he said, can sometimes burn out or fail suddenly. **********""I don't care if you get 20 hours out of it,"" Mr. Seybold said. ""Relying on that machine with a single battery is not wise."""

Once a pattern is discovered, it can be used to increase the chances of making a profitable trade -- in theory, at least. **********""It's one of those things that you might not use for several days, and then something comes up and you say, 'Hey, what's the answer?' "" said Frank J. Marinaro, vice president of research for the Gelber Group of Chicago, a bond trading office and commodity trading adviser. ""Like yesterday, the bond market was down a full point. So we ask, 'Show me the bond market the week before and the week after, when bonds are down a point on the day.' That's a simple request. We can tack on other conditions, like, 'and when X happens.' "" X might be a sudden rise in foreign currency movements, or a shift in a particular company's stock price. **********Jeffrey Li, vice president of the Duich Investment Corporation of San Francisco and another MIM enthusiast, said: ""If you look at correlation of interest rate levels versus the price of stocks, you know that as interest rates go lower the market is going to go up. But everybody knows that and will be on that trade."" So the hard part, he said, is coming up with original ideas. ""Usually it's been done before, and it's hard to make money when everyone is doing the same thing,"" he said. **********Using MIM, traders can concoct ad hoc queries with multiple variables. For example: *********** When the Consumer Price Index was up less than 5 percentage points over a 12-month period, and the price-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500 index was 10 or less, was the S.&P. up in the following 12 months? If so, by how much? *********** Show United States bond prices from, say, the first hour of trading to 1 P.M. on days when a share of International Business Machines is down more than 10. *********** The last time bond prices were up 1 percent and so was the German mark against the dollar, what happened in the bond and currency markets in the next three days? **********MIM has a relatively easy-to-use method that allows traders to create such questions using point-and-click commands, or by typing the questions in plain English. In other data base systems, queries are usually constructed in a programming language. Few traders have the time to learn to be programmers, or to wait for staff programmers to prepare and process the request. **********Anthony D. Kolton, president of Logical Information Machines and, by no coincidence, a former stock and commodity trader in Chicago, said he thought MIM would eventually prove itself in many uses outside the financial markets. **********""Our technology will apply wherever there are vast quantities of data, and you want to ask complex questions,"" he said. Insurance companies might want to use the system for risk analysis, for example. ""We're currently in the design phase to analyze consumer scanner data at grocery stores,"" Mr. Kolton said. Supermarkets generate thousands of megabytes of data, in areas ranging from inventory control and special pricing to sales at the checkout counter, but as with the stock market there is no convenient way to ask complex questions of it. **********As he explained it, a manager might ask MIM: ""Show me the sales of this certain product in this region when it's on sale on Saturday between 9 A.M. and noon, when the competitor is not running a coupon and when it's displayed on an endcap,"" the prime display area at the ends of aisles. ""The way it is now, if you want the knowledge you have to do custom programming. Using this system, you can get quality research a lot quicker."" **********The great strength of the MIM seems to be its speed, which derives in part from the proprietary way the system takes advantage of a computer's high-speed memory, said Eugene Lowenthal, a former director of the advanced computer architecture program at the Microelectronics and Computer Corporation of Austin and now a director of Logical Information Machines. MIM traces its origins to research done at the corporation. **********In the financial markets particularly, all the data needed for research are generally publicly available, but few traders have the luxury of enough time to spend researching data, poring over charts and reading reams of analysis. And often they are not willing to commit the time or money needed to have a researcher check out a convoluted hunch -- especially if the hunch requires going back through 70 years of stock market data and economic indicators. **********Mr. Li of Duich Investment said he was impressed with how quickly MIM can sift through years of data and display the results as graphs. His system is loaded with about 1,500 megabytes of market data -- about 1.5 billion characters. ""It retrieves data almost instantaneously,"" Mr. Li said. And, of course, ""as traders, we really, really like speed,"" he said. **********Duich Investment leases the MIM software, which includes the data base search engine and the historic market data, and runs it on a Unix work station. The software costs the company about $2,500 a month, depending on options. **********Logical Information Machines said more than two dozen companies, including some of the biggest names on Wall Street, use its system. Financial and insurance companies are notoriously secretive about the equipment and technologies they use in competitive forecasting, and several companies declined to acknowledge that they use MIM.  Those that did praised MIM despite its expense. **********""One of our traders said it paid for itself after the first trade we did on it, and that was for the full year, hardware and software,"" said Mr. Marinaro of the Gelber Group. **********Clearly, MIM is not for the casual investor, although no doubt some individuals would like to have instant access to decades of market data. **********Because it is a one-stop shop, combining market data and the search engine, MIM may prove to be a model for future tools for the investor, once prices come down, as they inevitably have in the computer business. **********Many traders have turned to powerful computers to take over the research chores. ""Speed and accuracy are two of the most important criteria that money managers and traders would look for in any system,"" said Sharon S. Schwartzman, editor of Wall Street and Technology magazine. **********One Wall Street trader for a large firm who spoke only on condition that neither his name nor that of his company be used said he had seen an early version of MIM and rejected it. **********""It was clunky and difficult to use, it didn't have enough functions, and there was no ability to hook up our own data,"" he recalled. His company decided to develop its own computer-based system, he said. But recently, he added, he had seen the ""very impressive"" latest version of MIM -- and leased it. **********""For the medium-sized shop, it's a must,"" he said. ""We're a larger house, and we have got to have this stuff."""

Only if You Support Price-Gouging,FORUM; A Dogfight Over Deregulation: The New Deal On Fares Deserves Applause ... Only if You Support Price-Gouging," **********Dear Fred: **********I have your letter commenting on my April 19 piece in The New York Times on the folly of domestic airline pricing deregulation. Let me rebut your allegations point by point: **********1) The tone of my piece was not ""choleric"" but was instead an admirably restrained exercise in disgust at the media spin given to the pricing changes initiated by American Airlines. **********2) American Airlines and United Air Lines combined actually filled 64 percent of their seats for the 12 months ended September 1991, despite the Gulf War. My estimate of the airlines' costs is therefore right on target. **********3) If average yield last year was, as you allege, only a loss-producing 12.46 cents per mile, the principal reason was the carriers' pricing of selected excursion fares below cost, while cutting all sorts of deals with major corporations and mega-travel agencies. This process is so perniciously discriminatory, though, that even American Airlines balked. Last year, about 34 percent of all business travelers got under-the-table discounts averaging 50 percent on their tickets, with far fewer restrictions on excursion-fare tickets. If Government action is the only way to end such unfair advantages, I support it. **********4) Sorry you don't like the ""grudging credit"" I gave American and its imitators for changing 100 percent cancellation penalties to a flat $25. When a thief belatedly stops only a portion of his stealing, you do not give him an award. **********5) Your ""value of service"" argument, to justify gouging business travelers who ""value frequent, conveniently scheduled flights"" and ""have to make their reservations at the last minute,"" is a tired and bankrupt apologia. It also deters virtually all last-minute, impulse leisure travel, which was affordably available before deregulation. So price-gouging is ""rough justice,"" is it? Rubbish! Air transportation in the 1990's is, and should be treated as, an essential utility -- run by private industry for what airline regulatory law once mandated as the ""public convenience and necessity."" It should not be some sort of frill available only to the well-off. **********Further, the frantic efforts of travelers to escape the burdens of overpriced benchmark fares explains why 95 percent flew on discount fares last year. Imagine a car priced at $60,000, but ""negotiated"" down to $19,800 (your 67 percent average-discount figure) by 95 percent of all buyers. How would you explain the virtues of deregulation to those who had to pay the full $60,000 -- or to passengers who have to buy full-fare tickets? **********6) You are correct that I used to be a proponent of airline deregulation, as practiced by Air Florida, People Express and a host of other now-defunct low-fare carriers. Making a profit while charging a reasonable fare to all is what the airline industry is supposed to be about. But, when all regulatory pricing controls came off the books in 1985, the public suffered. **********I was naive to believe that total deregulation of pricing would result in a pro-consumer airline industry. Just when are you going to advocate that the U.S. domestic airline passenger deserves the same legal protection against price-gouging as his international counterpart enjoys?"

The reports followed Tuesday's report that the economy expanded at a 2.7 percent annual pace in the summer quarter, compared with 1.5 percent in the spring, a pace analysts considered unsustainable. **********The decline in orders, a widely followed but volatile indicator of future factory activity, was the third in a row. Such a string of declines has not occurred since the first quarter of 1991, when the economy was clearly in recession. **********Nonetheless, economists were mildly heartened today to see that orders rose five-tenths of 1 percent when military goods are excluded and jumped 4.1 percent for nonmilitary capital goods, a gauge of business investment. Moreover, shipments of durable goods, defined as those intended to last at least three years, rose 1.4 percent, reversing a two-month decline. **********""Over all I'd say it's a weakish report, but there were some positives,"" said Ian Borsook, an economist for Merrill Lynch & Company. **********At the same time, analysts continued to be disturbed by a persistent erosion in unfilled orders, the backlogs that sustain current operations. These fell 1.3 percent last month, the 13th straight decline, to the lowest overall level since December 1988.  Backlogs also fell nine-tenths of 1 percent with military business excluded. **********""The divergent components of the orders data indicate pockets of strength and weakness, and in this respect only further cloud an economic situation that was already murky,"" said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. He predicted ""continued stagnation"" in the current quarter ""as consumption slows down again."" **********The main contributor to the $500 million order decline, to $118.9 billion, was an 8.4 percent drop for aircraft and other transportation equipment. The smaller primary metals sector slumped 10.2 percent, the biggest loss since March 1989. Military orders dropped 15.7 percent, to $5.4 billion, the report also showed. **********Partly offsetting these, however, were a 5.6 percent gain for electrical machinery and a 2.3 percent gain for non-electrical machinery. Distorted by Weather **********Today's income and spending figures were distorted by the weather, which obscured what economists said was essential flatness. The Department said the rebound in personal income from the effects of Hurricane Andrew, which hit Florida and Louisiana in August, more than offset declines attributed to Hurricane Iniki, which hit Hawaii in September. **********This produced the seven-tenths of 1 percent increase in incomes, to an annual rate of $5.08 trillion, the biggest advance since December. Consumer spending climbed by the same percentage, to $4.12 trillion, the biggest rise since January. Both income and spending eased two-tenths of 1 percent in August. **********Among the hurricanes' effects for which the Department made adjustments were the loss of rental and proprietors' income from uninsured losses to homes and businesses, wages lost from work disruptions and losses from crop damage. September's rise in income also benefited from subsidy payments to farmers. **********Without the hurricane-related adjustments and the subsidy payments, personal income edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in September, compared with a six-tenths of 1 percent increase in August, the Department said. **********Both income and spending last month, after hurricane adjustment ""were weak, even though at first glance the data appear strong,"" declared Marilyn Schaja, an economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ""Wage and salary income actually fell."" **********The seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer spending resulted from a 1.2 percent increase for services -- 57 percent of the total -- a nine-tenths of 1 percent increase for durable goods and a two-tenths of 1 percent decline for nondurables."

Once unpopular afterthoughts, Saturday newspapers are now selling more copies than their weekday counterparts and are challenging the weekend pre-eminence of the country's Sunday papers. **********Over the last six years or so, Britain's five serious national dailies have expanded their Saturday papers, adding magazines and leisure and review sections that have won both readers and advertisers. **********Save for The Financial Times, the serious broadsheet dailies have all lost circulation over the last year. But their editors say the losses would have been worse had they not been offset by gains on Saturday. **********By charging more on Saturdays than on weekdays, The Daily Telegraph, The Times and The Independent have been able to offset a decline in revenues, which have been depressed by the recession. Last month, The Guardian also raised its price. **********Over all, advertising for Saturday papers has risen sharply in recent months, according to The Guardian. **********In one week in February, the newspaper said, The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent and The Guardian averaged a combined total of 66.5 pages of advertising on weekdays. But on Saturday, it said, advertising totaled about 326 pages. Recent figures for The Daily Telegraph showed that two and half times more advertising space was sold for Saturday than for the average weekday. **********""Six or seven years ago,"" said David Pugh, group marketing manager for The Telegraph newspapers, ""if we'd said we're going to turn Saturday into the most successful day of the week, most people in publishing would have laughed."" **********The Saturday surge, said Jonathan Fenby, deputy editor of The Guardian, comes amid a long-term decline in the Sunday newspaper market. Now, Mr. Fenby asserted, ""Saturday is the beginning of the weekend"" and people want to start their weekend reading on Saturday. **********More than Americans and most Europeans, the British are avid newspaper readers. Britain has 11 national dailies, including two large middle-market tabloids, The Daily Mail and The Daily Express, and several sensationalistic tabloids, most notably The Sun and The Daily Mirror. **********And unlike the American press, the British newspapers have not faced intense competition for readers' time from television, which here offers only a fraction of the programming available in the United States. **********The trend toward larger Saturday papers began in 1985, when The Financial Times started its Weekend section, and picked up speed in 1988, when The Independent introduced its color magazine and leisure and review section. The Independent's editor in chief, Andreas Whittam Smith, said those sections had ""a brilliant effect on circulation."" Indeed, in February, The Independent's circulation averaged about 406,000 on Saturdays, compared with 360,000 on weekdays. **********At The Financial Times, the Weekend section features subjects ranging from personal finance to gardening. The Saturday paper now attracts about 25,000 more buyers than the weekday paper, which has a British circulation of about 180,000. **********At The Times, its editor, Simon Jenkins, has expanded his Saturday paper to three broadsheet sections and a color magazine. 'Stopped the Rot' **********""We've sort of stopped the rot, stopped those Monday-to-Friday Times readers from buying a rival newspaper on Saturday,"" he said. There is, he added, ""no question of a doubt that The Times would have been in worse shape if we hadn't made these expansions."" **********The Guardian, meanwhile, says it has picked up about 10,000 readers on Saturdays since it added a second broadsheet section in February. **********At The Telegraph, Mr. Pugh said, Saturday expansion was part of his paper's ""long-term strategy of overtaking The Sunday Times."" **********With a circulation of 1.05 million, The Daily Telegraph was deemed better placed than The Sunday Telegraph to compete with The Sunday Times, which dominates the market with a circulation of 1.17 million. From September to February, The Sunday Telegraph's circulation averaged just about 563,500, down from 671,400 about three years before. **********So, a Saturday features section was added in 1987, the Sunday color magazine moved to Saturday in 1988, a supplement for young readers was started in 1990 and in February the Saturday paper began a weekly television guide. With each innovation, the newspaper gained advertising and tens of thousands of readers. Problems on Sunday **********Mr. Pugh acknowledged that the stronger Saturday paper might have hurt The Sunday Telegraph, but said The Daily Telegraph needed to respond to increased competition. **********And Mr. Whittam Smith, as editor in chief of both The Independent and its sister paper, The Independent on Sunday, said that by improving his Saturday paper, ""we probably did make it harder for ourselves."" But he said Saturday and Sunday papers could coexist because they served overlapping, but different markets."

Can Paris Be Like This?,Poor Buenos Aires! Can Paris Be Like This?," **********The people of Buenos Aires like to think of their city as the Paris of Latin America because of its thriving arts, ornate French architecture, outdoor cafes, broad boulevards and tranquil parks. **********But uncollected trash piled up on the sidewalks recently and residents, climbing over unfilled potholes and pondering the high tax rate and disclosures that the city was essentially broke, with $600 million in debt, remembered that Paris was thousands of miles away. **********""In sum, a neglected, dirty, broken city in its twilight and economically bankrupt,"" La Nacion, the nation's leading paper, said in an editorial. **********The public outrage found a scapegoat in Buenos Aires's 48-year-old Mayor, Carlos Grosso, who resigned last week. Mr. Grosso had been named by President Carlos Saul Menem in 1989, and yielded power to the Mayor's hard-nosed Planning Minister, Saul Bouer, a 55-year-old economist. The Mayor of Buenos Aires is not elected; he is appointed by the President. **********""You can't administer or make decisions if you are always on the defensive and giving explanations,"" Mr. Grosso, who like the President is a Peronist, told reporters as he left office. **********To many, the situation in Buenos Aires is a painful reminder that the free-market changes of the Menem Government have not eliminated some of Argentina's worst problems: inept and bloated ranks of civil servants and corruption at almost every level of government. **********Despite Mr. Grosso's assertions that he did not enrich himself while in office, there have been charges that he profited from bribes and distributed them abundantly throughout Mr. Menem's Peronist party machine. In a poll last week, 57 percent said they believed Mr. Grosso was corrupt, and only 12 percent thought he had done a good job. **********The troubles of Buenos Aires could hurt President Menem politically. The city has long been a stronghold for the Radical Party. In June, the Peronist party lost the first election of Mr. Menem's presidency here, when the candidate he backed as Senator from Buenos Aires trailed badly. **********Mr. Menem has made it clear that he would like to change the Constitution to allow his re-election. But the image of a poorly administered, bankrupt, corrupt city government can only weaken those prospects. **********For President Menem, the Buenos Aires situation is symptomatic of a problem that has dogged his administration: his appointment of government officials whom many view as inept or linked to corruption. Business people who have contracts with the city say bribes are still an integral part of business, with payoffs totaling 15 to 20 percent of the value of a contract. **********A bloated municipal payroll -- as many as 15,000 extra employees as well as thousands of people who collect paychecks for doing no work at all -- has made efficient government impossible. **********It was no secret that Mr. Menem had been pressing Mr. Grosso to start cutting the city bureaucracy and raising taxes even further. **********""There is little alternative for Menem in Buenos Aires; you have to fire 15,000 city workers, raise taxes and renegotiate the contracts,"" said Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst. ""The fact is that Grosso quit because he did not want to do Menem's dirty work."" **********Though the city's providers of school lunches, hospital cleaning services and hospital food programs had not been paid for months, the final crisis was touched off when the city's garbage collector, Manliba S.A., started cutting back on some collections and the city's trash began piling up.

Hoffman of the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. ""But this also reminds us that it's not going to be robust, not going to surprise us on the upside."" **********The skimpy gain in new-home sales, virtually all of it in the West, followed a plunge of 15.9 percent in March and left the sector that Mr. Hoffman called the epicenter of the recovery running only 5 percent above the level a year earlier. **********The April annual selling rate was 530,000 units, compared with 523,000 in March and an average of 644,500 for the first two months of the year, when falling interest rates and warm weather helped spur demand. **********Sales actually fell in the South and Midwest and gained only insignificantly, to a 53,000 rate from 52,000, in the Northeast. The West posted a 22.5 percent gain, to 169,000, but still a slower pace than in December, January or February. **********At the end of April, there were 274,000 unsold new homes, representing a 6.4-month supply at that month's rate of sales, a figure unchanged from March, according to the report, issued jointly by the Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development. **********The index of leading indicators for April climbed for the fourth straight month and by slightly more than had been expected. Yet analysts found no particular comfort in the rise of four-tenths of 1 percent, which was almost entirely accounted for by higher prices for materials sensitive to the business cycle. These prices have since flattened. **********And the increases of four-tenths of 1 percent for both April and March were only half those chalked up in January and February. **********""These numbers are giving us pause,"" said Laurence H. Meyer, who heads a consultancy by that name in St. Louis. He cited the lack of a gain in April in a companion index of indicators that reflect current conditions..  That index, the index of coincident indicators, was also revised to show a one-tenth of 1 percent rise in March after having initially been reported to have been unchanged. Reversal of a Pattern **********The economy is not building momentum, Mr. Meyer said, noting that in the first quarter, the consumer sector was strong while production lagged, a pattern reversed in the current quarter. **********""There's no indication that this economy is going to fall back into recession,"" Mr. Meyer said, but he added that the lack of momentum was ""a source of concern."" **********Only 4 of 11 components of the leading indicators index contributed to the advance, with higher materials prices far outweighing a decline in first-time claims for unemployment insurance, higher factory orders for consumer goods and a rise in consumer expectations. **********Holding the index back were a drop in the M-2 money supply, lower building permits, a decline in the proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers, lower contracts and orders for new plant and equipment and lower manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders."

Because of its growth and that of some other companies, the American textile industry has persuaded American negotiators to try to keep curbs on imported apparel. The Canadians have resisted, and the haggling continues as negotiations in Washington remained unresolved today. **********Canada's International Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, standing up for Peerless and other companies in the small but vocal Canadian apparel industry, argues that Washington is clamping down unjustly on success. Minuscule Market Share **********Jack Kivenko, president of the Canadian Apparel Manufacturers' Institute, complained, ""As soon as we have any degree of success -- even though the amount of our exports is minuscule in the U.S. market -- the Americans are trying to stop us, which is not really fair."" **********The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, has so far been unwilling to make an exception for Canada. **********Imports by the United States of men's woolen suits from Canada rose ninefold, to 456,000 in the 12 months that ended May 31, from 49,000 in 1987. That growth was largely a result of the dismantlement of barriers under a free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada that went into effect on Jan. 1, 1989. **********Peerless, whose 300,000-square-foot computerized plant employs 1,300 people in the north end of Montreal, saw the trade liberalization coming and capitalized on it. The 73-year-old company turns out 17,000 men's suits a week, as well as trousers and sport jackets. **********Its chief executive and principal owner, Alvin Segal, a 58-year-old Montreal resident who calls himself a manufacturing specialist, said he had prepared for expansion by turning to a process known as European engineering to make what look like hand-tailored suits without the hand tailoring. Instead, pieces of fabric are carefully molded and fused to garments. **********""When I saw what the Europeans were doing, I was fascinated, and began implementing it right here,"" he said in an interview on Friday. ""The technology is widely available. I didn't do anything anyone else couldn't have done."" **********Such machine-made suits were developed in Europe after World War II, after a generation of tailors died in the Holocaust or fled the Continent, Mr. Segal said. **********The process allows him to sell his suits to American retail outlets for as little as $130. The stores put on their own labels and mark up the suits to around $300. **********Peerless has 2,000 retail accounts, most in the United States, and some in Puerto Rico and in Mexico. **********Under the Canadian-American free trade agreement, Canadian manufacturers like Peerless can import spools of yarn from Europe and Asia and knit them into fabric for garments that are considered to be Canadian for trade purposes. **********Such garments qualify for lower duties and eventually duty-free trade with the United States under the staged reduction of tariffs that is part of the United States-Canada pact. Peerless's suits pay a 15 percent duty, down from 25 percent in 1989. **********But under the negotiations for the new North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States is insisting that suits or other garments made of foreign yarn come in under a special quota to get the preferential duty. Once that quota is filled, the suits would have to pay the full 25 percent tariff, the same as those from South Korea or Italy, for example. **********In other words, the way the Canadians see it, Canadian companies that do not use American fabric to make garments would not be able to enjoy the freer trade benefits of the pact. **********Asked his reaction, an American trade official said, ""The Canadians are beefing because they are trying to get themselves a bigger quota."" He declined to predict the outcome of the conflict. Focus on Hills **********So far, Mrs. Hills has been unwilling to budge. Any eventual concession to the Canadians would depend on her judgment of the political as well as economic trade-offs. **********The reason the United States has been so tough is that Canadian garment manufacturers like Peerless pay much lower import duties on foreign yarns and fabrics than their counterparts in the United States. **********The powerful American textile lobby, which in recent years has been able to sway the votes of more than half the members of Congress, has kept duties on imported fabrics and yarns as high as 36 percent. Peerless and other Canadian companies pay only 8 percent on their European woolens and worsteds. **********""It's the fabric that makes one garment different from another,"" Mr. Segal said. ""We have access to world fabrics at world prices, and we don't want to give that up."""

Brown said of his family's newspaper, The Herald in New Britain, Conn., where New England's economic decline hit especially hard. **********For instance, The Herald's classified advertising revenue last year was about a third that in 1987. **********But in April, after 30 consecutive months of declines in total advertising revenues, The Herald showed an improvement from a year earlier, said Mr. Brown, who is the paper's associate publisher. **********Indeed, as newspaper operators gather in New York today for the start of the annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, the newspaper business is beginning to show new strength, especially compared with its doldrums of a year ago. Many newspaper companies have reported first-quarter earnings that are considerably higher than those in the 1991 quarter, which was one of the worst in memory. **********""The bottom line is that the worst is definitely behind the industry,"" said Kenneth T. Berrents, an analyst who specializes in newspaper companies at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., a Baltimore brokerage firm. **********Mr. Berrents said that newspapers were generally showing signs of recovery in improved classified advertising, but that retail advertising still lagged, especially in the New York City area and California. **********He said that New England was generally recovering somewhat faster than the New York area and that the Midwest, Northwest and South seemed to be setting the recovery pace. **********But that pace, even where the recovery is greatest, is far from a blistering one. A spot check of publishers around the nation reflects optimism, but newspapers are scrambling hard to replace advertising revenues that have been lost because of the recession and the financial difficulties of some big department stores. **********For many papers, the solution to cutbacks by big advertisers has been to become far more aggressive in courting small advertisers. **********At The San Diego Union-Tribune, where retail advertising is down about 3 percent from a year ago, Gerry Wilson, director of advertising sales, has restructured its advertising department to attract new advertising from small accounts. For instance, advertising salesmen now make most of their income from commissions, rather than salary. **********The Wichita Eagle, a Knight-Ridder paper in Kansas, has begun charging for some classified ads based on the price of what is being sold. For instance, a three-line ad for a used car priced under $500 costs $6.25 for four days; a similar ad for a $4,000 car would be $26. **********Reid Ashe, publisher of The Eagle, said that the special pricing applied only to car ads now, but that he was starting a similar plan for low-priced real estate classifieds. **********The Eagle, like many papers, is willing to experiment with novel revenue-building schemes. **********For instance, the paper has begun publishing books, including ""Beargrease, Builders and Bandits,"" a regional history, and ""Guide to Fishing in Kansas."" **********Mr. Ashe said the paper would soon expand into mail-order retail sales of Kansas-oriented books of all kinds, from ""The Wizard of Oz"" to books published by the University of Kansas Press. The initial catalogue, which will list 90 titles, will also include recordings of old prairie ballads and cowboy songs. **********""And if it doesn't work, we can just quit,"" said Mr. Ashe, in the tone of firm practicality that has become commonplace at newspapers after years of tight budgets. **********Mr. Ashe, like many other publishers, said he would not make the trip to the publishers' convention this year, though he normally attended it. **********""In the course of trying to budget for this year, I told everybody, 'no conventions,' and I had to start with me,"" he said. **********New York has been a popular site for the convention of the publishers association, which will change its name on June 1 to the Newspaper Association of America. For instance, the best-attended convention was in New York in 1987, when more than 3,000 people registered. **********Less than half that many people attended last year's convention in Vancouver, British Columbia, and an association spokesman said attendance this year would probably show only slight improvement. **********The availability of heavily discounted newsprint has been the one silver lining for newspapers during the recession. **********Newsprint accounts for roughly 20 to 25 percent of a newspaper's costs, but as demand for advertising has dropped, the size of newspapers has also declined, creating less demand for newsprint. Newsprint manufacturers, swimming in newsprint, have been offering discounts of 40 percent or more to top customers to maintain market share. **********Thus far in 1992, the discounts are holding, to the great pleasure of newspaper publishers. **********""It remains to be seen how long it will last,"" said George N. Gill, publisher of The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Gannett newspaper. **********Almost inevitably, when advertising returns, so will much higher newsprint prices. **********Publishers say that even with a jump in newsprint costs, newspapers stand to be very profitable in a recovering economy. **********With lean operations, a host of new -- albeit small -- advertisers, and old advertisers who need to move merchandise, publishers say they are hoping a rising economy will be a time of great prosperity for them. **********Bruce E. Thorp, a communication stock analyst for the PNC Financial Corporation in Philadelphia, said the second quarter should demonstrate whether the recovery would be fast and strong, or tepid and slow. **********And after several disappointing years, he is keeping his expectations under close control. **********""I'm afraid to predict too much on the upside,"" Mr. Thorp said.

To attract investors, issuers sometimes push up yields. **********The seven-day compounded average yield for tax-exempt funds rose 27 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.04 percent, with the simple yield up 26 basis points, to 2.99 percent. In the same period, the 30-day compounded yield rose 12 basis points, to 2.72 percent, and the simple yield gained 11 basis points, to 2.68 percent. **********Donoghue's said the average number of days left to maturity of securities being held in portfolios was unchanged at 51 days. Managers reached out to the longer maturities to try to pull in the higher yields because they did not expect interest rates to move higher soon. **********According to Donoghue's, the total assets of tax-exempt funds for the week were down a sizable $1.2 billion, to $96.3 billion. In the previous week, assets declined $760 million. **********For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded average yield was 4.22 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket was 4.40 percent. **********For the week ended Tuesday, among taxable funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Market Fund was the best performer for the second consecutive week. The fund had a return of 3.95 percent, up from 3.62 percent the previous week. **********The assets of taxable funds fell $16.2 billion, Donoghue's said. It was a record outflow, but analysts noted that the size of this category had grown steadily and was in proportion to the total of $481.9 billion. **********Most of the outflow was attributed to institutions, which pulled $12.4 billion from the funds, leaving their total assets at $146 billion. Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, said the institutions, which had entered the money funds in a big way when interest rates began dropping, were swinging out to the more attractive yields in other short-term investments, like Treasury bills, because money-fund yields were essentially flat. Yields Unchanged **********The average seven-day compounded taxable average yield was unchanged at 3.80 percent, with the simple yield also unchanged at 3.73 percent. The compounded and simple 30-day yields were also unchanged, at 3.80 percent and 3.73 percent, repsectively. **********The taxable fund with the best return was the Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, at 4.54 percent. The fund's distributor is the Olde Distribution Corporation of Detroit. **********By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.63 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. Its national index was down 2 basis points from the previous week."

Resumes Relief Flights to Sarajevo," **********Despite continuing ground fire that made the operation more than usually risky, the United Nations command reopened Sarajevo airport to relief flights today after a 24-hour suspension caused by heavy shelling. **********The resumption of the airlift of food and medicine was approved by Maj. Gen. Lewis W. MacKenzie of Canada, the United Nations military commander in Sarajevo, despite a heavy mortar attack on the airport that began late on Monday night and continued into the early hours today. **********After restarting at breakfast time, the flights were suspended again, for 90 minutes, in midday, after another mortar landed near the airport terminal. Then they resumed once more. **********The on-again, off-again nature of the relief operation reflected the continuing failure of the cease-fire that the warring sides signed last week in London. The truce that was to have begun across this newly independent state on Sunday evening has been no more successful than the many cease-fires that preceded it. shelling and sniper fire are continuing in Sarajevo, and battles of greater intensity are raging in at least 12 towns.  Relief for 400,000 Residents **********At a news conference here General MacKenzie said at least some of the cease-fire breaches had been a result of Bosnian Government defenders in Sarajevo and the Serbian nationalists' firing on their own positions. ""We have evidence that both sides shell themselves in order to create a particular image,"" the general said. ""I got so frustrated with this a month ago that I said to both sides, 'If you stop shelling yourselves maybe we'll have peace around here.' "" **********General MacKenzie, who is to hand over command of the United Nations force at the end of the month to another general yet to be named, probably one from France, said both sides in the fighting were breaching the conventions of war by placing mortars close to hospitals and artillery pieces near schools, as well as by reacting to attacks on military targets by shelling civilians. He did not specify which side was responsible for which offense. **********The 52-year-old general also appealed to the Bosnian Government to accept that the direct military intervention it has asked for from the United States and other Western powers was a ""totally impossible dream,"" because of the military challenges involved in the mountainous terrain. Geneeral MacKenzie estimated that the United Nations would need 40,000 troops to impose peace in the Sarajevo region alone, compared with the 1,600-member force approved by the United Nations Security Council, and that even such a force would be at risk from warring factions outside Sarajevo. **********Emphasizing that he was expressing a personal view and not United Nations policy, General MacKenzie said the Sarajevo Government should accept that there was no alternative to direct political negotiations with the Serbian nationalists, a step that the Government has refused. By that the General apparently meant that Sarajevo would eventually fall to the superior military power of the Serbian nationalists. **********The nine United Nations relief flights that landed today represented less than half the 20 that have been scheduled for most recent days. But United Nations officials said enough food and medicines were brought in to keep the relief pipeline flowing to the 400,000 residents. **********The fighting was less intense than on Monday, when 15 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the heaviest mortar and sniper attacks in a month. But United Nations military observers reported heavy exchanges of fire around Dobrinja, a Government-held suburb adjacent to the airport, and there were reports of mortar attacks in districts along a band from the airport on the southwestern edge of the city to the New City area close to the center, about five miles away. **********The Government also reported heavy shelling of many of the provincial centers in Government hands or in the hands of the Croatian forces that have also been fighting Serbian nationalist troops. The towns reported to have been heavily attacked included Gorazde, the last predominantly Muslim town in eastern Bosnia not to have fallen to the Serbian forces; Gradacac in the north, Bihac in the northwest, Stolac in the southwest and villages near Brcko in the northeast and Visegrad in the east. **********When the Sarajevo airport reopened after the overnight mortar attack, which damaged a United Nations relief warehouse and seven United Nations vehicles used to transport supplies into the city, one of the first aircraft to take off carried Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, to Zagreb, capital of Croatia. The trip by Mr. Izetbegovic and several top officials was aimed at persuading President Franjo Tudjman toresume shipments of arms and ammunition to Bosnian forces defending Sarajevo. **********At a news conference on Monday in Sarajevo, Mr. Izetbegovic said of the supplies, which were cut off last month by Bosnian Croats, who have forces 10 miles from Sarajevo, ""It looks like we will be getting what we want."" **********After the Zagreb talks, Mr. Izetbegovic, looking relaxed, said: ""We didn't discuss a military pact, but we will cooperate in oppossing aggression. We will coordinate our military efforts. There is nothing now to prevent this."" **********Mr. Izetbegovic has been in telephone and fax contact with Mr. Tudjman, who has been pressing Mr. Izetbegovic about relations between Bosnia and Croatia, including formal constitutional links. **********Mr. Izetbegovic also faces new pressures from international mediators.  Lord Carrington, the former British Foreign Secretary who negotiated the latest truce accord in London on behalf of the 12-nation European Community, said in Belgrade he held ""the Muslims,"" meaning the Izetbegovic Government, ""as much, if not more, responsible"" for the failure of the accord as the Serbian nationalists. **********Lord Carrington was in the Serbian capital for talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.                    --------------------       Yugslovia Invites Observers **********UNITED NATIONS, July 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- In an effort to dispute assertions that Serbia is fueling the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milan Panic, the new Prime minister of truncated Yugoslavia, invited United Nations observers today to monitor military bases in Serbia. **********After delivering his invitation in a letter to the Security Council, Mr. Panic said that his primary objective was to stop the killing in Bosnia and that he had ordered all Serbian personnel and arms out of Bosnia. **********Asked whether Serbian troops would be more loyal to him or to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, he replied: ""You'll learn very fast who is in command."" **********Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a rare rebuke to the Security Council, has criticized senior members of the United Nations for the swift approval last week of a plan aimed at carrying out a cease-fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a private letter to the Council on Monday, he admonished its members for ignoring his objections and expanding the role of United Nations forces in the area. He called the decision unrealistic.

For many it underscored growing concern about the future relevance of a state church that serves a society that is already among the most secular in Europe. Victory Margin Is Thin **********Not since King Henry VIII split the church from the Vatican in 1534 has a debate left such deep fissures among clergy and laity, with people on both sides threatening to abandon the church if they disagreed with the outcome. **********To approve the motion, a two-thirds majority was required in each of the three houses of the church's General Synod. While it was approved by 75 percent of the church's bishops and 70 percent of the clergy, it won a wafer-thin margin among the laity, with just over 67 percent of the 251 lay members to the synod voting yes. **********A switch of just two votes among lay delegates would have blocked the path to priesthood for women. **********Some 500 people holding a candlelight vigil outside Church House in central London danced, cried and set off fireworks when they heard the result of the vote announced in a radio broadcast. **********""The church has been emotionally exhausted over this, and now we can get on with preaching the Gospel,"" said Cave Bergquist, a chaplain at Trinity College, Cambridge. **********Stephen Jenkins, a spokesman for the Church of England, said Parliament, which remains the formal ruling body of the state-sanctioned church, must rule on the motion. If it gives its approval, which is expected, Queen Elizabeth II must then give her assent. **********Mr. Jenkins said it was unlikely any woman could be ordained before July 1994. Archbishop in Favor **********Dr. George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the spiritual head of the Church of England, was among those supporting the motion. **********In an impassioned speech opening a daylong debate here, he pleaded with members of the General Synod to bring women closer to the center of the church. ""We must draw on all our available talents if we are to be a credible church engaged in mission to an increasingly confused and lost world,"" he said. **********The legislation does not permit women to be bishops. Parishes may refuse to accept a woman as a priest, and bishops cannot be compelled to ordain women or accept them as priests in their dioceses. **********Women now serve as deacons in the Church of England, which means they are able to perform marriages, baptisms and funerals, but are forbidden to celebrate the Holy Eucharist, the most sacred moment of the church service. There are 1,350 women who are deacons of the church. **********After the vote, the synod agreed to pay severance to any full-time priest who chose to resign rather than accept the ordination of women. **********While the issue has been discussed on and off since 1975, the debate in recent months has been argued with a barbed ferocity not often seen in theological discussions. Proponents of the ordination of women have accused their opponents of defending a sexist proposition they regard as the moral equivalent of slavery. Some have even reported hate mail threatening them with death and perdition. **********""The plain fact is, the church is an awful muddle, just hanging on by its fingertips,"" said Annis Fessey, a woman who serves as a deacon. ""If the church is to grow and attract new people, we need women as role models."" **********Opponents of the measure argued that the church should not change a 2,000-year-old tradition for reasons they regard as secular and political, rather than spiritual. **********Some opponents threatened to leave the church. Bishop David Hope of London, who opposed the motion, said he would now ""reflect carefully on the decision and the sort of options that lie open before me."" **********The debate came at a time of growing anxiety about the future of the church. **********According to census data, only 10 percent of British adults, or about 3.7 million people, regularly attend Sunday church services. Of that number, fewer than one in three attend services of the Church of England, even though it is the official state church. Church Attendance Falls **********Since 1970, church officials say, attendance at Anglican services nationally has declined from 1.5 million to 1.1 million. At the same time, the clergy and lay ranks of the church have been consumed by a seemingly endless series of disagreements over everything from its liturgy to homosexuality. **********The Anglican Church, more than most Protestant churches, has found itself vulnerable to sharply held differences of theology and liturgy. **********While the Reformation was driven by Martin Luther's rejection of Roman Catholic dogma, which he and his colleagues regarded as misrepresenting the teachings of Christ, the Church of England evolved out of what was fundamentally a battle over turf: Henry VIII wanted to marry Anne Boleyn, and when the Vatican said no he split off with his own church. **********As a result, the Church of England retained far more of the Catholic traditions and customs than many other Protestant churches. Some traditions, like the refusal to ordain women, are still fiercely defended by the church's more Catholic wing. **********At the Vatican, a spokesman said Pope John Paul II told Archbishop Carey in an audience in May that the issue ""touched on the very nature of the sacrament of holy ordination."" **********""The Catholic church, for fundamental theological reasons, does not believe it has the right to authorize such ordinations,"" the spokesman said. **********The two churches have sought closer ties since 1966."

The two magazines are expected out late this summer. **********Soap Opera Illustrated is expected to complement K-III's two existing television magazines, Soap Opera Digest and Soap Opera Weekly, which have a total circulation of five million and are primarily sold at supermarket checkout counters. **********""That's a large and hungry market that is up 25 percent this year,"" said Harry A. McQuillen, president and chief executive of K-III Magazines. **********The glossy new monthly magazine, which will cost at least $500,000 to start, will focus on the lives of soap opera stars and consist mostly of photographs. Mr. McQuillen said it would begin with a circulation of 300,000 and a cover price of $1.50. **********So confident is K-III of the magazine's success that the company will not even test it; instead, Soap Opera Illustrated will go right out to supermarket checkout stands. **********As for the other magazine, Mr. McQuillen would say only that it was a still-untitled biweekly and would be a ""downscale magazine in the news category."" It will also be sold at checkout counters and have an expected circulation of 300,000. K-III Magazines expects to spend $500,000 to $1 million to start this magazine. **********The Kohlberg, Kravis magazine venture was set up a little over a year ago after a partnership of the investment firm, K-III Holdings, stunned the magazine industry by acquiring eight magazines and The Daily Racing Form from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for $650 million. **********K-III's magazines include Automobile, New Woman, New York, Premiere and Seventeen. European Travel & Life, which was also part of the deal with Mr. Murdoch, was closed in April. **********Mr. McQuillen said reports in the industry that K-III Magazines was developing a gossip magazine and a music magazine were untrue.  The Gossip at Hearst **********The Hearst Magazine Development Group, on the other hand, is showing prototypes of its proposed gossip magazine to focus groups of would-be readers. The tongue-in-cheek tabloid being put together by Gael Love, former editor in chief of Connoisseur, is expected to appear next year. People at Hearst say it is ""going to scare the pants off Vanity Fair."" **********The still-untitled publication is expected to be a sassy mass-market pictorial publication filled with high-level gossip, fashion, health and beauty, according to unofficial reports from Hearst. Company officials declined to comment. **********Topic: Planet Earth **********In the summer of 1989, Paul Perkins, a newspaper advertising executive; Toru Mano, cultural affairs coordinator at the Nippon Club, and Anne Gilbert, an advertising associate at Inc. magazine, decided to quit their jobs and devote themselves to creating a publication that promotes the environment. ""Only positive things,"" Mr. Perkins said. **********They bought three Apple personal computers, a printer and a fax machine and set up shop in Mr. Perkins's small apartment on Gramercy Park in Manhattan. They began to call around to see what they could do. **********A letter to Maurice F. Strong, Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, won them the organization's blessing. They are now in Rio de Janeiro distributing a 20-page special advertising supplement on the environment that they produced for the Earth Summit. ""We are going to distribute it to every single delegate and attendee and to every chairman and president of Fortune 500 companies,"" Mr. Perkins said before leaving for Brazil last week. **********The supplement, titled Imagine, which was put together with little outside help and cost about $350,000 to produce, had a circulation of three million. It ran yesterday as an insert in The New York Times as well as in newspapers in Mexico and Sweden. **********Mr. Perkins and his two colleagues, who want to carve a niche for themselves in the environmental publishing field, can hardly believe their success. A special children's section and a worldwide hourlong television special, also called ""Imagine,"" are in the works. **********""The whole thing has been about as low budget as you can get,"" Mr. Perkins said.  A Fun-Seeker's Guide **********Richard Ekstract, a magazine publisher for more than 30 years, likes to stay on the cutting edge. **********He has started and later sold magazines about high-fidelity equipment and consumer electronics. In April, he closed Video Review, a monthly magazine about video equipment and software, because he thought its market was stagnant. **********Now, he said, he has found a market that really excites him -- people who want to vacation in the United States, a group that he thinks will continue to increase. Most travel magazines focus on foreign destinations, he said, and there is no national magazine that offers schedules and information about hundreds of sponsored events around the country. **********""Event sponsorship is up 32 percent over the last two years,"" he said. ""Forty-five hundred companies are spending about $3.3 billion on event sponsorships this year. Events spending will soon outstrip television advertising spending."" **********The magazine, titled Events USA, will be published six times a year, with a cover price of $2.95 an issue. Plans are in process to tie it to an ""800"" telephone number for people to call for a calendar of events. It will appear in late August with 250,000 copies on newsstands around the country. The design team of Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard will be consultants to the magazine. **********Mr. Ekstract said he expected to spend at least $1 million to start Events USA."

Downe Jr., a former director of Bear, Stearns & Company and the husband of the automobile heiress Charlotte Ford. **********Also charged were Martin E. Revson, co-founder of the Revlon cosmetics empire; Steven A. Greenberg, a New York public relations executive; Milton Weinger, a broker at Oppenheimer & Company; Thomas Warde, a Los Angeles real estate investor, and David Salamone, a foreign businessman last located in London. In addition, Fred R. Sullivan, former chairman of Kidde Inc. and a director of numerous public companies, including the Tyler Corporation, was accused of providing confidential information to Mr. Downe. **********The agency charged that from at least 1987 through 1989 Mr. Downe conspired with Mr. Greenberg ""to exploit their access"" to inside information to generate at least $23 million in illegal profits for themselves, their family and their friends. Hours after the S.E.C. civil complaint was filed, Mr. Downe, 62 years old, appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan to plead guilty to two related criminal charges, brought by the United States Attorney's Office in New York. Insider Trading Tenacious **********The S.E.C. case, besides being one of the most important brought in recent years by the New York office, illustrates just how tenacious the problem of insider trading is on Wall Street. The trades cited by the S.E.C. took place in the midst of other highly visible insider-trading investigations -- cases that supposedly had put the financial community on notice that regulators and prosecutors were ready to pounce on such activity. The S.E.C. case also offered clues to previously unexplained stock price movements.  [ Page D1. ] **********Mr. Downe, as a consequence of pleading guilty to one charge of conspiracy and another of failing to disclose securities purchases he made as a director, faces a maximum five-year prison term and $250,000 fine on each charge. In addition, the S.E.C. is seeking to recover at least $23 million in asserted insider profits from the defendants, including $8 million from Mr. Downe, and fines of up to three times the total profits reaped by the defendants and others with whom they shared information. **********But lawyers said that the related case brought against Mr. Downe by the United States Attorney was especially significant because it reflected a new approach by the Government, relying on a section of the securities code that had not figured in earlier Federal prosecutions. This strategy, Government lawyers said, may ease the prosecutors' burden of proof. **********People in the legal community said yesterday that the Government was aware of a number of others, some with celebrity status, who have supposedly participated in the scheme. They said the criminal investigation was continuing. **********""This is a classic -- and very significant -- insider trading case,"" said Richard Walker, the New York regional S.E.C. administrator, after the charges were filed yesterday. ""Obviously, the commission hopes that by bringing cases like this, we can send the message that this is something we simply will not tolerate."" **********Frederick P. Hafetz, an attorney for Mr. Revson, said the S.E.C. allegations against his client were unfounded. ""Mr. Revson has never traded on inside information,"" he said, ""and is extremely upset at the S.E.C. charges."" Mr. Revson is no longer with the Revlon organization. Charges Are Denied **********""The charges filed today are false,"" said David M. Brodsky, an attorney for Mr. Weinger, one of the most successful brokers at Oppenheimer, a midsized brokerage house not previously tainted by the scandals of the 80's. His client would fight for ""public vindication,"" he said. **********Harvey Pitt, a lawyer for Mr. Greenberg, said the S.E.C. action against his client was ""both unfortunate and wrong."" He said Mr. Greenberg had cooperated fully over the course of the S.E.C.'s lengthy investigation and would fight the charges. **********Mr. Sullivan, 77 years old, has offered to settle the charges against him, without admitting or denying his guilt, by paying a penalty of $58,000, the S.E.C. announced. In a statement released by his attorney, Mr. Sullivan said he settled the case ""to avoid the burden, expense and distraction"" of litigation. **********Neither Mr. Warde nor Mr. Salamone nor their lawyers could be reached for comment last night. **********The message that the Government was cracking down on insider trading was broadcast to the investment community throughout the mid-80's, as one after another of Wall Street's brightest young bankers and brokers were accused of trading on inside information. **********The major scandals began to unfold in May 1986, when the S.E.C. brought insider trading charges against Dennis B. Levine, a managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert. From then until April 1990, when Michael R. Milken pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to his handling of Drexel's junk-bond operation, new details in the far-ranging prosecutions emerged almost monthly. **********But the S.E.C. charges that this new scheme had begun by at least 1987 and it continued at least through 1989, just months before Mr. Milken's guilty plea. In the Social Spotlight **********At the center of this new case stands Edward Reynolds Downe Jr., a journalist-turned-entrepreneur and the founder of Downe Communications, whose stable of properties once included Argosy and True magazines, The Ladies' Home Journal and American Home. When his marriage in 1986 to Charlotte Ford put him into the social spotlight, he became known as an art collector and a cheerful raconteur at poolside parties at his and his wife's homes in Southampton. **********Among the frequent guests at those publicized parties was Martin Revson, one of Mr. Downe's close friends. Mr. Revson is the younger brother of Charles Revson and was associated with him for 23 years at Revlon before leaving to set up his own cosmetics company, Del Laboratories in Farmingdale, L.I., where he still serves as chairman and owns 20 percent of the company's shares. **********Another of Mr. Downe's associates named in the S.E.C. complaint is Mr. Sullivan, who has served as a director of more than a dozen public companies. His long corporate career was dominated by his service as chairman of Kidde, a diversified consumer products company acquired by Hanson Trust in 1987. Mr. Downe had been a member of the Kidde board, and the two men served together on the board of Bear, Stearns. **********In a profile in New York magazine, the Wall Street columnist Dan Dorfman once described Mr. Greenberg as ""a flamboyant public-relations man with a gimmick: he often takes big positions in the companies he represents.""  Bally and Edgcomb Trading **********Mr. Greenberg, who sported shoulder-lenth hair and once boasted of owning two Rolls-Royces, was the owner of Anametrics, which was a financial public relations firm in New York. The S.E.C. charges that he traded on inside information obtained from two of his clients, Bally Manufacturing and the Edgcomb Corporation, and shared that information with Mr. Downe and others. **********In July 1985, according to the criminal complaint to which Mr. Downe pleaded guilty, he and Mr. Salamone, a friend and business partner, set up Broadsword Ltd., a Bermuda corporation that subsequently opened brokerage accounts in London. From August 1985 to October 1987, the complaint says. Mr. Downe and Mr. Salamone conducted numerous trades through Broadsword's account. **********In addition, the prosecutors charged, Mr. Downe attended a Bear, Stearns board meeting on Sept. 22, 1987, and learned that a large block of the brokerage firm's common stock might be sold at a premium price to an institutional investor and promptly had Broadsword buy 150,600 shares of the brokerage firm's stock. As a result of the market crash in October 1987, however, he ultimately sold those shares at a loss. **********On seven other occasions, the prosecutors continued, the trades by Broadsword involved shares of Kidde -- and produced profits of $2.5 million for the Broadsword accounts. The S.E.C. action charges that those trades, too, were guided by inside information obtained by Mr. Downe. **********According to the S.E.C. complaint, Mr. Weinger of Oppenheimer was Mr. Downe's principal broker and shared with him the power to direct the trading decisions in at least 53 brokerage accounts set up for Mr. Downe's relatives and friends. ""During the relevant period,"" the S.E.C. charged, ""Mr. Weinger, one of Oppenheimer's leading producers, earned commissions in excess of $1 million."" **********In addition, the agency charged that Mr. Downe shared inside tips about Kidde, Bally and Bear, Stearns with Mr. Weinger to guide the trading in those accounts. The S.E.C. said Mr. Downe had also shared inside information with Mr. Salamone. **********Mr. Warde was an officer of the Manhattan Capital Corporation, a Los Angeles real estate investment firm. According to the S.E.C. complaint, Mr. Warde received, and traded upon, tips from Mr. Downe about confidential developments at Kidde and Bally."

The Top Performer **********In surveying tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund distributed by the Strong/Corneliuson Capital Managementwas the top performer, with a yield of 2.85 percent. **********""In effect, little has changed from last week,"" said Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist. ""But the heavy supply of new municipal short-term paper being priced this week may have some impact on money market fund yields next week."" **********The average seven-day compounded yield for a taxable money market fund was unchanged at 2.78 percent, and the simple yield was 2.74 percent, also unchanged. Over 30 days, the average compounded yield was 2.78 percent, and the simple yield was 2.74 percent, both down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. **********Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios fell by 2, to 63. That is not much of a move, the analysts said, but a move into the mid-50's could be a signal that rates may be headed higher. **********The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, the top yield producer the last few weeks, had the best return in the latest week, too, with a yield of 3.77 percent. **********For government-only funds with assets less than $100 million, the United Services Government Securities Savings Fund, distributed by United Services in San Antonio, fell to 3.86 percent, from 3.95 percent the previous week. **********Elsewhere, the average yield on a bank money market account was at 2.78 percent, down a basis point from the previous week."

Lone Cypress is owned by Taiheiyo Club Inc., owner and operator of many golf courses in Japan, and Sumitomo Credit Service Ltd., a unit of Sumitomo Bank that is the leading issuer of Visa International credit cards in Japan. **********Lone Cypress said today that it had a signed letter of intent to buy Pebble Beach from companies controlled by Minoru Isutani, a Japanese business executive. Mr. Isutani acquired the 5,300-acre resort in Monterey County, Calif., and its operator, the Pebble Beach Company, in September 1990. The terms of the deal announced today were not disclosed, but sources close to negotiations said the price was about $500 million. If so, that would be about 40 percent less than the $841 million Mr. Isutani paid. **********""Frankly speaking, my original thought was if we could refinance the loan it would be O.K.,"" said Daisuke Saji, a chief credit officer with Sumitomo who is serving as chief adviser to Lone Cypress. ""But I learned of the incredible negative reaction from local people"" to Mr. Isutani, he said, adding, ""So I decided that new ownership was definitely needed."" Taheiyo to Hold 75% **********Under the terms of the deal, Sumitomo will have a 25 percent stake in Loan Cypress while Taheiyo will hold 75 percent. Sumitomo will also lend Lone Cypress several million dollars to make improvements at Pebble Beach. **********Telephone calls today to Mr. Isutani's United States company, Cosmo World, in Los Angeles, were not returned. **********Mr. Isutani was criticized by golfers and the press when he proposed selling high-priced memberships as a means to pay back the $574 million he borrowed to buy the resort. In October, the California Coastal Commission rejected Mr. Isutani's proposal, saying it would restrict public access to the shoreline. **********Taheiyo Club and Sumitomo Credit said that they had no plans to sell memberships at Pebble Beach and that Mr. Isutani would have no further role in the ownership or management of the resort. **********""I have a hunch it will help matters,"" said Sam Karas, chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Monterey County. ""The allegations and Mr. Isutani's background were quite a problem for some people. The only problem I see is that this is another absentee landlord, but on the other hand, they may be very legitimate and responsible owners."" **********There was anxiety from the start among some Monterey County residents about Mr. Isutani's purchase of the resort. Press reports linking Mr. Isutani to organized crime in Japan and to the Recruit stock scandal there added to the concern. **********For his part, Mr. Isutani painted himself as a victim of the seller, Marvin Davis of the partnership Miller, Klutznick, Davis & Gray, who Mr. Isutani said got top dollar by fostering a bidding war for the property. **********Sumitomo Bank became involved as the primary bank of the Itoman Corporation, the Osaka, Japan, trading company that provided backup financing to Mr. Isutani for the resort property. Itoman will not be involved in the financing under the new ownership. But Sumitomo is acting as an adviser and financing the acquisition. **********The new owners said their immediate focus would be to make needed improvements in the course to insure a successful United States Open tournament at Pebble Beach in June. The Pebble Beach Company will continue to operate the properties under the existing management team. A new board will be created with equal numbers of American and Japanese members."

Indeed, as recently as last fall, when the problem of sexual harassment dominated Judge Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, a good many French men viewed the scandal as a display of, if not puritanism, certainly hypocrisy. **********Now, however, it seems that not all is well behind France's facade of sexual freedom. Some French men may think they are the natural heirs to ""le droit de cuissage"" -- the squire's right to spend the wedding night with the new brides of his estate -- but more and more women think otherwise. **********This week, the Government finally came to the defense of women. Under a new bill approved by the Cabinet and soon to be taken up in Parliament, sexual harassment in the workplace would become a crime punishable by up to 12 months' imprisonment and fines between $360 and $3,600. **********The law is a direct result of the Thomas case, which stirred France's first debate about the use of power or position to extract sexual favors. Polls showed that at least one in five people in France felt that they had been victims of sexual harassment. **********French Government officials assert that the new law is the toughest of its kind in Europe, going far beyond the code of conduct drafted by the European Community last November. The code has been sent to employers, labor unions and workers in the community's 12 member nations with a view to increasing awareness of the problem. **********Already in January, at the insistence of Yvette Roudy, a Socialist lawmaker, the French Parliament amended the penal code to make sexual harassment punishable by a jail sentence of up to one year and a fine of up to $18,000. The significance of the new law, which will be part of the labor code, is that the campaign against sexual harassment now has full Government backing. **********""Obviously, most harassment is by men against women,"" said an official at France's Ministry of Women's Rights, which promoted the new law. ""But this is not a sexist bill and we did not specify men when defining sexual harassment."" Perhaps the biggest concession to French ways is that the law will apply only to sexual harassment by hierarchical superiors in the workplace, with the idea of differentiating between sexual blackmail and old-fashioned -- albeit unwanted -- flirtation by colleagues. **********Veronique Neiertz, the Secretary of State for Women's Rights, has even criticized attitudes in the United States, where she says ""the slightest wink can be misinterpreted."" Her ministry's advice to women who feel harassed by fellow workers is ""a good slap in the face."" **********Certainly, a recent poll in the magazine Le Point suggested that French women are less sensitive than American women to some forms of harassment. Responding to a series of questions about hypothetical situations, 20 percent of the women surveyed said they would not consider themselves harassed if they were asked to undress during a job interview. In another scenario, a male manager suggests that a woman employee spend a weekend with him to discuss her request for a promotion. Among women, 47 percent considered this to be harassment and 45 percent did not, with the balance giving no answer; 45 percent of the men thought it was harassment, while 51 percent did not. **********But conversations with working women in Paris point to rapidly changing attitudes toward long-entrenched male practices. ""All too many men think they are being charming when they're being a pain,"" a journalist said. **********Marie-Victoire Louis, who leads an association against violence inflicted on women in the work place, is among those who are unhappy that the new law deals only with sexual harassment by superiors. ""In the name of progress, we're being disarmed against other forms of harassment,"" she said."

The words strike fear in the hearts of parents who have struggled to put together toys and of backyard warriors cursing the jigsaw pieces of a new hibachi. But for a growing number of Americans with a screwdriver and some patience, unassembled furniture is that rarity in hard times: an affordable option for sprucing up one's home. **********Sales of traditional furniture have suffered in the recession, putting pressure on large manufacturers like Ladd Furniture Inc., which just entered the do-it-yourself market, and Drexel Heritage, now a subsidiary of the Masco Corporation. Some retailers have also been hard hit, with Seaman's, for example, filing for bankruptcy protection. **********But sales of ready-to-assemble furniture have grown 10 percent a year in the last five years, now accounting for about 10 percent of all furniture shipped out by American manufacturers -- $1.1 billion worth in 1991 (or $1.8 billion at retail), up from $750 million in 1986. **********""This is a product where the consumer adds value to the piece,"" said Jerry Epperson, a furniture analyst for Mann, Armistead & Epperson, an investment banking firm in Richmond, Va. ""People like that. They feel like it's a bargain."" It is estimated that consumers can save 25 to 50 percent on ready-to-assemble -- ""R.T.A."" to the industry -- compared with fully assembled pieces. **********As demand has risen and technologies have improved, the range of furniture has moved beyond simple television stands and microwave carts. Consumers can now buy entertainment centers that cover half a wall, home office set-ups and even bedroom ensembles in a box. **********Most unassembled furniture is still of particle-board construction. But new technology has meant more natural looking wood-like finishes and solid wood moldings -- even such intricate pieces as roll-top desks. **********""In the old days, you'd say, 'Oh my God, don't put that in my house,' "" said Ray Allegrezza, a furniture writer who concentrates on the R.T.A. market. ""Now, you'd be hard pressed from across the room to tell if it's a solid wood piece."" **********Humble Beginnings  Particle Board, Born In Postwar Europe **********Unassembled furniture was developed, as were many consumer-product ideas, to alleviate a pressing problem in postwar Europe.  After the devastation of World War II, there was a huge need for inexpensive home furnishings. With hardwood in short supply, furniture makers sought an alternative material. They found it: wood chips and shavings, compressed and then covered with stained paper, foil or melamine, a white resin. The new furniture was solid and potentially durable. And it was cheap because the materials were and the customer supplied the labor. **********In the United States, manufacturers began experimenting with what they called knock-down furniture in the 1950's. Erie Sauder, founder of the Sauder Woodworking Company in Archbold, Ohio, marketed a snap-together end table that needed no hardware. It cost $9.95 in 1951. **********In the 1970's, ready-to-assemble furniture became a function-driven industry, as companies made pieces for every innovation hitting the market. The trend grew stronger in the 1980's as new companies sprang up to provide TV/VCR stands, microwave carts and the surroundings for personal computers. (The second-largest R.T.A. maker, O'Sullivan Industries Inc., is owned by the Tandy Corporation, the computer maker, and sold through another Tandy subsidiary, Radio Shack.) They also began branching out into bookcases, bedrooms and children's furniture. **********Prices have risen, naturally; your basic end table may run $39 these days. And some marketing drawbacks remain. Many people still consider particle-board furniture to be of low quality, especially in this country, where wood furniture has always been available at relatively moderate prices. **********Thus, unassembled furniture still appeals mostly to younger people or to families furnishing a spare room or a second house. **********""I don't think you're ever going to see it as primary furniture you sit on when the preacher comes to visit,"" Mr. Epperson said. **********The Distributors  Pushing the Boxes At Kmart and Sears **********The real secret to the industry's success may be not in how the products are designed or made, but in how they are distributed. **********The furniture is sold most frequently by major discount stores and mass merchants, not by traditional furniture retailers. Discounters like the Kmart Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. represent 30 percent of the retail market. Mass merchants like Sears and catalogue showrooms take another 35 percent. Discount retailers find R.T.A. pieces easy to handle: show one assembled unit and stack 20 boxed duplicates right next to it. **********""You can't sell a set-up six-drawer dresser through Kmart,"" said Kevin Sauder, grandson of the founder and director of marketing for Sauder Woodworking, now the largest R.T.A. maker in the country. **********Right behind the discounters have come home improvement centers, now with 7 percent of the R.T.A. market; membership warehouse clubs (6 percent) and office superstores (9 percent). **********One of the most recent mass marketers to jump on the R.T.A. bandwagon is the Sears chain, which gets 9 percent of its furniture sales from unassembled furnishings. **********""R.T.A., with its styling, was in the right place at the right time,"" said Mary Ellen Schumacher, a Sears buyer. ""They make it differently than traditional furniture, but it's not any less of a product."" **********The Ikea Formula  Pick Out a Room And Drive It Home **********If there is one aspect of the ready-to-assemble market that analysts and manufacturers can agree on, it is the Swedish phenomenon called Ikea. **********The furniture retailer broke into the American market in 1985 with an enormous blue-and-gold store-cum-warehouse outside Philadelphia. There are now 10 stadium-sized stores in the United States, and the 11th will be opening in the Houston area this week. **********Everything about the Ikea concept -- from quirky advertising to in-store signs depicting a talking Allen wrench that explains the do-it-yourself concept -- has helped to bring R.T.A. into the American mainstream. **********The chain's total sales in 1991 were $284 million, up 68 percent from 1990, according to a spokeswoman, Pam Diaconis. **********Ikea lures customers with splashy, colorful advertising and mailings. The maze-like pattern of its stores insures they see a dozen displays, even if they planned only to look at bookshelves. When a setting catches their eyes, they can take home the whole room -- from the shelves to the tables and chairs to the lampshades -- that day. **********It's a concept shared by other specialty stores, like Conran's Habitat, that in total now account for an estimated 12 percent of the R.T.A. market. There is strong logic to it. Surveys show that most people hate the traditional furniture-shopping experience.  The pricing and brands are confusing and once consumers have made a decision, they still must wait weeks for delivery. **********Immediate gratification, then is one of R.T.A.'s biggest assets, a thought not lost on Ikea. . **********""People walk around the store,"" said Robert Marks, a senior editor and furniture writer for HFD magazine, a home furnishings trade publication. ""They find a piece, they strap it into the back of the car, go home and put it together and that afternoon they've got a new piece of furniture."" A TRADITIONALIST TAKES A FLYER ON THE R.T.A. **********Most times, a corporation with little more than than $400 million in annual sales does not cause much of a stir when makes an $8.4 million acquisition. **********But the industry certainly took notice when Ladd Furniture Inc., the fourth-largest furniture maker in the country, best known for its Pennsylvania House line, announced July 3 that it was buying the Fournier Furniture Corporation. Fournier makes ready-to-assemble furniture, and this is the first time a traditional manufacturer has taken an R.T.A. maker into its fold.. **********Fournier is the fifth-largest ready-to-assemble furniture maker in the country, with sales of $30 million in 1991. It was founded in 1972 by Greg Sammons, originally to cash in on the market for something to put home electronics on or in. Now it offers furniture for every room in the house. **********Mr. Sammons, who is staying on as president of Fournier, said the Ladd deal would help his company expand its styling efforts. ""We want to bring the whole fashion design flair of the rigid furniture industry into our product,"" he said. **********As Richard Allen, chairman and chief executive of Ladd, sees it, R.T.A. is just growing too fast to ignore.  ""There is a $15 billion market for furniture out there,"" he said, ""and the distribution is changing."""

Vows to Raise Indian Flag **********The Hindu nationalist leader, Murli Monahar Joshi, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, set off on Dec. 11 on a procession from Kanniyakumari on the southernmost tip of India, declaring that he would raise the Indian flag in the center of Srinagar to demonstrate the unity of the Indian nation. Separatist militants in Kashmir have vowed to halt Mr. Joshi's caravan of cars, trucks and buses and have threatened to shoot anyone displaying the Indian flag. **********On Thursday, as the caravan was traveling through the Punjab, another region torn by separatist violence, Sikh militants wearing police uniforms opened fire on advance buses filled with Mr. Joshi's supporters. Five people were reported killed. **********Standing in the pulpit of a specially designed Toyota truck, Mr. Joshi arrived today in the city of Jammu, which is now home to 200,000 Hindu refugees who have fled the violence in the Vale of Kashmir. Police officers and soldiers with automatic weapons lined the 67-mile stretch of road that winds from Pathankot to Jammu through forests into the faint foothills of the Himalayas. **********Towns and villages along the route were festooned with the green and saffron flags of the Bharatiya Janata Party and plastered with portraits of its leaders. Young party workers swept ahead of the caravan on motorcycles waving party banners and shouting religious slogans. **********Mr. Joshi's party has emerged over the last year as one of the most powerful political forces in India and the main opposition party to the governing Congress Party. The party has gained influence through its vociferous appeals to nationalism and to Hindu religious fervor. **********In 1990, the parliamentary leader of the party, Lal Kishan Advani, led a religious procession across India to press his group's argument that the town of Ayodhya, the site of a Muslim mosque, is the birthplace of the Hindu god Rama. In a campaign that heightened tensions between Hindus and the country's Muslim minority, the party argued that the mosque should be replaced by a Hindu temple. **********The public's reaction to the new procession, which Mr. Joshi calls a ""Pilgrimage for Unity,"" has generally been subdued, although the leader received an enthusiastic greeting in the so-called Hindi heartland in northern India. Today more than 50,000 people greeted Mr. Joshi in Jammu with cries of ""Hail Lord Ram!"" **********Rama, a mythical king who is the hero of the Ramayana, an epic Hindu tale, is the patron of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the god whose reign is regarded as the utopian expression of Hindu rule. **********Mr. Advani traveled to Jammu tonight and said he would accompany Mr. Joshi to Srinagar. Both leaders met late this evening with the Governor of Kashmir, Girish Chandra Saxena, to discuss security risks surrounding the cavalcade after the explosion at the police building. **********Mr. Advani said he would oppose canceling the procession in reaction to threats from Kashmiri militants. ""It would mean accepting that the Government as well as the people are unable to face them,"" he said.  Claims From Separatists **********After the explosion in Srinagar, several people claiming to represent separatist rebels called news organizations in New Delhi to claim responsibility for the bombing. Many Government officials in New Delhi were startled by the attack in the city, the base of the Kashmir region's security apparatus. The bombing is seen as a setback to the Government's efforts to bring the guerrilla war under control. **********The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, a group that seeks independence for the region and has widespread support in the Vale of Kashmir, said that suicide squads had been formed to stop Mr. Joshi's caravan. **********The police and the army have sealed off the highway from Jammu to Srinagar and have warned the valley's residents to stay away from the road. Srinagar has been placed under an indefinite curfew."

Yeltsin ordered the creation of a separate Russian Ministry of Defense today and named himself its acting head, thus taking the first step toward the establishment of a potentially powerful Russian army. **********Mr. Yeltsin's decision, which follows repeated failures within the Commonwealth of Independent States to resolve the fate of the former Soviet armed forces, appears to raise serious questions about the possibility of keeping a unified military command when the commonwealth heads of state meet in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on Friday. **********At a news conference today, Sergei Shakhrai, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, said the new Russian Defense Ministry would set up armed forces on Russian territory ""with the view that these forces are part of the joint commonwealth armed forces and are subject to its operational command."" The Message Is Clear **********Yet the clear message in Mr. Yeltsin's decree, issued on his return to Moscow after a two-week vacation, is that Russia, along with several other former Soviet republics, is now ready to press its claim to the remnants of the former Soviet armed forces and to answer for its own security. **********After the formal breakup of the Soviet Union last December, the leaders of the republics who formed the Commonwealth of Independent States agreed that the 3.7 million-strong former Soviet armed forces would remain unified under the command of Marshal Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov. This was viewed as particularly important for control of the nuclear weapons spread around the former Soviet Union. **********But Marshal Shaposhnikov's authority has been repeatedly challenged by Ukraine, which has set out to form its own large force, and Azerbaijan, Belarus and Moldova, all of which have taken steps to form their own military forces. Russia Moves in Germany **********Ukraine's insistence on putting the important Black Sea fleet under its jurisdiction has riled Mr. Yeltsin, and it is thought that by forming his own Russian armed forces he will be in a better position to bargain with Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader, at the commonwealth meeting on Friday. **********It is always possible that a agreement can be reached by the commonwealth leaders for some form of joint military command, in which the various republican contingents under their own flags could work together, but in the current atmosphere, marked by Ukrainian independent fervor, this is seen as increasingly hard to achieve. **********Russia has already moved to assume jurisdiction over former Soviet troops still in Germany and others in Poland, Mongolia and Cuba, a spokesman at the headquarters of the western group of troops told the Itar-Tass agency.  ""However, before the Russian Defense Ministry is formed, they will continue to be subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Commonwealth armed forces,"" the spokesman was quoted as saying. **********Russia is also sending a delegation to other commonwealth states to negotiate the status of troops on their territory, the television news reported this evening. **********In the Russian Parliament today, Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, a military aide to President Yeltsin, said Russia could have 1.5 million men under its command within two years. **********Russia is now following a trend that became apparent shortly after the commonwealth was formed late last year, when Ukraine, Moldova and Azerbaijan declared their intention to maintain independent armies. Belarus is also considering setting up its own armed forces, and today the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, issued a decree setting up republican guard units, a special military force subordinate to the President. **********Until now, Russia has pressed for a unified command over conventional forces. While these are largely dependent on Russia for financial support, the idea created the impression of a common defense and ducked the tricky question of how to divide up the powerful Soviet military machine. **********But Ukraine has argued that Russia is simply using the commonwealth as a cover for its own ambitions. Indeed, Ukraine's proposal to take over the nonstrategic part of the Black Sea Fleet, based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, turned into a bitter dispute with Russia, where many people still regard Crimea and the fleet as Russian property. **********Ukraine again displayed its distrust of Russia's handling of military matters last week when President Kravchuk suspended the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, where they are to be destroyed in accordance with treaties with the United States. Mr. Kravchuk said he was given no guarantee that the weapons were in fact being destroyed, and pointed to the danger that they might ""fall into the wrong hands."" **********Military issues are once again the main matters to be discussed when the heads of the commonwealth states gather in Kiev. According to Russian press reports, an agreement is unlikely. **********""Again, as at previous summits, there is not enough time for anything serious,"" said a commentator in the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Most experts agree that the mutual suspicions, particularly between Russia and Ukraine, have already overwhelmed the military debate, leaving ""presidents to issue decrees, commanders to issue orders and the resulting contradictions to be decided according to the evolving C.I.S. tradition: by use of force,"" the commentator concluded. **********As the heads of state gather to discuss the fate of the military, its future has already been decided in many parts of the former Soviet Union by individual commanders, who have begun to turn over their forces to local political leaders and in some cases are reported to have put their weapons up for sale. **********An armed forces spokesman in Moscow today denied reports that two nuclear warheads had been sold to Iran from a base in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is one of four former Soviet republics holding nuclear weapons."

An official of Caterpillar Far East Commercial Ltd., the Asian subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., based in Peoria, Ill., told a Congressional committee recently that on a visit to Vietnam last spring he saw working Caterpillar vehicles that had been delivered 20 years ago. **********""The interest in Vietnam is substantial,"" said Virginia Foote, director of the three-year-old United States Vietnam Trade Council, a private group that helps American companies and individuals position themselves for the competition expected in the Vietnmese economy when the embargo is finally lifted. The council's chairman is William H. Sullivan, a former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Vietnam, whom Hanoi approached for help in 1988. **********Ms. Foote said at least 10 large corporations and about 300 smaller companies, plus dozens of individual entrepreneurs, had joined the council, which gives briefings every couple of months in Washington to keep Americans abreast of trade laws as well as developments in Vietnam. The council is asking the Treasury Department for a license to bring Vietnamese to the United States under fellowships, or to allow Americans to teach courses in Vietnamese schools or companies. **********Nearly 17 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the United States not only maintains a nearly total embargo against country-to-country dealings with Vietnam but also opposes any assistance to Hanoi by international lending and development organizations, in particular the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, where Vietnam is in arrears from past borrowing. **********Washington does not, however, object to the World Bank's conducting surveys or giving advice in Vietnam in preparation for later development. On Dec. 17, the State Department relaxed travel restrictions, allowing group tours to Vietnam to be sold in the United States. Moreover, about $1 million in humanitarian assistance goes to Vietnam annually through private organizations, and an unknown amount of financial help is provided Vietnamese families by relatives in the West. **********But all applications for commercial trading licenses are routinely rejected, Government officials say. Americans, unlike their competitors in Japan and Europe, are not permitted to open offices in Vietnam. In Asia, American Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong, Bangkok and other cities have begun campaigns to lobby Congress and the Administration for a change in this restrictive policy. Hanoi Seeking Oil Bids **********Hanoi, short of hard currency and suffering from the loss of Soviet aid, is urgently seeking bids to explore and develop its oilfields in the South China Sea and to begin constructing or reconstructing roads, power plants, airports, ports and industrial buildings. Vietnam needs aircraft and wants to sell textiles and agriculture products, including tropical fruit and processed seafood. **********Jerry Smith, a spokesman for Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Okla., acknowledged that Phillips was among the oil companies interested in exploring Vietnamese offshore fields ""as soon as the embargo comes off."" **********David Dollar, the World Bank's Vietnam specialist, said the rebuilding of Vietnam, extremely impoverished by half a century of wars, is likely to cost roughly $500 million a year for five years. Mr. Dollar, speaking at the Asia Society last month, said it was far from clear where Vietnam would secure the money for these contracts. Low Incomes, High Debt **********The country has nearly 70 million people and one of the lowest per-capita incomes in the world -- barely $200 a year -- and is $140 million in arrears to the International Monetary Fund. Hanoi is also thought to have large foreign debts in rubles to the former Soviet Union and in hard currencies to commercial lenders in Japan. Hanoi and Tokyo are now negotiating a debt-repayment plan. **********At the Commerce Department, several officials said that Americans's interest in trading or investing in Vietnam is significant, despite the uncertainties. Among those asking for help and information are war veterans who would like to go back and help the country rebuild. Change Not Expected Soon **********State Department officials who deal with Vietnam say they are aware of the concerns of American business, and they acknowledge that Vietnam, with a well-educated labor force eager for jobs, holds a lot of potential. But the general feeling in the Bush Administration, in Congress and in private research organizations is that lifting the embargo and granting diplomatic recognition to Vietnam are not likely to occur before this year's Presidential election. **********Under the terms of a ""road map"" the American Government presented to the Vietnamese last spring, Hanoi must help smooth the transition to democracy in neighboring Cambodia and demonstrate that it is doing all it can to resolve at least 82 possibly solvable cases involving the 2,267 Americans who are missing in Indochina or whose remains have not been found. **********In the State Department, even officials most predisposed to hastening the recognition of Vietnam say that Hanoi is not extending as much cooperation as it could, perhaps because Communist hard-liners continue to deal from a position of mistrust and suspicion in issues involving Americans."

The refusal is particularly resented by the Government of President Ion Iliescu because ""the clause,"" as it is called here, was granted to the Ceausescu dictatorship and is enjoyed today by most other former Communist countries, as well as China. **********Mr. Iliescu was re-elected in October with 61 percent of the vote in presidential and parliamentary elections that foreign observers said were generally fair. His first election, in 1990, gave rise to doubts.  President Rejects Accusations **********In an interview, Mr. Iliescu, a usually genial man, bristled and his voice took on an edge as he rejected the catalogue of accusations that cloud the reputation of post-Communist Romania. **********""I see all of this as the result of ideological intoxication, which dominates all of us, here and abroad,"" the President said. Speaking of the violence of the 1989 revolution and the summary trial and execution of Mr. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, he said the dictatorship was the worst in the Communist world and ""an explosion"" was the only way to dislodge it. **********""Compare the evolution now,"" he said. ""After the 'velvet revolution,' Czechoslovakia is being dismembered. In Romania, progress was difficult and encountered problems, but I think Romania now is an area of greater calm, balance and stability."" **********Mr. Iliescu angrily rejected suggestions that his Government bears blame for rioting that took place in 1990, in which miners brought to the capital by Government transport attacked opponents to the Government and vandalized opposition offices.  Cites Other Ex-Communists **********He also reacted with bitterness against suspicions raised by his past as a top Communist official. ""Why isn't Boris Yeltsin judged the same way?"" he asked. He named Presidents Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and said, ""Everybody forgets their past."" **********A senior Western diplomat agreed with some of Mr. Iliescu's criticisms but said they were overstated. He said the bitterness of the country's political life is the principal reason why Romania's, and Mr. Iliescu's, past remain issues despite what many diplomats here view as progress toward democracy and economic liberalism. **********""Romania is a pariah largely because of the hostility of the opposition,"" he said. ""It paints the situation in solid black and Iliescu as an unredeemed Communist."" **********The harshness dividing election winners and losers was evident in interviews with opposition leaders. **********""Iliescu is a crypto-Communist who inspires no confidence,"" said Corneliu Coposu, a royalist who led the Democratic Convention electoral alliance and heads the National Peasants Christian Democratic Party. ""He has a nostalgia for the Communist structures and a Marxist-Leninist orientation. He has no credibility."" **********In a parliament in which no party or formal coalition can muster a majority, the small parties led by close associates of Ceausescu share significantly in the balance of power. The new Cabinet of Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, an economist who is considered a technocrat without close political ties, was approved with the support of the two radical parties.  New Premier Supports Plan **********Mr. Vacaroiu is charged with carrying out Mr. Iliescu's policy of slow reform, which seeks to minimize the effects of closing nonproductive state factories and withdrawing Government subsidies from essential goods on the long-suffering public. **********""The continuity of Romania's reform can be achieved only at a bearable social cost,"" the Prime Minister said in an interview. He stressed the word ""bearable."" **********The opposition asserts that this slow approach is a facade behind which Mr. Iliescu and his followers hide their unwillingness to change the still largely state-controlled economic structure. **********""They can't stop reform but want to slow it, to keep their old privileges for a few more years,"" said Nicolae Manolescu of the Civic Alliance Party. **********While the political leaders and the many parties vituperate in Parliament and through many new newspapers that contain far more opinion than fact, the 23 million Romanians seek with varying success to survive. **********Private stores have sprung up offering a much wider choice of goods than was available under the Communists, but most Romanians still buy necessities in state stores with subsidized prices. Food lines, a regular feature of Romanian life for many years, are shorter but still exist. **********Continuing pervasive poverty makes many Romanians uneasy about freedom. Those who rise above the average in a nation that was largely equal in poverty and repression are met with suspicion. Ordinary Romanians state with conviction that the small new class of entrepreneurs who succeed under the new freedom are either members of the former secret police or Gypsies, who are widely disliked. **********""It is easier to free people than to free their minds,"" said Dumitru Ciocoi-Pop, rector of the University of Sibiu."

Among them were pensioners in their 80's, men and women suffering from cancer and other diseases, pregnant women and mothers with small children, and dozens of people with disabling wounds sustained in the seven-month siege, including several who lost limbs in mortar and artillery explosions. **********The reason given by the Bosnian Red Cross for abandoning the evacuation was the shooting attack today on the driver of a minivan that carried about 20 Serbs out of Sarajevo into territory controlled by the Serbian forces besieging the city. The driver, a Serb, was only lightly wounded when unidentified assailants fired on the minivan as it crossed the runway at Sarajevo airport after delivering the Serbs to a Serbian military barracks. **********But behind the collapse of the evacuation was a tangled web of politics and diplomacy. All the major players in the Sarajevo siege -- the Serbian forces, the Bosnian Government and army with their headquarters in Sarajevo and the United Nations military headquarters -- have created obstacles to free movement out of the city. Each had a role in the events that ended today with hundreds of exhausted and embittered people walking off into the foggy darkness of the Sarajevo night. Attack at Airport **********""This whole thing has been a farce, an outrageous deceit,"" said an 86-year-old man who asked that he be identified only by his first name, Jovan. **********As he spoke, his 82-year-old wife, suffering from cancer, sat shivering on a plastic chair friends had placed for her in a nook at the entrance to the Sarajevo railway station. **********Moments earlier, a Red Cross official had announced that the bus convoy for those waiting at the station entrance would not be leaving because of the airport shooting incident. It was one of the few definitive scraps of information available during a day in which people had been left to sift rumors and counterrumors abouts their fate. They had sat on bulging suitcases and cardboard boxes tied with string and plastic bags that were spilling their contents -- all that most had saved from lifetimes in Sarajevo. **********On Tuesday, when the evacuation attempt began to falter, Serbs who had waited 12 hours outside the railway station were told that Muslim drivers for the Sarajevo city buses chartered for the evacuation had refused to drive into Serbian-held territory for fear they would be arrested, as has occurred previously when Muslim drivers have taken groups of evacuees into Serbian territory. Later, word passed among those waiting to leave that there was no fuel for the buses, and that there were no tires for the vehicles. A No Compromise Commander **********But today, as hours passed without the 20 buses needed for the evacuation, many of those waiting concluded that they were hostages to the reluctance of the Bosnian Government, defending Sarajevo, to allow the city to be emptied of people. Many with precious tickets for the convoy said they considered themselves victims of ethnic discrimination by the Muslim-led Government against Serbs, about 50,000 of whom have remained here, a minority in a predominantly Muslim population. **********""Ask Sefer Halilovic why we are still here,"" an old man said, referring to the Bosnian army commander, who has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in the Government, and a strong advocate of making no compromise with the Serbian forces who have seized two-thirds of Bosnia and driven more than a million Muslims from their homes. **********A weeping woman standing beside the old man in the darkness, Radojka Crnogora, who is 75, said: ""It's the Muslims. They block every way out. We are hostages here."" **********On Monday night, Major Halilovic issued an order forbidding the Red Cross to continue the evacuation effort."

On Tuesday, the cutter has orders to take 250 Haitians back to Haiti because they did not qualify for asylum in the United States. **********The boat that was intercepted today was newly built, with white caulk still gleaming between its boards, its roughly hewn timber mast still not weathered. It had survived a rough squall on Sunday night after its third day at sea. The refugees, who said they paid $1,000 for the 25-foot boat, recalled praying together as they rode out the storm. Interception on Sunday **********On Sunday, in the first interception of Haitian refugees in several days, the Coast Guard picked up some boat people sailing north from Haiti in a rickety, stolen 20-foot sailboat. **********The migrants, who said they had been at sea for three days but were still in sight of Haitian shores, had already run out of food and water and were beginning to show signs of dehydration. **********They were sighted by a Coast Guard helicopter late Sunday morning and were out of the water within an hour of the cutter Mohawk's arrival on the scene early Sunday afternoon. **********The rescue went smoothly in calm seas and light winds. **********Despite the fine weather, Capt. Richard R. Beardsworth, the skipper of the Mohawk and commander of the Coast Guard task force patrolling waters near Haiti, said the boat would have faced slim chances of making it to Miami, where the refugees said they were heading. **********Stael Pantrot, the group's leader, said this was the second time he had tried to flee Haiti and that he believed they could have made it. **********He said the group of 12 men and a 7-year-old boy had taken six gallons of fresh water with them before embarking from Port-au-Prince. Fear of Authorities **********Another of the men said he would rather have died at sea than in Haiti. He said the authorities there had killed his mother two or three months ago. **********The Haitians, who said they were neighbors from the same village, said they were being harassed for supporting the ousted President, the Rev.  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and some said they had been in hiding for months. **********Unlike most of the hundreds of migrants picked up in recent weeks, these appeared to be in relatively good health. They even had a few hundred dollars and some extra clothing with them. **********But the ship's medical officer, Lieut. George J. Majus, said that three of them were running 102-degree fevers. 'Confusion Sets In' **********""Five days out and they would have been in really serious medical condition,"" he said. ""They ran out of water a day and a half ago. Once they get really dehydrated, confusion sets in. They'll go north, or south, but not necessarily toward Miami. **********""God's the only one who is going to help them if we don't pick them up."" **********A few of the men wept quietly and one of them folded his hands in prayer as they sat on the cutter's helicopter deck and watched their boat, which the Coast Guard had flooded with fuel and set afire, drift smoking into the distance. All refugee boats intercepted by American vessels are destroyed to prevent hazards to shipping.                    --------------------       U.S. Restates Position **********WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (AP) -- The Bush Administration said again today that it had no documented evidence of reprisals against forcibly repatriated Haitian boat people. The statement followed the disclosure of statements from dozens of Haitian refugees who said that after they were sent back in November they suffered political persecution in Haiti, prompting them to flee the island nation again. **********The State Department press officer, Richard Boucher, said today that officials had investigated claims by four Haitians who said they were persecuted. ""We've not found information to corroborate these stories,"" he said. ""We don't have evidence that people are being persecuted upon going back."""

It was a major step to tie the republics into the rest of the world's economy. **********Western and Russian officials said offering membership would also help make billions of dollars of Monetary Fund and World Bank aid available to the republics as they emerge from seven decades of Communism and make the painful transition to market economies. **********""This is indeed an historic day,"" said Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont. ""Some 46 years after its foundation, the I.M.F. has at last become a truly global institution, and the countries of the former Soviet Union are taking their place in the world economy."" Negotiations to Begin **********Now that membership has been offered, Russia and the other republics will begin negotiating in earnest with the Monetary Fund and World Bank on accords in which they agree to sweeping changes to build stable market economies. The I.M.F. has called on the republics to slash their budget deficits, remove price controls and reduce subsidies to industry. **********Such agreements will reduce the economic sovereignty of Russia and the other republics by requiring them to meet strict conditions in exchange for receiving more than $20 billion in loans over the next three years. **********American officials say that when Moscow signs an I.M.F. agreement, that will begin triggering much of the $24 billion aid package for Russia that President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany unveiled April 1 on behalf of the Group of Seven major industrial democracies.  Components of Package **********That package includes $4.5 billion in aid in 1992 from the I.M.F. and World Bank, a $6 billion ruble stabilization fund, $2.5 billion in debt deferral and $11 billion in government-to-government aid, including $2 billion from the United States. Group of Seven officials say that not only Monetary Fund and World Bank loans, but also the ruble fund and much of the debt deferral and bilateral aid, are contingent upon signing of an I.M.F. accord. **********Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said he hoped that Russia would sign an agreement in June or July and that other republics, which trail Russia in reforms, will complete agreements later this year. **********Yegor T. Gaidar, the Russian Deputy Prime Minister who is representing his Government in the Monetary Fund meetings, said that signing an agreement would greatly help Russia in its transformation to capitalism, which he said would take most of the decade. ""It is a slow process, a process that is politically difficult, socially depressing,"" he said. **********He said the agreement would provide a basis for stabilizing the economy and would give Russia a seal of approval that would spur foreign investment. **********Monetary Fund officials said that when balloting ended at noon today, a majority of its 156 members had voted for Russia and all of the other republics except Azerbaijan to join. Approval of Azerbaijan's application was delayed by paperwork, but fund officials said they expected to offer membership in early May. **********""They can take justifiable pride in passing this historic milestone on the road from central planning to market-based economic systems,"" said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady at a meeting of the fund's top policymaking committee. ""For our part, we can use this occasion to re-dedicate ourselves to helping the new states complete the journey."" **********The Monetary Fund and the World Bank announced their membership offers at the two institutions' annual spring meeting. **********The Soviet Union took part in the international conference held in 1944 in Bretton Woods, N. H., which set up the I.M.F. and World Bank to promote development and to supervise the world's monetary system. But Moscow ultimately refused to join the two institutions after disputes with Washington about the operation of the fund and the bank. **********The membership offer to the former Soviet republics and the decision on Sunday by the Group of Seven to approve the $24 billion aid package for Russia are widely viewed as major steps propelling its transition to a market economy.  Specific Actions Urged **********The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada -- welcomed the tough economic reforms that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia has pushed through since January. But they urged Russia to sign an agreement with the Monetary Fund that would mandate further action in these specific areas: ***********Reducing the budget deficit. ***********Curbing growth in the money supply to bring inflation under control, and halting the extension of credit to uncompetitive enterprises. ***********Establishing a legal framework and contractual rights to allow the development of a market economy, including private ownership. ***********Reforming the farming and energy sectors to spur production and increase foreign exchange earnings. ***********Developing a fiscal system that insures that the central Government obtains enough hard currency to meet its international obligations. ***********Establishing a single rate for the ruble, rather than continuing several different ruble rates. **********""The task is historic,"" Michel Sapin, France's Finance Minister, said at a news conference in Washington today. ""The task is difficult. The task is long."" **********In a morning speech to potential investors at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Gaidar disclosed that his Government planned to establish a single ruble rate by July 1. Economists say this is a crucial step toward making the ruble freely convertible and for activating a planned international fund to stabilize the ruble. Trying to Stabilize Ruble **********At a related gathering in Washington, the finance ministers of 11 industrial nations formally approved setting up a $6 billion ruble stabilization fund that will come into being once Russia and other republics have taken steps to steady their teetering economies. **********The 11 include the Group of Seven countries plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. **********The money would come from an emergency fund known as the General Arrangements to Borrow, which industrial nations could draw on if they needed to prop up their own currencies. **********Finance ministry officials attending today's meetings said many obstacles remained before a ruble stabilization fund could be set up. The steps they outlined paralleled the actions the I.M.F. is calling for. One is putting the unitary ruble rate in place. **********Russia will also have to decide what rate it wants the ruble to trade at, and whether it wants a fixed or somewhat flexible rate. Russia, they said, would also have to clamp down on inflation to create a minimum of confidence that the stabilization fund would seek to build on. Need to Curb Money Supply **********A senior German official said that perhaps the most difficult obstacle was to get not just Russia, but all the republics using the ruble, to rein in their money supplies at the same time. **********""I can't imagine that this can be solved in one, two, three, four weeks,"" the German official said. ""Maybe in one, two, three, four months. It's not a decision for tomorrow."" **********Several Group of Seven officials said the Netherlands sought to block the way the fund would be financed unless plans to increase the I.M.F.'s overall financing by $60 billion was first approved. In this way, the Netherlands sought to put pressure on the United States, whose failure to approve its $12 billion contribution has prevented the overall increase from taking effect. But the Dutch Government backed down when it saw that the group was intent on approving the ruble fund. **********Monetary Fund and World Bank officials said they expected Russia and the other republics to join their institutions over the next few weeks once their Parliaments approve whatever laws are necessary for membership. **********Russia is being given a 3 percent share in the capital of the Monetary Fund, which works in many ways like a cooperative bank. Within six months after accepting membership, Russia will have to pay $3.94 billion into the fund as a membership contribution, with 22.7 percent -- $895 million -- in hard currency and the rest in its own currency. **********Under Monetary Fund rules, countries following the Fund's reform agreements can usually borrow three times the amount of their membership contribution over three years. **********Altogether, the other 14 republics -- including Azerbaijan once it joins -- will have 1.75 percent of the fund's capital, and will have to put up about $2.8 billion, with almost $640 million in hard currency. **********To join the World Bank, Russia would have to pay $333 million as a down payment on its shares in the bank, while the 14 other republics would have to pay about $250 million. The World Bank often allows countries to borrow many times what they pay in. **********The World Bank said today that it was offering membership to all the republics except Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. The applications of those two republics were delayed by paperwork, but are expected to be approved next month. **********Addressing the Monetary Fund's policymaking committee, Treasury Secretary Brady urged the industrial nations to do more to spur global growth, asserting that economic sluggishness would hurt the republics' transition to a market economy. ""The time for concerted action to promote recovery and boost its strength is now,"" he said."

This week, after an adjournment for consultations, they are trying to meld the two drafts into one. **********They are focusing on three elements. **********One is the nature of any peace: that is, will it include trade, tourism, exchanges of embassies? Another is the nature of any withdrawal by Israel from the Golan Heights, which it captured in the 1967 war. Will it be total or partial or phased? The third is the nature of the security arrangements that would be established along their common frontier to monitor any peace accord. The Need for Caution **********Agreement on such a document would, in effect, establish the agenda and the objective of the peace negotiations, but it could still take months or years to actually work out the final details of a treaty, if they can be worked out at all. **********Officials on both sides emphasized the need for caution in following the talks. There have been good days and bad days, they said. Today was a good day; tomorrow could be a bad day. There will be many more ups and downs before the two sides reach agreement on this document of principles, let alone a final settlement, if they ever do. **********""We are continuing tomorrow and we hope that the same seriousness and the same businesslike atmosphere will continue so that at the end of this round maybe we can come out with something that can be acceptable to both sides,"" Syria's chief negotiator, Mouwafak al-Allaf, said. **********""We haven't reached yet all the essential elements,"" he added. ""We have discussed some of the important elements in the document, and we were able to agree, at least in a general way, on some of these elements."" Syrian Leader Visits Egypt **********As Syrian and Israeli negotiators were reporting headway in Washington, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria made a surprise visit to Alexandria for talks on a Middle East peace with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Egypt is the only Arab country that has a peace treaty with Israel and could play an important role behind the scenes. **********Both Israelis and Arabs have been saying privately for the last few days that if ever there was a need, and an opportunity, for high-level American mediation to help bridge the gaps it is now. But with the Bush Administration preoccupied with its re-election effort, and the State Department shorn of virtually its entire senior staff to run the Bush campaign, such a mission seems unlikely. **********Israeli officials said that the progress today involved agreement on language that the Syrians wanted, stating that the objective of the negotiations would be a ""comprehensive peace"" -- that is, not a separate deal between Israel and Syria that ignored the Palestinians, Jordanians and Lebanese. **********But added to this language is wording being sought by Israel that makes clear that a Syrian-Israeli peace has to stand on its own and not be made entirely dependent on final treaties with Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. **********The major difficulty will be to find language to bridge Syria's desire to recover full sovereignty over the Golan Heights and Israel's wish to retain a degree of control for security reasons. 'Mutual Education' **********Nevertheless, after the three-hour negotiating session at the State Department today, the chief Israeli and Syrian negotiators gave by far their most optimistic assessments yet of their negotiations. **********The Israeli negotiator, Itamar Rabinovich, said: ""We discussed texts, we compared texts, we agreed on some formulations, we continued to disagree on some, but disagree in a positive spirit."" **********Most important, Mr. Rabinovich said, ""there is a process of mutual education under way, and that is why even when we disagree on something it is possible to come back to it later."" **********But Mr. Allaf added: ""We are still in the area of general principles. Everything depends on what would be the situation when we come to more specific and more detailed parts of the document. We shall come tomorrow maybe or the day after tomorrow to the paragraphs of the document which deals with the Israeli withdrawal in a more detailed manner."" **********""If we continue tomorrow with the same manner, with the same spirit,"" Mr. Allaf went on, ""maybe we can say that there is certain progress in our discussions. But I cannot tell you that now because everything depends on the document in its entirety because the document is comprehensive; it deals with all necessary elements for comprehensive, just and lasting peace."" **********Even with all of the caveats, it is clear that Syria and Israel, the bitterest of foes, are talking in tones, and working on documents, that are unprecedented in their relationship. The only agreement between them -- the 1974 disengagement of forces agreement -- was signed by an Egyptian Army officer on behalf of Syria."

Judge Helen Balick in Wilmington, Del., granted the request in an emergency hearing sought on Wednesday by the airline and its creditors. **********Separately, T.W.A.'s unions approved a plan that protects their pensions and allows the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to seek $1.2 billion in pension underfinancing from Carl C. Icahn, the airline's owner. The plan calls for T.W.A. to issue notes to cover $300 million of the amount, but allows the agency to seek the entire underfunded sum from Mr. Icahn and his other companies after terminating the carrier's two pension funds. The pension funds must be terminated before T.W.A. emerges from bankruptcy-law proceedings and Mr. Icahn relinquishes control."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/16/business/economists-back-clinton-on-investment-tax-credits.html,Steven Greenhouse,1992-11-16,,1146,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Economists Back Clinton On Investment Tax Credits,Economists Back Clinton On Investment Tax Credits," **********The investment tax credit proposed by President-elect Bill Clinton is probably the single most powerful tool for giving the economy a jolt forward without dangerously expanding the budget deficit, economists agree. **********Several economic forecasters interviewed said Mr. Clinton's investment tax credit, probably limited to purchases of equipment, would create 300,000 to 500,000 additional jobs by the end of 1993 while increasing the deficit by just $500 million. **********""Investment tax credits probably provide more short-term stimulus than any other changes on the spending side or tax side,"" said William A. Niskanen, president of the Cato Institute and a member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. **********While economists agree that investment tax credits are a potent tool, not everyone agrees that they are needed now with the economy finally showing some signs of picking up. But with economic growth weak for the last three years, Mr. Clinton seems intent on stepping on the accelerator, if only in part to make sure the economy does not stall again. **********Most of the jobs created by an investment tax credit would be in companies that produce equipment like computers, trucks or metal-working machinery, economists said. Only a fraction would probably occur in companies buying equipment, since much of that equipment would replace workers. Though this would penalize some workers, the tax credit is intended to create a wealthier nation over all by increasing investment, growth and productivity. **********Mr. Clinton is seeking a marginal or incremental tax credit, meaning companies will receive a tax credit only on investments above a certain base level. If the tax credit was 10 percent, a number some Clinton advisers have suggested, a company that invests $1 million in equipment above its base level, for example, would receive a $100,000 credit. Looking at 80% **********Although no final decision has been made about what the base level of investment would be, Mr. Clinton's advisers suggested during the campaign that the credit might be available on equipment purchases that exceed 80 percent of a company's 1992 levels. So if a corporation spent $1 million on equipment in 1992, a tax credit would be calculated on amounts it spent in 1993 that exceeded $800,000. **********This marginal approach is intended to minimize a problem with the investment tax credits used by every President from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan. These credits provided a windfall of billions of dollars for investments that would have been made even without a tax credit. **********""In many ways a marginal tax credit is an ideal policy because the Government will leverage private-sector investment,"" said Gene B. Sperling, who was economic issues coordinator in the Clinton campaign and is now deputy director of the President-elect's economic transition team. ""It has the attractive aspect of not increasing the deficit while providing significant stimulus to the economy."" **********The investment tax credit was repealed by the 1986 tax bill after many economists argued that it improperly distorted investment decisions in favor of areas where the credit was available. The idea behind the repeal was that corporations should make investment decisions according to market forces, not tax incentives. **********Nonetheless, President Bush proposed an investment tax credit as part of his economic package last January, which aimed to stimulate the weak economy. That credit was never enacted into law, however, because Mr. Bush ultimately vetoed the package after Congress inserted some tax increases into it. The Cost in Revenue **********Past investment tax credits have generally cost the Government about one dollar in forgone tax revenues for each dollar of investment generated. Mr. Clinton's advisers say they are confident that their marginal credit will spur several dollars of investment for each dollar of Federal revenue forgone. **********DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., estimates that a marginal tax credit that costs the Government $4 billion next year would bring an additional $20 billion in investment. **********David Wyss, DRI's chief financial economist, said such a credit would create 300,000 jobs in capital goods industries next year and 200,000 additional jobs indirectly. These would be in trucking companies, software companies, restaurants or other corporations that sell goods or services to equipment manufacturers or their employees. **********Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, the St. Louis consulting firm, estimates that a 10 percent marginal credit would cost the Government $3.1 billion in foregone revenues in fiscal 1993 while producing about $22 billion in extra investment. The firm says the investment incentive will increase growth and incomes by so much that the deficit will increase by just $500 million next year. But because most companies would act immediately to take advantage of the new credit, Meyer sees a far smaller stimulus in 1994, with the credit expected to produce just $4 billion in extra investment. New Analysis Issued **********The firm, which was commissioned by the Clinton campaign to do a pre-election study of the tax credit, has issued a new analysis since the election showing lower job gains than originally estimated. Initially basing its computations on the assumption of a tax credit for equipment purchases exceeding 80 percent of a company's 1992 levels, the firm at first concluded that the credit would produce 500,000 additional jobs in 1993 and add seven-tenths of 1 percent to the gross domestic product. **********The new study predicts the credit will create only 300,000 extra jobs and a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in output. The firm made the downward revisions, its economists said, because they had originally underestimated how much would be spent on imported equipment. **********The Clinton plan could face numerous hurdles in Congress. For one, business groups are signaling that they will lobby for a tax credit on all equipment purchases rather on just incremental investments. **********And some people dislike a marginal tax credit because it would seem to penalize businesses that bravely increased investment despite the 1990-91 recession. **********""There is no reason to favor firms whose relative past investment has been low, rather than those whose recent investment has been high,"" said Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an economic official in the Carter Administration.  Work at Harvard **********Mr. Clinton's push for a tax credit on equipment investment seems in part inspired by the work of Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard professor who many say is on the short list to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Research by Mr. Summers and his Harvard colleague, Bradford Delong, shows that machinery investments have huge returns -- not just to corporations but to all of society. Such investment, they argue, helps spread new technologies and pushes companies to improve their workers' skills. **********Mr. Summers said in an interview, ""A dollar of equipment investment does more for economic growth than a dollar invested in office buildings, shopping centers or housing."""

The boards of both associations, meeting in New York yesterday and Monday, agreed in principle to the merger, subject to the approval of their members. **********Cathleen Black, the former publisher of USA Today, who has been chairman and chief executive of the publishers' association since June, has been named chairman and chief executive of a joint management organization that will run the two associations until the merger is concluded. **********If, as expected, the members approve the merger, which is planned to take effect on July 1, Ms. Black, 47 years old, would become president and chief executive of what would be called the American Newspaper Association (a set of initials already claimed in the world of advertising and media by the Association of National Advertisers). Leonard P. Forman, 47, who has been president of the ad bureau since February, would at that time become chief operating officer of the new association. **********For many years, the two organizations, as well as others in the fractionated industry, whose members belong to more than a half-dozen other marketing, advertising and research associations, have discussed amalgamating. But it took the industry's worst financial results in 50 years, in large part because of a plunge in ad sales not seen since the 1930's, to hasten this merger. **********""I've often said that if the newspaper industry were the Balkans, we'd be in World War III now,"" said John Morton, newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a brokerage, in Washington. ""They've always had all these separate organizations,"" he added, ""which is outdated in this day and age."" **********The industry's recession, and the cost savings the merger would bring members in expenses like dues, were not the only reasons behind the merger, J. Stewart Bryan 3d, chairman of the ad bureau, told the news conference. **********""The newspaper business has determined that it wants to speak with a single voice,"" said Mr. Bryan, who is also chief executive of Media General Inc. **********Among the issues to be addressed by the new organization, said Robert F. Erburu, chairman of the publishers association, and chairman and chief executive of the Times Mirror Company, will be marketing, First Amendment rights, public policy, technology and diversity in the newsroom. **********""The idea that you could pursue advertising excellence apart from circulation excellence, editorial excellence or production excellence, is insane,"" Mr. Morton said. ""These are all interlinked."" **********Still, the financial issues behind the merger cannot be ignored. The publishers' association now has 1,323 members, Ms. Black said, about 150 fewer than five years ago; Mr. Forman said that the ad bureau, with 633 members, had suffered a similar decline. Though about a third of the membership hemorrhage was attributable to newspapers merging or closing, the rest was because of resignations by members. **********While new dues structures are still being determined, Ms. Black said, ""for a newspaper that belongs to A.N.P.A. and N.A.B., dues will drop."" **********Ms. Black said it had not been determined where the new organization would be based. Mr. Morton, the analyst, predicted that it would be in Reston, with an ad sales office in New York. Ms. Black added that staffing decisions had also not been made; the publishers' association has about 150 employees, all in Reston, and the ad bureau about 100 -- 80 in New York and the rest in sales offices around the country. **********The proposed combination pre-empts a decision announced last year to merge, effective in July, the ad bureau and six other marketing and research organizations, into an organization called Newspaper Marketing Inc. While details have not yet been worked out, Mr. Forman said, the intent is to have the activities now performed by the six, as well as the bureau, performed by the new association. Among the six are the Association of Newspaper Classified Advertising Managers, the International Newspaper Advertising and Marketing Executives and the Newspaper Research Council. **********The merger is the latest significant change in a realm of industry associations and organizations that have been hit hard by the sour economy. The Television Bureau of Advertising, for example, which is that medium's equivalent of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, has spent the last year drastically reorganizing to narrow its focus and reduce costs. **********When the newspaper ad bureau was founded in 1913, it was called the Bureau of Advertising and was part of the publishers' association. It became a separate organization in 1950 and was renamed in 1973."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/02/world/senate-endorses-pact-to-reduce-strategic-arms.html,John Cushman,1992-10-02,,885,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Senate Endorses Pact to Reduce Strategic Arms,Senate Endorses Pact to Reduce Strategic Arms," **********With a decade of negotiations and an era of superpower rivalry gone by, the Senate endorsed an arms control treaty today that sharply reduces the numbers of long-range nuclear weapons held by the United States and four republics of the former Soviet Union. **********Even greater cuts in nuclear arms are already planned under a later agreement reached last June by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. That agreement, currently being translated into treaty language, would cut warheads to 3,000 in the Russian arsenal and 3,500 in the American one, less than a third of today's levels. **********But the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which was signed in July 1991 and was voted on by the Senate today, carries importance beyond its numerical reductions in warheads. The treaty breaks new ground by actually reducing rather than merely limiting the growth in the most powerful weapons. Reductions Already Under Way **********Some of those reductions are already under way, but the treaty makes them legally binding, and it dictates that the arms to be removed include some of the powerful land-based varieties that arms control experts consider the most destabilizing and dangerous. **********At the same time, it prevents the breakup of the Soviet Union from scattering nuclear forces among several new republics, since only Russia would retain nuclear arms. Ukraine, Belarus and Khazakstan, three newly independent republics where Soviet missiles were based, will have to become non-nuclear states under the treaty's terms. Vote Was 93-6 **********That process could take years and may yet prove difficult, arms control experts said. In Ukraine's legislature, for example, there is large resistance to handing over weapons to Russia and embracing non-nuclear status. **********If it happens, the disarmament of Ukraine, Belarus and Khazakstan would be the first time that any state with nuclear weapons has renounced them altogether. **********The vote on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, which like all treaties must win the Senate's consent by a two-thirds majority, was 93-6, with only a few conservative members still opposing a pact whose momentum had gained steadily as the Soviet Union crumbled and the tensions between the two biggest nuclear powers relaxed. **********The treaty will reduce the total number of long-range nuclear warheads in the United States arsenal to 8,556, compared with 12,646 in 1990. Russia will retain 6,163 warheads, compared with the 11,012 held by the former Soviet Union in 1990. **********Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, noting the lingering uncertainties over carrying out the treaty, called it ""a dream and a prayer to the tooth fairy."" **********But Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, in a letter to Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, said approval of the treaty was needed to push the former Soviet republics forward. **********""The history of the cold war will not be over until Start is ratified and has entered into force,"" Mr. Eagleburger said. Soviet Aid Also Approved **********The Senate also passed a foreign aid bill that would provide $417 million to the former Soviet republics if they meet standards for human rights and carry out democratic and economic reforms. The measure would also provide $12 billion in new lending for the International Monetary Fund, some of which might flow to the republics. The House has approved a similar bill. **********The treaty approved by the Senate today was negotiated with the Soviet Union, mostly during the Reagan Administration, and was signed at a Moscow summit meeting between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in July 1991. **********After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia assumed operational control over the Soviet nuclear weapons, and Mr. Yeltsin said at once that Moscow would respect the treaty as negotiated. Under a separate protocol, negotiated after the dissolution of Soviet Union, the republics of Kazakhstan, Belarus and Ukraine have become parties to the treaty as well. **********Kazakhstan's legislature has already approved the treaty protocol, which was signed in Lisbon in May by the United States and all four republics in which the Soviet Union based nuclear weapons. None of the other former Soviet republics' legislatures have yet approved it, although they are expected to do so before the end of the year. **********But even those votes will not put the treaty into effect. That only happens when all five parties exchange what diplomats call the ""instruments of ratification."" And neither Russia nor the United States is likely to do so until Ukraine and the other republics take further steps. **********Under the protocols signed by all sides, Ukraine and the other republics must declare that they will join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear states, meaning that they give up their nuclear weapons and forswear ever building any more. **********The Ukrainian Government has said it hopes to do this, but it cannot guarantee that its legislature will go along, and nobody can say for sure whether the opposition to such a step can muster a parliamentary majority."

They are working to fill orders not only from mobile-home parks that have been devastated by the disaster, but also from distributors that want to keep their supply intact in anticipation of shortages. One Maker's Orders Rise 75% **********At Fleetwood Enterprises, the nation's largest maker of mobile homes, orders in the last few weeks have risen nearly 75 percent, compared with the period in 1991. **********""We have found that demand has increased because of people who actually want homes and from distributors who don't want to be caught out there without supplies,"" said Jon A. Nord, senior vice president of the housing group of Fleetwood, which is based in Riverside, Calif. **********That demand for mobile homes, also called manufactured homes, has already started affecting prices, industry officials say. **********""We have already seen one memo,"" from a maker, ""saying that a small increase, about $250 per unit, will go into effect,"" said Daniel L. Vaughn, a sales consultant at the Hamptons Golf and Country Club, a retirement community of manufactured homes in Lakeland, Fla., about 40 miles west of Orlando. **********Mr. Vaughn added that his company and other buyers of manufactured homes anticipated that the price would increase at least $500 to $600 a unit because of the tightening supply of many materials that go into the homes. Manufactured homes generally sell for $18,000 to $80,000. **********And the makers of manufactured homes say they have already seen tighter supplies of several items, including plywood, roofing materials and certain lumber products. New Concerns About Safety **********The large number of mobile homes in Florida and their vulnerability to natural disasters has many public officials worried about the safety issue, and those concerns could have a profound effect on the industry. **********The Dade County Board of Rules and Appeals recently adopted a recommendation that sets the same standards for mobile homes as those for traditionally built homes. That recommendation calls for manufactured homes to withstand winds of up to 120 miles an hour. **********""I have great concerns about the safety of mobile homes,"" said Bertram S. Warshaw, chairman of the board, which oversees building codes in Dade County. ""They are not structurally capable of withstanding high winds."" **********Mr. Warshaw added, ""We simply want mobile homes to be required to meet the same performance standards as permanent residences."" **********Jack Kemp, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has ordered a full-scale review of the Government's manufactured housing code to insure that it provides adequate protection to residents of mobile homes in hurricanes. **********Bruce A. Savage, a spokesman for the Manufactured Housing Institute, an industry trade group in Arlington, Va., said that builders were ""committed to building and properly installing homes that are safe, durable and affordable for homeowners."" **********He added that builders of mobile homes conformed to standards mandated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ""So if there is a question about manufactured homes, it's not whether they are built to the code, but whether the code is adequate,"" he said. ""We'll build to whatever code they establish."" Sites Need to Be Cleared **********The convoys of trucks carrying mobile homes to communities in Florida like Homestead have not yet formed. There is still a need to demolish and remove the rubble left by the storm. Moreover, there are more immediate needs in the affected communities, like restoring electricity, sanitation service and water. **********Nonetheless, manufacturers of the homes are stepping up production, and retailers and operators of mobile-home parks are increasing their purchases, because mobile homes offer a quick and relatively inexpensive method of providing housing for the tens of thousands of people whose homes were destroyed. **********""Before the hurricane, we saw the demand for mobile homes as being sluggish,"" said Rollin E. Priest, chief executive of Ronlee Mobile Home Centers Inc., an Orlando-based retailer of mobile homes and operator of mobile-home parks. ""But now the tempo has picked up."" **********Mr. Priest added that it would probably be one and a half to two years before damaged homes could be rebuilt in the areas affected by the hurricane, while mobile homes could be set up in weeks. **********""You have 50,000 housing units that have to be replaced, and that's not going to happen overnight,"" he said.   The Florida Manufactured Housing Association, a state trade association, estimated in a survey that 85,000 traditionally constructed houses and about 10,000 manufactured homes had been destroyed or damaged by the hurricane. Already the Federal Government has requested about 1,000 manufactured homes from storage areas in the South to be sent to areas in Florida affected by the hurricane. And manufacturers like Redman Homes Inc., the Skyline Corporation and Clayton Homes Inc. have begun to gear up for the demand. **********The mobile home industry has already had a fairly robust year. The Manufactured Housing Institute said that in the first seven months of the year, production of mobile homes rose to 114,184 units, a jump of 17 percent from the 97,519 produced in the comparable period last year. **********Officials of the trade group contend that the recession has made manufactured homes more attractive to home buyers because they generally cost 30 to 50 percent less than homes built by traditional methods. Popular in Florida **********Manufactured homes are an important segment of the housing stock in Florida. They accounted for more than 750,000 of the state's 6.1 million housing units, according to the 1990 census, about 12 percent of all homes in Florida. That compares with a national average of about 7 percent. **********Mobile home producers typically fill orders with production from plants closest to where the units are needed. ""We have already had substantial backlogs in our plant in Florida,"" said Bill J. Thoma, manager of marketing with Redman Homes, the Dallas company that is the nation's second-largest producer of mobile homes. ""Our question is how we can meet some of the extra need that the public will have in an efficient manner."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-woman-to-clarify-its-identity.html,Stuart Elliott,1992-08-17,,751,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,New Woman To Clarify Its Identity,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; New Woman To Clarify Its Identity," **********A WOMEN'S magazine that focuses on relationships is seeking to renew its own relationship with advertisers and agencies. Yet complicating that task is one of Madison Avenue's most vexatious verities: relationships between media and buyers of advertising can be as difficult as those between any quarrelsome couple. **********New Woman, which competes in the saturated contemporary segment of the women's magazine market, is introducing a campaign that seeks to clarify its somewhat blurry identity. Though aimed predominantly at the ad trade, the print advertisements, created by Wills & Evans Inc. in New York, New Woman's new agency, will also be exposed to potential readers, primarily women in their 30's with jobs, families and some sort of significant others. **********""New Woman had been undermarketed,"" Lori Zelikow Florio, the monthly's publisher, asserted in an interview last week in Manhattan.  ""One of the challenges we have, in our advertising, and in our sales calls, is to convey the essence of this magazine."" **********In the women's contemporary market, New Woman, which K-III Magazines acquired last year in buying Murdoch Magazines, is third in circulation and rate base, which is the circulation guaranteed to advertisers. It trails two behemoth monthlies, Cosmopolitan and Glamour. Following those three are a lengthy list of titles like Lear's, Mademoiselle, Mirabella, Self and Working Woman. **********Their quests for ad dollars are hampered by a need to define themselves by what they are not as much as by what they are. They are not the Seven Sisters, the traditional women's service magazines like The Ladies' Home Journal and McCall's (though one of that group, Redbook, is edging its way into the contemporary field after a revamping.) Nor are they fashion magazines like Elle, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, which, coincidentally, is also now bringing out a trade ad campaign, by Cox Landey & Partners. **********And atop that, New Woman has had to insist vociferously that it is not, as Ms. Florio put it, a Cosmo clone. That sobriquet began to be heard in 1984, when Rupert Murdoch bought New Woman and hired as editor and publisher Pat Miller, who had been director of Cosmopolitan's international editions. (Ms. Miller left New Woman in 1988 to join Woman, which closed two years later.) **********""It's the Cosmo girl and the New Woman,"" Ms. Florio said, deftly skewering her rival. **********The initial three ads in the campaign, which begin running next Monday, center on topics covered by New Woman's articles, which tend, like those found in almost all women's magazines, to be infused with a cheerful ""Climb Every Mountain"" spirit. (Samples from the September issue: ""Ah, Romance! How to Revive the Magic Between You,"" ""34 Lovely Little Pick-Me-Ups"" and ""Awaken Your Spiritual Self."") **********""It's a way to talk about relationships within women themselves as well as with all the people in their lives,"" said R. Scott Wills, president at Wills & Evans, who, with his partner, Ben Evans, executive vice president and creative director, joined Ms. Florio for the interview. **********""When we're together, we're inseparable,"" says one ad, about romantic relationships. ""But we work just as well apart."" **********A second ad, about careers, says: ""I run to work just as fast as I run home. I think that's healthy."" **********And a third ad, about family, says: ""My daughter just asked me when she would stop growing. I said with any luck, never."" **********All three ads, which Mr. Evans described as in a first-person voice, carry a hopeful, albeit flat, theme line: ""New Woman magazine. For the woman who loves life."" Still, it improves upon previous slogans, like the hopelessly boastful ""Nobody knows you like New Woman"" and the ridiculously redundant ""The New Woman is the new woman."" **********The campaign is the latest in what has been an intermittent series created by various agencies with which New Woman had relationships that, were they with human beings, would be characterized as one-night stands. **********Even Ms. Florio called them ""random efforts, an ad here and an ad there, that had not been consistent."" **********The ads will run through year-end in the Adcrafter in Detroit; Advertising Age; Adweek; Brandweek, formerly Adweek's Marketing Week; Inside Media; Mediaweek; New York magazine, a sibling K-III title, and Women's Wear Daily. They will also appear on buses and bus shelters in New York. The ad budget will be about $1 million on an annual basis, Ms. Florio said."

Whistle Blower Could Face a Suit,G.E. Whistle Blower Could Face a Suit," **********The General Electric Company has threatened to sue a whistle-blowing employee to recover any monetary award he receives for bringing forward allegations of wrongdoing in the company's sale of military jet engines to Israel, people involved in the case said yesterday. **********For several years military contractors have sought ways to blunt the provisions of a Federal law intended to encourage and protect whistle blowers. But General Electric's threat to countersue the whistle blower in this case is a highly aggressive tactic that will raise substantial questions about the way the whistle-blower law works, lawyers and Congressional investigators said. Chilling Effect Seen **********Proponents of the law, the False Claims Act, said countersuits from companies would have a chilling effect on prospective whistle blowers and would undercut the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. **********But the case also suggests the mounting frustration among large Government contractors at the whistle-blower law's central provisions, which in effect offer bounties to employees by allowing them to share in any financial recovery to the Government as a result of information they bring forward. Contractors argue that the law, by offering a financial reward, undermines their own efforts to encourage employees to report suspicions of wrongdoing immediately to officials within the company. **********A spokesman for General Electric, Bruce Bunch, declined to comment on whether the company was considering suing the whistle blower in this case, Chester L. Walsh, who served as general manager of the company's aircraft-engine group in Israel from 1984 to 1988. **********Mr. Bunch also declined to comment on statements by two of Mr. Walsh's lawyers, John R. Phillips and Mary Louise Cohen, that General Electric has threatened to dismiss Mr. Walsh if he does not agree to retire on terms that would allow the company to sue him. **********But Mr. Bunch repeated the company's argument that Mr. Walsh, who joined General Electric in 1964, had secretly gathered information about the reported wrongdoing and had failed to bring the information to the attention of the company, as a written General Electric policy requires him to do. U.S. Informed, G.E. Says **********General Electric has not denied the basic allegations in the case, which are that a group of employees in the aircraft-engine division conspired with an Israeli general, Rami Dotan, to submit fraudulent claims for work done for the Israeli Air Force that would ultimately be paid for by the United States Government. General Electric has instead said that it reported the matter to the United States Government as soon as the company became aware of possible wrongdoing in December 1990. The company said it was cooperating with the Justice Department in its investigation of the case. **********General Electric and the Justice Department tried to negotiate a settlement of the case in recent months. But the two sides have been unable to come to terms, lawyers involved in the case said, and yesterday the Justice Department filed an amended civil complaint against General Electric in United States District Court in Cincinnati, where the company's aircraft-engine division is based. Judge Carl Rubin last week set a trial date of Nov. 2. **********In addition to the Justice Department's civil and criminal investigations, the case is under investigation by the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, whose chairman is Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan. The case has also received widespread attention in Israel, where General Dotan last year pleaded guilty to fraud and bribery charges in the case. **********A member of the oversight subcommittee's staff said that General Electric executives had spoken repeatedly to Congressional investigators of their intention to sue Mr. Walsh should the case result in a monetary award for him. Mr. Walsh could theoretically receive as much as 25 percent of the $120 million in damages the Justice Department is seeking from General Electric, although the actual amount he would receive if the case is settled or decided against General Electric in court is likely to be far less. 'To Send a Message' **********Mr. Walsh's lawyers said previous court decisions had held that a company could not sue a whistle-blowing employee to recoup any award received by the whistle blower. But they said they saw the threat as a way to ""hound"" whistle blowers even after they won a case. **********""They're doing it to send a message to other G.E. employees that they shouldn't think they can file a False Claims Act suit and win a recovery and then walk off into the sunset and live happily ever after,"" Mr. Phillips said. **********General Electric has repeatedly argued that Mr. Walsh could have brought the information forward to company officials much earlier than he did and ended any wrongdoing much sooner. All General Electric employees sign a statement each year pledging to bring to management's attention any evidence of fraud promptly. **********""Rather than doing that he gathered information secretly and filed a lawsuit from which he seeks personal gain,"" said Mr. Bunch, the spokesman for General Electric. **********Mr. Walsh's lawyers said he could not report the information internally because he believed General Dotan might harm him physically. Mr. Walsh believed that any internal reports of wrongdoing would go straight to his direct superiors, who were aware of the purported fraud and who had close ties to General Dotan, the lawyers said. **********Two former General Electric employees who do not have any direct ties to Mr. Walsh's case said in interviews over the last several weeks that General Electric's culture discouraged employees from bringing charges of contract fraud to management, and that employees who did so were punished. **********""If you come forward at General Electric and try to give the information to somebody, they're going to blacklist you,"" said John M. Gravitt, a former machinist at General Electric's aircraft-engine unit who filed a whistle-blower suit against the company that was settled in 1989."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/10/world/south-korea-s-vietnam-veterans-begin-to-be-heard.html,James Sterngold,1992-05-10,,1235,,The New York Times,World,News,article,South Korea's Vietnam Veterans Begin to Be Heard,South Korea's Vietnam Veterans Begin to Be Heard," **********The tales of chaotic battles in Vietnamese jungles are much the same as those heard in the United States. The anger at a government that some say used its young men as pawns in a cold war power game is also familiar. But the faces of these bitter Vietnam veterans are different: They are Korean, and after years of bearing their hurt in near silence, they are finally being recognized for their role in a war few know South Korea fought. **********It is almost as little known here as it is in the West, but South Korea sent 312,853 solders to Vietnam from Sept. 22, 1963, to April 30, 1975, according to the Defense Ministry. After the United States, South Korea had the largest contingent of soldiers fighting Hanoi. **********But with two big-budget movies on the Korean soldiers in Vietnam coming out here shortly and the Vietnam Veterans Association battling for better treatment for its members, South Koreans are starting to come to grips with their heavy involvement in Vietnam and the toll the war took on many of the young men who served there. **********The veterans' stories are opening a little-explored chapter in South Korea's history, and are becoming a symbol of how this scarred country may finally be winning its own battle for free expression after years of authoritarian rule. The rough-and-tumble process of democracy, just five years old, is slowly giving South Koreans the chance to explore the difficult path they have taken to their current prosperity. Like Others, Alienated **********""The Vietnam veterans in other countries who returned were very alienated,"" said Hwang Myung Chul, vice president of the Vietnam Veteran's Association, seated near the neat rows of jars filled with black and dun-colored Vietnamese earth that he hopes one day to place in an official memorial. ""We were no exception. We wanted the media to relate our pain and difficulties, but they were told not to. The Government virtually ignored our problems. That is what we are fighting now."" **********For some, there is pride that South Korea, which was saved from Communist domination only because of United States military intervention in 1950, answered America's call for help. Soldiers from Thailand, the Philippines, Canada, Australia and New Zealand also served in Vietnam. **********But South Korea's Government had a number of reasons for responding so energetically to America's call for assistance in Vietnam. The military-dominated Government in power at that time had to maintain a constant vigil against attack from Communist North Korea, bolstered by American troops stationed in South Korea, and was resisting pressure from its own people for the introduction of real democracy at home. It also was engaged in a struggle to free the country from its grinding poverty -- tasks that all required some aid or acquiescence from the United States. **********Many South Koreans argue that their Government acted more out of a desire for the hundreds of millions of dollars in aid the United States offered, or that they feel shame because Koreans were killing and being killed in a land in which they had no place. Some complain, too, that the Government has still not told the whole story of South Korea's role in the war helping the United States support South Vietnam's fight against the Communist North. 4,687 Koreans Reported Killed **********According to the Defense Ministry, 4,687 Koreans were killed in the war, and more than 5,000 others wounded, but some veterans insist that the casualty figure is much higher, based on the death tolls in their own units. Also unexplored are reports of the particularly brutal methods the Korean soldiers were said to have used. **********For the veterans, much of the focus now is on demands for greater Government assistance, which they say has been in meager. One particular complaint is that the Government neither recognizes nor offers treatment for problems related to Agent Orange, the powerful chemical used to kill dense jungle foliage during the war. The chemical is believed to have caused an array of health problems for some of the soldiers exposed to it. **********Studies in the West have been unable to turn up clear evidence of ill effects, except for a temporary skin condition, called chloracne, and small increases in rates of a kind of cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma. As a result, even American veterans have been fighting with their Veteran Affairs Department, which limits the claims that it will pay. American veterans groups, like their Korean counterparts, continue to protest this policy. **********American veterans, along with some Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders, are eligible, however, for compensation from the manufacturers of Agent Orange. Korean soldiers were not part of a 1984 court decision establishing the fund to make these payments. And the Korean Government says it will not assist them in efforts to qualify for the compensation. **********Kim Young O, a director of the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, said the Government had no programs to treat veterans claiming problems from exposure to Agent Orange because no illnesses have been detected.  Economic Benefits From War **********The war provided tremendous economic benefits for South Korea, but it was a political inconvenience. In the 1960's, South Korea had barely recovered from war and was still one of the poorest nations in Asia. **********The Vietnam War provided what were by Korean standards generous salaries for soldiers. The Government also received huge amounts of aid, which helped catapult South Korea into its status as a newly industrialized country. **********But politically South Korea was not ready to permit open debate on a war said to represent a battle between freedom and Communism, particularly when South Koreans were struggling for freedom against their unelected, military-dominated Government. **********That, of course, has now changed. The first open presidential election was held five years ago, and in elections for the National Assembly last month the voters denied the governing party a majority. Two Movies to Cost Millions **********The two multimillion-dollar Vietnam movies, one being made for the cinema and the other to be serialized on television, along with several new books depict a grim, dispiriting war. **********One of the new movies, ""White Badge,"" is based on a novel whose serialization in a magazine in 1983 caused the publication to be closed. **********""Members of the younger generation do not even know that Koreans served in Vietnam,"" said Ahn Jungyo, a veteran and the author of the book, which depicts the horrors suffered by one group of soldiers. ""Nobody talked about it. What the Government has done is a kind of mass cheating of the people."" **********""White Badge"" will cost $2.6 million, a high figure for the Korean movie industry, and was filmed partly in Vietnam. The film being made for television, whose preliminary title is ""Farewell to Songba River,"" also cost $2.6 million. This movie is described as a look at the relationship between two young soldiers as they come of age. **********One of the soldiers in ""White Badge"" ponders: ""The blood money we had to earn at the price of our lives fueled the modernization and development of the country. And owing to our contribution, the Republic of Korea, or at least a higher echelon of it, made a gigantic stride into the world market. Lives for sale. National mercenaries."""

A Lack of Spending Programs **********But Peru's problems are not only those of having too much money in the bank and not enough in the economy. **********Executives here say the Government admits that it will be hard pressed to figure out how to spend the money any time soon, mainly because of a lack of management expertise to develop and administer spending programs. This suggests that at a time when the country needs large resources of investment to deal with unemployment and underemployment estimated at a combined 90 percent of the work force, relief will be slow in coming. **********The Peruvian experience is a lesson for many governments in the region about the costs and the benefits of coping with deficits and inflation, moving to a freer market economy, getting the government out of business and opening borders to foreign competition and investment. **********Almost every Latin American country has embraced some form of open-market economic model. The results have been surprising. Inflation has dropped considerably and growth has begun again for the first time in years. But the social costs have been high. In reining in government spending, thousands of government workers are usually laid off, social spending programs are deeply cut and competition suddenly springs up from abroad so that businesses that are uncompetitive often close, creating more joblessness. **********The hope is that after a short period, the industrial sector that survives will be reinvigorated and begin creating jobs. Recuperation Appears Difficult **********It is a delicate balance that Peru so far has seemed unable to manage. Most of its small mining companies, for example, have come to a halt. Only three large concerns are making money, according to the National Confederation of Private Enterprises, Confief. Ninety percent of textile exporters have closed. And many businesses are now having to sell money-producing assets to pay bills. **********""For most businesses, it is like trying to teach your horse to live without eating, but by the time he learns, he may be dead,"" said Juan Antonio Aguirre Roca, president of Confief. ""After you have broken down a company, it is much harder to recuperate and bring it back to life."" **********In addition, a combination of sabotage by Shining Path guerrillas and a yearlong drought has devastated the country's energy production capacity. Factories now have to operate with 40 percent less energy, and researchers expect energy shortages for a decade, further restricting the potential for economic growth. **********Through the end of July, economic activity plunged almost 6 percent from July 1991. Manufacturing was off 15 percent and retail sales were down 12 percent. The talk here now is that even though inflation was two million percent during the tenure of President Alan Garcia Perez, growth was higher than it is today. **********All this has meant that the Minister of Economy and Finance, Carlos Bolona, has come under intense fire. The Oxford-educated economist is considered one of the brightest analysts in Peru and one of its few Government officials capable of negotiating the nation's return to the international financial markets. He has tried to jump-start the economy by promising a series of tax cuts and new credits to banks, but few here expect quick results. **********Mr. Bolona is known for his fierce determination to push through his economic policies. Acquaintances say that was one reason he decided not to resign after the seizure of near-dictatorial powers by President Fujimori in April.  Admirer of Rightist Economist **********""He wants to be known as the man who modernized the Peruvian economy,"" Mr. Castagnola said. **********The economy minister is also a fan of Hernan Buchi, the architect of the free-market economy created in Chile under the 17-year military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Bolona has hired Mr. Buchi has an adviser. **********Mr. Bolona has recently been lobbying the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for new loans that have been held up since Mr. Fujimori's seizure of power. **********""Bolona made some real mistakes, mainly in not anticipating the effects that some of his adjustment policies would have after the Fujimori coup,"" said Julio Velarde, an economist with the University of the Pacific and former member of the Peruvian central bank. ""In this contraction we have lost $4 billion in national income, more than all the foreign economic help we will get for the next 10 years."" **********Public opinion has not swung against President Fujimori for two principal reasons: the poor worry more about inflation than economic growth, and the capture of the Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman Reynoso has given Mr. Fujimori a big gain in popularity. Terrorism has been considered the nation's No. 1 problem. **********Mr. Bolona has begun a privatization program of more than 200 state-owned companies, which were losing $2.5 billion a year. He has brought inflation down from 7,650 percent in 1990 to about 50 percent this year. And during his tenure the Peuvian central bank has built reserves of almost $2 billion. At the same time, he has imposed an estimated $300 million in new taxes. **********""He exaggerated the need for adjustment,"" said Jorge Picasso Salinas, president of the Banco Latino in Lima. ""He is playing the role of the Minister of Finance, making sure all the purse strings are tight, but not that of Minister of the Economy, worrying about the health of the economy."""

No problem. Just book 45 days in advance, stay over one Tuesday that is not a legal holiday anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere and complete travel in a month with fewer than 29 days. . . . **********American Airlines' bold move to simplify fares and slash the margins between discounted and unrestricted seats is winning applause from both business travelers and computer-bleary travel agents. But their enthusiasm may be tempered by the prospect of less competition and higher prices in the future. **********For in the view of some analysts -- notably, Michael Levine, the former president of New York Airways who is now dean of Yale's School of Organization and Management -- it could give American a commanding edge over weaker rivals. And it will almost certainly unhinge the survival strategies of the very weakest, perhaps pushing Continental and T.W.A. past the point of no return. **********Like it or not, most airlines have followed American's move from 16 or 17 fares per route to four. Fares for unrestricted seats in both the front and back of the plane have been cut sharply -- one-way coach from New York to Chicago, for example, is down from $427 to $250. And the hodgepodge of discounts has been rationalized to just two advance purchase options with obligatory Saturday stayovers. **********The biggest winners are the minority of business travelers who cannot plan ahead, but lack the muscle to negotiate special deals with individual carriers. The changes should also eliminate some headaches for the airlines, which have been losing the battle to make posted prices stick. **********With unrestricted coach fares down 38 percent, Daniel Kasper, an airline consultant at the Harbridge House firm in Massachusetts, predicts that few corporate buyers will bother to press for better deals. And few penny-pinching business travelers will bother to play games with restricted fares -- evading the Saturday stayover rule, for example, by purchasing two deeply discounted round trips and tearing up the return portions. **********There is a darker side, though, to what is widely viewed as a strategic coup by Robert L. Crandall, the hard-driving chief executive of American who has exploited the airline's size and technological edge with the finesse of a sumo champion. By eliminating incentives for corporate discounts, virtually all bookings should end up at posted fares. And Michael Levine argues that ""American does best when all the cards are played face up."" **********The giant carrier owns Sabre, the most successful of the computerized airline reservation systems. It will thus reap a modest windfall from writing more tickets for other carriers. Then, too, the cut in off-computer bookings and the simplification of the fare structure will make it almost impossible for other carriers to undercut American's fares without being discovered. **********But these are marginal considerations, Mr. Levine suggests, compared with the blunter competitive effects of the new pricing formula. Mr. Crandall acknowledges that American will take an initial hit on revenues from the dilution of fares. But what is merely painful for American and its deep-pockets rivals, Delta Air Lines and United, could prove crippling to financially pressed Northwest and USAir. And it is likely to put both T.W.A. and Continental in the intensive care unit. **********The consequences for these latter two carriers, Mr. Levine argues, may be even more dire than they initially appear. For both have been using pricing strategies that exploited travelers' frustrations with sky-high unrestricted fares. **********T.W.A. has been luring passengers who lacked access to corporate discounts by selling unrestricted tickets at steep discounts to full fare. Continental has played a variation on the same game, seating those who paid full-fare coach in the first-class compartment. T.W.A. has already responded to the American initiative by cutting unrestricted fares yet again, further diluting potential revenues. And Continental is between a rock and a hard place: First class at the competitive coach rate now means far less income for the beleagured carrier. **********How one stands on the fare changes largely depends on where one sits. Mr. Crandall makes no secret of his disgust with a bankruptcy system that forces American to compete with deeply indebted airlines that need not make interest payments to keep on flying. He believes that the technology and economics of the business leave room for only three healthy airlines operating nationwide -- a scenario that would ground Northwest and USAir, as well as Continental or T.W.A. **********Effective price competition on virtually all routes may still be possible with just three or four mega-carriers. But it remains a scary scenario for deregulation-minded economists, who always assumed that competition would be guarded by the relative ease of entry into the airline industry."

The conflict has smashed the foundations of the federation of six republics that had arisen under Communist rule at the end of World War II. Bosnia and Herzegovina announced its independence last month and the European Community tendered formal recognition on Monday. Split in 5 Parts **********This means that on the territory of what once was the six-republic nation of Yugoslavia, there now are five separate entities. These are the three independent countries, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina; the remnants of the Yugoslav state, made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro; and the secessionist republic of Macedonia. **********The independence of Macedonia has not yet been officially recognized by the European Community or the United States out of deference to Greece, which already has a region named Macedonia and is concerned that an independent Macedonia would make claims to Greek territory. **********The Administration action was intended to bring United States policy into line with that of the European Community. The community recognized Croatia and Slovenia in January. Vance Mediation Effort **********The United States held back then because the United Nations envoy, Cyrus R. Vance, a former secretary of State, was engaged in negotiations to end the fighting in the region and senior United States officials believed American recognition might set back the chances for the United Nations to arrange a solution. A United Nations peacekeeping force has now been approved and initial forces have arrived in Croatia to take up positions between Serbs and Croats. **********The Bush statement issued by the White House said the United States would also ""work intensively"" with the European Community toward concurrent recognition of Macedonia. Joint recognition of Macedonia is not expected before early May, in the hope that Greece and the Macedonian secessionists will be able to negotiate their differences. **********In addition it said the Administration would discuss with Serbia and Montenegro their plans to remain together ""in a common state known as Yugoslavia."" **********The Bush statement underscored the Administration's intent, in recognizing the three republics, to promote the United Nations effort, and to help negotiations among the warring parties that are continuing under the auspices of the European Community.  U.S. Voices 'Some Concern' **********But the statement took no note of the clashes in recent days in Bosnia and Herzegovina pitting ethnic Serbs against Croats and Mulsim Slavs that have left scores dead in that republic. A White House spokeswoman said in response to a question that ""there has been some concern"" about the latest fighting. **********The Administration said that in recognizing the three republics that have been the scenes of the fiercest battles of the civil war, the United States ""accepts the pre-crisis republic borders as the legitimate international borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia."" **********This obliquely referred to the desire expressed last year by both Serbia and Croatia to alter the borders of their republics and at some point, to divide up Bosnia and Herzegovina between them. The fighting by Croatian and Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina appears to be aimed at carving out enclaves of Serbs and of Croats in that republic.  Lifting of Sanctions **********The Bush statement said that as a result of American recognition, the Administration would lift sanctions against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. The sanctions, involving both economic aid and trade benefits, were applied to all of Yugoslavia last December. **********The Administration said these sanctions would be lifted from Serbia and Montenegro as soon as those two republics ceased blockading commerce with Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********On a day when the House Foreign Affairs Committee drafted a resolution pressing for United States recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, the Administration took pains to explain its rationale for delaying such action.  Baker Opposed Secession **********A year ago, when Slovenia and Croatia were threatening to secede, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d strongly urged against such a move and sought to hold together the Yugoslav federation. And Washington fruitlessly sought to delay the European Community recognition when it was pushed by Germany at the end of last year and accomplished in January. **********Judy Smith, the White House spokeswoman, said, ""The reason why we did it was because now we feel that it can contribute to the peace process."" Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, pointed out that Mr. Vance had warned repeatedly against ""moving precipitously,"" and noted: ""We took very seriously what the former Secretary of State said."" **********At the White House, a senior official said, ""We have felt that for the United States to have proceeded with selective recognition -- that is, of Croatia or Slovenia -- before now would not have served the purpose of containing and ending the conflict."" U.S. Indifference Denied **********The official rejected suggestions that the United States had distanced itself from the Yugoslav conflict or remained relatively indifferent to it. ""We did not simply wait,"" he said. ""We took advantage of the continued influence that we did have,"" particularly with regard to the intensified combat in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********He said that after a referendum on March 1 endorsed independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Administration had pressed the European Community to recognize the sovereignty of the government in Sarajevo, saying, "" 'We think that it's critical that you move with us with regard to Bosnia, because if we don't, we may have stopped a war in one location, we may now see a war, perhaps an even worse war, in the other.' So, we think we've accomplished that as well."" **********The official said it was not yet clear whether the United States would accept the proposal of Serbia and Montenegro to be regarded as ""Yugoslavia."" He said that would depend on ""questions like the disposition of assets, diplomatic representation and, as important as anything, the conduct of Belgrade and its policies and the Yugoslav National Army."""

Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said the Pentagon will send a force to Somalia sufficient to ""dominate"" the famine regions of the eastern African nation and deter armed clans from challenging the Americans. Some Government specialists on the region say that the relief effort is long overdue and will not be actively resisted. **********Mr. Hempstone's warning was sent in a cable to Frank G. Wisner, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs. The cable, in which the envoy refers to the ""Somalia Tarbaby,"" Administration officials said, has circulated widely within the Pentagon and the State Department. **********He makes two basic points, officials who have read the message said. One is that the Somali clans are tougher and meaner than Washington thinks and will harass the American troops and inflict casualties. Secondly, he argues, the operation does not serve Washington's vital interests. **********""Somalis, as the Italians and British discovered to their discomfiture, are natural-born guerrillas,"" Mr. Hempstone said, according to an excerpt from the cable that is being published by U.S. News & World Report in its coming issue. ""They will mine the roads. They will lay ambushes. They will launch hit-and-run attacks. They will not be able to stop the convoys from getting through. But they will inflict -- and take -- casualties. Aside from the humanitarian issue -- which admittedly is compelling (but so is it in Sudan) -- I fail to see where any vital U.S. interest is involved."". **********An Administration expert on the region, who asked not to be identified, disputed Mr. Hempstone's suggestion that the Somalis might engage in guerrilla-warfare tactics against the Americans, though he agreed that it would be difficult to disarm the clans. ""The warlords will fade away and wait us out,"" the official said. ""Then when we leave, they will go back and the burden will fall on the U.N. peacekeepers."" **********Mr. Hempstone was executive editor of the right-wing Washington Times before President Bush appointed him to the Kenya post in 1989. He has a freewheeling approach compared to that of career diplomats, and has stirred controversy by his aggressive tactics in pressing Kenya to institute multi-party democracy. **********Appropos, perhaps of his ""tarbaby"" reference in the Somali crisis, he has also stirred accusations of racial insensitivity. A voluble critic in Kenya of the Government of President Daniel arap Moi, charging it with corruption and disregard for human rights, he ran into strong hostility a year ago from members of Mr. Moi's party, who asked that he be replaced. Foreign Minister Wilson Ndolo Ayah called Mr. Hempstone a racist, charging that had ""contempt for Africans"" and the attitude of a ""slave owner."" **********The Ambassador replied: ""I don't know if supporting human rights and multi-party democracy makes me a racist or not. But it's a little hard when both sides of the equation are black."" **********The State Department defended him as the President's representative. **********As Somalia policy is debated, the deployment moves forward. Today, the Central Command dispatched three ships from Diego Garcia with vehicles, fuel and water for the marines."

But two years of back-room haggling, filibuster threats, and skirmishes between the oil and auto industries and environmental groups gradually pruned the bill to a shadow of its former self. **********By the time the House and Senate passed similar versions earlier this year, the two most far-reaching provisions -- to permit oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to bolster automobile fuel efficiency -- were spiked. Effects of Legislation **********Nevertheless, as elements of the bill are phased in over the next few years, motorists will be more likely to drive cars fueled by natural gas or methane, home buyers will receive lower interest rates on mortgages for better insulated homes, and businessmen eventually could become more willing to take a chance on investing in new nuclear power plants because of a streamlining in licensing rules. **********While few in the Congress or the Administration are enthusiastic about the legislation, both Republicans and Democrats have said they wanted to prove they could accomplish something before the Congressional session ended. **********""We can't leave and leave the work of the nation undone,"" said Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and a principal author of the bill. **********""We are very pleased with and fully support the progress made by the conferees in moving that much closer to final passage of the energy bill,"" said Laura Melillo, a White House spokeswoman.  The most far-reaching provision would revamp 1935 utility regulations, increasing competition between utilities in generating power and removing restrictions on smaller power companies from using power lines controlled by larger utilities. **********Leon Lowery, a lobbyist for Environmental Action, said the measure would ""mean the profit margin for electric generation is lower and that means that conservation and efficiency will look better to utilities as investments."" **********The measure also authorizes the Energy Department to provide financing to banks to offer lower interest rates for investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. **********In a 12-hour conference session that ended early today as the bill was approved, the pruning continued as Mr. Johnston and Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the leading House member of the conference, deleted or watered down provisions that hurt industries in their states. **********Concerned about the impact on the auto industry, Mr. Dingell weakened a requirement that Government and private vehicle fleets purchase more cars, trucks and buses that run on alternative fuels by requiring a finding by the Secretary of Energy that fuels such as methane or ethanol are available at low prices. **********Mr. Johnston insisted that a measure intended to restrict the ability of natural gas producing states from controlling prices be stricken, and replaced by a nonbinding ""sense of the Congress"" line calling for competitive natural gas pricing. Environmental Groups' Reaction **********Environmental groups had generally expressed cautious support of the legislation until today. But they sharply denounced many changes bargained by the conferees, including the last-minute inclusion of a restriction on the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for radiation exposure at the proposed radioactive waste dump site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. **********Nevada's two Democratic Senators, Richard H. Bryan and Harry M. Reid, said they would use procedural delays to force Senate leaders to delete the Yucca Mountain provision, and kill the entire bill if they fail. They could be joined by Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, who is concerned the bill will open the way to drilling in environmentally sensitive offshore areas of his state. **********The Administration successfully lobbied to delete a section containing a moratorium on oil drilling off much of the outer continental shelf and enabling the government to purchase back leases off the Florida, North Carolina and Alaska coasts."

After the second mortar blast, 40 minutes before the burials were to have taken place, gravediggers at the cemetery hastily loaded the two coffins into the grave and shoveled earth atop them, all before the main body of mourners had arrived. **********Half an hour later, Vera Zoric, the 51-year-old director of the Ljubica Ivezic orphanage that had been home to the two children, arrived beside the graves with 20 orphans, many of them bearing sprigs of flowers. The confusion when they discovered that the burials had already taken place turned to hysteria as a second volley of mortars struck across the road from the cemetery. **********Shouts of ""Run! run!"" and ""Get away!"" carried across the cemetery as smoke from the mortars curled into the morning air. Sarajevo Airport Closed **********Dropping their flowers as they ran, the orphans fled back to the vehicles that brought them, led by a sobbing Mrs. Zoric. The departure of the other mourners left only Mrs. Glavas, Vedrana's grandmother, and the child's mother, Svetlana, who is 20 years old, standing beside the grave, along with a group of Western reporters. It was then that the third volley of mortars struck. **********In the manner in which they devastated the Glavas family, the attacks on the bus and the cemetery were not greatly different from similar sequences that have struck many other Sarajevo families. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people have been reported killed in Sarajevo, and 10,000 wounded. The death toll increased by at least 25 today as the Serbian bombardments continued with an intensity that caused the local United Nations command to close the Sarajevo airport for three days, saying it wanted to reassess the safety of an airlift of food and medicine into the besieged city. **********Still, Mrs. Glavas's misery will be remembered better than most. Television cameras recorded today's attack, showing Mrs. Glavas and her daughter, Svetlana, whose mental impairment prevented her from raising the child, rushing toward the cemetery gate in terror from another mortar that struck moments earlier. **********Members of two news teams, from Reuters and the British Broadcasting Corporation, helped stanch the flow of blood from the wounded woman, assisted in carrying her from the cemetery, and drove her to the hospital. **********But what gave the incident a particular resonance was that it was part of a sequence of events that was bizarre and frightening even by the extreme standards set in the Sarajevo siege. At 7 P.M. on Saturday, a bus carrying 50 children between the ages of five months and three and a half years, all from the city's main orphanage, was struck by a hail of fire as it headed out of Sarajevo on the first leg of a journey to a Trappist monastery in Magdeburg, Germany, where the children had been offered sanctuary for the duration of the siege. 9 Orphans Taken Away **********The gunfire killed Vedrana Glavas and Roki Sulejmanovic, age 14 months. The surviving children, screaming in terror, were pulled to safety by troops manning a roadblock beneath a highway bridge nearby, and spent Saturday night in a concrete bunker beneath a suburban hotel. **********On Sunday, the journey resumed, but the bus had not gone a mile before it was halted at a Serbian roadblock, where nine of the children were pulled off the bus and separated from the others on the grounds that they were ethnic Serbs. That was in accordance with the policy that has motivated the Serbian offensives all across Bosnia, which holds that Serbs must be separated from the Muslims and Croats who constitute more than 60 percent of the republic's population and corralled in ""ethnically cleansed"" areas, accounting for two-thirds of Bosnia, where they can govern themselves. **********The remainder of the infants, along with several adults from the orphanage, made the 150-mile journey across the Bosnian mountains to Split, in Croatia, safely. From Split, they were flown on a chartered aircraft to Magdeburg today. **********In Sarajevo, orphanage officials said they had no news about the nine children taken off the bus, although Serbian officials have given assurances that the children are safe. Deliberate Attack **********Whether the mortars were fired at the cemetery deliberately or were an accident of the fighting that has been raging in the hills north of the cemetery since last week was impossible to determine. In Sarajevo, most people concluded that the attack was deliberate, and cited as evidence the fact that the mortar volleys around the cemetery began and ended within 40 minutes either side of the 10 A.M. time set for the burial of the two infants, which had been widely announced. **********An hour after the mortar volleys, a joint funeral for eight Muslim soldiers was completed without incident. But the 37-year-old Muslim hodza, or holy man, conducting the funeral, Suljo Cerimovic, said he was convinced that the burial had been deliberately targeted. **********""I've been coming to this cemetery almost every day for three months to conduct funerals, and almost every day there is a mortar attack on one or other of the burials, regardless of whether there is fighting in the hills or not,"" he said. **********From the outset of the siege, Serbian nationalist leaders have denied responsibility for attacks on civilians, saying that the ""Muslims,"" meaning the Muslim-led Bosnian Army defending Sarajevo, launches shelling and sniper attacks to discredit the Serbian forces. Today, Radovan Karadzic, the Serbian leader, renewed the assertion, saying that it was Government forces who fired at the cemetery. **********""The Muslims shoot at themselves, so that Serbs can be blamed,"" he said in an interview with Britain's Sky television network.                    --------------------       42 Orphans Reach Germany **********ZERBST, Germany, Aug. 4 (Reuters) -- Forty-two dazed and exhausted children from a Sarajevo orphanage reached safety here today after a grueling three-day trip during which two infants were killed by snipers. **********The children, many crying, flew into the Russian military base here from the Croatian city of Split, which they had reached after an arduous bus journey from the Bosnian capital. Some had cuts on their faces from splintered glass after snipers fired on their bus in Sarajevo' on Saturday. **********Five children were immediately sent to hospitals in the east German state of Saxony Anhalt. The rest will stay in children's homes."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/28/world/confirming-split-last-2-republics-proclaim-a-small-new-yugoslavia.html,John Burns,1992-04-28,,1030,,The New York Times,World,News,article,"Confirming Split, Last 2 Republics Proclaim a Small New Yugoslavia","Confirming Split, Last 2 Republics Proclaim a Small New Yugoslavia"," **********Serbia and Montenegro today proclaimed the establishment of a new, truncated Yugoslav nation shorn of the four republics that have seceded over the last 10 months. The move amounted to a confirmation of the breakup of the old Communist Yugoslavia and an implicit acceptance of the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its existing borders. **********The decision to proclaim a new Yugoslavia was rushed through in a subdued, almost regretful, ceremony of less than 10 minutes, reflecting the discomfort of people acting to accommodate demands from Europe and the United States. **********In finally acknowledging the demise of the Yugoslavia that had existed since 1946 and proclaiming a nation with less than half its area and with a population of 10.5 million compared with 23.5 million, the leaders of Serbia, dominant partners in the new nation, were effectively seeking to evade or forestall growing pressures for Serbia's international isolation. **********In the Constitution for the new Yugoslavia proclaimed today, its leaders declared the borders to be those of Serbia and Montenegro as they existed in the Communist Yugoslavia established by Tito after World War II. In an accompanying declaration, the leaders said the new nation, to be called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia like its Communist predecessor, ""has no territorial claims"" on neighboring republics. **********Diplomats said this amounted to a renunciation of the claim made in the past by Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, and by other Serbian nationalists that all Serbs in the old Yugoslavia had the right to be included in a single state that others called ""a Greater Serbia."" **********The significance of this appeared to extend not only to Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose 1.7 million Serbs are the largest Serbian group outside Serbia, but also to the three other republics that have seceded: Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia. Serbia fought a war on behalf of Croatia's 580,000 Serbs last year similar to the one in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********The pressures on Belgrade to give such assurances, led by the United States and the European Community, intensified last week after Serbia gave its backing to a military offensive in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Offensive Kills 200 **********The offensive, in which a dozen or so towns were captured, killed at least 200 people and forced tens of thousands of Muslim Slavs and Croats to leave their homes. It also raised fears that Serbia would eventually annex the captured territories or seek to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina by recognizing a separate Serbian republic there. **********The decisions announced here today created new optimism among the Muslim Slavs and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who approved the republic's independence in a vote eight weeks ago. The vote was boycotted by the republic's Serbs, who account for about 30 percent of the population. **********The proclamation of the new Yugoslav nation and its renunciation of territorial claims served as a signal for the new Government in Bosnia and Herzegovina to renew pressures for removing 10,000 Yugoslav Army troops who have been garrisoned there. **********Tonight, a statement from the Bosnia and Herzegovina presidency, issued on behalf of the Muslim Slav and Croatian leaders, formally demanded the withdrawal of the army from the republic, and said that those Yugoslav troops who wished to remain should join the republic's newly established territorial defense force. Another Cease-Fire Broken **********But the statement had hardly been read over the radio in Sarajevo, the capital, before Serbian forces in the suburb of Ilidza responded with a barrage of recoilless cannon and machine-gun fire that appeared to be the most serious breach yet of the cease-fire that was agreed between the rival forces last week. **********At the weekend, as part of its moves to ease Western pressures for its diplomatic isolation, Serbia dispatched the acting Yugoslav Defense Minister, Gen. Blagoje Adzic, to open negotiations on the army's presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim Slav who is the republic's President. But in a seeming effort to allay the concerns of the republic's Serbs, the army commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Col. Gen. Milutin Kukunjac, a Serb, told reporters in Sarajevo today that while the army might pull out of ""certain areas,"" it would remain in Bosnia as ""the army of the people who accept us."" This appeared to imply that the army would remain in areas of Serbian population. **********The declaration accompanying the new Constitution included other gestures toward Western governments, among them a pledge that the new nation would abide by the principle of ""not using force to settle open questions."" **********The declaration also said that Yugoslavia, in its new form, would be a democracy based on respect for human rights and on the principles of a ""market economy."" Further, it pledged to negotiate with the four breakaway republics on all ""open questions,"" including the division of the old Yugoslavia's assets, through the European Community's Conference on Yugoslavia. **********Many Serbs who attended today's ceremony at the copper-domed parliament building were subdued, and their spirits seemed unimproved by efforts to foster a spirit of celebration. Few joined in when a choir of women in white robes sang ""Hey Slavs!"" the anthem of the old Yugoslavia and of the new one, and only a small crowd gathered outside to watch the raising of the new flag, the same tricolor of red, white and blue that was flown by Communist Yugoslavia, minus the red star at the center. **********Some of those present saw the new nation as a poor relation to the two previous ones: the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which lasted from 1918 until the Nazi invasion in 1941, and Tito's republic, which covered 98,765 square miles, more than double the 39,380 square miles of the new state. **********""I was born in one Yugoslavia, grew up in another, and now I'm a citizen of a third, and it is the smallest of the three,"" a woman said at the ceremony."

Three Somalis were arrested by marines who said the men had shot at them. **********About 60 reporters were ordered to lie face down on the dock for 15 minutes by marines who reinforced the order by firing over the journalists' heads. The marines apparently were annoyed to find them there.  Somali Gunmen Not Evident **********The armed vehicles that usually patrol the port had left by the time the marines arrived, but others filled with gunmen careered around town. **********Cobra anti-tank helicopters hovered over the port area as the marines landed, apparently in anticipation of trouble from the gunmen in armed vehicles who have controlled the port and prevented most relief supplies from getting to the needy. Up to 80 percent of the food at the port has been looted, relief officials estimate. **********Sgt. Joseph Rossi, from the First Marine Expeditionary Force in Camp Pendleton, Calif., said: ""We're here for relief, but we'll do whatever it takes to protect my men and my mission."" Somalis Are 'Very, Very Happy' **********As he collected several AK-47's and a sub-machine gun found at the port, Sergeant Rossi said that if Somalis raise their weapons, ""We consider it assault."" **********But when it became clear to all that the Americans were in town and there would be no immediate resistance, many Somalis were quite emotional. **********Aden Usman Haj told one American reporter: ""We are very, very happy. Now for once there will be no more gunfire, now we can sleep. I am so happy, I am losing my little English."" At the Shamo guest house, Abcar Amin Mohammed, watching the helicopters in the pink dawn sky, said: ""Today is a new day in Somalia. All Somalis are happy."" **********The operation began early this morning when three teams of Navy Seals, their faces painted with green camouflage make-up and their backs loaded with equipment, waded unopposed onto a muggy Indian Ocean beach under a full moon. **********The first six men who emerged from the low surf were greeted not by armed Somalis but by an American news photographer, one of scores camped out on the beach near the Mogadishu airport. **********""No flash,"" said one of the Seals, apparently worried about night blindness, after the photographer took a picture. ""Stay away from us."" Welcome to Mogadishu **********But as more Seals arrived in black rubber dinghies, more flashes and lights popped from a crowd of photographers and television crews, until the three dozen sailors were hemmed in on the bushy sand dunes by journalists covering an event that began to look like a movie set. **********Several Pakistani soldiers from the 500-man United Nations contingent in Somalia arrived to welcome the Seals with handshakes. **********By 6:30, in bright sunshine, hundreds of curious Somalis, many with smiles, lined the streets around the port and airport, watching the helicopters swoop by. Others clambered onto rooftops and hung out of windows to watch a show of strength that made the armed men of Mogadishu seem insignificant. 28,000 Troops Coming In<HE **********The marines had been offshore for several days on a three-ship amphibious assault unit and backed by a Navy battle group, led by the aircraft carrier Ranger, with 60 warplanes. **********In all more than 28,000 American troops are to take part in the United Nations-approved operation, which will include troops of at least 10 other countries, according to the Pentagon. France announced that some of the 2,000 French troops taking part would fly into Mogadishu today from their base in neighboring Djibouti. **********The mission, initiated by President Bush, is intended to establish a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian aid. About 1.5 million Somalis are still considered to be at risk of starvation. Laying the Groundwork **********On Friday, when President Bush announced the operation, he said the troops would leave within a few weeks, but Pentagon officials said that given the complex logistics of operating in a barren country, it might take much longer. **********The military operation was unusual even before it began. **********Instead of cloaking the troops' arrival in secrecy, Washington sent officials here a day in advance to explain the mission and to give an approximate time of the landing. **********This was done, officials said, to win as much cooperation as possible from the two main factions in the Mogadishu area and to encourage them to clear the town of the gunmen who have obstructed the delivery of foreign aid. **********Robert B. Oakley, appointed as a special envoy by President Bush, traveled to both sides of the divided capital on Tuesday to meet Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, who controls the port, the airport and the southern part of the city, and Mohammed Ali Mahdi, who presides over the northern part. Backed by Clan Leaders **********At a news conference, Mr. Oakley described both men as ""positive"" about the operation, but warned: ""We will see what happens on the ground. That's the only way to test it."" **********He added that both men had given assurances that there would be no ""deliberate"" attempt to provoke trouble or put up resistance. **********Mr. Oakley, an Ambassador to Somalia in the early 1980's, said the leaders had acknowledged that they did not totally control the roving gunmen. **********Gen. Frank Libutti of the Marine Corps, military adviser to Mr. Oakley, said that if the troops met resistance they would ""take appropriate action and will do what they have to do."" But he said the main objective was not to ""flex military muscle."" **********At nightfall Tuesday, General Aidid went on the radio to advise his fighters to stay at least a kilometer (1,100 yards) from the airport and port. **********Somalis who listened to the broadcast said that the general's tone was unusually upbeat and that he encouraged Somalis to welcome the American forces as ""friends."" **********As Somalis went about this morning, some AK-47 rifles were piled up in the back seats of cars in anticipation of being collected by the United States troops.  'Plain Sailing' **********Even before the Americans arrived, the mood on the street was one of excitement. Some armed vehicles used by the gunmen fired antiaircraft rounds into the air for no apparent reason than to show off. **********""A farewell to arms,"" said Ahmed Jama, a former head of the national police force, as a volley of shots rattled around his house at twilight Tuesday. ""It will be plain sailing, although you can't exclude some incidents."" **********Many people said they were looking forward to having a gun-free environment. ""We don't want to have the guns,"" said Yusuf Gele Ugaas, a driver who had three teen-age gunmen in the back of his pickup. ""We have them only because of the circumstances. We need to protect our cars from others. When we have peace, we will sell our guns."" **********The United States has given some $200 million in assistance to Somalia through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations since the clan-based civil war broke out here in 1991. The war, and to a lesser extent drought, caused a famine that is estimated to have killed 300,000 people in the past year. **********One of the reasons for the high death rates was the diversion of aid by gunmen and merchants who hired them to loot relief convoys. **********In the first attempt to protect the aid convoys, 500 Pakistani troops were dispatched to Mogadishu in October by the United Nations to secure the airport and port. But the Pakistanis, inhibited by military regulations that did not allow the troops to shoot until shot at, were outmaneuvered by the armed clan factions and their leaders. Only 100 Pakistanis were deployed.                    --------------------       Bush Is 'Pleased' **********WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (AP) -- After the first United States forces landed at Mogadishu, the White House issued a statement saying, ""President Bush is pleased by the success."" **********National Security advisers gathered at the White House to monitor developments, and Mr. Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the President had talked by telephone with his envoy, Robert B. Oakley."

His remarks wiped out what had been a positive early response in the credit markets to President Bush's State of the Union address and a preliminary report from the Commerce Department showing that the economy expanded only three-tenths of a percent during the final quarter of 1991. **********Ever the cautious economist, Mr. Greenspan went out of his way to note the economy's unusual condition made predictions difficult. At the moment, he said, the Fed is doing more watching than forecasting.  'A Silly Reason to Sell' **********Nevertheless, ""there is a general sense that the Fed is done easing policy for now,"" a government bond trader said. ""That is a silly reason to sell securities, because that notion was already in the market. At this point, I think that prices are cheap."" **********Mr. Greenspan has made many of the same comments before, and some analysts acknowledged that they were a bit mystified at the market's severe reaction. **********""Market reaction to Greenspan's testimony has been enormously overblown,"" economists at MMS International noted in their daily market commentary. **********""We would argue that his remarks are merely supportive of the view that the Fed is on hold near term,"" they said, ""but that the potential for further easing down the road still exists if economic data continue to depict a stagnant economy.""  Losses Exceed a Full Point **********The selloff in the bond market, which amounted to more than a full point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, was even more surprising in light of the Commerce Department's report on the weak economy. **********The three-tenths of a percent rise in gross domestic product was about in line with Wall Street's expectations. But the report also noted that inflation in the fourth quarter rose by just 1.7 percent, a full percentage point below expectations. This was the lowest quarterly increase in 25 years. **********Most economists said the modest economic package proposed by President Bush on Tuesday night should have placated credit market participants, assuming Congress does not try to increase its size significantly. And the early reaction to the speech was positive, as prices moved higher during overnight trading in Asia. **********But some analysts speculated that good feeling about the proposals may have evaporated later, after the Administration's 1993 budget was released.  'Pretty Ugly Stuff' **********""The budget is pretty ugly stuff,"" said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research on developments in the foreign-exchange and fixed-income markets. **********After doing the math, Mr. McCarthy said the Administration's projected deficit of just under $400 billion made it likely that Treasury borrowings in the July-September quarter, the last of the Government's fiscal year, could be as high as $184 billion. **********""We are talking about such enormous numbers that it is a bit mind-boggling,"" he said. ""And since the President has been outmaneuvered in previous budget negotiations, it seems safe to assume the deficit will be even larger than projected.""  Notes and Bonds Plunge **********The bulk of the day's selloff was concentrated among longer-term notes and bonds. **********By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10230/32 , down just over a point, to yield 7.74 percent, compared with 7.66 percent late Tuesday. **********Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10126/32 , down 19/32 to yield 7.23 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9917/32 , down 3/32 , to yield 5.12 percent. **********Despite Mr. Greenspan's comments, short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.81 percent late yesterday, unchanged from late Tuesday. And six-month bill rates rose by just a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.90 percent. **********The big selloff in the Treasury securities market did not deter a number of large investment-grade corporate issuers from pricing enormous amounts of new issues. **********By far the largest deal was a three-part, $1.5 billion offering from Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the main bottler for the Coca-Cola Company. The issue consists of $750 million worth of 30-year bonds, $250 million worth of 20-year securities and $500 million of 10-year notes. **********The 8.50 percent 30-year bonds were priced at $98.83 to yield 8.61 percent, 89 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing. **********The 8.50 percent 20-year securities were priced at $100, or par, 78 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bond at the time of pricing. **********And the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were also priced at $100, 68 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.  Retiring Debt **********Proceeds from the sale will be used to retire higher-cost outstanding debt, including $550 million worth of high-yield securities issued by Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc., which Coca-Cola Enterprises acquired in December. **********Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. All three parts of the issue are rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********Elsewhere, the Ford Motor Credit Corporation offered $1 billion worth of securities backed by dealer receivables. The 6 7/8 percent five-year securities were priced at $99.281, to yield 7.05 percent, 80 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing. **********Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.  Tax-Exempt Issues **********A number of offerings were also priced in the tax-exempt municipal bond market. The largest offering was a sale of more than $550 million worth of securities for the State of Washington. **********The negotiated sale consists of serial bonds with yields from 3.30 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to 6.25 percent in 2006. **********Yields on term bonds range from 6.35 percent in 2011 to a maximum yield of 6.50 percent in 2014. **********Lehman Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities are rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's."

She is a war refugee who fled the destruction of her village nearly a year ago, and her greatest hope is to be able to return home and resume the hard life she lived for 60 years. **********""This place is like a prison to us,"" she said while sitting on a bench by the sea. ""We're used to planting crops and tending cattle, and now we are squeezed into hotel rooms. People treat us well here, but we are all very unhappy."" **********Of the nearly two million people who have been displaced by the year-old Balkan conflict, Croatia is supporting by far the largest number. There are 650,000 here, in a republic with a normal population of just 4.5 million.  Nation Under a Strain **********The refugee flood has put Croatia under great strain, and Government officials say they are nearing the limit of their ability to help. **********About one-quarter of the refugees in Croatia are living in hotels, with others in schools, military barracks, campgrounds, dormitories, sports halls, unused rail cars and prefabricated huts. More than 200,000 are staying with relatives, friends or acquaintances. **********As fighting intensifies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, refugees are continuing to pour into Croatia. Housing these refugees will be more difficult in winter since many of the places where they are now living are unprotected from the elements. **********""We are very afraid that our refugee problem may increase in the weeks ahead,"" said Josip Osterreizher, spokesman for Croatia's main refugee agency. ""People will say the Croatian Government is cruel, but we have no more capacity here. This means that Europe and the world could expect 300,000 to 400,000 refugees in the next few months, and we have seen that the world takes these refugees the way a sick person takes medicine -- only in very small teaspoons."" **********At a conference in Geneva in July, Western nations pledged $150 million in new aid for Balkan refugees, a large sum by international standards, but small in relation to the estimated $1 billion that Croatia will need to spend to support its population of refugees and displaced people over the next 12 months. **********The 600 refugees living at the Split Hotel have no prospect of returning home any time soon. Many are Muslims from a single Bosnian village, Vrlika, which was sacked by Serbs a year ago. **********""We walked across mountains to get here,"" said Stipe Mandaric, 43 years old, as he sat on a sofa in the bright hotel lobby. ""I had to carry my mother because she didn't want to leave even if it meant dying there. We have heard so many promises about going home that now I am beginning to lose hope."" **********""In my mind I am in this hotel only 5 percent of the time,"" he added. ""The rest of the time I am in my field."" 'They Stole Everything' **********Mr. Mandaric said patrols of Serbian irregulars, guided by local allies, found Muslim and Croatian families in Vrlika and expelled them under threat of death. He said Serbian families had since moved into their abandoned homes. **********""Still, according to what I could see, some of those people refused to participate,"" Mr. Mandaric reflected. ""If they would understand that it is not possible to throw people out of their homes, I think we could live together again."" **********Several younger refugees sitting nearby heatedly disagreed. **********""They are using our tractors at this moment, farming our land and sleeping in our beds,"" one said. ""They stole everything that we spent lifetimes building with our own hands. We can never go back to living side by side with them."" **********A few miles from the hotel, 1,300 refugees are living beside the Adriatic at what was formerly a trailer park and campgrounds. Some children venture into the azure water, but many of the adults brood quietly in front of tents provided by Italian and British donors. **********These refugees are recent arrivals, survivors of some of the most brutal atrocities perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their awful memories are still fresh, and many have chilling tales of severed arms and ears, summary executions by throat-slashing, and a river that flowed with human blood and disfigured bodies. Water From a Sewer **********""We spent four months hiding in a basement, without any electricity or contact with the outside world,"" said Camila Lendo, a refugee from Hrasnice, near the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. ""We got water from a sewer pipe. Altogether we lost 100 of our men."" **********Mrs. Lendo began to sob as she spoke and was comforted by her daughter. Among family members she lost before escaping in a speeding auto under sniper fire, she said, were her husband and her 87-year-old father. **********""It was our neighbors who killed our families,"" Mrs. Lendo repeated several times. ""They guided the artillery. This is what we can't understand. We lived together for so long and shared everything."" **********The intensity of ethnic hatred in the former Yugoslavia, currently most visible in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has led relief workers to wonder if it will ever be possible to resettle many of these refugees. **********Refugees living at Adriatic resorts like the Split Hotel, oddly incongruous among the European Community peace monitors and the bow-tied waiters who serve them, are among the lucky ones. Many others live huddled together in poor conditions, like 500 who are packed into what was once a dormitory for construction workers on the outskirts of Zagreb. **********At this camp, refugees say they are not abused, but live 10 or 12 to a room, without running water or medical attention, and are given just one meal a day. Many come from Kozmarac, a Bosnian village that was attacked in June. Some have declined offers of German visas because they want to remain together with their neighbors and eventually return to their village. **********""We cannot have our homes back because the homes were burned,"" said one of the refugees, a 58-year-old grandfather named Ramo Velic. ""But we would at least like to go back to the same place."" Some Return to Bosnia **********As Mr. Velic spoke, a truck pulled into the camp and several refugees climbed aboard with bags of possessions. The driver explained that he worked for a relief agency evacuating refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina and that as a side business he was taking refugees tired of exile back to Bosnia. He charged each of them the equivalent of $100. **********Why would anyone pay to travel from the relative safety of a Croatian camp back to war-torn Bosnia, especially after personally witnessing the savagery that is loose there? **********""We're going to a safer part of Bosnia, not where there is fighting,"" answered a young woman as she waited to depart. ""This man is not exploiting us. We are hoping he will take us to a place where we don't have to be refugees anymore."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/09/world/accord-reported-to-end-haiti-crisis.html,Howard French,1992-01-09,,740,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Accord Reported to End Haiti Crisis,Accord Reported to End Haiti Crisis," **********Diplomats seeking a negotiated settlement of Haiti's three-month political crisis say that the country's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has endorsed the nomination of a leading political rival as Prime Minister in a compromise arrangement that would eventually bring about his return from exile. **********Officials from the Organization of American States, which has sponsored negotiations for Father Aristide's return, said today that after two days of discussions with Haitian parliamentary leaders in Venezuela, the deposed President had accepted the nomination of Rene Theodore, one of two names put forward by the legislators, to be his Prime Minister. **********Mr. Theodore, a founder of the Haitian Unified Communist Party whom American diplomats have described as a ""moderate and urbane politician"" had recently been one of Father Aristide's leading critics, suggesting forcefully that the deposed President had repeatedly violated the Constitution and encouraged class violence in his nearly eight months in office. Overthrow of Aristide **********Father Aristide, a stirringly popular leftist priest who won 67 percent of the vote in Haiti's first democratic elections 13 months ago, was overthrown and forced into exile in Venezuela after a military coup last Sept. 30. **********Almost immediately after his overthrow, the Organization of American States moved to impose a hemisphere-wide commercial embargo on Haiti to force his restoration. Warning that a successful military coup in Haiti could destabilize fragile democracies throughout the region, the O.A.S. has consistently demanded Father Aristide's negotiated return to power. **********After today's announcement in Caracas that Father Aristide had accepted Mr. Theodore, the Colombian diplomat who has led the negotiations, Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, other O.A.S. officials and diplomats expressed cautious optimism that the agreement would soon lead to the establishment of a new government in Haiti and the lifting of economic sanctions. Preliminary Steps **********The details of Father Aristide's return, several diplomats said, was the subject of negotiations and, according to some, was unlikely to occur before several more months. These diplomats said that time was needed to restart a crippled economy, to iron out security arrangements for Father Aristide and to carry out major reforms of the Haitian police, army and judicial system under O.A.S. supervision. **********The diplomats said that although he had been proposed by conservative leaders of the National Assembly, Mr. Theodore, 51 years old and the leader of a small party that still carried the Communist label, had not conclusively gathered enough support among the entire Parliament, Haiti's conservative economic elite, and most important, the army, to assure that his nomination would be approved. Support of the Wealthy **********Before news of Mr. Theodore's selection began to circulate in the capital this afternoon, several Haitian legislators warned that support among the wealthy and the army for Father Aristide's return could only be assured if the deposed President were to endorse the nomination of Marc L. Bazin, the other candidate proposed by the legislators who traveled to Venezuela. **********Mr. Bazin is a conservative former World Bank official who placed a distant second in the 1990 elections won by Father Aristide. An O.A.S. official who asked not to be identified said that Father Aristide had rejected Mr. Bazin, in part, because of what he felt was the conservative politician's endorsement of the coup d'etat against him. **********Associates said that Mr. Theodore, who did not return several telephone calls, has been meeting with military and business leaders in recent weeks to reassure them and seek their support. **********In recent statements, Mr. Theodore has also stressed the importance of the private sector and called for more domestic and foreign investment. **********For years, a variety of underground political movements, some of them claiming Communism as their ideology led efforts to organize insurrections and invasions by small armed bands aimed at unseating the Duvalier family dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 29 years until its overthrow in 1986. **********In its early years, Mr. Theodore's Unified Haitian Communist Party, was recognized and actively supported by Moscow. It was largely composed of educated young people. **********The party suffered a major setback in 1969, the year it was formed, when many of its leading members were rounded up and killed. **********Mr. Theodore was on a mission to Budapest at the time, and eventually made his way to Paris. In 1978, he became the party's leader in exile. In the 1990 election the party did poorly, winning just three seats in Parliament."
https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/25/business/the-media-business-tv-commercials-chase-supermarket-shoppers.html,Eben Shapiro,1992-05-25,,1148,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,TV Commercials Chase Supermarket Shoppers,THE MEDIA BUSINESS; TV Commercials Chase Supermarket Shoppers," **********The National Enquirer is facing some serious competition at supermarket checkout counters, and not because a rival tabloid is displaying exclusive photos of Leona Helmsley modeling prison garb. **********Instead, the competition is coming from some of the biggest and most innovative operators in television broadcasting. **********In January, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. created the Checkout Channel, a network of supermarket television monitors that display snippets of news, fashion tips, weather reports and, of course, advertisements to shoppers waiting to pay for their groceries.  Similar Ventures **********NBC, ABC and Whittle Communications are exploring similar ventures. **********The reason for the increasing interest in what is called place-based or out-of-home media is straightforward. As a result of the proliferation of cable channels, prime-time network television no longer neatly delivers huge numbers of viewers for advertisers. In the jargon of media planners, the audience has become ""fragmented"" or ""fractionated."" **********The new ventures are an attempt to reach harried people as they go about their lives. Turner is also developing systems for airports and movie theaters. While similar ventures have been tried with little success since the early 1980's, this is the first time that a number of big companies are making a commitment to the area. **********For all the activity, the fledgling systems are still in far too few stores to deliver the large number of viewers that big advertisers want. **********""They've got to get close to 50 percent or 60 percent coverage before they are will be seriously considered at any real budget level by any national advertiser,"" said Bob Taber, a senior vice president of the Ally & Gargano ad agency. **********Also, in the handful of stores where monitors are in place, consumers do not appear to be paying very much attention. And with all the clutter in the marketplace, some advertising experts are skeptical that the new networks will be effective in gaining people's attention. **********Turner's Checkout Channel, which is further along than its rivals, is being beamed into only 134 stores around the country. But Turner executives plan to blanket the nation's supermarkets with their channel. The company hopes to be in 1,400 stores by the end of the year and in more than 3,000 stores by 1994. **********Steve Carter, vice president of sales for the Checkout Channel, estimated that with 3,000 stores, the channel would reach more people on a weekly basis than many of the highest-rated television shows. **********For its supermarket system, Turner places a monitor over each checkout aisle. Fashion tips are stressed during the day, while the emphasis shifts to stock prices and economic news in the evening. During important news events, the system occasionally switches to the Cable News Network. Interspersed are advertisements for consumer products like antiperspirants and coffee. Similar Optimism **********Executives working at the NBC venture are making similarly optimistic projections for their system, even though it is being tested in only a few stores. To get into a lot of stores quickly, NBC has joined forces with the Fleming Companies, the largest grocery wholesaler in the country. A third partner in the deal is On-Site Media. **********""If you have 4,000 or 5,000 supermarkets watching your network, you have the equivalent of the 'Cosby' show,"" said Lewis Solomon, the executive in charge of the NBC/Fleming venture. The company hopes to be in 7,500 stores in three years. **********In another test, ABC is broadcasting a sports highlights program in the sports clothing departments of more than 600 J. C. Penney stores. **********And Whittle Communications, which set up Channel One to transmit commercially sponsored news programs to schools, is planning to start or buy an in-store media company, probably by the end of the year. ""Supermarkets are the richest environment,"" since the commercials would reach consumers while they are ready to spend money, said Gerry Hogan, vice chairman of Whittle. **********In addition, the McDonald's Corporation is working with Turner to develop its own network for its restaurants. McDonald's is expected to begin testing a system this summer. **********Establishing these in-store systems is expensive, although companies have all declined to disclose how much they are spending. **********The supermarkets, however, get the systems at no cost. Turner provides the television monitors and the broadcast system that beams the shows into the stores. The supermarkets also collect a small percentage of Turner's advertising revenues. **********A. & P., for example, is testing the Checkout Channel in a few stores and has plans to expand to 20 more. Michael Rourke, a spokesman for A. & P., said shoppers seemed to like the system. **********The NBC/Fleming venture plans to scatter monitors throughout the store and not use sound. Instead of news, NBC will emphasize entertainment, along the lines of ""stupid pet tricks"" and sports bloopers. **********Despite the promoters' optimism, a number of advertising executives remain skeptical. For instance, Jayne Spittler, director of media research for the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, decided not to recommend the Checkout Channel to her clients. She said televisions in stores might end up being just one more thing that people ignore. ""The store is becoming awfully cluttered,"" she said. **********And some people believe that there are already too many televisions littering the landscape. The average American household watches seven and a half hours of television a day. **********""It's totally unnecessary and excessive,"" said Dorothy Swanson, president of the Viewers for Quality Television, a nonprofit group in Fairfield, Va. ""Enough is enough. People are turning into zombies as it is."" **********On a recent weekday, shoppers at a King Kullen supermarket in Bayshore, L.I., seemed oblivious to the 13 television monitors posted over each checkout stand. **********""I was busy cutting my coupons,"" said Cynthia Oliver, when asked why she was ignoring the television set, which was showing a commercial for Ex-Lax. **********A mother, shopping with her 2-year-old son, said in an annoyed tone: ""I can't be bothered with TV. I'm thinking of things I have to do."" **********Others were a bit more charitable. ""It's great, especially when you are standing on line for a long time,"" Emma Allen said. **********Still, Mrs. Allen could not remember any of the ads on the supermarket televisions. ""There's a Folger's ad, or another coffee,"" she tried gamely. ""You look at it, you go out and you forget about it."" **********Perhaps because of such responses, The National Enquirer is not overly concerned. ""It doesn't faze me at all,"" said Iain Calder, editor in chief of The Enquirer. In fact, he said, ""it might actually work for us"" by keeping people from reading through The Enquirer while waiting to pay for groceries. ""One of our problems is people have so much time that they read the thing and put it back,"" Mr. Calder said."
