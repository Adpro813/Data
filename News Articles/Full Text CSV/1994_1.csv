With police officers and little else on the streets, the United Nations' immediate neighborhood seemed like a science-fiction movie set in need of rubberized monsters and fleeing extras. **********The main commotion the President's visit stirred was blaring horns from chronic traffic jams, as side streets were nipped off for Presidential passage. Mr. Clinton's two-day visit ended last night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the protest pen erected by the police at 81st Street and Fifth Avenue was notably empty. The one street incident of the day occurred when a woman from Queens, carrying a machete and a knife, was arrested near the United Nations after she asked to see the President. **********""What's wrong with New Yorkers?"" asked Mary Duffy, a tourist from Lexington, Mass., who was only one of two -- count them, two -- people waiting forlornly at midday behind a blue police barricade down from the United Nations at East 49th Street and First Avenue, one of Mr. Clinton's prime motorcade turnings. ""In Boston there'd be mobs, hoping for a chance to wave. I'm heartsick."" **********The other half of Ms. Walsh's crowd volunteered an answer. ""Cynicism,"" said Gloria Hage, an apartment dweller on East 49th Street. She was so embarrassed by the sparsely attended streets, she said, that she came down to stand and wait, perchance to wave at the President or more likely spy her reflection in the smoked-glass windows of some statesman or other's passing limousine. **********""I'll tell you, it makes me cry,"" Ms. Hage told Ms. Duffy. ""But I've got to defend New Yorkers, too. Most of them are busy working their butts off right now, trying to survive,"" she said, estimating that New Yorkers tended more toward the film-at-11 sort of celebrity watching. **********""With onions,"" instructed Herb Selby, an East Side office worker, as he stood near a police barricade at East 49th Street and Third Avenue and watched Adel Wesa hurriedly build his luncheon shish-kebab sandwich at a sidewalk stand. **********""I work too hard,"" said Mr. Wesa, midway in his nine-hour day on East 49th Street, apologizing for watching his sizzling griddle more than the motorcades of dozens of visiting national leaders sporadically blinking and blaring past him between the United Nations and the Waldorf. ""I want to make life,"" he said, gesturing resolutely with his workday spatula. ""Too busy for politics."" **********Some city denizens were proud to claim a President sighting. ""He went by right here in a limo,"" said Matt Guice, who was manning a card table filled with protest pamphlets on East 42d Street, two blocks west of the United Nations. ""I'm not the sort to be metaphysically absurd, so I won't claim he actually saw me and my sign."" He brandished a placard that read: ""Welcome Bill, Bye Bye Brits"" -- a reference to a complex accusation that Mr. Clinton's Whitewater problem is entirely a fabrication of London intelligence agents. **********A more typical brush with the President was experienced by Susan Jaffe, a Manhattan lawyer barred by the police in the morning from stopping her car to drop off her daughter at Marymount School at Fifth Avenue and 84th Street. She resorted to swooping the second grader across a police barricade erected early across from the Metropolitan Museum, where the heads of state would be having an evening reception. ""It's really pathetic,"" Ms. Jaffe said at her return swoop past in the evening. She then learned that no one at the school had bothered to tell the girl that the President was in the city -- a good day's lesson in being blase in New York. **********Though out of sight, President Clinton was working hard, delivering 700 handshakes at the museum reception in a steady poolside lineup at the Temple of Dendur. ""I'm here out of respect for Egyptian culture,"" he told the gathering, ""not because I'm running for Pharaoh."" **********A few New Yorkers worked to mark the day as special, notably Rabbi Avi Weiss, head of the Coalition for Jewish Concerns, who sought to protest dramatically about a human-rights award being given to Argentine leaders. Rabbi Weiss was arrested as he clung to a brass banister near the award luncheon in the grand foyer of the Hotel Pierre at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street. ""That's part of New York -- equal-opportunity speech,"" said Millie Leet, a passing guest. **********Ken Gregory, describing himself as an 11-year-old political junkie, was among a handful of spectators who saw the President's motorcade rush up First Avenue and head the wrong way west on East 50th Street, thereby taking a virtual witness-free route between the United Nations and the Waldorf. ""It makes me feel I know somebody who's really a celebrity,"" the boy said after the President went by. **********His was a gentle voice. **********On all sides of the motorcade route, traffic came to a standstill for the passage and a great wail of blaring horns sounded from drivers who never saw Mr. Clinton pass. **********""Sometimes as a New Yorker you don't really need an excuse to be upset,"" said Detective Lynn O'Garrow of the police intelligence unit, standing watch amid the din near the Waldorf. ""But when you've got one and you can give it a name, well then, they have that opportunity to give their problems a name. They can say, 'Ah, that President.' "" **********Atop the United Nations, sharpshooters with binoculars watched the city, grateful for the light crowds. They were watched, in turn, by Ken Bukowski, a tourist from Green Bay, Wis., who could only train his own binoculars on the United Nations from across the street once he discovered there would be no tourists admitted this week. **********""I don't know, maybe we'll try the Empire State Building,"" said Mr. Bukowski, who seemed caught somewhere between blaming the city and world for his problem. **********A half-block down, Gregory McClendon, a homeless man, waited politely on the sidewalk, clinging to a pile of scrap cardboard and staring steadily at the United Nations. ""I know what's going on,"" he said, insisting that he needed to see the President and hoped he would stop his motorcade to lend an ear to this New Yorker's problem. **********""He's my tie to politics, you know,"" Mr. McClendon said."

The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index was up 2.05 points, to 735.19. **********An equally listless bond market, which ignored some favorable economic reports but not a higher commodities price index, helped depress trading. **********Moreover, a prediction by a prominent Fed watcher did not help. Wayne D. Angell, formerly a Federal Reserve Board governor and now chief economist at Bear, Stearns, said the central bank may raise interest rates at its July 5 policy-setting meeting. **********Many Wall Street traders had hoped for a moratorium on rate rises throughout the summer to help prompt a stock rally. Mr. Angell cited what he expected to be especially strong second-quarter economic growth. A fifth rise in interest rates this year would slow the economy and, possibly, the stock market. **********Whatever the case, many traders stayed on the sidelines yesterday. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled only 215.8 million shares, or nearly 30 percent below this year's average of 300 million shares. **********But much of May was similarly timorous. Only three sessions out of 21 exceeded 300 million shares in volume and all three followed the Fed's most recent increase in interest rates. There have been six straight sessions of below-average trading volume.  Several Bullish Indicators **********This tentativeness has kept the market from rallying, despite several bullish indicators. The ARMS index, for example, measures investor sentiment by the actual number of shares that are being bid up and down. The ARMS index has been bullish, below 1.0, nine times out of 13 sessions since May 12. **********Still, some stocks were trading heavily yesterday, with a few showing moderate swings in price. Blockbuster Entertainment, operator of the nation's largest chain of video stores, said its joint venture with I.B.M. would test-market a way of manufacturing video games from a huge in-store data base. **********Blockbuster stores, if the market test is successful, could thus have a virtually unlimited inventory of video games. Blockbuster shares rose 1 1/4, to 28 1/8. At 3.2 million shares, it was the second-most-active stock yesterday. **********Microsoft, the computer software company, was the most active stock, at 4.8 million shares. It rose 1 3/8, to 53 3/4. **********Long-term interest rates rose for the fifth session in a row. The yield on the benchmark 30-year treasury bond increased to 7.43 percent from 7.39 percent in the previous session. **********Bond yields rose in part because of a higher Commodity Research Bureau index, which tracks futures contracts for 21 commodities. But the index rose yesterday, as it has in the recent past, over concerns that dry weather may hurt supply in agricultural commodities. Leading the index were contracts for soybean meal, corn, and soybeans. Such commodities as lumber and oil rose modestly, and live cattle and pork bellies actually fell. **********And bond yields rose despite favorable economic reports from the Government and the private sector. The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence dropped in May, the first drop after three monthly gains. The Commerce Department reported that personal income rose in April by four-tenths of 1 percent, but spending fell one-tenth of 1 percent. Both reports indicated a lack of inflationary pressures. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.55 point, to 252.24, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 971 to 1,203. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.49 point, to 440.45."

It may be a turning point in the 46-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict, but Arabs tend to regard the treaty as an admission of an Arab defeat in a long struggle rather than an honorable end that deserves rejoicing. **********Unlike the anticipation that surrounded the Madrid peace talks of 1991, when hopes were high that a new era might be about to begin in the Middle East, the feeling this time is that an uneven peace treaty is taking shape in which Israel, and its strategic ally the United States, are reaping the fruits of a victory while Arabs are simply hitching themselves to an inevitable but not particularly rewarding venture. **********Throughout the region, including Israel, the sentiment is that this is an agreement between heads of states, not peoples; that it is more of an American party than a Middle East feast, and that these dramatic advances are in need of much nursing before they can usher in a new era. **********In Israel, where Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and senior figures in his Labor-led Government appear charmed by King Hussein and pleased with their success in prying open the doors of one Arab capital after another, the country seems to lack enthusiasm, still dwelling on the terrorist attacks that took nearly 30 lives in the last three weeks. **********Among Palestinians here, the reaction today to the peace accord, which provoked a widely observed general strike in Gaza and the West Bank, was uniformly hostile. **********Frustrated by the virtual freezing of their talks with Israel and the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, many Palestinians feel that the peace treaty they signed last year in Washington was used to reach out to other Arabs at their expense. **********The feeling of being discarded by both the United States and Israel is growing acute as Palestinians watch both nations court Arab governments from Morocco to Bahrain to Syria to join the ""normalization process"" being denied them. **********""We want to know where we fit in future agreements,"" said Faisal Husseini, a senior P.L.O. official in Jerusalem, echoing a feeling that was shared by many Palestinians interviewed today in the West Bank and Gaza. **********Particularly irritating is the increasing flirtation between Israel and Jordan over the status of East Jerusalem. East Jerusalem, which has a large Arab population, is in the minds of many Palestinians the future capital of what they hope will be an independent Palestinian state. **********But over the last few months, there have been repeated assertions by Israel, reflected in the peace accords signed with Jordan today, that the Islamic religious sites in Jerusalem should remain under the jurisdiction of King Hussein. **********This has fanned the worst fears of the Palestine Liberation Organization, namely that Israel would rather have Jordan take over the West Bank instead of the P.L.O. as stipulated in the Oslo agreements. **********In Jordan itself, it appears that the King is moving ahead of his people in making peace with Israel. **********With nearly half Jordan's population of 4 million composed of Palestinians, there has been a lackluster reception to the rapid developments of the last four months, which included the first public meeting between the King and Israeli leaders and developed into a full-fledged peace accord signed today under the sponsorship of President Clinton. **********The King remains enormously popular, but last week in conversations in Amman many Jordanians were wondering what has gotten into him and why he rushed to establish normal relations with Israel. Among the questions was: Why was the King lending himself to a fight with the P.L.O. over Jerusalem after having renounced in 1988 all claims to the West Bank of the Jordan? **********Some Jordanians have also been taken aback by the way he implicitly criticized Syria in defending the treaty, saying pointedly that ""no one should give us lessons."" **********The Syrian Government of President Hafez al-Assad has openly castigated Jordan for its ""rush"" to sign a deal with Israel and described its willingness to lease a small plot of land to Israel for 50 years in the peace accord as ""a shameful precedent that verges on blasphemy."" **********Stressing the difference between its style of driving a hard bargain with Israel and what Syrian news reports described as the King Hussein's ""fawning"" attitude toward Israel, Damascus today allowed an unidentified spokesman for Hamas, which took responsibility for the bus bombing in Israel last week, to warn Israel against carrying out its vow to pursue the group's leaders. **********""If Rabin attacks Hamas, we will hit back harder,"" the Hamas spokesman said. **********In the Persian Gulf, there has been silence or demure congratulations for the peace treaty, but most gulf Arabs have not been on speaking terms with King Hussein since the gulf war, when he sided with Iraq. **********""It's tough going,"" said Judith Kipper, a Middle East affairs expert at the the Council on Foreign Relations in New York who is observing the talks here. ""They are settling a hundred years of historical grievances and fear. I also think there is, in the region, a fear this peace is ushering in a new kind of domination centered around the Israeli-American alliance that is so overwhelming for many Arabs."""

The bond market fears a tax cut would undermine prices by stimulating the economy and swelling the budget deficit. **********The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 22/32 , to 957/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.92 percent, from 7.86 percent on Friday. **********In the municipal market, where there was lingering concern about the bankruptcy filing by Orange County, Calif., yields pretty much tracked the rising rates of the benchmark Government securities. **********Municipal bond prices were down an average of a quarter-point to a half-point in trading that reflected a lack of confidence in the market and apprehension of the next move by the Federal Reserve. The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues rose to 7.06 percent, from 7.04 percent on Friday. **********Some traders expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets next Tuesday. They say the market has already priced in an increase of 50 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. **********But many Fed watchers see only a modest chance of a rate increase before January. That view was strengthened by comments from the Fed's top two officials last week that suggested the Fed would not be prepared to raise rates before January. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder indicated that they wanted to see economic data that would not be available until January. **********The market took a beating in the morning, as buyers held back ahead of today's producer price numbers and tomorrow's consumer price data. Retail sales are also due today. The week includes reports on industrial production and capacity utilization, business inventories, housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed's survey of business activity. **********Analysts expect producer prices to show gains of four-tenths of 1 percent for November in both the overall index and the so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. **********Economists note that the Producer Price Index has been restrained in the face of this year's higher prices for crude and intermediate goods, and the market will be sensitive to evidence that these are being passed through to the finished-goods level. Analysts expect a seasonal decline in the tobacco component of the index to offset a similar rise in prices for passenger cars. **********Traders said that the long end of the market did not fare so well amid talk of middle-class tax cuts, fearing that any spending cuts to pay for them will not be enough, thus leading to a bigger Federal budget deficit and higher interest rates. **********Yesterday, the Treasury sold $27.2 billion in new three- and six-month bills at rates that were lower than than those auctioned last week. The average rate for a three-month issue was 5.76 percent, down 7 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month issue was down 1 basis point, to 6.32 percent. **********The following are the results of the Treasury's auction: (000 omitted in dollar figures)              3-Mo.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/business/tobacco-industry-tries-a-new-pitch-openness.html,Michael Janofsky,1994-04-20,,1304,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Tobacco Industry Tries A New Pitch: Openness,Tobacco Industry Tries A New Pitch: Openness," **********As Federal, state and local governments intensify their opposition to smoking, the tobacco industry has stepped up its public response in a strategy to show that cigarette companies are not the monsters that lawmakers portray them to be. **********With newspaper advertisements to rebut claims that cigarettes are laced with extra nicotine, an unusual collaboration to disclose ingredients and easier access to officials for reporters, industry executives say they have adopted a more open and aggressive approach to gaining public trust. **********But some critics of the smoking industry say that is not necessarily the case. They contend that tobacco executives have been forced to embrace a more vigorous position by the growing weight of legislative and Administration efforts that have pushed down the stock prices of the two largest cigarette makers, Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, since late February.  [ Philip Morris reported an increase of 59 percent in its first-quarter earnings yesterday. D5. ] Responding to Criticism **********""The tobacco industry only does what it has to do,"" said Matthew Myers, a lawyer in Washington who represents a coalition of health groups. ""They have been forced to take a number of steps that they would not have taken two months ago. The only reason they identified the secret ingredients is that they realized the cost of not disclosing them was more significant than the benefits of secrecy."" **********The tobacco industry's response began shortly after Feb. 25, when David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency had evidence that cigarette makers could manipulate the levels of nicotine as a way to keep smokers addicted. **********Around the same time, senior executives of Philip Morris began meeting each morning in a conference room at its headquarters in New York to review current events. **********""It began informally, with a few of us sitting around when a lot of things were going on,"" said Steven C. Parrish, a senior vice president and general counsel for Philip Morris U.S.A. ""Basically, we were just discussing what's going on. We wanted to keep up to date."" **********The daily meeting grew in size and scope, he said, ""almost to becoming a crisis management session."" **********Over the next six weeks, at least three initiatives developed involving Philip Morris: ***********On March 24, the company sued the ABC television network for several news programs in which the industry was accused of ""spiking"" cigarettes with nicotine. The suit asked for $10 billion in damages. ***********On April 13, Philip Morris ran an advertisement in several major newspapers, including The New York Times, with a headline that read, ""We Want You to Know"" over a defense of the industry against assertions that ingredients used in making cigarettes were unsafe. The advertisement also announced that a list of ingredients was being made public. ***********Later that day, the industry's lawyers in Washington released a list of 599 substances, all of which were already known to the Government. By law each company is required to submit its own list of ingredients. The combined list did not include amounts or any indication of how the substances are altered during smoking, and did not specify which tobacco companies used which ingredients. **********From the morning meetings there also emerged a sense, Mr. Parrish said, that the company had to broaden its actions beyond the need to satisfy the industry adversaries in Congress, Federal regulators and health-group leaders. The company determined that the public had to be convinced that cigarette makers were not evil scientists poisoning smokers with illegal substances. **********Part of that strategy meant making company executives available for extensive public comment. One such effort led to a recent article in The New York Times Magazine in which seven Philip Morris executives, including Mr. Parrish, addressed the general question ""How do tobacco executives live with themselves?"" In the article, the executives talked about working for companies that make a controversial product. A Cooperative Spirit **********""A year ago, we would not have considered doing that,"" Mr. Parrish said, referring to the cooperation on the project. ""Two years ago, the feeling at the company was, 'The less said about Philip Morris, the better.' We knew we would never get a fair shake so why should Philip Morris be accessible? Whatever was said was going to be negative. But then we realized that if we didn't speak out, how can we be critical if a story does not give our side?"" **********Maura Payne Ellis, a spokeswoman for R. J. Reynolds, said her company held no comparable morning meetings, but added that the same issues had been under constant review by Reynolds executives. She did not elaborate. **********""Is this the most aggressive we have been in years?"" asked Brennan Dawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, the industry's trade organization in Washington. ""I would say yes. We are driven by what we're facing. You are more aggressive when you want to be heard. You have to be out there, in the media, on Capitol Hill. The issues have changed in the past several months, and with new issues arising, the ground is shifting."" **********The ground had shifted enough for the country's major cigarette makers -- staunch rivals in a shrinking domestic market -- to join forces in disclosing the list of ingredients, information each company once swore was a trade secret. **********The final decision to act was apparently prompted by a report on National Public Radio on April 8 that identified 13 ""unsafe"" ingredients in cigarettes. The tobacco companies branded the report erroneous, but felt they needed to do more. **********""We knew what was coming,"" said one company executive who did not wish to be identified. ""It wasn't an issue of safety, so we decided, why should we get plastered with this?"" **********He said that conversations within his company and talks between companies led to a decision to have industry lawyers collect lists from each company and put the combined ingredients in alphabetical order to protect the individual sources. **********While Mr. Parrish and other industry executives cite the list as an example of the industry's eagerness to be open and forthright, critics contend that the disclosure was a pre-emptive strike against the release of lists from individual companies by lawmakers the next day at a House subcommittee hearing. **********Last Thursday, top executives from Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds and five other tobacco companies faced questions for more than six hours at a hearing called ""historic"" by the subcommittee chairman, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. **********But if the hearing broke any major ground, it was more for the appearance of so many tobacco company executives and their research directors. The sharp exchanges broke little ground in the larger debate over cigarettes as a health concern and left at least one Congressman who favors tighter regulations on the industry, Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, dubious of any new openness on the part of industry officials. **********""Openness is only as good as honesty,"" he said. **********For any benefits the industry's public relations strategies might provide -- including a future rise in stock prices -- the fate of tobacco companies may be far more dependent upon the industry's lobbying efforts in Congress. **********Ethan Siegal, the domestic and fiscal policy analyst for Prudential Securities in Washington, said those efforts would play a major role in shaping, among other things, new regulations on cigarettes and the size of a proposed excise tax increase on cigarettes to finance health care reform. **********Citing the 56 House members from six tobacco-growing states, Mr. Siegal said their support could become far more beneficial to the industry than public relations efforts, especially if the White House needed their votes to pass a health care bill."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/business/gm-raising-many-prices-as-costs-of-materials-rise.html,James Bennet,1994-12-22,,645,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,G.M. Raising Many Prices As Costs of Materials Rise,G.M. Raising Many Prices As Costs of Materials Rise," **********With steel and plastic costs rising and demand for vehicles still strong, the General Motors Corporation said today that it would raise the prices of almost half its cars and nearly all its light trucks on Jan. 3. **********Although the increases varied by vehicle, they averaged seven-tenths of a percent, or $151, on base models, G.M. said. When it announced 1995 prices in June, G.M. said they would be 2.5 percent, or $494, higher than prices of 1994 models. **********G.M. was the first of the Big Three auto makers to increase prices broadly during the 1995 model year, which began on Oct. 1, although the Chrysler Corporation has raised prices of some light trucks. **********G.M.'s hottest-selling models will have the steepest price increases. For example, G.M. raised prices 5.4 percent, or $1,695, on its Oldsmobile Aurora sedan. The Aurora's destination charge also increased by $10, or 1.6 percent, giving the car a new base price of $33,700. Similarly, the base price for the GMC Suburban truck will increase 1.4 percent, or $300, to $22,607, including the destination charge. **********Auto industry analysts said the increases were not enough to erase G.M.'s price advantage over Japanese competitors, which some analysts put as high as $2,500 on comparable models. But they warned that the Japanese auto makers were cutting costs to become competitive despite the weak dollar, which makes exports to the United States more expensive. **********""I get very nervous when I see stuff like this, because I just see that again they're going to run the risk of putting themselves in an uncompetitive price position,"" said Joseph S. Phillippi, a financial analyst who follows the auto industry for Lehman Brothers. ""You cannot ignore the fact the Japanese as a group are ripping billions of dollars out of their cost structure."" **********John F. Maciarz, a G.M. spokesman, said that the increases in prices brought ""them in line with those of our competitors."" **********With its own suppliers raising prices for raw materials, G.M. may have felt it had to pass those costs along. ""They're paying more for steel, more for plastics,"" said David Healy, the auto industry analyst for S. G. Warburg. **********Some G.M. dealers disapproved of the increases. ""Any time a car goes up by 1 or 2 percent, it's 1 or 2 percent harder to sell, if you know what I mean,"" said Ray Skillman of Ray Skillman Oldsmobile-GMC Truck in Indianapolis. Given G.M.'s price advantage over Japanese auto makers, he said, ""I would take advantage of that and try to take more market share, rather than more gross profit."" **********Some of the price increases like the one on the Aurora, would not deter buyers, Mr. Skillman said.  Less understandable, he said, was an increase of 1.5 percent, or $205, in the base price of the Oldsmobile Achieva small sedan, to $14,200. ""There is no more value in it than there was two years ago,"" he said of the Achieva. **********At two G.M. divisions, Cadillac and Saturn, prices did not change. **********At one division, Buick, prices actually fell on some models, reflecting a change in pricing strategy. For the cars it sells everywhere but California, Buick abandoned an approach of offering some vehicles with a set package of options at a reduced price. Buick said it was applying the savings from those ""select series"" vehicles to its traditionally priced models. **********Using both pricing approaches in the same showrooms confused customers and salespeople, said Lawrence R. Gustin, a Buick spokesman. **********Facing the same predicament, the Oldsmobile division decided earlier this year to drop traditional pricing entirely, and it was not clear why Buick went the other way. ""It's just a different philosophy on what works for us,"" Mr. Gustin said."

In addition, three other front leaders were freed from jail without any restrictions. **********In the last year, militant Muslim groups have brought Government authority to a near halt throughout the country. They have burned, destroyed and shut down hundreds of schools, factories, plantations and Government offices. **********General Zeroual was installed in power by the military last year, largely as a figurehead president, but he has moved since to form a group within the Government advocating a measure of power-sharing with Islamic opposition forces to stem the bloodshed. **********Rabih Kebir, a senior figure in the Islamic Salvation Front in exile in Germany, described the release of Mr. Madani and Mr. Belhaj, who were allowed visitors even though they remained under house arrest, as a positive but ""insufficient"" step. **********He repeated frequent demands for a greater role by the front, the main Muslim opposition party. The front was banned shortly after the military seized power and canceled elections in early 1992 in which the front was leading. **********More important, the front said it insisted that militant Islamic factions, particularly the radical Armed Islamic Group, participate in any talks. The Armed Islamic Group initiated the wave of assassinations against foreigners living in Algeria a few months ago that has claimed 59 lives. **********In a statement faxed to news agencies today, another wing of the front welcomed the release of the leaders and said the party would work for ""a return of stability to our country"" and to give ""the Algerian people a basis for building a civilized state based on the principles of Islam."" **********Algerian and French officials noted that it was far from clear that either the 63-year-old Mr. Madani or the 29-year-old Mr. Belhaj were in a position to command the loyalty of younger Islamic militants who have taken charge of the armed revolt. **********And, the officials said, there are significant differences on how far a dialogue with the fundamentalists will be allowed to go by the top command of the Algerian Army. Several senior generals are known to favor continuing the war against the militants, and a previous figurehead president, Mohammed Boudiaf, installed in power two years ago by the ruling junta, was subsequently assassinated when he strayed toward reconciliation with the militants. **********France, the former colonial power in Algeria, greeted the development with palpable apprehension. There is concern here that the beginning of talks between the Algerian Government and fundamentalists means that events are approaching a point where a hard-line, vehemently anti-French Islamic feeling is emerging. **********""One must be very prudent since it is not a secret for anyone that the Islamic movement, and without any doubt the Government, are divided,"" Alain Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, said concerning the anticipated dialogue between the Government and the fundamentalists. **********The Islamic Salvation Front and other Islamic political groups, including moderate ones, all share the view that secularist influences, most particularly France's political, economic and educational influence in Algeria, must be obliterated. **********Recently Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has begun a highly visible campaign against the spread of militant groups in the North African French expatriate community. **********Twenty militants, accused of channeling money to the Islamic groups in Algeria, have been deported and others accused of sending weapons and organizing secret cells are under arrest. A widespread police and secret service operation is under way. **********But the most significant question remains how serious are the divisions within the Islamic movement itself. In the last year, the Algerian militant movement has come to resemble the one in Afghanistan, which has divided in various camps fighting each other. **********Today, Mahfouz Nehnah, leader of the moderate, anti-violent Hamas party in Algeria, said he would not take part in any talks in which the violent Armed Islamic Group takes part. **********In addition to the Armed Islamic Group, which came into existence over the last 18 months, other new and more violent Islamic factions are believed to be active, guided by the conviction that the Government is on the verge of collapse and talks are an unnecessary concession by the militants. **********Three days ago, the Armed Islamic Group, headed by a former army officer who uses the nom de guerre Abu Abdallah Ahmad, called for a ""general mobilization"" throughout Algeria of its guerrillas, who number in the hundreds. **********Today a senior leader of the Tunisian Al Nahda opposition party, Rached Ghannouchi, who lives in exile in Britain, said ""the divisive factors are growing bigger and bigger"" within the Algerian fundamentalist movements and that the Algerian Government is in the process of disintegration. **********""That explains why the moderates on both sides are trying to negotiate,"" he added."

They have lobbied strenuously in Congress and at the White House to preserve China's trade benefits as a way of retaining and expanding American companies' share of expanding Chinese markets. No Moral Responsibility **********They say that embracing such codes of behavior would undermine their competitiveness and raise suspicions in the Chinese Government. **********""The impetus of laying on the American business community a corporate code of conduct simply gives credence to the idea that business is morally responsible for the human rights situation in China,"" said Robert A. Kapp, president of the United States-China Business Council, a group that promotes commercial links between the two countries. ""We don't accept that."" **********While there is some sentiment in Congress for a voluntary code, China's stiffest critics, like Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, think that Congressional efforts should now focus on whether to revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status, and on other potential sanctions. **********Ms. Pelosi said she supported a voluntary code of conduct, but did not see that as a substitute for canceling Chinese trade privileges. She said she found corporate opposition to voluntary standards of conduct difficult to understand. **********""The business community resisted this in the past, as now,"" Ms. Pelosi said. ""I think it's ironic that the business community opposes a voluntary code of conduct. How do you oppose something that's voluntary."" **********Richard Dicker, an associate counsel for Human Rights Watch in New York, said American companies would signal their support for American policies in support of human rights by adopting a code of minimum conduct. **********""The objective here on our part is to insure that U.S. business operations in China do not encourage or contribute to oppressive practices, and in a positive way contribute to the human rights climate by taking a positive approach,"" he said. **********The question of voluntary codes for American business abroad was first raised in 1977 by the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan of Philadelphia. who outlined principles for how companies should operate under apartheid in South Africa, in ways that were sensitive to black aspirations. Inapt Comparison Seen **********Human Rights Watch tries to draw parallels between the Sullivan Principles for South Africa and its proposed code of conduct in China. But American companies reject both the analogy and the proposal. **********""In China, it would be particularly inappropriate because of the nature of the Chinese economy -- the economy being state-directed while moving toward some market freedom,"" said Robert McNeill, executive vice chairman of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, which represents leading American businesses. ""In China, companies would be seen as agents of the U.S. Government,"" Mr. McNeill said. ""And the danger with codes of conduct that are initially voluntary is that they can become statutory."" **********Mr. Kapp said American companies would not accept efforts to impose rules of conduct on their China operations. **********""There is a great uneasiness about notions of codes of conduct,"" he said. ""First, it becomes a process of public shaming. It is very easy to say things that sound good. No. 2, the advocates of heavy economic pressure against China, to compel China to change its domestic political behavior, believe they are dealing with universal values. That is one of the explanations for what I believe is a cavalier approach to national sovereignty."" **********The five voluntary measures proposed by Human Rights Watch would prohibit the use of prison products by American companies, discourage compulsory political indoctrination in the workplace, embrace nondiscriminatory employment practices -- which means not discharging people for their political beliefs, allow workers to discuss work-related issues freely, and have American executives discuss human rights issues in their localities with Chinese officials. **********Timothy Kellogg, director of corporate communications for Motorola, said the company felt comfortable with its rules. **********""We have a very strict internal code of conduct that has been translated into Chinese,"" Mr. Kellogg said of the code used in Motorola's $120 million semiconductor and pager manufacturing plant in Tianjin. ""What we have in place is more than adequate. Any effort that goes beyond that appears to make us a Government agent."" **********George Jamison, a spokesman for the General Electric Company, said G.E. had not made any public statement on corporate guidelines. **********Mr. Jamison said China was an important market for the company, adding, ""Over the next decade we have $13.5 billion in potential export opportunities."" Pride in Chinese Employees **********Several business groups, including the Emergency Committee for American Trade, have been distributing details of American business activity in China to legislators and Administration officials. In one such packet, I.B.M. called China its fastest-growing market, and said that its 385 Chinese employees ""leave the security of the socialist system that provides subsidized housing, education, and medical care to experience risk and reward in the Chinese marketplace."" I.B.M. said it contributed more than $1 million last year to a hospital, a model-classrooms project and the state-run Beijing Film Academy. **********Similarly, Xerox said it backed ""human resource development"" through financial support of a management institute in Dalian and a training center in Shenzhen. The company said it ""supported cultural activities primarily in Shanghai and contributed to the overall well-being of its Chinese employees by offering thoroughly modern working conditions and facilities in China."" **********But Representative Pelosi, who has led Congressional efforts to revoke China's preferred trade status because of its rights abuses, described such corporate drum-beating as off the mark. ""We're talking about fundamental rights,"" she said. ""They support cultural activities. Isn't that nice. I find it disingenuous."""

Gone are the hallmarks of the current crop of shows: the cheesy sets and dowdy hosts and the hours of hard-se...",1978,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Television Shopping Is Stepping Up in Class,Television Shopping Is Stepping Up in Class," **********A NEW generation of TV home shopping shows is set to begin this spring and the medium's message is about to take a quantum leap upscale. **********Gone are the hallmarks of the current crop of shows: the cheesy sets and dowdy hosts and the hours of hard-sell pitches for budget goods like cubic zirconium rings. Catalog 1, a Spiegel-Time Warner joint venture which will be available in selected markets on March 28, sets the new high-gloss tone. A Catalog 1 demonstration tape features a shapely model in Hawaii sporting a one-piece swimsuit priced at $108, with a brightly colored wrap going for $176 more. The suit is described by an announcer as ""cayenne, rum and loden, with gold-toned accents sparkling in the folds of the bodice."" A fashion director with a proper English accent purrs about the Moroccan influence the swimwear shares with the latest collections of top European and American designers. **********Home shopping executives have seen the future, and it isn't the fiftyish housewives from Dubuque or the thousands of other small cities and towns who provided the bulk of the buying power in the industry's first decade. Now, the industry is reaching for a younger baby-boom audience in its 30's and 40's, as well as the 20-something Generation X. To do so, it is significantly raising the quality, and in most cases the price, of home shopping fare. **********""The home shopping business is where catalogues were in the mid-1970's before we started marketing to younger working women,"" said John J. Shea, Spiegel's chief executive. ""People tend to forget that we used to be a mostly rural, blue-collar business."" **********The stakes are high as the home shopping industry lifts its sights from the discount bins to the high-fashion aisles. Industry executives predict that home shopping, already ringing up $3 billion a year in sales, could soar to $25 billion a year by the end of the decade if the upscale shift succeeds. While still only a small fraction of last year's estimated $245 billion in apparel and jewelry sales, home shopping is likely to be retailing's fastest-growing sector for the next several years. Mr. Shea, for instance, estimates that within five years home shopping could add more than $1 billion to Spiegel's annual revenue, which last year was $2.6 billion. **********Another giant retailer, the R. H. Macy department store chain, is planning to test its own upscale home shopping channel this year. At least half a dozen other chains, including Nordstrom, are weighing a similar move within the next few years. Not to be outdone, the two industry leaders -- QVC Inc. and the Home Shopping Network Inc. -- are starting new channels in the next few months aimed at more affluent audiences to complement their existing programming. **********Soon even MTV Networks' viewers will be able to hip-hop and shop. Next month, the Viacom Inc. division will try selling compact disks, videotapes and other goods between music videos. MTV plans a separate shopping channel if the test is a success. And by year-end, MTV will face competition from another music video-home shopping network being formed by Germany's Bertelsmann A. G. and Tele-Communications Inc., America's largest cable operator. **********CHANGING demographics and consumer attitudes will give home shopping an added boost the next few years, industry consultants say. The number of two-career families pressed for leisure time is expected to increase. In addition, the ""mall pall"" caused by poor service in many retail stores and the rising fear of crime in malls will lead more people to give home shopping a try, says Watts Wacker, a managing director and ""resident futurist"" at Yankelovich Partners, a consulting firm based in Westport, Conn. Mr. Wacker predicts that with the confluence of these trends and the industry's targeting of upscale shoppers, ""40 percent of American households will have tried home shopping by the end of 1996,"" compared with only 10 percent today. **********Critics of home shopping contend that the concept is being oversold. They say most retailers should focus on what they do best -- selling apparel in stores. **********""Certain commodity-type products can be sold over the TV, but for a lot of higher-priced apparel, the customer still wants to touch and feel it,"" says Walter Loeb, a retailing consultant in Manhattan. ""The whole retailing industry is embracing home shopping as a new panacea for being successful."" **********There are other potential hurdles. Existing home shopping channels have been plagued at times by high return rates from customers complaining about the quality or fit of goods. Higher than average rates of credit card deadbeats also can eat into home shopping profits, experts say. But Ann Morris, a Spiegel spokeswoman, counters that the company's years of experience in the catalogue business make it confident that it can keep these problems at acceptably low levels. **********Whatever the problems, home shopping is too big for many retailers to ignore. They are rushing to establish their identities before the field is crowded with look-alikes that will have shoppers reaching for their channel changers. **********""There will be a window of opportunity during the next two to three years for home shopping channels to establish strong brand names"" before a shakeout occurs, predicts Candice Carpenter, president of QVC's new shopping channel, Q2, set to debut in May. **********THE Spiegel-Time Warner Catalog 1 venture aims to replicate the experience of shopping in a mall or flipping through a stack of catalogues by showcasing products from several different stores. Catalog 1 initially will feature merchandise from Spiegel and its Eddie Bauer outerwear subsidiary, as well as from Neiman Marcus, Sharper Image, Crate and Barrel, the Nature Company, Williams-Sonoma and the Bombay Company. **********Each retailer will process its own orders and agree not to appear on another home shopping program during Catalog 1's one-year test period. Other retailers will be added if the test is judged a success, Spiegel executives say. The channel's test markets will include Rochester, N.Y.; Nashua, N.H.; Columbus, Ohio, and suburban Milwaukee. **********Home Shopping Network is responding similarly with a new channel, the Television Shopping Mall, that will offer the wares of dozens of retailers. ""We're building the 'mall,' and retailers will fill it,"" says Gerald Hogan, the company's chief executive. Mr. Hogan plans to have 35 retailers lined up by late spring and to be on the air this summer. **********The TV Shopping Mall is expected to reach 3 million cable households and 20 million broadcast households initially, with a goal of 30 million cable households within five years, Mr. Hogan says. Home Shopping Network, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., reaches 60 million households with its existing programming, while rival QVC, in West Chester, Pa., goes to about 50 million. **********SOME retailers are planning to go it alone in home shopping without the support of a televised ""mall."" Macy's, for example, will begin test-marketing its TV Macy's shopping channel this fall, with a full launch not expected for another 12 to 18 months. TV Macy's will highlight a broad range of the department store's products and feature celebrity hosts. The 24-hour channel will be carried initially by Long Island-based cable TV operator Cablevision Systems, which reaches 2.3 million households. **********Nordstrom, the Seattle-based department store chain that prides itself on its in-store customer service, trails the retailing pack when it comes to reaching customers at home. The family-controlled company didn't even start mailing catalogues to customers until January. Making a virtue out of necessity, Nordstrom says it is likely to leap-frog its retailing rivals by skipping the next generation of home shopping channels like Q2 or the TV Shopping Mall. Instead, Nordstrom says that within the next few years it may jump directly into interactive television, the generation after next in which home shoppers will be able to view and call up or store detailed information about products. ""There is no existing technology that strikes us as an attractive possibility,"" says Daniel Nordstrom, general manager of direct sales. **********QVC's new Q2 channel is taking the riskiest approach among the planned offerings. Appearing initially only on weekends, Q2 will consist of 30-minute segments focusing on themes like preparing a dinner party, improving health and fitness or planning an exotic vacation. Products or services used during the segments will be offered for sale. Another QVC offering, On Q, will run during the week, replacing QVC's struggling fashion channel, and cater to a younger audience in its 20's. Q2 expects to have 12 million viewers by year-end, executives say. **********Q2 is betting that its broadcast-quality entertainment and information segments will attract an audience, even though viewers initially may be more familiar with the type of straightforward product presentations they'll see on Catalog 1 and the TV Shopping Mall. By cutting out the retailing middlemen, Q2 also will be able to sell certain product lines at a discount to retailers hawking their wares on rival shopping channels, says Ms. Carpenter, the channel's president, although she declined to give specifics. **********With so many shopping programs soon to be competing for slots on cable systems and for viewer's attention, it's certain that only the strong will survive. But it's too early to say who will be eating whom for lunch. **********""Some of these channels are sure to fail five years down the road, but I don't think anybody has a clue as to which they will be,"" says Peter Siris, an industry analyst with UBS Securities in New York.ON THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT HORIZON OF VIDEO RETAILING **********WHILE retailers are anxious to test their new home shopping channels as soon as possible, so-called interactive television tests planned around the country may eventually play a greater role in shaping the future of home shopping. **********Later this year, Time Warner Inc. will begin testing an interactive television system in Orlando, Fla., that will carry the Catalog 1 home shopping program developed by Time Warner and Spiegel Inc. The field test had been set to start April 1 but was postponed last week until the fourth quarter, apparently because of software and equipment delays. **********Dozens of other interactive tests involving home shopping are expected to begin around the country this year and next. **********With phone companies across the country investing billions in fiber optic cable, which is required to carry interactive TV's digital signal, ""50 percent of the U.S. will be able to receive interactive TV by the year 2000,"" Gordon Cooke, president of Time Warner's interactive merchandising group, estimates. **********Using interactive TV, home shoppers in Orlando initially will see the same programming on Catalog 1 as any cable TV viewer. The interaction starts when a particular product catches their eye. The interactive viewer will be able to stop the action while viewing models wearing swimsuits and, using special controls provided as part of the test, call up more information like type of materials or colors and sizes. The customer can order directly from the TV by clicking on icons and entering a credit card number. **********Eventually, interactive technology is expected to allow a home shopper searching for a black evening dress, for instance, to call up a dozen or more choices at once from all the retailers included in the system. **********""Virtual shopping"" is also being considered by industry experts as a possible evolution of interactive TV. Viewers would not only customize their selection of apparel, but would also be able to ""try"" garments on, using computerized likenesses of themselves on the screen, complete with correct measurements, skin tone and hair color. But that technology could easily be a decade or more away, Mr. Cooke indicates."

Or even worse, as far as Japan Airlines is concerned, they are flying on United. **********Weighed down by the nation's lingering recession, the strong yen and aggressive competition, Japan Airlines said today that it would trim 5,000 people, or about 23 percent of its work force, over the next four years as part of an extensive reorganization aimed at cutting costs. Hiring Foreigners **********The company, which has had heavy losses, said it would make the cuts through attrition, early retirements, transfers to subsidiaries and reduction of hiring. Only 80 pilots will be hired in the next fiscal year -- no flight attendants, ground crew members or office workers. And many of the flight attendants to be hired will be foreigners who can be paid less than Japanese workers. **********J.A.L. also said it would cut its planned investment on new aircraft and ground operations in the four-year period almost in half, to 440 billion yen, or about $4 billion. As part of that cutback, the company will defer delivery of six Boeing 747 jumbo jets, a spokesman said. **********While the airline previously instituted wage freezes, hiring freezes, voluntary retirement programs and other cost-cutting steps, the plan announced today was the most aggressive yet, reflecting the recognition by J.A.L. that its way of doing business was ill suited for the competition in today's airline industry. **********The carrier, which was Government controlled until 1987, was known for pampering customers and employees. It uses 19 flight attendants on a jumbo jet flight between Tokyo and New York, while some competitors might use as few as 13, said Geoffrey Tudor, a J.A.L. spokesman. Pilots were taken to and from Narita Airport in Tokyo in limousines. **********But with Japan's economy in a slump, sales of lucrative first-class and business-class seats are down significantly. American carriers, sharpened by deregulation in the United States, have become tough competitors, offering low prices and incentives like frequent-flier plans, which Japan Airlines and other Asian carriers were slow to match. A new airport that will open later this year in Osaka will allow foreign carriers to increase their service to Japan, putting even more pressure on J.A.L. Continuing Poor Results **********Japan Airlines expects a net loss of 26 billion yen, or about $234 million, in the fiscal year ending in March, after a net loss the year before of 43.8 billion yen, or about $395 million. Revenues in this fiscal year are expected to fall for the fourth consecutive year, to 970 billion yen, or about $8.7 billion. **********Susumu Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines, said J.A.L. and other carriers worldwide were losing money because of overcapacity in the industry. ""That overcapacity is mostly provided by American carriers,"" he said late last year. **********He has frequently complained that the 1952 aviation treaty between the United States and Japan is outdated and unfair because it gives more flights to American carriers even though most passengers between the two nations are Japanese. **********To seek relief from the international market, Japan Airlines is trying to gain more business in Japan's protected and high-priced domestic market. But right now, that market is hurt by the recession as well, so Japan Airlines sometimes flies nearly empty jumbo jets on 90-minute hops. **********Robert Rowland, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Tokyo, said the steps announced today should allow the airline to earn a small profit in the next fiscal year instead of the loss he had projected. **********""It changes my forecast quite dramatically,"" he said. ""It will give them a fighting chance next year."" **********The airline previously said it expected that in four years as many as 30 percent of the cabin attendants on international flights would be foreigners. A Thai attendant, for instance, who lives in her home country, can be paid only a fourth as much as a Japanese attendant. More Work for Charter Unit **********Today, J.A.L. said it planned to make more use of Japan Air Charter, a low-cost unit it set up in 1992 that has only Thai attendants and mainly uses American contract pilots. **********While the unit now makes mainly charter flights, it would increasingly take over scheduled J.A.L. flights, mainly to tourist destinations like Hawaii. After the four-year revamping period, Japan Air Charter is expected to account for 20 percent of Japan Airlines' overseas flights, said Mr. Tudor, the spokesman. **********As for the limos to the airport, those were eliminated in a previous cost-cutting move. ""We succeeded in getting pilots to take taxis,"" Mr. Tudor said. Of course, in Tokyo, even a taxi ride to Narita airport can cost more than $100."

An additional 5 percent is spread among Framatome employees. **********Company sources suggested that 5 percent of the 7 percent required to give Alcatel Alsthom majority control would most likely be surrendered by Crédit Lyonnais, which is trying to focus on core banking activities and return to profitability. Analysts suggest that the 7 percent stake could be valued at 1.5 billion francs. **********Framatome had sales in 1993 of 16 billion francs and net profits of 900 million francs. Sales are expected to boom in 1994 as high as 20 billion francs, as two reactors built at Daya Bay in China, and now operational, are to be billed. **********However, the future for Framatome is clouded by a frigid international market for nuclear power plants. The company is in a joint venture with Kraftwerk Union AG, the nuclear plant unit of Siemens AG, to design an advanced nuclear reactor for export markets, but there is not likely to be any demand in Western Europe for such plants in the foreseeable future, analysts say."

Gen. Raoul Cedras today that his forces must stop beating Haitian citizens and took what may be a significant first step toward dismantling the force the military holds in this frightened country. **********A day after Haitian police and soldiers lashed out with clubs at crowds who were greeting American troops, Lieut. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps and Maj. Gen. David Meade, commander of the 10th Mountain Division, strode into General Cedras's headquarters to warn the Haitian command to shape up, American military spokesmen said. **********Overnight the de facto Haitian Government, dominated by General Cedras, had issued a proclamation banning all public demonstrations and ordering the police ""to take all necessary measures"" to make sure none occurred. **********But, when thousands of Haitians ignored that warning and gathered eagerly again today around the port and airport to watch the American troops with their helicopters, cargo ships and trucks, the police did not repeat its beating and scattering of the welcoming crowds. **********Largely as a result of those attacks, and the graphic reports by journalists who witnessed them as they went on for hours, President Clinton announced that 1,000 military police officers would be sent to join the growing American contingent, already expected to number nearly 10,000 by the end of the day. He said the police would ""monitor"" the performance of the Haitian police and that international human rights monitors, expelled in July by the military, would return. **********Perhaps the most important step reported by the American side after the hour-and-a-half meeting in General Cedras's French Colonial-style headquarters, with its peeling white paint and lounging soldiers, was an agreement to dismantle the Haitian Army's only heavy weapons company. **********The unit's six armored vehicles, artillery pieces and heavy machine guns are to be dismantled at Camp D'Application in the hills east of downtown Port-au-Prince, and the barracks partly occupied by an American Special Forces battalion. The weapons are to be removed from the barracks, which would have been a prime target of the 82d Airborne Division had an invasion occurred, so they can be counted and inspected to make sure they no longer work. **********American Special Forces troopers could be viewed this evening at the camp, a shabby-looking compound whose green concrete walls were topped with shards of broken beer and Coca-Cola bottles that had been set in mortar. They said they planned to tow the weapons and the half-dozen halftracks (armored vehicles) to a soccer field near downtown. **********The barracks' immediate commander is Maj. Leslie Sanz, who is widely believed responsible for much of the killing carried out after the military coup in 1991. A few dozen people drifted up from the road to watch the arrival of the Americans, and some applauded discreetly. **********The disarming of the heavy weapons company will reduce the coup-making potential of the army, since no other unit possesses the armored vehicles and heavy guns that could be used to surround Government buildings. **********In the byzantine world of Haitian politics, the move is also seen as a blow to the police chief, Lieut. Col.  Michel Francois, who controls the company and, indeed, lives in the upscale neighborhood surrounding its barracks. **********Colonel Francois, a shadowy figure in recent days, did not sign the agreement worked out last weekend by former President Jimmy Carter.  He has been described by President Clinton as ""out of the picture,"" but is believed in some circles here to have been a key player in unleashing the club-wielding police on Tuesday. **********Some Haitians speculated that Colonel Francois was trying to reassert that he is someone who must be dealt with. The port area, where most of the beating occurred, is under his direct jurisdiction. **********General Cedras was told by the two American generals at the meeting that ""the beating of civilians must stop,"" an Army spokesman, Col. Barry Willey, said at a briefing this afternoon. **********Colonel Willey said that for his part, General Cedras ""understood the importance"" of the issue. **********General Shelton also ""expressed his displeasure at the inflammatory nature of broadcasts on Haitian television and asked for an immediate halt"" to the programs, Colonel Willey said. The Government-controlled television has been steadily broadcasting pictures from the American invasion of Panama in 1989. **********The beatings of civilians on Tuesday were somewhat of an embarrassment to the American mission here, depicted by the United States as an effort to uphold democracy. It was also upsetting to many of the soldiers, who had been told they were coming to oust a military force that oppressed its populace and then had to stand by and watch them do just that. **********""I think that is all confusing for soldiers,"" General Meade, whose division supplied most of the troops, said today. ""Why wouldn't it be confusing for soldiers?"" **********Or, as a sergeant in the ""Triple Deuce,"" the battalion of the 10th Mountain Division that made the first landing, put it with a growl: ""There are thugs on the street. They're the same thugs we were sent here to take out."" **********Trying to explain the situation at a briefing this morning before his meeting with General Cedras, General Shelton said he had been instructed by his superiors in Washington that ""it is not our policy to intervene in law-and-order matters per se; that is a Haitian matter. **********""However, the fact that the Haitian police and military have continued to use what we consider unnecessary force to deal with their own citizens is of concern to us,"" he said. **********General Shelton suggested that that problem was that the Haitian police were ""not trained in riot control or crowd control."" **********He added that the ""level of civility that is here is provided by the police and the military, which is under the control of General Cedras."""

He added that he was confident a compromise would be reached ""in the coming weeks."" **********Mr. Camdessus' remarks represented a remarkably defiant stance for a man who was castigated by officials of the United States and other G-7 countries for having taken a partisan position on the aid package even though he is nominally only an international bureaucrat. **********Mr. Camdessus said there was ""still a feeling of cooperation that will help finalize a solution that is acceptable to all."" But he added that no IMF member was ""in a position to totally impose its views"" concerning the proposal. **********Mr. Camdessus also took a swipe at the position held by Germany, which has opposed his aid proposal on the grounds that creating 36 billion Special Drawing Rights ($53 billion), the IMF's artificial currency, would be inflationary. He contended that ""nobody believes that 36 billion SDRs would in any way be an inflationary factor."" **********On Sunday, a dispute erupted at the Madrid meeting when Mr. Camdessus sided with Third World countries who eventually blocked a compromise offer from the Group of Seven that would have been worth $23.4 billion. The poor countries, emboldened by Mr. Camdessus' support, also killed a separate financial assistance program intended mainly for former Soviet-bloc states. **********The feud between G-7 countries on the one hand and Mr. Camdessus and poorer nations on the other marred the 50th anniversary of the IMF and World Bank. It also overshadowed discussion of the encouraging outlook for world economic recovery. **********Although Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen of the United States made a point of adopting a conciliatory tone as part of a damage-control campaign this week, both U.S. and European officials of G-7 countries have been privately furious with Mr. Camdessus. **********The IMF chief himself, who conceded only that he was ""possibly too immodest,"" made repeated references during the Madrid meetings to ""my agenda"" and behaved as though he had political power despite his role as an international civil servant."

Decide the Future can Wait Maybe everyone got carried away with this ""information highway"" idea; maybe things were moving too fast. Because all the fancy talk got slammed into a wall of reality. The Huge Merger planned by Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications was supposed to set off a fireworks-popping transformation of, well, the world as we know it - cable-television, communications, who-knows-what. But last week, the two compnies said, Never mind: The numbers don't add up. Why did the deal crash? The F.C.C. lowering cable rates played a part, and T.C.I.'s aggreasive manner did clash with staid Bell Atlantic. But more likely it just wasn't time for the cable industry to disappear into some labyrinthine, futuristic world. Now, said one executive, cable ""will not be folded into the telephone industry as quickly as people thought."" cable stocks, though, looked better before. **********What Should Cable TV Cost?  Even without merger confusion, cable television is a slippery thing. Regulators keep trying to put a fair price tag on it, but the technological sands keep shifting. Last year the F.C.C. moved to bring rates down to competitive levels, but somehow a third of consumers saw their rates rise -- partly because cable companies proved adept at reshuffling the channels in a ""basic"" package. Last week, the F.C.C. tried again, cutting rates an additional 7 percent -- that, it says, is where true competition would drive them -- and it is trying to close the loopholes. The head of the F.C.C., Reed Hundt, called it ""one of the greatest consumer savings"" -- when you add it up, it amounts to a couple of dollars a month. Soros Takes a Beating  Well, no one's invincible -- not even George Soros. Mr. Soros has taken on a larger-than-life aura for his prescient, and hugely profitable, bets on the direction of the world's currencies. A year and a half ago, he made $1 billion when he bet that Britain's pound would be devalued in the midst of Europe's exchange-rate turmoil. With such stakes, though, the day had to come when the losses would be just as huge. It has. Last week Mr. Soros said his Quantum Group funds lost $600 million on Feb. 14 in a bad bet on the direction of the yen. Giving In to Cancer at Tenneco  Michael Walsh tried for a year to do two quite formidable -- and quite different -- tasks, but in the end one of them demanded his undivided attention. One task had been to run Tenneco, and he did that spectacularly. In less than three years, he had, by all accounts, whipped the company into shape -- just as he had turned around Union Pacific before that. But in January 1993 he developed brain cancer, and after a year of battling that, while staying on the job, he resigned last week at the age of 51. The stock fell $3.375 over two days, to $54.625, but a more relevant point is that that's still nearly twice what it was shortly after Mr. Walsh took charge. Take That, Microsoft!  Mighty Microsoft, the fearsome competitor, got its wrist slapped last week, but it will take a lot more than that to slow it down. A Federal jury said the company infringed the patent of a small California company called Stac Electronics, which had developed a method for doubling the storage capacity of computer disks. The jury awarded Stac $120 million in damages -- which Microsoft can pay out of its pocket money -- but the bigger question is whether this Goliath will now be a bit more cautious in its dealings with various Davids. And it will surely cause more discussion about whether the patent concept is even relevant to something as complex as software. NASA, Back in the Frying Pan  NASA can't seem to stay out of trouble. Recently it went a long way toward erasing one black mark by patching up the Hubble, but last week it had another headache. Federal prosecutors accused nine people, some of whom work for NASA, of taking part in bribery and kickback schemes at the Johnson Space Center in Texas. Martin Marietta agreed to pay $1 million and to help in the inquiry. What's behind it? One scientist cited NASA's loose, ""mom and pop"" accounting methods, saying, ""It's a lot easier to knock off a mom-and-pop than an armored car.""  INTERNATIONAL Japan Abandons HDTV (Briefly)  In Japan, high-definition television is a topic painfully close to the economic nerve. It's their baby, a rare instance of Japan pioneering a technology. So there was an uproar last week when the Government said it might abandon analog HDTV technology, into which industry had poured billions, in favor of the Americans' digital system. Such an uproar, in fact, that the next day Tokyo said, Well, uh, maybe we'll stick with it after all. A token bit of national honor restored, but the damage was done: Who's going to put more effort into a technology that could be a dead end?  Bradley Slams 'Japan-Bashing'  President Clinton's tough talk on trade with Japan is good box office, but -- for the long-term good -- is it the right thing? Some have doubts, and last week they got a key ally in Bill Bradley. ""People want to believe,"" the Democratic senator said, that ""somebody is victimizing us."" But he wants none of it. Mr. Clinton's saber-rattling is ""gratuitous brinkmanship,"" he said -- ""Japan-bashing"" for domestic consumption. Threats of a trade war, he said, could undermine efforts at reform in Japan. He will surely be heard, because he's usually a solid Clinton backer.  Easing High-Tech Exports  People are nervous about exporting fancy technology. As one arms-control advocate put it, we don't want to ""send U.S. pilots again to bomb things our industry has exported."" But changes in the world, and in technology, cannot be ignored. And, not least, a chance to increase the nation's trade cannot be ignored -- not by this President anyway. So last week Mr. Clinton proposed an overhaul of export controls to fit the realities of a post-cold-war world, with the aim of easing the sale of machine tools and other high-tech stuff. The move seemed, politically, on target, because the protests matched up well: business wanted more, arms-control groups wanted less.  Health Reform: A Fatal Flaw? In his passion to fix the health care mess, President Clinton faces a built-in, possibly insurmountable problem: though everyone cheers the notion of ""universal coverage,"" many recoil at the idea of the Government running things. One lawmaker called the plan ""too bureaucratic, too governmental."" In other words, any ""government"" plan may be doomed. And last week the American Association of Retired Persons declined to support the Clinton plan. That one hurt. The group has 33 million members -- with great interest in health care -- and Mr. Clinton has put a lot of effort into getting its backing.  Greenspan Keeps 'em Hopping  Alan Greenspan, whose every utterance is scrutinized by the markets, tried to make something perfectly clear last week. No, the Fed chairman insisted before Congress, inflation is under control. No, there's no reason for long-term interest rates to rise just because he'd nudged short-term rates up. President Clinton liked what he heard, but the markets were of two minds, with stock and bond prices rising on Tuesday, falling on Wednesday and plunging on Thursday before steadying on Friday -- with rates cited as a factor all week. Putting the Hot News on Ice  Instant communications. It practically defines our age. Beepers, pocket phones, mercilessly up-to-the-second scheduling gadgets. But wait -- something very curious happened last week. The big story of the winter -- forget the snow, forget the earthquake, even forget Paramount -- was the duel between Ms. Apple Pie and Ms. Pool Hall. But when the ached-for moment came at last, most people didn't know 'til hours later. They didn't want to know (""Don't ruin it for me!"") or blocked out the fact that during prime-time figure skating, it was the dead of night in Norway. CBS kept up the fiction, pounding every drum in reach as it opened its coverage of this great taped drama, now seven hours old.  Heading Off That First Puff  Dr. Joycelyn Elders is committed to cutting smoking, and last week, in the 23d Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, she took the battle to a new front. Noting that tobacco companies lose nearly two million customers a year -- they either die or quit -- and must thus constantly recruit new ones, she urged that the focus be on preventing those first puffs. ""Young people are the chief source of new customers,"" she said, calling for a ban on advertising aimed at the young, like the Joe Camel ads. The Tobacco Institute insisted that ads are aimed at adult smokers. ""We don't need to target kids, and we don't,"" a spokesman said. . . . The tobacco industry got another blow on Friday when the F.D.A. ruled that cigarettes could be considered drugs -- and face regulation as such."

Some of the buying yesterday also represented traders covering short sales, which occurs when traders sell borrowed securities in hopes of buying them back at lower prices and pocketing the profit. Rising prices caused many short-sellers to take action sooner. **********Market watchers said the scramble to cover shorts was apparently touched off by rumors that some Fed governors might not go along with a rate increase when the Fed's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday. **********While many traders still expect a rate increase, Mr. Greenspan's comments yesterday helped to ease the nervousness about a tightening. Mr. Greenspan's testimony, in a regularly scheduled appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, indicated that the economy was doing well and that growth had slowed from an exuberant pace. Traders said the market reacted positively to Mr. Greenspan's testimony, even though he said nothing new. **********The price of the 30-year bond rose 10/32 , to 9626/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.77, from 7.80 percent on Wednesday. **********Shorter-maturity bill rates were mixed. In when-issued trading ahead of next week's Treasury auction of new bills, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.50 percent, and the five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.20 percent. Both yields showed marked improvement from the previous day. **********P. Christopher Leary, a senior vice president and portfolio manager for SunAmerica Asset Management, said trading was thin, but noted that some investors sold two- , three- and four-year maturities and bought ten-year notes and longer maturity bonds. Over all, he said, investors were positioning for an increase in interest rates of 50 basis points next week. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point. **********""Personally, one more rate hike is sufficient since we will see more indications of a slowdown in the economy over the next few months,"" Mr. Leary said. ""It usually takes about nine months for a tightening to work its way through the econony."" **********But there are investors and analysts who predict the Fed will not act next week and will instead wait until November before pushing rates up for a sixth time this year. **********The bond market brushed aside a report on unemployment claims yesterday, which showed initial claims down 7,000, to 320,000, for the week ended last Saturday. The number was slightly lower than expected, but consistent with the general theme of a steadily improving labor market. **********In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said there were signs that the product and labor markets might be nearing capacity limits. He said that the rest of the world was clearly doing better and the broad global expansion was the best in some time. **********Elsewhere, IBCA, Europe's leading international credit agency, announced yesterday that it had established a rating of BB for South Africa, marking the first assessment of the country by a recognized rating agency since the elections on April 27. **********The agency's rating puts South Africa in the same category as Argentina, Mexico and Hungary."

COUNCIL VOTES TOUGHER EMBARGO ON HAITIAN TRADE,U.N. COUNCIL VOTES TOUGHER EMBARGO ON HAITIAN TRADE," **********The Security Council voted unanimously today to impose a near-total trade embargo on Haiti to try to force its military rulers to permit the return of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power as President. **********The sanctions imposed on Haiti were those long demanded by Father Aristide himself but rejected for months by the Clinton Administration out of concern that they would deepen the economic hardship of ordinary Haitians with no guarantee that the steps would persuade the military to change its position. **********Haiti, which has one of the lowest living standards in the world, has been subject to a mandatory oil embargo since last fall, enforced by an international flotilla of warships, and a voluntary trade embargo by the United States and other Western Hemisphere countries. **********As a result, electricity has been scarce, unemployment is at 70 percent and it is estimated that most of the country's factories and stores have been shut. **********These conditions are expected to worsen under the newly enacted United Nations embargo, since Haiti would not be able to send its low-cost clothing, shoes or other goods for export anywhere. **********The vote for sanctions today came after rising political pressure from Congressional supporters of Father Aristide, as well as from those dissatisfied with President Clinton's failure to reverse President Bush's policy of sending back Haitian refugees fleeing by boat. **********The Administration signaled last week that it would change track and agree to more stringent measures on Haiti, and this week President Clinton and his aides have made a point of not ruling out possible military intervention to oust the junta from power. **********Some members of the Administration have said in Washington that they are under no illusions that the new sanctions will achieve their goal. Despite the widespread hardship, the ruling elite of Haiti is said to have largely escaped the worst effects of the sanctions already in place. **********The fuel embargo, for example, is being circumvented through imports from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Smuggled fuel supplies have enabled the military rulers to keep up their own operations -- including drug trafficking, United States drug enforcement officials say. **********The embargo has hampered the delivery of food and medicine to ordinary Haitians by relief agencies. May 21 Deadline **********Today's 15-to-0 decision by the Security Council gives Haiti's rulers until midnight on May 21 to comply with a peace agreement negotiated last summer at Governors Island in New York, under which the military agreed to hand over power to Father Aristide or face a general trade cutoff. The only exceptions to the embargo are to be imports of food, medicine and certain supplies like books, newspapers and visiting journalists' equipment. **********As a preliminary warning to Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and the members of his military government, the Security Council ordered a ban by all member nations on granting entry to some 600 of Haiti's top military and police officers as well as to all participants in the coup that forced Father Aristide from office in 1991. **********The ban has the force of law among the members of the United Nations. **********The resolution today also ""strongly urges"" member nations to freeze these officers' personal assets, but at European insistence it does not oblige them to do so. **********The resolution also immediately bars all private aircraft, though not scheduled airlines, from flying to or from Haiti, in a move aimed at depriving Haiti's rulers of the millions of dollars they are believed to be making from aerial drug smuggling. **********""This is a step that we did not want to have to take and a step we should never have had even to consider,"" the American representative at the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said today. **********Calling sanctions ""a blunt instrument,"" she told the Council that the Clinton Administration was ""acutely conscious"" that sanctions would aggravate the ordinary people's suffering, saying, ""That is why the United States, and the international community, is also undertaking humanitarian assistance measures in Haiti on a massive scale."" **********But it is not clear what sort of assistance she had in mind. Relief agencies and foreign governments' relief programs remain active in Haiti, but many of their activities have been hampered by problems. Iraqi and Yugoslav Embargos **********The near-total trade ban, if it goes into effect, will be similar to those the Security Council has imposed on Iraq as a result of its invasion of Kuwait and the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro for stirring up civil war in Bosnia. **********In each case the United Nations has been forced to organize a huge aid effort aimed at relieving the distress caused by the sanctions. **********The trade ban also means that the Council will be extending to the whole world and rendering mandatory the voluntary embargo already decided on by the United States and the other members of the Organization of American States, which many companies have been able to circumvent. **********Several speakers at today's Council meeting emphasized that the effectiveness of the threatened new embargo would depend on whether the Dominican Republic kept its pledge to enforce it effectively. **********Some diplomats warned that unless today's new sanctions achieved their political goals relatively quickly, Father Aristide's position could become more difficult if Haitians, or Haitian political leaders, believed that he was not doing enough to reach a settlement with the military. **********As President he already lacks a clear majority in Parliament, which was elected at the same time as he was. Parliamentary elections are due in October, and there is a fear that if these are held under a military government, they might be rigged."

The bad weather just makes this more so."" **********But an electronic web is not a substitute for all activities, and at the Boeing Company's helicopter operations in Ridley Township, Pa., south of Philadelphia, ""we were unable to complete test flights because of the weather,"" said Jack Satterfield, a Boeing spokesman. **********""We did not close,"" he said, ""but we had higher-than-normal absentee rates."" Problems in the Mid-South **********As the storm moved eastward through the mid-South, many companies ran into problems. **********""We lost production when people couldn't get in,"" said Jim Allen, a spokesman for the General Electric Company in Louisville, Ky., where washers and dryers, ranges and refrigerators are built. ""But we're making up for weather problems by working on Saturdays, and one more Saturday should catch us up."" **********At the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, a Tenneco Inc. subsidiary in Newport News, Va., one yard area was shut because of severe icing, said Jack Schnaedter, a company spokesman. The area is used to refit cargo ships as ""sealift"" vessels capable of carrying tanks and other heavy military equipment, he said, but ""it's a long-range project"" and losing a day is not significant. **********At another military contractor, Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Conn., the second and third shifts were canceled and first-shift workers were encouraged to leave early, said William Tuttle, a company spokesman. The same thing happened during last week's first snowstorm. **********But for all the interruptions in production, he said, Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation, has had no supply problems.  Two Shifts Canceled **********At Hamilton Standard in Windsor Locks, Conn., a United Technologies subsidiary that makes aircraft propellers and fuel-control systems for jet engines, the second and third shifts were also canceled, said John Mayo, a spokesman. Fewer than 1,000 of the company's 5,000 workers in Connecticut were affected, he said. **********One beneficiary of the bad weather is the natural gas industry. While many electrical lines are knocked out by winter storms, underground gas lines are generally unaffected, and demand has been steady and strong. **********Steven D. Chesebro', the president of Tenneco Gas, whose pipelines carry 14 percent of the natural gas used in the United States, said that industry inventories were likely to be down to about 36 percent of storage capacity as a result of last week's storms. The supply for the winter is more than adequate, he said, but current demand will create a strong market in the spring and summer. **********While the single biggest problem caused by the weather is the difficulty employees have in getting to work, some companies say supply problems have cropped up. **********Mr. Allen of G.E. in Louisville said some supplies were not getting in because of road and rail problems, and shipments of some finished appliances were delayed, though not enough to cause long-term concerns. Some Supplies Delivered Late **********Mr. Satterfield of Boeing Helicopter said some truck- and rail-delivered supplies were also late, but not a significant amount. **********In general, most corporate spokesmen had similar experiences to Len Doviak, who works for G.E. in Schenectady, N.Y. ""We haven't had production problems,"" he said. ""It's the paperwork that has difficulty in getting through."" **********While the Federal Express Corporation and many commercial airlines were badly disrupted on Friday, most seem to have caught up by Saturday night. ""We spent most of Saturday catching up, both with passengers and cargo that was delayed,"" said Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United Airlines. ""By Saturday evening we were back to our normal schedule."" **********During the storm Friday, United canceled about 50 flights, he said, and diverted some others away from the East Coast, as did other airlines.  Delta Air Lines, based in Atlanta, said its storm losses would be ""millions of dollars,"" said William D. Berry, a spokesman, adding, ""Just to give you one example, we had to purchase a couple of thousand of hotel rooms for stranded passengers."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/business/at-work-linking-gay-rights-and-unionism.html,Barbara Noble,1994-12-04,,771,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,At Work; Linking Gay Rights and Unionism,At Work; Linking Gay Rights and Unionism," **********A CONFERENCE of gay trade unionists was just one of hundreds of events last June organized to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion, the 1969 clash between the New York City Police and the patrons of a Greenwich Village gay bar that is generally regarded as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. But out of the Pride at Work conference, as it was called, a national organization has emerged. A leadership group of labor activists gathered in New York again late last month to formally ordain the National Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Transgender Labor Organization, the group's politically inclusive full title. Alas, no acronym dare speak its name, and so the group will be known as Pride at Work. It has a national mailing list of about 600 names. **********It may not seem like the most propitious moment for an alliance between the two groups most likely to be marginalized by those who must now be obeyed in Washington. The Democratic debacle is attributed in part to Bill Clinton's support for gay rights and his attempt to change the military's discriminatory sexual orientation policies early in his term. There are undoubtedly those in the union movement, with strong ties to the Democratic Party, who would regard gay rights as a lavender albatross. Supporting those issues, the argument would go, is to risk further alienating the gay-shy electorate. **********But as Pride at Work's organizers point out, they are not asking unions to do the right thing. Instead, they are trying to establish a power base that cannot be ignored, either in the political arena or when union locals are called on to support their gay and lesbian rank-and-file members who are being harassed at work. ""We want to be recognized as part of the labor movement,"" said Flo Stern, a spokeswoman for the group. ""We have to be visible wherever we are."" **********If the rank and file of the gay and labor movements would seem to have little in common other than an activist impulse, consider that neither group reflects its stereotype very faithfully. The liveliest segment of the labor movement is not in blue-collar industries dominated by workers who -- according to stereotype -- might be inclined to be hostile to homosexuality. The fastest-growing unions are those organizing white-collar and service industry workers. Some of those unions, especially the ones based in big cities, have a significant gay presence. **********On the other hand, new research indicates that gay men and lesbians aren't all ""guppies"" and ""dinks,"" which is to say, gay urban professionals and ""double income, no kids"" upwardly mobile couples without significant family financial responsibilities. A survey by a University of Maryland economist, Lee Badgett, revealed that both gay men and lesbians earn less on average than similarly qualified heterosexual men and women. **********Pride at Work envisions itself as a kind of mediator between gay and labor concerns, promoting civil rights within the unions and the labor perspective within the gay community. **********Part of the mission is to raise the consciousness of blue-collar workers who do fall into the stereotypical category, as well as to provide support for gay unionists in parts of the country where it is virtually impossible to be out of the closet. **********The group can build on the history of informal gay activism within the union movement, and gay caucuses of varying degrees of formality exist at several unions. Pride at Work is doing within the labor movement what many gay people in general are doing these days: Coming out after a long period of cogitation in which they were open in every way except putting a name to it.  Labor Notes *********** In the week before Thanksgiving, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants observed the first anniversary of its strike against American Airlines, which, to the surprise of most observers, nearly shut the carrier down. The parties have been in arbitration since Oct. 17 and expect to be there until at least February. Reports of the airline's improved financial condition may give the union leverage to fight off concessions. *********** Traffic accidents are the leading cause of occupational injuries. The Monthly Labor Review reports in its October issue that highway-related fatalities accounted for 20 percent of 6,271 fatal workplace injuries, based on statistics from the Labor Department's 1993 Census of Fatal Injuries. Homicide ranks second, at 17 percent of total job-related deaths. About half were of retail workers in grocery stores or restaurants who were killed during robberies or in the commission of some other crime. Roughly one victim in seven was done in by a ""co-worker or personal associate."""

Ameritech Says It May Link With a Wireless Communications Alliance"," **********The Ameritech Corporation, a regional Bell telephone company that has not expanded its cellular telephone operation beyond the Midwest, said today that it might join an alliance with other companies that are already creating nationwide wireless communications networks. **********Ameritech, based in Chicago, has not identified which alliance, if any, it might join. But it confirmed today that it had talked about combining its cellular operations with those of other wireless communications companies. **********""We are talking to many different people,"" Lorrie Secrest, a spokeswoman for Ameritech, said.3 Large Alliances **********So far, three big alliances have been formed in the rush to create a nationwide wireless communications network. The AT& T Corporation has agreed to acquire McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the country's largest cellular telephone company. Two regional Bell telephone companies, the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the Nynex Corporation, announced plans in June to merge their cellular businesses. And Airtouch Communications and U S West Inc. agreed last month to combine their cellular operations. A newspaper report today said Ameritech was talking about joining the Bell Atlantic-Nynex camp. The report, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal, also said U S West and Airtouch had approached Ameritech about joining its alliance. **********Airtouch, which is based in San Francisco and will own 70 percent of the combined Airtouch-U S West cellular business, would not comment on any talks with Ameritech. But Airtouch already has wireless licenses in Michigan and Ohio, two of the five Midwestern states where Ameritech operates. **********If Ameritech were to join the U S West-Airtouch pact, Airtouch would have to sell the overlapping licenses or swap them with other companies, an Airtouch spokeswoman, Susan Rosenberg, said. ""We are interested in adding new partners,"" she said, ""but we want partners that would expand our footprint to serve more markets."" **********Bell Atlantic and Nynex, whose pact would create a cellular network from Maine to Virginia, hopes to attract other cellular partners to expand its network nationwide. The two companies said they had talked with other regional Bells about joining their alliance. **********And Ms. Secrest of Ameritech said that company had talked with other regional Bell telephone companies about combining cellular operations.Potentially a Good Fit **********Ameritech might be a good fit with Bell Atlantic and Nynex, analysts said. The company has 1.5 million cellular customers, including subscribers in five Midwestern markets that rank among the nation's 25 largest. Ameritech has licenses to provide wireless service to 22 million people in markets in five states. **********Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are partners in another venture. Each of the two companies has a stake of 24.9 percent in New Zealand Telecommunications, the telephone company in New Zealand. **********Cellular telephone companies expect to pay high prices later this year at a Government auction of licenses that could help companies build nationwide wireless communications services. And they are rushing to form alliances with one another to expand into as many vital markets as possible before then. **********""Companies are going to need a lot of money to participate in the auctions,"" said Connie Luecke, an analyst at Duff & Phelps Inc. ""By teaming with other partners, companies can pool their financial resources."" **********The auction for broad-band airwaves, which will be held later this year, could generate up to $9.4 billion, considerably more than the $650 million that the Government received in the auction last month of narrow-band airwaves, she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/business/economic-scene-who-will-pay-for-universal-health-care-well-off-households.html,Peter Passell,1994-07-28,,815,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Economic Scene; Who will pay for universal health care? Well-off households.,Economic Scene; Who will pay for universal health care? Well-off households.," **********WHO wants to pay for universal health coverage? The answer, as the current debate is making all too clear, is no one. Indeed, for some interests who have campaigned for change -- notably big business -- the whole idea is to shed part of their financial burden. **********But as a flock of studies have shown, the contretemps over who pays is a shell game: One way or another, households with above-average incomes, not businesses or government, would almost certainly pick up the tab for broader coverage. And President Clinton's understandable wish to obscure this reality may prove too clever by half. ""He may end up without a good bill -- or the support to push a mediocre one through Congress,"" said Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. **********Most Americans below age 65 have private medical insurance, and most of them receive it as a fringe benefit. So it was easy to see why the White House chose to build on the current system, requiring all employers to do what most now do to attract and keep valued workers. In fact, the political case for expanding the employer mandate seemed like a no-brainer when the President's task force was assembling the Health Security Act. **********Those working without insurance would obviously be delighted by the prospect of something for nothing. More important, big businesses would be pleased, since they had much to gain: Their current premiums are inflated by doctors and hospitals, who look to private insurance to cover the costs of the uninsured and to supplement reimbursements offered by Medicare and Medicaid. **********Organized labor, too, likes the idea of an employer mandate. Among other virtues it would take the pressure off unions, which have been asked to share employee medical costs by companies claiming to need the break to remain competitive. **********But the politics of mandates has proved subtler than was widely reckoned. **********To woo small businesses, which typically do not provide health insurance today, Mr. Clinton offered subsidies linked to the number of employees. The subsidy rate has proved inadequate to break small- business resistance, however -- indeed, the concession seems to have invigorated lobbyists who scent weakness like wolves on the hunt. And the subsidy has alienated big businesses, which assume they will somehow be stuck with the cost. **********Most galling from the perspective of economists, the subsidy is sloppily targeted. While small businesses do employ a disproportionate share of low-wage workers, tens of thousands of beneficiaries of the subsidy would be middle- and upper-income employees. ""It doesn't make any sense at all,"" Mr. Reinhardt said. **********The broader economic problem is that the employer mandate is built on a misunderstanding. Virtually everyone thinks the money would come from employers' pockets. But there is a huge body of research by labor economists suggesting that employees as a group bear the costs. In one classic study published in 1991, Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. and Alan Kreuger of Princeton found that 85 percent of workers' compensation insurance costs were reflected in lower wages. **********This finding implies that an ""individual mandate"" requiring families to buy health insurance, with subsidies for those who can't afford it, would generate roughly the same impact on incomes. And indeed, a new study by John Holahan, Sheila Zedlewski and Colin Winterbottom of the Urban Institute confirms it. **********The research, commissioned by the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimates that the President's employer mandate would transfer roughly 6 percent of the income from families in the top fifth of the economic pecking order to pay for the care of the bottom fifth. So would an individual mandate, with insurance premiums linked to income. For that matter, so does the current system, in which a portion of private health insurance premiums along with tax revenues are siphoned from the rich to pay for both the uninsured and those insured by the Government. **********But while the individual approach would certainly make it clear who was really paying, it is hardly an ideal way to finance medical costs. Subsidies that made insurance affordable to the near-poor, Ms. Zedlewski notes, would discourage work effort by sharply rising insurance bills as incomes approached middle-class levels. **********Isn't there a better way? Mr. Reinhardt is a fan of the German system, which fudges the political issue of whether employers or employees pay by collecting a fixed percentage of payrolls to cover health costs. **********If Americans really understood the bottom line, he believes they would opt to eliminate mandates entirely and cover medical costs from a broad-based tax, much the way they pay for Medicare and Medicaid today. For contrary to the conventional wisdom about ""single payer"" systems, the approach need not go hand in hand with socialized medicine. **********""You could collect the money in one pot,"" Mr. Reinhardt said, ""and still use it to finance Clinton-style managed competition."""

Show of Unity **********The show of unity by the governments with the greatest influence with Bosnia's Muslims, Serbs and Croats seemed likely to increase pressure on the warring parties to accept the peace plan. **********The foreign ministers also supported efforts in the United Nations Security Council that threaten to punish any parties that takes offensive action near Brcko, a Serbian-held town in northern Bosnia where Western diplomats fear an outburst of fighting. **********But otherwise, the meeting produced no new threats or inducements to the Bosnian factions, and it is unclear whether the increased diplomatic pressure will produce a settlement. **********""This is the first time since the beginning of the war,"" said Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France, ""that the Europeans, Americans and Russians have agreed not on a vague formula, but on numerous details for an overall settlement."" **********One senior American official was so optimistic about the unity among the major powers that he predicted a cessation of hostilities in four to six weeks. **********But the ministers acknowledged that after two years of bitter strife that has left an estimated 200,000 people dead, Bosnia's warring parties might not agree to resume negotiations or accept the details of the peace plan. **********""All of this is very fragile, very delicate, and can easily founder,"" said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany. Confidence in Jawboning **********The ministers voiced confidence that through jawboning by the major powers and maintaining the existing array of carrots and sticks -- like continuing economic sanctions against Serbia or renewing old threats to pull out United Nations peacekeepers -- the parties would get down to serious peace talks. **********For example, to pressure the Bosnian Government to get serious about a peace settlement, Mr. Juppe renewed a threat to withdraw France's 6,000 peacekeepers from the Balkans if there was no concrete movement toward peace soon. Mr. Christopher repeated suggestions that the United States might push for lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia if the war continued indefinitely. **********American officials also repeated threats to more strictly enforce the economic embargo against Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs, who are supplied by Serbia, rejected new negotiations. **********The proposed 51-49 division of land would require concessions by both sides. The Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs tentatively endorsed such a division last fall as part of a European-led peace effort, but they have since retreated from that compromise and are demanding far more land for themselves. The Government now insists on 58 pecent, while the Serbs are demanding 60 percent. **********As an inducement to the Bosnian Serbs, the Europeans, who have long called for phasing out sanctions on Serbia if they move toward peace, won United States backing for gradually lifting the sanctions. Russia Urges Lifting Sanctions **********Russia's Parliament voted today in favor of immediate lifting of the sanctions on Serbia, but Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, endorsed the European proposal to phase out the sanctions once the Serbs began to comply in good faith with a peace plan. **********American officials say the time is ripe for a settlement. Serbia, they say, is being strangled by economic sanctions and is tired of being viewed as an international pariah. The Bosnian Serbs also see that the Bosnian Government, thanks in part to a new federation with Croatia, is in the strongest military position it has held in two years. **********American officials asserted that the Bosnian Government, which now controls less than 30 percent of the country, should look longingly at a plan offering them 51 percent. **********A senior American official said today's communique offered the Muslims not just quantity of land, but also quality. The official said it was important that Russia had endorsed a plan saying the final arrangement for Bosnia should provide the country ""with viable, realistic and reasonable territory."" **********With such a formula and with 51 percent of the land, the official said, the Bosnian Government should be able to regain much of the conquered territory in the east and north that it so eagerly wants back. **********""We have to get the best possible solution for the Bosnian Government,"" the American official said. But no proposal for actual boundaries was made today. **********--------------------       Iran Said to Violate Embargo **********SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, May 13 (AP) -- Iran has smuggled material for making weapons to the Bosnian Government in violation of a 1991 United Nations arms embargo on all sides in the war, a senior Bosnian Army official confirmed today. **********The Bosnian Army also received a large shipment of antitank rockets delivered to Croatia by a Brazilian ship, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

To fill 'er up in 10 minutes, requires at least 200 kilowatts of power for the average electronic vehicle. Because a 200-kilowatt charger is too heavy to be carried in a car, the charger must be offboard in an electric filling station. **********And the charging cable cannot be a simple line cord that plugs into a wall socket or a socket on a parking meter.

At stake are a band of reserves estimated to hold some 15 billion barrels of oil -- 50 percent more than the Prudhoe Bay fields, currently one of the largest sources of United States oil. **********The companies are emboldened by the results from the current deep-water record holder, Shell Oil's Auger platform, tethered to the gulf floor in water half a mile deep. Since the Auger went into production in April, several of its nine wells have yielded oil in daily volumes far higher than ever before recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. **********Other companies, including Texaco Inc., are now also expected to start moving their deep-water plans beyond the drawing broad. **********""It's become well known that Auger has performed very well,"" said Clive Fowler, vice president of Amoco's offshore business unit. ""That's extremely positive for the entire industry."" **********The plan to go after that oil bears an economic importance far greater than the volume of the reserves themselves, which under full production would probably meet less than 10 percent of the nation's daily demand for oil. But with about half the oil the United States uses coming from foreign sources -- imports are expected to total about 2.73 billion barrels this year -- the deep-water fields would be a significant new source of domestic oil that would give the nation greater bargaining power in the global energy market. **********Just as development of Prudhoe Bay helped dampen the impact of price shocks and ease the nation's dependence on Middle Eastern oil during the 1970's and early 1980's, development of deep-water fields in the Gulf of Mexico could help counter any new moves by the OPEC countries to revive slumping oil prices by curtailing production. **********""That kind of development will slow the rate of our dependency on imports,"" said John Hervey, oil analyst for the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********The plan by Amoco, Exxon and Shell calls for the companies together to spend nearly $1 billion to anchor an oil production platform 3,220 feet below the gulf's surface at a site about 140 miles southeast of New Orleans. The platform, which would be called Ram-Powell, would begin producing oil in 1998. It would be some 400 feet deeper than Shell's Auger platform, and nearly 300 feet deeper than a Shell platform named Mars that is now under construction and is scheduled to enter production in 1996. **********Shell Oil's board has already approved the plan, and the Amoco and Exxon boards are expected to approve it by the end of the month. **********The depth of an offshore platform must be understood as a separate measurement from the depth of the oil wells feeding into it. A platform amounts to an entire petroleum factory, collecting the oil piped to it from perhaps dozens of wells, temporarily storing it and then either loading it onto tankers or feeding it into pipelines connected to shore. **********A well, by contrast, is little more than a hole bored deep into the earth's surface, often several miles or more, until it hits a pocket of oil or natural gas. Natural geological pressure sends the oil or gas to the surface through piping that has been fed into the well as it is drilled. **********In terms of wells alone, the deepest undersea well right now is operated in the Campos Basin off Brazil by Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil company. That well, just past the edge of a sharp drop-off, begins 3,369 feet beneath the water's surface. But it feeds its oil back to a platform anchored in water far shallower than what is now being contemplated in the Gulf of Mexico. **********The deep-water platforms in the gulf are intended eventually to allow development of hundreds of wells past the continental shelf, where the gulf's floor drops off sharply and beyond which offshore production had not been considered feasible before the Shell Auger. **********Building such factories, able to withstand the winds and waves of deep waters without losing their moorings, has required new and improved technologies that include the use of deep-diving robots for construction and maintenance. And unlike earlier rigs in shallower water, which were built on rigid towers, the deep-water platforms are floating hulls tethered by steel tendons to barn-size anchors. **********It is not a cheap way to build, and persuading companies to invest in such engineering feats has required the use of increasingly accurate seismic mapping techniques and the creation of detailed, three-dimensional computer models of the petroleum deposits beneath the gulf's floor. **********Mr. Fowler of Amoco said the techniques could also lead to development of fields known to be lying in deep water elsewhere in the world, like off the coast of West Africa. **********It may seem risky to spend nearly $1 billion to develop such platforms at a time when the price of oil -- $17 to $18 a barrel -- is low by historicalstandards. **********But the Gulf of Mexico's deeper reaches are alluring to American oil companies, in light of dwindling production closer to shore, as well as in Prudhoe Bay and elsewhere in the United States, that increasingly has forced the companies to bear the economic and political risks of developing oil overseas. **********In the case of Auger, on which Shell spent $1.2 billion, the main risk was not that it would fail to yield oil and gas but whether they would flow to the surface in quantities large enough to justify the investment. Of the nine wells now feeding up to the Auger, two have flowed a gulf-record rate of up to 13,000 barrels of oil a day. And the others are averaging 10,000 barrels a day -- well above the 6,000-a-day target that Shell had set. **********'It's very exciting and encouraging,"" said Rich Pattarozzi, general manager of the deep-water division of Shell Oil's offshore unit. ""It was very critical to have high flow rates to make deep water successful."" **********With benefit of Shell's experience, the industry expects to see the relative cost of such projects decline. Shell itself is already well along in construction of the Mars platform, which is expected to cost about the same as Auger to build, even though it is in deeper water. **********And further into the future, Shell hopes to improve its techniques and reduce costs further by drawing on the deep-water experience of Exxon and Amoco. The three companies have assembled a 40-person team to develop the Ram-Powell platform. **********Judy Wagner, who manages several projects in the Gulf of Mexico for British Petroleum, said, ""Auger has made people much more comfortable that you can put a platform at that water depth."" **********She cautioned, however, that to venture significantly deeper than the Ram-Powell platform, to depths of 4,000 feet to 6,000 feet where oil is known to lie, will entail new technical challenges. Because the impact of wind and waves on such structures would be significantly greater, new and costlier safeguards will probably be needed, Ms. Wagner said. **********Still, the projects, if they proceed, could be a boon to hundreds of companies, many of them based in Louisiana and Texas, that have roles in creating, setting up and maintaining the platforms. The gulf region has been hit hard by the decline of the domestic oil industry which has shrunk to about 450,000 workers currently from 920,000 workers in 1982. Hundreds of small companies have gone under or have been absorbed by larger competitors. **********""Without the advent of deep water, this industry is going to continue to decline,"" said Bobby Rawle, vice president of North American Operations for McDermott International, a company based in New Orleans which is a major supplier and builder of offshore structures for exploration and production. ""We need this."""

In fact, rates are rising, at least for some consumers, and the only cure is more competition. **********Consider basic rates -- those outside MCI's ""Friends and Family"" program and the other highly touted discount plans. Twice in the last six months, AT&T raised its per-minute charges for basic long-distance calls. Last Aug. 1, prices rose almost 4 percent and, on Jan. 1, they were increased 6.3 percent. **********Ditto for MCI and Sprint, which together with AT&T control at least 86 percent of the market.. Within days of the two AT&T rate increases, those long-distance companies implemented virtually identical raises. Their speed in doing so -- MCI raised rates four days after AT&T -- surprised even Wall Street. And the future will apparently bring more of the same. On June 1, AT&T will again raise some rates, by 4 percent. **********Even more surprising is that these rates are soaring while the three companies' biggest cost, access charges, is falling. **********These charges, which are paid to local phone companies to help finance below-cost local service, account for about 40 percent of long-distance costs. But since 1984, these charges have been getting lower and lower because a federally mandated ""subscriber line charge"" has shifted many costs directly to subscribers. **********For the long-distance companies, the savings from this change are massive. Total access charges paid by AT&T fell from almost $29 billion in 1985 to $14 billion last year. But today, AT&T customers do not profit from the lower costs. **********This pattern -- substantial price increases, despite lower costs, by a few large companies -- is consistent with what economists call oligopolistic behavior. The term denotes an uncompetitive industry run by a handful of powerful sellers. **********Long-distance prices haven't always been on the rise. When access charges declined from 1984 to 1991, long-distance rates fell, too. But the big three have not passed along cost decreases since then, for several plausible reasons. The economic recovery may have given them greater freedom to raise rates. So too may have a regulatory change a few years ago, under which AT&T's allowed earnings are measured on a price cap rather than a rate-of-return basis. **********Or it may be that, at 22 percent and 10 percent of the market respectively, MCI and Sprint are too big to want to give AT&T the price competition they gave when they were smaller. The reason: the bigger a company's market share, the costlier is price competition. **********But, whatever the cause, consumers no longer benefit from lower costs. **********In defense, the long-distance companies say their customers are saving money by switching from basic-rate service to the heavily advertised discount plans. But -- TV celebrities notwithstanding -- these plans are not price competition that would help consumers. They are just more of the same oligopolistic behavior. **********Here's why. Under current regulations, the Federal Communications Commission essentially caps the per-minute rates that AT&T can charge. When AT&T offers a discount plan, it tells the F.C.C. its revenues will dip below those allowed by the rates. Then AT&T can jack up the basic rates to replace revenues lost to the discount plan. **********In other words, AT&T robs Peter to pay Paul. ""Paul"" is enrolled in the discount plan. ""Peter"" is the customer who pays only basic rates; he often makes too few long-distance calls for the discount plan to make sense. **********MCI and Sprint, which are not regulated at all, simply follow AT&T's lead, keeping their rates just below the industry leader's. **********What's the solution? Congress must open up the entire telecommunications market to competition -- something now forbidden under court decrees stemming from the breakup of AT&T 10 years ago and other cases. We must give the seven local Bell companies and the long-distance ones access to each other's markets. The long-distance companies say they will lower local phone rates, and the Bells promise to cut long-distance rates 50 percent over the next 10 years. **********Consumers deserve to benefit from the competition this access will foster. But if things stay the same, the cozy trio of long-distance companies will remain ""Friends and Family."" And that's not fair to the long-suffering public."

Furthermore, the $88 million came from more than $140 million of excess cash that has been generated. What do our investors get? Some cash, stock, bonds and a 52 percent ownership in the second-largest drug chain in the country.

Vending-Machine Technology Pushes Electronics Frontier"," **********IN the recent movie ""Flesh and Bone,"" Dennis Quaid plays a melancholy vending machine serviceman named Arlis Sweeney who shleps through diners and topless bars in West Texas, servicing what have to be some of the oldest vending machines on earth, a rusted collection of ancient candy machines and decrepit condom dispensers. **********In fact, vending machines are close to shedding their low-technology image. During the last seven years, the vending machine industry has embraced high-technology. Sleek, electronic machines loaded with circuit boards and microprocessors are replacing their mechanical predecessors, which are filled with gears, chains and wires. For consumers, the change has meant devices that make fewer mistakes, serving cups of coffee, for example, instead of just the empty cups. **********Now the industry is increasing the data-processing intelligence of the machines to make them less labor-intensive and expensive to service. **********Until very recently, vending machine route drivers -- the industry's Arlis Sweeneys -- generally had to open the machines, count how much product was left, check the coin boxes and make sure the machines worked. **********With the new electronics, many of those chores can be done with computers. That has helped some companies reduce by up to 30 percent the number of drivers they use and simplify product ordering and inventory control. **********With more sophisticated circuitry, vending machine communication may soon become a two-way street, with companies controlling units from central computers miles away and carrying out chores like changing the prices on products, resetting thermostats and verifying credit cards. **********But for now, the roughly $25 billion-a-year vending industry is counting smaller victories, like the new electronics standard that was formally endorsed last October by the National Automatic Merchandising Association, a trade group. **********""Until about a year ago, most of the data-gathering capability in vending machines was built into the coin acceptors of the units, rather than into their central control units, or controllers, mostly because of the lack of a standard,"" said Warren Philips, president of the Validata Computer and Research Corporation, a computer systems company in Montgomery, Ala., that serves the vending industry. **********Vending operators can place in their machines electronic controllers that process data from a machine's coin acceptor, bill validator or the thermometer used to keep soft-drink bottles chilled. These controllers, in turn, communicate with data-transmission technologies similar to the hand-held computer tracking systems long used by parcel delivery companies, or through wireless data communication networks. **********Hand-held computers have caught on only recently, and some vending machine route drivers use them to ""read"" the status of certain machines in one to four seconds. **********Some devices are plugged directly into the machines, while others use infrared technology to scan data like the type of product that goes into each vending column of a machine. **********When the data is processed, the computers prepare restocking lists for the route drivers. Then they recalculate the amount of product that is left in the driver's truck, giving the company greater control of inventory. At the end of the day, the data from the units equipped with modems can be loaded into the main computer at the warehouse. **********""Most of our customers are telling us they're reducing inventory by 20 percent,"" Alan Kronenberg, founder of Compu Vend Systems in Bridge City, La., said of the system. **********At A. H. Vending and Food Services in Rolling Meadows, Ill., Craig Hesch, vice president of administration, said hand-held units had reduced by two-thirds the time it took to enter data from vending machines into the company's computer. **********Mr. Philips of Validata said that while hand-held computer systems typically required an investment of $5,000 to $6,000 for each vending route, they often paid for themselves in about eight months. **********Many vending machine operators would like to eliminate unnecessary service routes, which is where wireless transmission technologies carry an edge. Real Time Data, a wireless communications company in Bellevue, Wash., says it is testing a wireless data communications system for vending operators. **********Real Time's system relies on an interface board installed inside a vending machine and hooked to a standard I.B.M. personal computer at the vending company's warehouse. Real Time's software keeps tabs on the machine's inventory, malfunctions and break-ins. **********Cyplex, a wireless data communications company in Nashua, N.H., is developing the communications technology that will help the vending machine industry use the advanced wireless data network operated by RAM Mobile Data, a business venture of RAM Broadcasting and BellSouth. While the network is expensive to use, it offers robust two-way data-handling capability and is available in more than 200 metropolitan areas in the United States and about a dozen other countries. **********Some technology quirks still need to be worked out. ""We've discovered that the data we receive electronically doesn't always match what we get manually,"" said Gailard Ring, director of equipment support services for the Canteen Corporation, a food service company in Spartanburg, S.C.. His company is testing the new wireless data technology on 100 vending machines. **********Mr. Ring said the discrepancy may be caused by the noise that moving parts like motors typically generated, especially in older machines. That noise can interfere with electronic signals, he said. **********For some vending companies, cost is a deciding factor. The hardware for wireless communications costs about $500 for each vending machine, and service fees add an additional $10 a month. Some vending companies are linking banks of machines together so they need only one communications device. **********Dixie-Narco in Williston, S.C., which sells vending machines mostly to can and bottle vendors, is taking a longer-term view. Douglas Drenten, vice president for group engineering, said the ""technology ultimately may make sense."" **********""If an individual bottler has 50 route drivers, this technology could reduce the number to 25 drivers,"" Mr. Drenten said. ""But the technology might pay for itself by eliminating just one driver."""

You will know instantly why H. Wayne Huizenga, the chairman of the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, the largest video renter in the world, has a spare $1.25 billion burning a hole in his pocket. **********In the Viacom-Blockbuster merger plan announced yesterday, Blockbuster will immediately invest that amount to bolster Viacom's once-faltering bid for Paramount. In the process, Mr. Huizenga (pronounced high-ZEEN-ga) has transformed Blockbuster's minority holding into a position of power at Viacom. **********Mr. Huizenga, already a billionaire, will become even richer from selling his Blockbuster stock to Viacom. He will also become vice chairman of the combined company at a presumably large salary and will be able to fill 3 Blockbuster seats on the 12-member Viacom board. **********The two companies valued the merger, largely a stock swap, at $8.4 billion. But as part of the deal, Viacom gains cash, by dint of Blockbuster's agreement to pay $1.25 billion for 23 million shares of Viacom's class B nonvoting stock, at $55 a share. Viacom, in turn, will offer Blockbuster shareholders a package of Viacom stock and options worth $30.97 for each Blockbuster share. **********Although the $1.25 billion cash infusion from Blockbuster is intended to help Viacom continue its pursuit of Paramount, the Viacom-Blockbuster merger is to be completed whether or not Viacom acquires Paramount. **********Last October, both Blockbuster and the Nynex Corporation were widely criticized on Wall Street for spending large sums of money for largely passive investments in Viacom: $600 million by Blockbuster and $1.2 billion by Nynex. Surpassing Nynex **********But as the bidding for Paramount escalated, Nynex, a regional Bell company with heavily regulated telephone holdings, had been discouraged from investing further by mounting criticism from government regulators and telephone customers. That has left the deal-loving Mr. Huizenga poised to invest an additional $1.25 billion, surpass Nynex and seize a position of influence at Viacom. **********If the combined Viacom-Blockbuster succeeds in acquiring the much larger Paramount, the resulting conglomerate will own a large array of entertainment assets. With combined revenues of $7.3 billion, a combined Viacom-Blockbuster-Paramount would be the nation's fourth-largest media and entertainment company, behind Capital Cities/ABC, Walt Disney and the biggest media company, Time Warner. **********Mr. Huizenga is the largest individual shareholder in Blockbuster, with 8 percent of the shares. Yesterday's announcement was the culmination of his strategy in recent years of buying stakes in entertainment-programming companies to keep products flowing into his video stores. **********The investments included a 37 percent stake in Republic Pictures, a film library and syndicator of television programs, and a 71 percent stake in Spelling Entertainment, a library of television programs and a syndicator of shows like ""Beverly Hills 90210."" **********But in the short term, Mr. Huizenga's latest move gives Blockbuster shareholders little to cheer about, said Barry Bryant, an analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. **********With a buyout offer from Viacom worth about $31 for each Blockbuster share, Blockbuster shareholders will get a scant premium for their stock, which closed at $28.25, down $1.625, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. As recently as Nov. 30, the shares were at a 52-week high of $34.25. **********To insure that Viacom's offer to Blockbuster shareholders does not fall below $31 a share, Viacom is giving an additional type of security called a ""variable common right,"" which is intended to make up any shortfall if the shares decline in trading. **********""There's a nasty way of looking at this and a magical way of looking at this,"" Mr. Bryant said. ""The nasty view is that Wayne sold out his shareholders for a chance to walk into the candy store. But the magical view is that Blockbuster stock is overvalued at $30 a share -- especially in view of the threat from video-on-demand -- and that Wayne is getting out of the horse and buggy before the automobile hits the road."" **********Video-on-demand refers to the coming era of interactive cable television networks that will enable consumers to order movies through computerized television sets, and stop, start and rewind the films just as they do with VCR's. **********For his part, Mr. Bryant leans slightly toward the ""magical"" view, in which Mr. Huizenga is wise to sell Blockbuster while video rental is still a lucrative business. **********The Viacom deal represents a peak in the extraordinary rise of Mr. Huizenga, who started his career as a 23-year-old garbage collector in Pompano Beach, Fla. **********Whether it was with garbage cans or videotapes, the secret to his success was simple, he told an interviewer last year: ""If I rent something, basically I'm selling the same thing over and over."" **********Mr. Huizenga founded Blockbuster Video, in 1985 as a Dallas video store and quickly turned it into an empire based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The company's revenues tripled from 1989 to 1992, reaching $1.2 billion. And earnings also grew threefold, to $142 million in 1992. Analysts say Blockbuster's earnings have been helped by the magic of videocassette accounting. Take, for example, a videotape of a hot-renting film like Paramount's ""Indecent Proposal."" At retail, ""Indecent Proposal"" would sell for nearly $100. But dealers like Blockbuster can buy a copy for $35 to $75. Some films can be had at a wholesale price of as little as $8. **********Popular films are often rented as many as 75 times at about $3 a rental over the first year, generating $225 -- or three times the tape's acquisition cost. Such multiples account for much of Blockbuster's enormous cash flow."

Flextech will issue new shares of common stock to United Artists now valued at $296.4 million. **********Among the programming that United Artists provides to cable operators are the Learning Channel, the Discovery Channel and the Country Music Channel. Flextech's shares have surged more than 40 percent since October, when the company said a takeover was planned."

Officials of several phone companies said there could be more than 500 circuits once full telephone service was restored. **********If an agreement is signed and the Clinton Administration approves, the number of calls between the United States and Cuba could rise to 25,000 a day from the present 100 or so, telecommunications officials said. The three-decade-old embargo restricted phone service and that limited service was decimated when Hurricane Andrew destroyed AT&T Corporation's equipment in Cuba in 1992. **********Telecommunication companies and Administration officials said the Cuban Government had shown far more flexibility over the last two weeks on the central issue that was holding up the yearlong telecommunications talks: the cost of collect calls from Cuba. **********Late last month Havana backed off its insistence on a surcharge of $4.85 for each collect call, which the Clinton Administration had rejected. Under the newest Cuban proposal, the surcharge on collect calls would be one dollar, a figure that Administration officials said was in line with the rate in other Caribbean countries. **********""We may be looking to a breakthrough on telecommunications,"" an Administration official said. ""The Cubans have come back with an offer on the surcharge that looks very reasonable."" **********The telecommunications talks are part of a subtle effort in which the Administration appears to be signaling that if Cuba signs an immigration agreement and curbs the flow of boat people, Washington is prepared to respond positively. **********Lawrence Codacovi, MCI's vice president for international services, said he was confident that the Administration would approve a phone accord with Cuba despite the tensions over boat people. **********""Re-establishing phone service might solve some of the problems because Cubans in the U.S. could tell people in Cuba don't leave on a raft,"" he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/business/your-taxes-no-child-s-play-building-a-low-tax-college-fund.html,Carole Gould,1994-02-27,,798,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,No Child's Play: Building a Low-Tax College Fund,YOUR TAXES; No Child's Play: Building a Low-Tax College Fund," **********CONGRESS created the ""kiddie tax"" in 1986 to stop parents from shifting income to their children solely to reduce taxes. Last year, it bumped up the tax rates on trust income, greatly diminishing the use of another tax-saving tool. **********""I used to be a magician,"" said Edward Mendlowitz, a partner in Mendlowitz Weitsen, a New York accounting firm. ""Years ago, I could save people seven times my fee -- no more."" **********Although the opportunities have been greatly limited, there are still ways to sidestep some taxes while building college funds for children. **********John and Sue Ferguson, of St. Louis, have constructed a detailed savings plan for their three daughters, Kelly, Katherine and Courtney. First, the couple made gifts of income-producing assets to them. Each daughter will pay tax on $1,200 of income a year. When children under 14 have dividends, interest and unearned income exceeding that amount, the excess is taxed at the parents' rate. This is known as the kiddie tax. **********But these children pay just $90 on the first $1,200 of income. The first $600 is sheltered by the personal exemption amount, and the next $600 is taxed at the low rate of 15 percent. **********Shifting this income saves the Fergusons $385 per child each year. That is the difference between the tax owed on $1,200 at the parents' 39.6 percent rate and the $90 owed by the children, said Anna Polizzi-Keller, the partner at Ernst & Young in St. Louis who devised the plan. **********The parents gave the girls stock and stock mutual funds, knowing that taxes on gains can largely be deferred until the shares are sold. The Fergusons also bought tax-free bonds in the girls' names, and Series EE Savings Bonds. Although income tax is not a concern on these instruments, shifting ownership to the daughters allowed the couple to reduce the size of their estate, and thereby any estate tax when they die. They can give each girl up to $20,000 a year without incurring a gift tax. **********Because the kiddie tax stops at age 14, the daughters can sell appreciated assets and reinvest the proceeds in other financial instruments. Any income after age 14 will be taxed at their lower 15 percent rate, versus their parents' 39.6 percent top tax rate. **********Not everyone puts such a premium on skirting taxes. Rob Clarfeld, a partner in Clarfeld & Company, a New York accounting and financial planning firm, takes a long view in investing for his sons, Larry, 8, and Joshua, 5. **********""We're putting away money regularly for the kids' education,"" Mr. Clarfeld said, ""and because we have such a long time horizon, most of the money is in equities."" **********About a third of the boys' stock funds are in accounts set up under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act. The accounts throw off little income, but Mr. Clarfeld said the tax shelter did not drive his decision. **********""My biggest concern isn't the tax, it's to get the biggest amount of money to make sure their educations are fully funded."" **********A big problem with gift accounts is that children gain complete control of the money when they turn 18 or 21, depending on the state. For that reason, Mr. Clarfeld keeps two-thirds of his boys' money in a 2503(c) trust, also called an educational trust. **********THE 1993 tax act stepped up taxes on trust income that is not paid out to the beneficiary. Trust income of more than $5,500 is now taxed at 36 percent, and any amount over $7,500 is taxed at 39.6 percent. Previously, the top rate was 31 percent, and that rate did not kick in until trust income reached $11,250. **********Even so, the tax changes ""aren't enough to make me discount its use,"" Mr. Clarfeld said, noting that control was his primary objective. Mr. Clarfeld's attorney, who is trustee, will use the money in the trust to pay the boys' college costs. Larry and Joshua will be able to withdraw a third of any remaining money when they turn 25, half when they turn 30 and the balance at 35. **********Parents can report their children's income on their own tax returns or file separate returns for their children. If the children own equities, separate returns are required. And many families may reduce their tax bill by filing separate returns for their children. **********But filing a child's return is not as easy as it might seem, Ms. Polizzi-Keller warned. Capital gains are figured using a formula that takes into account both the children's and parents' gains. Instructions can be found on Form 8615, which must be attached to the child's 1040."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/10/business/report-on-prices-renews-concerns-of-more-inflation.html,Sylvia Nasar,1994-09-10,,1148,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,REPORT ON PRICES RENEWS CONCERNS OF MORE INFLATION,REPORT ON PRICES RENEWS CONCERNS OF MORE INFLATION," **********Producer prices rose a surprising six-tenths of a percent in August, the biggest monthly rise in nearly four years. The spurt in prices fanned fears that inflation, which has been below 3 percent for three years, is speeding up. **********The surge in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which measures price changes at the nation's farms and factories, made another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve more likely this fall. It also sent stock and bond prices tumbling.  [ Page 37. ]  And economists scurried back to their computers to take another look at their relatively sanguine inflation forecasts for next year. **********To many business people, investors and analysts, the August rise looked as if it could be the first sign of the rising inflation that the Fed is trying so hard to avert. The August jump follows an increase of five-tenths of a percent in July and leaves the producer price index up at a compound annual rate of 2.9 percent through August, compared with 0.2 percent in the period a year earlier. **********""I'm personally surprised that it's taken this long to show,"" said Brad Roller, president of Sweiger Coil Systems, a Cleveland manufacturer. **********Yesterday's report from the Labor Department showed that the sharpest increases in the producer index were for energy and food. But prices for many other goods, from clothing to cars, also rose significantly. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices at the producer level rose four-tenths of a percent. **********""The key question is whether such pricing pressures will continue,"" said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. ""But, clearly, inflation risks are rising."" **********Despite the fact that inflation has been well behaved at the consumer level and virtually flat at the wholesale level for much of the year, the Fed has raised interest rates five times, citing concern that inflationary pressures would build up as the economic expansion rolled on. **********But it can take six months to a year for interest rate increases to slow growth enough to restrain price increases. So inflation could rise in the months ahead until the full effects of the Fed's rate increases are felt. **********But no one is talking about a return to the old days of high inflation. Many economists are expecting the pickup in consumer prices over the next year to push inflation to somewhere between 3 and 4 percent. The latest survey of the National Association of Business Economists sees a 3.5 percent inflation rate for next year. **********The head of President Clinton's National Economic Council, Robert E. Rubin, said, ""I think we're on track with the projections we've had,"" which show inflation of 3.2 percent next year. **********""The economy is growing,"" he added. ""It may be slowing down at bit. And there are efforts to get price increases, but for the most part they just aren't taking hold except at very moderate levels."" Confidence in the Fed **********One reason many analysts are confident that inflation is not taking off is that they believe the Federal Reserve will keep raising short-term interest rates until it is certain that inflation is in check. **********After the Fed raised its target for short-term rates by half a point in August, to 4.75 percent, most analysts thought the central bank would wait until after the November elections before acting again, so it would have time to gauge the impact of its earlier moves on the economy and on inflation. Some analysts even thought that rate increase might be the Fed's last for some time. **********But some analysts think the unexpectedly large jump in producer prices last month -- especially if it is clear that the increases are passed on to consumers -- will prompt the Fed to act when its policy-making group meets later this month. But most say they still think the Fed will wait until November or December. **********Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers. The Producer Price Index would include, for instance, the price a paper company charges for the newsprint that it sells to a newspaper. **********Some economists noted that some of the August price rises were clearly one-time events. Food prices rose seven-tenths of a percent, pushed up by a big jump in beef and fish prices. And gasoline prices jumped 6.8 percent after surging 8 percent in July. An upbeat crop outlook and softer crude oil prices suggest that these increases are unlikely to continue. **********In addition, a speeding up in producer prices does not always translate into a speeding up of overall inflation, and besides, monthly price data are, by their nature, volatile. The August report on consumer prices is due out on Tuesday. **********But few dismissed yesterday's report as a pure anomaly. The big rise in car prices paid by dealers, seven-tenths of a percent, seems to reflect strong sales and tight inventories. And the prices of many semi-finished goods that manufacturers buy, including metal parts, chemicals and fabrics, have been rising briskly for months. **********That inflation pressures could be building does, in fact, seem surprising in some ways. Consider some of the standard indicators: hourly compensation for workers has been rising at the slowest rate in 13 years, barely over 3 percent in the last year. Meanwhile, despite a slip this spring, productivity -- the amount each worker produces in an hour -- was up a solid 2.6 percent from a year earlier. And an overhaul of the health care system, which most economists thought would add a few tenths to the inflation rate, does not seem likely to take place this year. **********The two strongest reasons to worry that the August rise may be a prelude to inflation creeping higher are these: business and consumer expectations and the Fed's generosity earlier in the recovery. **********Most economists now know that inflation is as much a matter of psychology -- and what investors, business people and workers think the monetary authorities will tolerate -- as it is a matter of fundamentals like factory capacity or the unemployment rate. Businesses Are Raising Prices **********While there are still plenty of discounting and special incentives, there are signs that more and more businesses believe that they can make higher prices stick. Since May, for example, the National Association of Purchasing Management has been reporting that more than 70 percent of its members are raising prices. **********Further, before its recent series of rate increases, the central bank pumped a lot of money into the economy for a very long time. For example, bank reserves, the raw material of the money supply, grew at double-digit annual rates from 1991 to 1993."

Perhaps foremost among those are utilities, whose relative stability and high dividends often attract investors when rates are low. **********U.S. utility stocks have already been looking pretty battered. The rise in long-term U.S. rates since autumn has sent share prices sliding, a trend reflected by a falloff of 15 to 20 percent in major sector indexes since the middle of September. **********Moreover, say analysts, there's a sense of fear in the market that the utility industry is headed for further deregulation that could set off earnings-crushing rate wars and other destabilizing forces. A research report published on Nov. 1 by Standard & Poor's, which concluded that competitive pressures were indeed intensifying, helped scare off investors, sources said. **********The resulting picture for retail investors is thus a bit cloudy. While few analysts are positive on the utility sector as a whole, many say that the best-run companies are still quite attractive. And while equally few experts foresee a freely competitive landscape in which retail consumers will be able to choose their power company like their long-distance phone company, some say that the forces behind the movement and the potential ramifications are not to be discounted. Hence, the overall message: There's value out there, but look for companies that have prepared for further deregulation, should it come, and that also have shown the vision to explore future growth possibilities outside the United States. **********While the current ""buy"" lists of U.S. utility analysts vary widely, several companies appear frequently, one of which is New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. In 1993, Entergy posted an operating profit of $475.9 million, or $2.72 a share, up 14 percent from $418 million, or $2.37 a share, in 1992. Also, a cost-cutting program chopped 600 jobs from the company payroll. **********""Entergy has unusually good free cash flow, and I look for good earnings per-share growth, which will be helped by stock repurchases,"" said Kit Konolige, who covers utilities for CS First Boston in New York. Mr. Konolige said he also had ""buy"" ratings on Public Service Co. of Colorado, Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co., and a ""strong buy"" on CMS Energy Corp., a Michigan-based utility with diverse interests in oil and natural gas exploration. Public Service Co. of Colorado is a favorite of other analysts as well, many of whom cite the quality of its management and an aggressive cost-cutting plan announced in January. **********Citing interest rates as the prime driver of share prices in 1994 and 1995, Mr. Konolige cautioned that he was not ""pounding the table"" with enthusiasm on the sector as a whole. ""At best,"" he said, ""electric utility stocks will be moderately attractive relative to the rest of the market."" **********Gary F. Hovis, who covers utilities for Argus Research in New York, said he had ""buy"" recommendations on more than 20 companies, with Allegheny Power System Inc., TECO Energy Inc., and Consolidated Edison Co. among the highest-rated. Other picks included Duke Power Co. and Pennsylvania Power & Light. ""You could say the same things about all of them,"" said Mr. Hovis. ""Good management, well-contained costs, high-quality earnings, and favorable regulatory environments in their service areas, which essentially means a fair- handed balance of the interests of shareholders and rate payers."" **********Allegheny, which serves parts of five mid- Atlantic states through three operating companies, reported a 5.9 percent increase in 1993 net income to $215.7 million, or $1.88 a share. Meanwhile TECO, based in Tampa, Florida, reported an 8 percent increase in 1993 net income to $161.5 million, or $1.40 a share. **********Looking ahead over the next two years, Mr. Hovis shared the opinion that the utility sector as a whole would not perform well but that certain companies would. ""The general down slide that began in the fall is not necessarily over,"" he said. ""I think the index could fall another 20 points."" **********Paul Parshley, chief utility analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, said he looked for companies that were girding themselves for the possibility of further deregulation and that were also exploring emerging markets for future growth. He recommended The Southern Co., based in Atlanta, Union Electric Co., based in St. Louis, and Boston Edison Co., among others. ""We think there will be an overall market correction on the order of 10 percent over the next few months,"" he said. ""But even within that context, we expect these companies to produce an annual return of about 10 percent."" **********Earlier this month, The Southern Co. announced plans to invest $380 million in new power stations in Chile within the next six years, one example among many of U.S. utility companies expanding their reach globaly. **********""Over the next 10 years there will be a need for approximately 700 new power plants around the world,"" Mr. Parshley added. ""About 600 of them will be built outside North America in places like Southeast Asia, South America, India and Turkey. China is probably the area of largest interest. The traditional investor-owned utilities are chasing emerging markets, as are their nonregulated subsidiaries and the nonregulated independent power producers."" **********It is the nonregulated independent power generating companies that are the source of the fears regarding future deregulation. In 1992, the U.S. Energy Policy Act freed up the ability of such companies to compete with the traditional highly-regulated utilities for wholesale customers such as municipalities that own their own transmission lines. The S&P report, say some analysts, implied that independent generators were likely to be freed within several years to compete for retail customers as well. Such an event, other experts add, could send the industry into a competitive frenzy that might spell doom for investors. **********""People overreacted and were scared off by that report,"" said Mr. Hovis. ""But here on the street, a lot of analysts don't agree with S&P. I don't believe the industry will become deregulated, nor do I think it should. It is too vital a service to be turned over to independent entrepreneurs."" **********Mr. Konolige pointed out that since utility rates are regulated on a state level, any sweeping change would likely be very slow, involving separate action by 50 state commissions. ""I do think we will see some more competitive aspects,"" he said. ""A lot of major industrial consumers of electricity are pushing for it. But I think any extensive open choice is a long way off, and I wonder if it could ever happen for residential customers."" **********Mr. Parshley, meanwhile, said that the notion of free competition ""didn't just show up with the S&P report."" **********""The idea has been in the works for years,"" he said. ""And, yes, I think increasing deregulation is a likelihood."" Asked whether he foresaw an era of total deregulation, however, Mr. Parshley said, ""It depends on which day you ask me."" **********""Sometimes I think things are going quickly in that direction,"" he said, ""but there is a growing coalition against it, led by consumer and environmental groups, and they have valid points to raise. But either way, it's the companies which have prepared for the possibility that will perform the best for investors."""

Kuchma now pledges further painful austerity measures to turn around the depressed economy. **********Steps to raise prices on food, energy and rent and to increase exports were rewarded last week with pledges of millions of dollars in Western aid at a conference in Canada of the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies. **********Mr. Kuchma's Government needs the money to move ahead with a program, announced this month, whose broad strokes borrow heavily from successful economic transitions forged across eastern Europe. **********""Ukraine has taken a resolute step toward reform, and the West took a step toward Ukraine,"" Mr. Kuchma said on Friday. ""Without this help Ukraine will not overcome its crisis."" **********The attempt to repair the economy, which faces opposition in Parliament, comes three months after an election in which Mr. Kuchma narrowly unseated Leonid M. Kravchuk. Unlike Mr. Kravchuk, who favored gradual changes, the new President argues that the young country's sovereignty on Russia's southwestern flank depends on economics, not national symbols. **********By the new year, the Government wants to increase prices further, cut subsidies to heavy industry and agriculture, and start politically difficult mass privatization and land reform. Under conditions for more aid set by the International Monetary Fund, the budget deficit this year must be slashed from more than 20 percent of gross domestic product to 10 percent. Next year, it must drop to 5 percent. **********Inflation had been kept low this year, but economists say the Government must pursue tight fiscal policies to check an expected surge in the next three months. **********Draconian financial laws and taxes are to be overhauled in November to bring back, by one count, the 60 percent of economic activity now underground along with an estimated $15 billion that has gone overseas. **********""For us, reform is as important as the weather,"" said Yaroslav Soltis, chairman of Ukrinbank, a large bank in Kiev. ""Today, the weather is bad. But every country has potential, and if we reform, even if we don't do it that well, Ukraine will still quickly move forward."" **********The World Bank is pressing Ukraine, which is negotiating a $400 million loan, to restructure the energy and farming sectors, both potentially lucrative but draining Government coffers now. **********All the plans, if carried out, mean higher prices, more layoffs and plant closures, and more uncertainty for Ukraine's 53 million people. Already, after three years of independence, the poverty and unemployment rates are as high as any in the region, life expectancy has fallen two years, and the gross domestic product has fallen by 43 percent. **********Daniel Kaufmann, the World Bank's representative in Kiev, says the pain will be brief and far better than any alternative. **********""The lack of reform has caused more social ravage than any reform program could have done,"" he said. But opposition is strong. **********An agrarian-Communist coalition dominates Parliament. The influential speaker, Oleksandr Moroz, told a Socialist Party congress this weekend that Ukraine should not fulfill all International Monetary Fund conditions at the workers' expense. **********Tough fights are expected over the budget and Mr. Kuchma's plans to sell off nearly 8,000 state enterprises and let people buy and sell land. **********""Ukrainians are at the first stage of a phenomenal breakthrough,"" said Simon Johnson, a Duke University professor advising the Government. ""But Kuchma has to keep going, or he'll run out of steam."""

For some small investors, there was a gathering momentum of avarice that went hand-in-hand with thoughtlessness. The net result was that large percentages of individuals' investable wealth went into emerging market mutual funds. And this despite warnings from commentators and the industry itself that emerging market investment is supposed to be the exciting element in a personal portfolio - the top 10 percent (at the outside 15 percent) of ""risk"" capital. **********After the years of plenty we have had four months of famine. Yet the reaction to the disappointments of 1994 has been, on the whole, surprisingly mature. There have of course been a few shrill cries of ""no fair,"" as though it were not a marketing requirement that fund companies point out that prices can go down as well as up. The really greedy seem to have treated those caveats with a kind of simple-minded insouciance - the sort of complacency usually reserved for safety announcements on plane flights (sure, it might happen, but not to me). **********Pleasingly, and perhaps surprisingly, the majority of small investors is not quite so greedy or so witless. The steadfast refusal to sell at the first sniff of difficult times may be evidence of a mature, long-term attitude to emerging market investment. Cynics might say that what it really betokens is nothing more than plain old investor inertia. The argument runs that it takes a lot to persuade investors to buy, and, once they've bought, they are even more reluctant to sell. But it is too early to tell, so judgment must be reserved on the issue of investor maturity. **********As for emerging market performance, the picture remains unclear in the short term - other than its being extremely unlikely that the years of plenty will return soon. Yet, on the principle that these economies really are developing, it seems on balance likely that patient investors will get their long-term reward."

Today's gasoline advertising tries selling in a far softer, more low-key manner, as demonstrated by a humorous, at times even winsome, campaign for the Sun Company. **********Broadcast commercials and print advertisements by Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York focus on products like Sunoco gasoline and a new ""co-branded"" credit card linking Sunoco and Mastercard. The campaign for Sun, which spends $13 million to $14 million annually on promoting its Sunoco brand and service stations in the East and Midwest, is intended to put gasoline in its proper place, so to speak. **********A big mistake made in traditional ""chest pounding"" ads by oil companies was ""the idea that gasoline was more important to people than it actually was,"" Rochelle Klein, executive creative director at Angott, Thomas, said. ""They never took into account that it's a purchase people have to make, not want to make."" **********By comparison, she added, the tenor of the agency's Sunoco advertising is that ""we're something you have to do on the way to do something you want to do."" **********That attitude is evinced in the campaign, which began running last week. One television commercial pays tribute to cars as the song ""Bless 'Em All,"" a paean to the troops during World War II, plays on the soundtrack. ""After all,"" an announcer asks puckishly, ""without cars, where would we be?"" **********In a second spot, for the Sunoco Mastercard, which offers rebates on gasoline purchases, the announcer asserts: ""For years, your credit card purchases have fueled the economy. It's time they fueled your car."" **********And a final spot, also for the Sunoco Mastercard, spoofs a familiar animated commercial for the co-branded credit card of a Sunoco rival, Shell. ""Unlike our competitors' cards, our new Sunoco Mastercard doesn't fox trot, cha-cha or lambada,"" the announcer wryly declares, referring to the Shell commercial in which special effects give the impression that the credit cards can dance. **********""And for those who have to have a card that dances,"" he says, as a hand picks up a Sunoco Mastercard and moves it from side to side, ""arriba!"" **********Norm Vincoff, manager for marketing services at Sun in Philadelphia, said: ""In any business, you can get tied up in the belief people out there have a deep interest in your product and it's one of the most important things in their lives. But you have to be realistic about the role gasoline plays."" **********""We don't want to insult the level of intelligence of consumers,"" he added. **********The campaign carries a theme, ""On the driver's side,"" that was introduced in the spring of 1993 by Sunoco's previous agency, the New York office of Hal Riney & Partners. Angotti, Thomas absorbed Riney's New York office, and its accounts, in September of that year. **********""Angotti has done a great job positioning Sunoco the way we want to be,"" Mr. Vincoff said, ""in terms of value and high-quality product."" **********In addition to the Angotti, Thomas ads for the Sunoco Mastercard, 13 million to 14 million households -- including about 1.8 million that hold Sunoco credit cards -- will receive mail solicitations created by Cohn & Wells, a San Francisco shop specializing in direct-response advertising. The Sunoco Mastercard is issued by Bank of America. **********The Angotti, Thomas campaign will appear in three phases, Mr. Vincoff said. The first runs through early December, the second begins after the new year and the third is scheduled for mid- to late 1995. There will be television and radio commercials in local markets, he said, as well as ads in newspapers in Boston, New York and Philadelphia."

""I am afraid I cannot tell you any more."" **********But delegates at the meeting, who insisted on anonymity, suggested that the Serbs had come up with a ""yes, but. . ."" or a ""yes, and. . ."" in response to a plan that they do not much like, but which is better than the grim alternative. The plan calls on the Serbs to accept 49 percent of Bosnia, compared with the 70 percent they now hold, and gives the rest to the Bosnian Government in federation with Bosnian Croats. **********Before the meeting adjourned, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, veered away from the war-mongering bombast that he had served up over the past week, saying, ""I hope we will accept the plan in some way."" **********It remains unclear whether the Serbs' apparent attempt at compromise will be sufficient to convince the contact group that the Serbs are serious about peace. Moreover, if the contact group members -- the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany -- are perceived by the Bosnian Government as giving too much latitude to the Serbs, the Muslims' acceptance could quickly begin to fray. **********There is likely to be some tension in the contact group. The United States Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has said that ambiguity in the Serbian response would, in the American view, be a rejection. **********But Russia, tied to the Serbs through their shared adherence to Orthodox Christianity, is likely to want to show some understanding. And Britain and France, worried by a potential escalation of a debilitating war in Europe and concerned over the future of their contingents in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia, are also keen to engineer a settlement if at all possible. **********American diplomats say that if the Serbs want to make any major changes to the proposed map for a territorial settlement, which calls on them to give up several major towns, then the contact group will have little choice but to say no. **********But if the main Serbian conditions center on constitutional questions, which have scarcely been broached in the current proposal, then some latitude may be shown. The only firm constitutional stipulation in the plan is that Bosnia and Herzegovina should remain a single state within its internationally recognized borders. Pressures by Serbs **********The Serbs, close to one-third of the Bosnian population before the war, have fought throughout for the right to their own state or union with Serbia, saying they never had any wish to secede from Yugoslavia, as Bosnia did in 1992. If they insist that their right to a state be accepted, then the proposed settlement seems certain to fall apart. **********But if the Serbs take a less radical stance -- accepting, for example, a customs and monetary union with Serbia -- then the contact group will probably choose to work with them. Some diplomats say that since the Muslim-Croat federation has been given the right to form a confederation with Croatia, a similar right can hardly be denied to the Bosnian Serbs in their relationship with Serbia. **********The United States and the Europeans are well aware that if they construe the Serbian stance as a rejection, the consequences could be dire. They have said they will step up the pressure on Serbia by tightening trade sanctions, extending weapons-exclusions zones around several Bosnian towns, and eventually partly lifting the Bosnia-wide arms embargo to allow the outgunned Bosnian Government to rearm. The Croatian Factor **********If such measures are taken, Britain and France have already made clear that their soldiers in the United Nations force could be withdrawn. NATO would almost certainly have to take a more aggressive role in Bosnia. And President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, seeing that the war in Bosnia is not about to end, could lose patience with the Serbian occupation of close to one third of Croatia, and renew the Croatian-Serbian war that ended in 1991. **********All this is deeply unattractive to the international community, so some stretching from the contact group to accommodate the Serbs is very likely. At the very least, diplomats are likely to take a few days to review the Serbian position before a foreign ministers' meeting tentatively scheduled for the end of July. **********Already, however, there are clear signs that the United States is preparing to send soldiers to Bosnia shortly after any settlement is reached. **********Gen. John Galvin, the former commander of Allied forces in Europe and now the special American military representative for the former Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo today and will tour United Nations military positions around Sarajevo on Wednesday with the United Nations commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose. A Role for U.S. Troops **********Defense Secretary William Perry will arrive here on Friday; he is the highest-ranking American official to visit Sarajevo since the war began. This week, he has made clear that the United States is about to get ""more involved"" in Bosnia. **********The Clinton Administration has repeatedly promised to provide troops in the event that a Bosnian peace settlement was reached. **********General Rose, has in mind a plan whereby American and other NATO troops would initially complement the United Nations force here as they moved to take up positions between the rival forces along the 700-miles of front lines in Bosnia.                    --------------------       A U.S. Warning **********WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) -- The national security adviser, Anthony Lake, warned today that there would be ""consequences"" if Bosnian Serbs either rejected or attached conditions to their acceptance of the peace plan. **********If the Bosnian Serb response is no, and initial pressures do not force a change in position, ""then the Bosnian Serbs should understand that the pressures at the Security Council for a multilateral lifting of the arms embargo would be irresistible,"" Mr. Lake said, referring to possible United Nations action. **********He said that Bosnia's factions could tinker with a proposed map for their country that is part of the peace plan but the country must remain united."

He is expected to slow, but not abandon, the process of economic liberalization begun during five years of rule by the conservative National Party. **********With 96 percent of the returns counted, the Interior Ministry said today that the centrist Colorado Party had received 32.2 percent of the vote, the National Party 31.1 percent and the leftist Broad Front 30.7 percent. **********Mr. Sanguinetti, 58, who was President from 1985 to 1990, will succeed President Luis Alberto Lacalle. Mr. Lacalle leaves office after failing to complete a program of market-oriented economic changes similar to those carried out in other Latin American countries. **********Mr. Lacalle, 53, is credited with slashing import tariffs and joining the regional common market known as Mercosur, but he failed to assemble enough support in Congress to pass structural reforms that would have eliminated deficit spending and reduced the size of government. In 1992 the voters rejected a referendum to sell off state industries. **********Under the Lacalle Government, the economy grew by 7.4 percent in 1992, but slowed to 1.5 percent last year and is projected to expand by 2 percent this year. **********Economists here said that although inflation is declining it is still persistent and high, and they are troubled by a bloated public sector. Inflation has dropped from 129 percent in 1990 to 52.9 percent last year, and it is expected to fall to 41 percent this year. **********Political analysts here predicted that Mr. Sanguinetti would continue many of the economic changes started by Mr. Lacalle but that he would do so at a much slower pace. During the campaign, Mr. Sanguinetti advocated opening Uruguay's traditionally closed markets but also called for the Government to foster the development of strategic industries. **********Tomas Linn, a political columnist for the weekly newspaper Busqueda, said the voting was so close that it was difficult to discern trends, but suggested that Uruguayans were concerned about the fast pace of market reforms that Mr. Lacalle had pursued and equally troubled by the uncertainty of a new government led by the leftist Broad Front. **********""With Sanguinetti, they know what they are getting,"" Mr. Linn said. **********Sandwiched between Argentina and Brazil on the Atlantic coast, Uruguay, with 3.2 million people, is South America's second-smallest country, after Suriname, and one of the continent's best-established democracies. **********The Colorados, or Reds, and the Nationals, also known as the Whites, have dominated Uruguayan politics for most of the country's modern history. In recent years a third political force, known as the Broad Front, a coalition of mostly Marxist-Leninist parties, has been gaining momentum because of what political analysts say is growing voter dissatisfaction over political gridlock. **********The Broad Front, which includes Communists, socialists, and former Tupamaro guerrillas, won the municipal elections in Montevideo and was for the first time within reach of gaining the presidency. **********Hundreds of other offices were also decided, including members of Congress, mayors and municipal courts. The three parties were expected to evenly split the seats in Congress. Perhaps Mr. Sanguinetti's greatest challenge will be forging a coalition within Congress to achieve a legislative agenda."

The project is replacing a dreary landscape of boarded-up storefronts and littered vacant lots. **********The area is a national historic district, bounded by Chapel, Church, George and Orange Streets. The Ninth Square project weaves new construction with the historic rehabilitation of turn-of-the century mercantile buildings. **********The project is being developed in two phases by McCormack Baron & Associates Inc. of St. Louis in partnership with the Related Companies of Manhattan. Herbert S. Newman & Associates of New Haven is the master planner and architect. **********""What we are creating is a complete new neighborhood that will bring people of all economic levels back to the city,"" said John A. Onder, executive vice president of Related. **********Brian McGrath, senior director of projects at the city's Office of Housing and Neighborhood Development, said, ""This project will improve the area's image and increase property values there and on abutting streets."" **********The $100 million first phase consists of 335 apartments, 50,000 square feet of street-level retail space and two parking garages with 625 spaces. Completion is set for October. **********Financing came from several public and private sources, which are also expected to provide money to complete the project, Mr. Onder said. Some of it is already in place, including $14.1 million from the city, which also agreed to keep property taxes stable for 20 years. **********The Connecticut Housing Finance Authority provided $42 million, the biggest chunk of the financing, by selling taxable and tax-exempt bonds. Yale purchased $10 million of the bonds and gave $2.5 million more for operating costs. The developers also raised $15 million in equity through the sale of Federal low-income housing tax credits. In exchange, 187 of the initial units must be set aside for families earning $20,850 to $29,800 a year. **********The 335 apartments, from studio to two-bedroom units, are in 2 new and 11 restored buildings. Since leasing began in the spring, 89 have been rented and 49 are occupied. Monthly rents for the market-rate units are $525 to $1,050, on a par with those elsewhere in the city. The affordable units rent for $503 to $635. **********Deanna Thompson, a graduate student and her husband, Neal Peterson, a lawyer, moved from a rental to a $900-a-month two-bedroom apartment at Ninth Square in May. ""We feel we are getting a great deal for our money here,"" Ms. Thompson said. **********The neighborhood is part of the city's original nine-square plan, which dates to 1638. The only square not to be redeveloped since World War II, it had steadily declined. **********In the 1980's, New Haven determined that housing would be an important part of the reinvestment filtering into the central business district. Mr. McGrath said more than $300 million in public and private investment poured into the city, including several office towers and hundreds of residential units. Even more housing was planned in other projects like Ninth Square that were delayed or put on hold. **********The project was approved in 1986. But its complex scope and changes in state and local governments kept it from moving ahead. At times it looked as if it would never get built. **********The financing was also troublesome. In the late 1980's, some of the banks that were to buy the city's bonds failed, delaying the project until a new buyer was found. And in 1991 financing collapsed when Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. urged the state's finance authority to drop the project. Later he was persuaded to change his mind by backers, including Yale, which has pledged to spend $50 million over 10 years on economic development throughout the city. **********The new apartments all have washers and dryers and are in buildings linked by courtyards to the garages. Residents of the market-rate units pay $60 a month for garage parking and $30 for surface parking. For moderate-income tenants, parking is included in the rent. **********Construction on the project's second phase -- some 126 units and 25,000 square feet of retail space -- could start by early 1996 and be completed a year later, said Kathleen Etkin, project manager for McCormack Baron."

Since retiring from her staff job at the United Nations, she has read energetically about finances. But one question still puzzles her: ""My bond funds are all minus this year. With bonds paying 8 percent, are they a good buy again?"" **********The experts are asking the same thing. After a 13-year rally because of declining interest rates, bonds have been buffeted in 1994. Short-term rates, raised five times by the Federal Reserve, jumped from 3 percent to 4.75 percent, and long rates went from 6.25 percent to 7.97 percent at yesterday's close. **********These increases lift bond yields but reduce bond prices, particularly those of rate-sensitive long bonds. The net effect is lower, even negative, total returns. **********Will rates keep rising? The experts agree . . . and they disagree. **********They agree the Fed will raise short rates, by a half- or three-quarters point, at or before its Nov. 15 meeting. Many also see more bump-ups. And few expect long rates to rise as much as short ones. **********But when it comes to the long bond, let the bickering begin. ""There's a 50-50 split over buying long bonds,"" said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, bond specialists. ""To me, it looks a little early."" **********Henry Kaufman, whose investment firm bears his name, concurs. He foresees large if jagged rate increases, with short rates reaching 7 percent or more and long rates 9 percent or 10 percent in the next year or two. Such levels are needed, he said, partly because companies and banks have lots of cash; the Fed can thus brake the economy -- and avert inflation -- only with rates high enough to deter some borrowers. **********As for investors, ""it's still a good time to refinance your home, but not to buy long bonds,"" Mr. Kaufman said. ""Invest in shorter maturities -- two or three years at most."" **********Similarly bearish, Mr. Jones believes the strong economy -- nearly full employment and an estimated 3.5 percent growth rate -- will spur inflation and higher rates. ""It's almost too much of a good thing,"" he said. ""Go into money markets, T-bills and other short instruments."" **********Ride the rising rates, in other words. ""One-year notes now yield about 6 percent,"" said James Grant, of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, ""while last October, the long bond was yielding 5.78 percent."" One could do worse than get as much on a 1-year bond as a 30-year used to deliver, he says, particularly when low inflation means that the real yield -- after inflation -- is high. **********Paul W. Boltz, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, is more neutral. He sees long rates as stable, ""churning mostly between 7.75 percent and 8.25 percent."" Like the bearish outlook, this neutral stance focuses attention on yield, but it views long as well as short bonds as acceptable. **********""Long bond investors will probably get the yield,"" Mr. Boltz said. Their total return will not deviate much from it because recession and inflation -- the forces behind price jumps and declines -- are unlikely. **********Some experts are even using the other ""B"" word -- bullish, though with modifiers. ""We've been tilted slightly to the bullish side since August,"" said Ian A. MacKinnon, Vanguard's bond chief. With yields ""near the top,"" he sees long rates rising by just 15-hundredths of a percentage point to ""slightly more than 8 percent."" **********Yet more bullish is Thomas McManus, a strategist at Morgan Stanley. ""Long-term bonds are attractive now,"" he said; he expects yields to ""trend downward as evidence grows that the Fed's actions are cooling the economy."" How far downward? ""The low 7's or even 7."" **********Like the bears, Mr. McManus forecasts growing economies, worldwide. But unlike them, he detects forces -- ""improving productivity, free trade agreements, the outbreak of peace"" -- to keep inflation, and thus interest rates, at bay. **********Bulls or bears, many experts say that bonds may be less bad than the iffy stock market. ""What confuses me,"" Mr. McManus said, ""is that after a big bear market in bonds, investors decrease bond exposure and increase stock exposure."" From March to August, bond funds had a net outflow of $22 billion; stock funds gained $61 billion. **********How can investors decide which bonds are best? Look to your goals, said Steven Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser. Income seekers should stick to short or intermediate bonds. Daring investors might go long. ""A long bond may rise 15 percent if rates fall 1 percent,"" he said. ""With the 8 percent yield, that's a 23 percent return."" But, he warned, ""a 1 percent rate rise means a 7 percent loss."" **********Investors should also heed the ""yield curve,"" which compares bond yields to maturities. In midweek, the 10-year bond was earning 7.6 percent and the 30-year was earning 7.8 percent. At that slope, the latter's added risk ""doesn't buy a lot more yield,"" Mr. Janachowski said. **********But, if you play, beware. The last bear market in bonds lasted not one year, but 35 -- from 1946 to 1981."

""What has he accomplished that hasn't been accomplished in Bosnia 10 times before and then disintegrated in a few hours or days? We've been down this path before."" **********For the third time in a year, Mr. Carter was saying he had scored a triumph where official American foreign policy had failed. This time, he spoke of a cease-fire that he suggested could ultimately bring an end to the Bosnian war. **********But some Administration officials said it was far too soon to know what to make of the deal that Mr. Carter brought back from his pilgrimage to the Bosnian Serbs' mountaintop headquarters in Pale. **********The spectacle was similar to those Mr. Clinton witnessed earlier in the year from Pyongyang and Port-au-Prince, where Mr. Carter's intercessions with previously ostracized leaders left the White House to watch and wonder and, ultimately, to change course. **********""For those of us who work on Bosnia, it's been a new experience,"" a senior Administration official said. ""But we've been comparing notes with those who work on Haiti and North Korea, so we're learning what to expect."" **********Today, as Mr. Carter was rushing between Sarajevo and Pale, Secretary of State Warren Christopher was preparing for a news conference. Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, was in Africa. **********And as Mr. Clinton worked in the Oval Office, officials said he was relying on briefings from Samuel R. Berger, the Deputy National Security Adviser, who last spoke with Mr. Carter on Monday afternoon, but received a memorandum from him this morning. The White House also relied on calls from Charles Thomas, the United States Ambassador in Bosnia, who was excluded from Mr. Carter's talks in Pale. **********""There are many details that we don't know yet about these negotiations,"" Mr. Christopher said. ""They're really just unfolding as we sit here."" **********As reason for their caution, Administration officials pointed to the fact that Mr. Carter had emerged with not one but two agreements, one signed by Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and another by Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President. The two texts differed in language. **********It was evident that the White House was determined to keep its distance from Mr. Carter and his officially private mission. A lesson taught by Mr. Carter's previous ventures, aides to Mr. Clinton said, was that it was important that the Clinton White House be able to back away from the man that one official acknowledged could appear an ""unpredictable uncle."" **********""Look, if Jimmy Carter comes back having helped bring about a cease-fire, he brings stature to the nation while not operating on behalf of the Administration,"" a senior Administration official said. ""If he fails in this particular case, he has not done any damage."" **********Today, some aides praised Mr. Carter for sticking closely to guidelines the Administration had urged upon him. **********Some officials also described Mr. Carter's declared determination to play a neutral role as potentially helpful in a conflict like the war in Bosnia, for which the Administration has made clear it holds the Bosnian Serbs responsible. But they expressed distress at the virtual embrace the former President gave to Dr. Karadzic, and said it reminded them of Mr. Carter's praise for Kim Il Sung of North Korea and Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras of Haiti during his previous journeys."

In December, Gitano pleaded guilty to falsely reporting the country of origin for blouses imported in 1991 and 1992. **********""It is unfortunate that the efforts of the new management team to rebuild the company have been undermined by the events which occurred in 1991 and 1992 under Gitano's prior management,"" said Robert E. Gregory Jr., who was brought in as Gitano's chairman and chief executive a year ago when the company was shaken by scandals related to business dealings of its founders and prior executives, all members of the reclusive Dabah family. **********The company said Wal-Mart had indicated it would buy Gitano products, provided another company owned the rights to the name. **********In a statement, Mr. Gregory said Gitano would probably not fetch more than the $130 million it owes its secured creditors, which caused analysts and industry experts to wonder why the company did not file for bankruptcy protection. **********""To me this is basically a preliminary move to a Chapter 11,"" said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst at the Johnson Redbook Service, citing the chapter of the bankruptcy code that applies to voluntary bankruptcies. ""The question is whether there's any value to the company, and I don't think there is beyond the name, which is a good one."" **********Once a far-flung family empire of manufacturing plants, Gitano under Mr. Gregory's leadership has shed its sewing and finishing plants and transformed itself into a design and marketing company that sells its powerful brand name. **********Under this arrangement, retailers select a line of clothing designed by Gitano and then buy the materials and find and finance production themselves, ridding Gitano of responsibility for inventory that is carried on the balance sheet as an asset. 'A Whole Different Company' **********Although Wall Street analysts hailed the strategy as a shrewd way for an apparel company to eliminate inventory risks, Wal-Mart may have had second thoughts about assuming those risks itself. ""I'm not so sure that internal policies are the real reason"" for Wal-Mart to sever its relationship with the jeans company, Mr. Schaeffer said. ""I think it might be a way for them to bow out of a relationship that began with a whole different company than the company Gitano is today."" **********Jane Arend, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said its decision to end its relationship had nothing to do with Gitano's new strategy. ""In order to be consistent with our vendor partners, we had to tell them we could no longer do business with the company,"" she said. ""It was a tough decision for us because they've been such a big part of our business."" **********Mr. Gregory's strategy had started to pay off, shrinking the company's losses by almost half in the quarter that ended in September. But it also leaves the company with few concrete assets to sell beyond its brand name. **********Gitano's shares traded unchanged at $2 when the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading at about 3:45 P.M. pending the announcement of the sale. About 219,000 shares traded yesterday, compared with a three-month daily average of 99,257 shares, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets."

Warburg in London. **********Nevertheless, the current consensus is that the dollar is headed for a bit of a bounce. Typically, the approach to year-end is positive for the dollar as U.S. companies begin repatriating profits and dividends on foreign operations for their yearly reports. **********And with the dollar still benefiting from the larger-than-expected increase in U.S. interest rates two weeks ago, foreign exchange analysts see the dollar pushing up to 1.58 Deutsche marks in the next few weeks while remaining relatively stable against the yen. **********The dollar ended last week at 1.5602 DM and 98.775 yen. The big test for the dollar looms between 1.58 and 1.60 DM, a ""formidable resistance area,"" says Joe Prendergast at Paribas Capital Markets in London. But not much of a move is expected against the yen, as Japanese investors show no inclination yet to resume purchases of foreign assets. **********Meanwhile, the turnaround on the investment-income account highlights the vulnerability of the dollar to the whims of foreign investors. **********America's net income on the investment account peaked in 1981 at $33 billion. Last year it amounted to a measly $4 billion. **********This year it turns to an outflow estimated at $7 billion, and the deficit thereafter is forecast to balloon - up nearly 60 percent next year and 80 percent the year after - through the end of the century. The interest the U.S. government pays on bonds held by foreign investors accounts for a large share of the turnaround. **********In comparison to the merchandise trade deficit of more than $150 billion, an estimated investment income deficit of $20 billion by 1996 does not appear dramatic. **********""But it's not trivial,"" insists one close observer of the statistics. ""It becomes a drag quite quickly - another source of dollar outflow that needs to be financed."" **********This observer notes that investment income is only a relatively small component in measuring the balance of international payments and thus can be swamped easily by, for example, a huge flow of foreign money into U.S. stocks and bonds. **********But with portfolio flows this year running out of rather than into the United States, the new deficit on investment income ""is one more reason why the dollar has been under pressure in the foreign exchange market,"" the close observer adds. **********Although the size of its international indebtedness makes it by far the world's largest debtor, the United States is not on the lip of a debt crisis, as the dollar amount of the debt is equal to a mere 8.5 percent of total annual output, or gross domestic product. **********But, as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported last week in its survey of the U.S. economy, the shift in financing flows and the continuing buildup of indebtedness to finance the persistent external deficit make the U.S. economy ""increasingly vulnerable to changes in market perceptions."" **********The long delay between the 1987 accounting slide into net debt and this year's appearance of an investment income deficit is in part explained by the high rate of return on decades-old U.S. investments abroad compared with relatively recent and often unprofitable international investments in the United States, of which Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures are but two examples."

""Other countries will be asking, 'Who's next?'"" **********Washington's brinksmanship with Tokyo and the ensuing surge of the yen against dollar that underpins most other Asian currency values has wide-reaching consequences for regional investment and trade patterns. **********In the short term, analysts said Washington's efforts to expand market access to Japan would mean higher costs for Asian countries reliant on Japanese imports if currency speculators continue to push the yen to lofty levels that economic fundamentals do not support. **********Japan accounted for 49 percent of Hong Kong's retained imports in 1992. Corresponding figures for China were 33 percent; Malaysia, 30 percent; Thailand, 29 percent; Taiwan, 28 percent; Singapore, 27 percent, and South Korea, 23 percent. **********""We haven't seen much substitution of American and European goods for Japanese exports in Asia based on price,"" Mr. Kapur said. ""Traditional relations, lower transport costs and government aid are important factors in Japan's favor."" **********Several Asian countries also have substantial yen- denominated government debts, with Indonesia, Malaysia and China potentially facing higher repayments because of the currency turmoil that has accompanied Washington's hard-line challenge to Japan. **********But one advantage of a strong yen for Asian exporters could be additional orders from Japan, where the recession has caused consumers to opt for value over the prestige of domestic brands. **********Countries such as South Korea - Japan's closest competitor in the high-tech manufacturing and value- added consumer goods arena - also stand to win extra orders from North America and Europe. **********China also could benefit from an unstable yen- dollar environment, Mr. Von Pfeil said. **********But continued currency volatility and a strong yen threatens to undercut economic recovery in Japan and weaken its role as a driving force in Asian economic development. **********""Japan's ability to import Asian products and expand its direct investments in Asian economies is undermined at the levels the yen has now reached,"" said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Co. in Tokyo. **********While Japan remains a major source of new funds for developing economies in China and Indonesia and for stock markets throughout the region, currency volatility threatens to slow the fixed investment flows. It also could prompt repatriation of money committed to dollar-linked securities. **********""A chronically debilitated Japan is more of a liability than an asset to the rest of Asia,"" said Miron Mushkat, Lehman Brothers' chief Asian economist. ""A strong yen assists Japan in investing further in Asia, but not beyond a critical threshold, which we may already be through."" **********While Japan is in the trade spotlight now, other Asian countries with long-term trade surpluses with the United States are focusing on their own disputes with Washington. **********""As much as this is only a bilateral thing, the Americans must maintain a multilateral approach,"" Ms. Sasaki-Smith said. **********Taipei and Washington begin trade talks on Feb. 24. **********""We are probably net losers in this,"" said Peter Kurz, an analysts with Baring Securities in Taiwan, citing the overall harm to Taiwan's economic performance from a higher yen and a widespread belief that Taipei can expect difficult negotiations. **********""The Americans are understood to want tariff reductions on 8,084 items and much greater access to the services sector,"" Mr. Kurz said. **********Washington's determination to confront Japan may extract some concessions that will boost regional trade overall. But economists warned the strategy could backfire if a heavy-handed approach by the U.S. government strengthens the appeal of an Asian-only trade group championed by Malaysia. **********Japan has opposed proposals by Malaysia to create an East Asian Economic Caucus to counter the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********""In a worst-case scenario Japan could change its stance on EAEC,"" Mr. Kapur said."

Citing the rise in violence since Haiti's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted in 1991, she said there was a contradiction in recognizing the need for many to seek asylum but granting it to few. **********The Administration has said that it expects to grant asylum to no more than 10 percent of those applying in Port-au-Prince, the same as now. **********While the policy change was praised by refugee advocates, critics questioned its practicality.

It features anthropomorphic versions of gin garnishes that cannot wait to become intrinsic ingredients in drinks made with Gilbey's. **********In one print advertisement, for instance, lemon and lime wedges duel each other with colored plastic cocktail swords. In another ad, an olive tells a Gilbey's martini glass, ""Go ahead, make my day."" And in a third, a lemon, lashed into a parachute, is poised to make a ""perfect landing"" into a tall glass of Gilbey's. **********""We viewed them as the experts on the quality of where they were going,"" Mr. Krimstein said of the garnishes, which serve, in essence, as endorsers. **********""The message is that Gilbey's tastes so great,"" he added, ""you want to get into it."" The campaign, which will be extended into commercials, is evocative of the 1960's campaign by Papert, Koenig, Lois that concocted fanciful conversations between bottles of Wolfschmidt's vodka and drink mixers like tomatoes and oranges. **********""It's classic 'product as hero' advertising, but done in a way that tries not to take ourselves too seriously,"" said Mike Spurling, the Gilbey's international brand director at W&A Gilbey in London. ""It communicates a dynamic, fun-loving, younger, more accessible positioning."" **********There are several trends that are embodied by Krimstein/Clapps's campaign for Gilbey's, which runs a distant No. 4 in America, trailing Seagram's, Gordon's and Tanqueray. Gilbey's sells more strongly in markets like Canada, South Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, and worldwide the brand sold 2.3 million nine-liter cases last year. **********One trend is the fragmentation of agency services, enabling a Grand Met to hire a ""creative hothouse"" like Krimstein/Clapps, Mr. Spurling said, then hire larger shops for tasks like research and media services. **********""We found we wanted to give highly creative people a maximum amount of opportunity to do what they're good at,"" he added, ""with a minimum amount of bureaucracy."" **********Another trend is the growth of so-called global brands, which can be sold anywhere through campaigns imbuing them with single distinctive personalities. **********""This is a very, very simple idea,"" Mr. Spurling said of the ""Dive right in"" theme, ""that translates easily and clearly to consumers worldwide."" **********""Yet, rather than saying the object was a consistent piece of communication around the world,"" he added, ""we wanted something that would be absolutely relevant to consumers in any market; if we get consistencies, that's an added benefit."" **********And finally, the campaign's trans-Atlantic origins are indicative of recent technological breakthroughs that enable Mr. Clapps to ""scan shots into a computer in New York that can be seen in London in an hour and then shipped around the world,"" he said. **********The three men met in 1990, when Mr. Spurling was the American marketing director for Smirnoff vodka, another Grand Met brand, and Mr. Krimstein and Mr. Clapps worked on the Smirnoff account at McCann. **********The Gilbey's campaign is not running in the United States because the advertising decisions here are made by the brand's American importer, the Jim Beam Brands Company, which uses Fallon McElligott for its products. **********The Gilbey's American account has been inactive of late; Competitive Media Reporting, a company that tracks ad spending, reported none for 1993, compared with $3.2 million in 1992, when a print campaign appeared carrying the theme ""The authentic gin"" and using imagery of the Roaring Twenties. Mr. Spurling said he hoped the brand would resume its American presence soon. **********Other accounts that Krimstein/ Clapps handles include the Waldbaum's supermarket chain in metropolitan New York, for which it introduced a humorous radio campaign last month emphasizing ""unbeatable"" prices, and the China Grill restaurant in Manhattan."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/world/israel-arrests-militants-in-reaction-to-bus-bomb.html,Clyde Haberman,1994-10-24,,907,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Israel Arrests Militants In Reaction To Bus Bomb,Israel Arrests Militants In Reaction To Bus Bomb," **********Israel said today that it had arrested dozens of members of the Hamas Islamic group in a crackdown begun after the attack last week on a Tel Aviv bus, which is now said to have killed 23 people, including the bomber. **********No details were given about how many of the Hamas members, who were arrested on the West Bank, had been picked up or in which towns. **********Some Palestinians waved off the arrests as involving only low-level Hamas supporters. But a senior Israeli official said that they belonged to the group's armed wing and that some were suspects in attacks that preceded the bus bombing on Wednesday. **********The arrests were reported as the Government moved to widen the separation of Israelis and Palestinians, already considerable because of a post-bombing ban that has kept West Bank and Gaza Strip Arabs from entering Israel. **********Despite skepticism from some ministers, the Cabinet increased the number of authorized foreign construction and farm workers by more than 50 percent, from 35,000 to 54,000 -- mostly Romanians, Bulgarians, Thais and Chinese. **********It means that whenever the ban on Palestinians is lifted, and no end is in sight, there are likely to be far fewer Arabs allowed on Israeli streets than the roughly 60,000 workers who entered each day from the territories before the bus attack. **********The action made some Cabinet ministers uneasy, mainly those on the political left. Not only would it hit many Palestinians hard in their already-threadbare pocketbooks, they argued, but it could also help Hamas by undermining the fledgling Palestinian Authority of Yasir Arafat, which runs Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. **********""We have to be very careful here,"" Absorption Minister Yair Tsaban said. **********Along a similar line, Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator in talks with Israel, protested that the territorial closing ""means siege and starvation for Palestinians."" **********As he prepared to meet Foreign Minister Shimon Peres in Cairo tonight to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, which has rapidly turned sour, Mr. Shaath said the Palestinian Authority had nothing to do with the Tel Aviv bombing. Israel, he complained, cannot blockade its borders ""whenever it feels like it."" **********But the Israeli Cabinet's concern was less with Palestinian sensibilities than with how to improve domestic security. And the prevailing sentiment was that the solution lay in a deeper, more thorough separation between the peoples, as advocated last week by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. **********Mr. Rabin has also said Israel's army and security agencies will take tough new measures against Hamas, whose armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, took responsibility for the Tel Aviv bombing, the deadliest terrorist attack in the country since 1978 and one of the worst in Israeli history. **********The retaliatory steps the Israelis have in mind are not being spelled out, but officials have mentioned mass arrests like the ones said to have just been carried out, house demolitions and cutoffs of overseas financing for Hamas. **********With Gaza's hard-bitten towns and refugee camps off limits to Israel now, its target is the West Bank, which its army still controls. **********Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, Yossi Beilin, said today that Israel should not rule out talks with ""less extreme"" Hamas leaders to help in ""calming the storm."" But a Rabin aide said ""nobody is in any mood right now"" to even consider discussions with the Muslim fundamentalists. **********In Cairo, Mr. Peres said he expected the Palestinian police under Mr. Arafat's authority to deal with Hamas in Gaza since Israel can no longer do so. **********But Mr. Shaath accused the Israelis of playing into Hamas's hands by suggesting that the Palestinian Authority in effect serve as Israel's agent -- something, he said, that can only weaken Mr. Arafat and do little to stop ""resistance acts"" that have been going on in Gaza and the West Bank since they fell to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. **********There were reports today that Mr. Rabin had ordered Israeli ""hit squads"" to kill Hamas leaders. Not surprisingly, Government officials declined to discuss the reports, let alone confirm them. **********But Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet said, ""On the level of principle, I don't think Israel should remain with its hands tied behind its back and not able to take the most stern and strict action against the perpetrators of such horrible actions."" **********Over the weekend, Hamas warned in a statement sent to news organizations that if Israel struck, its response would be ""like a bolt of lightning."" And if Palestinian houses are blown up, it said, Israeli buildings would be destroyed ""in the heart of Tel Aviv."" **********In the bus bombing, the death toll has changed several times because some bodies were ripped to pieces so badly that the total number could not at first be accurately determined. **********Today, the authorities put the figure at 23, including the Palestinian suicide attacker who had carried what the Israeli police say was at least 40 pounds of explosives. **********A 61-year-old passenger, Kochava Biton of Tel Aviv, died of her wounds today. And the police confirmed that after blood and skin-cell testing they had determined that a previously unidentified body was that of Saleh Abdel Rahim al-Souwi, 27, who had appeared in a videotape distributed by Hamas describing himself as a ""living martyr"" about to kill Israelis."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/business/market-place-a-takeover-fight-at-hexcel-s-chapter-11-proceedings.html,Kenneth Gilpin,1994-08-08,,823,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; A takeover fight at Hexcel's Chapter 11 proceedings,Market Place; A takeover fight at Hexcel's Chapter 11 proceedings," **********HOSTILE takeovers are not normally associated with Chapter 11 proceedings, but in coming weeks a nasty dispute is likely to be played out in front of a Federal bankruptcy judge in Oakland, Calif. At issue is the fate of the Hexcel Corporation, a developer and manufacturer of a variety of materials used in the commercial aerospace, military and general industrial markets.  Even though it is in bankruptcy, Hexcel is still turning out quality products and is likely, analysts said, to re-emerge as a profitable enterprise once orders from companies like Boeing, its biggest single customer, start turning up. But many bumps will be negotiated before that happens. **********A protracted, largely unforeseen downturn in its main markets took its toll on Hexcel last year. Management was slow to adjust to the change and was ousted last summer. In December, the company filed for Chapter 11. **********The forces currently competing for control of Hexcel's future are a group of equity investors that includes Robert L. Witt, Hexcel's former chief executive, and several large investment funds on one side, and the management team that replaced Mr. Witt on the other. **********At this point, Hexcel does not seem to want any help or advice from the equity committee. A big reason for that, it seems, is that the equity holders have made it plain that if they prevail they intend to get rid of the current management. **********""From the get-go, the equity committee's position has been, 'We want management out of the way,' "" said Robert Feinstein, a partner at Kronish, Lieb, Weiner & Hellman and counsel to Hexcel management. ""It has gotten personal, and that is too bad."" **********The two sides filed reorganization plans in late July, and the merits of their plans will be argued in court on Aug. 30. But neither side is waiting to start the debate. **********Management's plan, said Wilbur L. Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., who is acting as the equity committee's adviser, ""is dead on arrival, unless for some reason some problem develops with the Whitman proposal."" He was referring to M. J. Whitman L.P., a fund that has pledged to raise $50 million in equity capital by mid-September. **********The caveat is important, because at the moment, the equity committee's plan is more expectation than substance. As Mr. Ross suggested, the essence of the proposal rests on the ability of M. J. Whitman to come up with the money. **********Mr. Feinstein said the plans differed in two key ways. ""Our plan contains firm equity financing,"" he said, ""and theirs does not. And our plan satisfies the requirement of the bankruptcy plan to provide all creditors with the opportunity to vote on the plan, and theirs does not."" **********The creditors, who are owed about $150 million, seem to be sitting squarely on the fence. **********That the two sides are fighting is a sign that each sees underlying value in Hexcel, even though few others seem to. **********Since the company went into bankruptcy, feelers about an equity infusion have been made to scores of potential investors. Only M. J. Whitman, which is likely to raise much of its money from existing shareholders, and Mutual Series Fund Inc., which is backing the management plan and could end up with as much as 41.1 percent of Hexcel if the proposal is approved, have stepped forward. **********""I have called a lot of their clients and they rave about their performance since they filed for bankruptcy,"" said Jim Curry, an analyst at the BDS Securities Corporation in New York. ""But going forward, things could get a little messy."" **********For now, Hexcel shareholders seem to agree. **********The stock, which was trading in the mid-$40's on the New York Stock Exchange a couple of years ago, rose by 12.5 cents a share on July 26, to $3.625, after the equity committee submitted its plan, which includes a rights offering at $3.875 a share..  But the stock fell back the next day after the filing of the management plan, which includes a $2-a-share offering to shareholders after the effect of a 2-for-1 reverse stock split. On Friday, Hexcel shares closed at $3, down 12.5 cents. **********""The thing I don't understand is how, once our financing is firm, they will be able to impose a lower price deal on equity holders,"" Mr. Ross said. ""With the reverse split, the $2 in their plan is the functional equivalent of $1 a share."" **********Mr. Feinstein sees some bluster in this sort of position. ""Wilbur Ross has one valuation for the company that in the view of other financial advisers is clearly excessive,"" he said. ""I think it is largely a tactic to get a seat at the table and get a bigger piece of the pie."""

Now, Lifetime Medical Monitoring"," **********PETE SANSONE doesn't like going to the doctor. When his ulcerated esophagus begins to burn, he pops an antacid. When he is short of breath, he lies down. ""I should go to the doctor more often,"" says Mr. Sansone, who cleaned machinery used to process uranium at a nuclear plant near here for 37 years. ""But it may be I'm afraid they'll find something."" **********Precisely. As part of a recent settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by former employees of the plant, called Fernald, Mr. Sansone, 66, is entitled to a lifetime of free annual doctor visits designed to spot an illness that could kill him. **********Mr. Sansone typifies the ambivalence many of some 6,000 former Fernald and subcontracted employees feel about ""lifetime medical monitoring,"" considered the cornerstone of the settlement announced in July. Comforted by the prospect of medical attention but worried that today's cough is tomorrow's biopsy, many find it a devilish bargain. Mr. Sansone is fatalistic. ""If they find anything, what are they going to do?"" **********Filed in 1990, the suit accused NLO Inc., formerly the National Lead Company, of knowingly exposing employees to harmful radiation and also, in the case of Mr. Sansone and others, to potentially toxic cleaning substances. NLO operated the plant on behalf of the owner, the Energy Department. A Federal judge is reviewing the settlement, which includes cash damages for emotional distress and a requirement that NLO no longer automatically oppose workers' compensation claims filed over radiation exposure. Because medical monitoring doesn't cover the cost of treating any detected illness, fair access to workers' compensation -- previously fought by the Energy Department and NLO -- is important, plaintiffs' lawyers say. **********Employees also retain the right to directly sue NLO, which, despite the settlement, says it did nothing wrong. **********The Fernald settlement could serve as a guide for claims pending at other Federal nuclear operations , and occupational health lawyers say it could spur already growing demands for medical monitoring in other industries in which handling potentially lethal substances is part of the job. **********Prompting demands for medical monitoring is a reluctance on the part of insurers to grant testing requests under ordinary health plans. ""Medical monitoring came into existence because it saves the hassle of fighting with your insurance company for this urinalysis or that liver biopsy,"" said Paul Monzione, a lawyer in San Francisco, who has negotiated such settlements for workers. **********Even so, courts are wary of medical monitoring. Some judges have wondered about its cost and practicality, asking who decides how much monitoring is sensible and at what expense. Defense lawyers say the concept is a fee-generating device for plaintiffs' lawyers, who typically win a percentage of fees set aside for such monitoring. **********""There's no question that in the last five to seven years, the thing motivating the filing of these types of damage claims is the contingency hopes and dreams of plaintiffs' attorneys,"" said John Leonard Watson, a Denver lawyer who successfully defended a subsidiary of Commonwealth Edison of Chicago against such a claim. **********INDEED, there is some sentiment among the ranks of ex-Fernald employees -- the plant is now being dismantled -- that lawyers and doctors are the real winners. Some $15 million will be set aside in a fund to cover lawyers' and trustees' fees as well as the emotional distress awards. Some employees say they would have preferred cash to annual exams, which are expected to cost between $400 and $800. **********But proving a link between the workers' exposure to harmful materials and their medical troubles proved too difficult, and Mr. Sansone, for one, is grateful for an end to the long, litigious road. ""We did win on principle,"" he says. **********Medical monitoring bothers defense lawyers because it generates epidemiological data that could substantiate future tort actions, according to Stanley Chesley, a Cincinnati class-action lawyer whose firm represents workers at Fernald and other plants. **********For now, medical monitoring as part of a damage award in a tort action has been confined to industries in which the suspected disease has a latency period, as in cancer linked to radiation exposure or asbestosis, the lung-scarring disease resulting from exposure to asbestos. **********The semiconductor industry could be ripe for monitoring claims, plaintiffs' lawyers say. Monitoring of some workers in that industry already takes place because of exposure to chemicals in the manufacturing process. But so far, lawyers say, there is a reluctance to ask for monitoring in the absence of dangerous substances, precluding industries that have prompted complaints of repetitive stress syndrome. **********For John Egan of Beacon, N.Y., medical monitoring calls for semi-annual trips to a hospital where the former power plant worker is tested for lung disease. He's been monitored since 1987, when he settled a workers' compensation claim against Con Edison. **********""My blood pressure always goes up that day,"" said Mr. Egan, now retired at 55, of his doctor visits. Doctors tell Mr. Egan he shows signs of asbestosis in his left lung. ""They're just hoping it'll level off,"" he said. **********Suspecting a terminal illness is one thing, but walking into a doctor's office with the fear it could be diagnosed that day is another. Mr. Sansone's wife, Julie, says the couple has coped with that stress for years. **********""Doctors or no doctors, we cannot eat, sleep and breathe this problem every day,"" says Mrs. Sansone, who blames her own bouts with cancer on years of washing her husband's work clothes, which she thinks were contaminated from the plant. ""We've got to go on for the grandchildren."""

There, computer users can view up-to-the-minute reports and photographs. **********The electronic paper composed by striking reporters and editors, which is called The San Francisco Free Press, even scored a national scoop in its first on-line issue last week with a report that Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat running for re-election, had been wrongly accused of hiring an illegal alien in the early 1980's. **********The speed and relative ease with which both groups published electronic newspapers was a clear demonstration of the power of computers and digital networks for distributing information to a potential audience of millions of computer users worldwide. Almost every major newspaper, magazine and broadcast company in the United States is investing heavily to explore the potential of publishing through computer, cable television, telephone and wireless networking systems. **********And yet, as conducted, the San Francisco experiment indicates that for now at least, pulp-and-ink newspapers have a far broader reach than the digital alternatives being published during the strike. Only a small number of people in the Silicon Valley area -- the most concentrated population of high-tech types in the United States -- appear to have access to the technically advanced World Wide Web on which the electronic newspapers are being posted. **********Even among the most dedicated cyber-surfers who are reading the San Francisco on-line issues, there is a feeling that electronic publications are not likely to replace paper any time soon. **********""I still like paper,"" conceded Mark Faigenbaum, a customer support technician at The Well, an Internet service that has thousands of users in the Bay Area. ""I really like turning the pages."" **********The computers that ""deliver"" the electronic papers are each receiving about 20,000 requests a day -- less than 10 percent of the readership the paper-and-ink issues had before the strike. Which isn't to say demand has not been brisk. The telephone circuits that connect the readers to the computers have been overwhelmed by the volume of calls, making the management-run electronic publication, The Gate, frequently inaccessible to readers during the day. **********Christian F. Gulker was already developing an Internet version of The Examiner before the strike, and as a result trained many of the reporters and editors now putting out the electronic Free Press. Mr. Gulker said he was negotiating yesterday to add a ""mirror"" Web site capable of accommodating as many as 100,000 readers a day to The Gate. **********The Free Press, meanwhile, is developing ways to reach readers through simple E-mail and file-transfer systems that don't require the computer skills and complex software needed for reaching the World Wide Web. These alternate-access routes would significantly broaden the publication's potential audience, but at the cost of losing the photographs and easy computer commands of the Web version. **********Several newspapers around the nation already have commercial agreements to deliver their daily content electronically through such on-line services as Compuserve, Prodigy or America Online. But the swiftness of the strike made such avenues impractical for the San Francisco publications. **********During the strike, a limited number of paper issues of The Chronicle, The Examiner and The Free Press are being printed. But because truckers are among those on strike, distribution has been erratic. **********""I was at a newsstand today, and because of distribution problems they only had yesterday's edition of The Free Press,"" Mr. Faigenbaum said. ""It was really nice to be able to get back and log on to see the latest news."" **********Local television and radio newscasts are keeping Bay Area residents informed of the day's main events. And other California papers, like The San Jose Mercury News and The Los Angeles Times are strengthening their San Francisco coverage and shipping extra copies to the city and its suburbs. **********But the electronic Free Press is the only means for readers to keep up with some of their favorite writers and columnists, like Herb Caen and Jon Carroll of The Chronicle. The management-produced electronic service consists almost entirely of wire service dispatches. **********As newspapers, The Examiner and The Chronicle, both of which are privately held, have separate editorial and news staffs. But they conduct business under a joint operating agreement, under the auspices of the San Francisco News Agency, which sells advertising in both papers. **********The papers' management-run electronic service, The Gate, is actually an electronic gateway to two separate on-line publications: The Electric Examiner and an electronic bulletin board operated by The Chronicle. Under terms of their joint operating agreement, neither The Electric Examiner nor The Chronicle's electronic bulletin board service is allowed to sell advertising. **********But The Electric Examiner does have 11 ""strategic partners,"" including Pacific Bell, Apple Computer Inc., and a variety of other computer-related companies, that have symbols or ""icons"" on the pages that are linked to promotional materials. Clicking on these icons with a computer mouse takes the reader to Web sites operated by those companies. The companies are not paying for appearing in The Electric Examiner, but are promoting and supporting the publication in other ways. **********The union publication does not have advertising either, but ""we're certainly thinking about it,"" said Mr.  Carroll, the Chronicle columnist. He said The Free Press had received and rejected ""literally dozens"" of offers of financial support from individuals to keep The Free Press operating on the Internet. **********""We really are making this up as we go along,"" Mr. Carroll said. ""No one has attempted to do a daily newspaper in World Wide Web format before this. Nobody has had a chance yet to think through issues like how to balance a news budget, and how to pay expenses if this goes on for a while."" **********Asked whether the electronic Free Press would continue to be published if a settlement was reached -- which sources on both sides was unlikely soon -- another member of the reporters' union, the Newspaper Guild, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ""discussions are going on at this moment."" **********""You have to understand that this newspaper represents a threat to most of the unions on strike,"" this person said. ""Nine unions are out on strike together, and the appearance of this strike newspaper on the Web proves that eight of them are obsolete."" **********Besides the Newspaper Guild, which has taken the leading role in producing the electronic Free Press, the other unions on strike in San Francisco represent truck drivers, paper handlers, pressmen and printers, among other employees."

Yet many wish they had not been forced to give up job security, blanket social guarantees and other state-sponsored aspects of the lives they lived before 1989. **********This discontent is likely to play a role in the all-German election on Oct. 16, the second since unification. **********National public opinion polls continued to show Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government coalition ahead but not by much, with a total of between 48 and 50 percent of the vote (if Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's Free Democrats win the 5 percent required to get into Parliament), and the opposition Social Democrats and Greens with a combined 43 to 45 percent. **********The result could still hinge on how well the former Communists in the east, the Party of Democratic Socialism, capitalize on widespread discontent. If they manage to get into Parliament by winning a plurality in three eastern Berlin electoral districts, Mr. Kohl and his main opponent, Rudolf Scharping of the Social Democrats, could end up in a standoff and even be forced into a grand coalition, the first since 1969. **********What makes eastern Germany fundamentally different, however, from the rest of the formerly Communist world is that it has a wealthy patron, the Bonn Government, which is willing to spend whatever it takes to assure that the economic transformation under way here ultimately succeeds. But although success is on the horizon, the horizon still seems very far away, and for the moment many easterners are frustrated and angry. **********Politicians and commentators agree that Germans have not managed to tear down the ""wall in our heads,"" to achieve the elusive goal of ""inner unity."" **********""No one on either side of the wall had any idea how far apart we had grown in 40 years,"" said the Mayor of Leipzig, Heinrich Lehmann-Grube, a Westerner who moved here in 1990. ""Only now are we beginning to understand it. I can tell you that if West Germany had absorbed Italy or France, the problems would have been far less than they are with the absorption of East Germany."" **********""Imagine if the United States, overnight, had to adopt the entire Chinese bureaucratic, legal, political and economic system,"" Mr. Lehmann-Grube suggested. ""That gives you an idea of how traumatic the change has been over here."" **********The shock of the changes that eastern Germans have had to accept is compounded by their realization that Westerners have not had to change at all. While every detail of life in the east has changed radically, nothing whatsoever has changed in the West, except that people there must pay higher taxes to support the costs of unification. In fact, if Westerners had no access to newspapers or television or radio, many would probably not even notice that unification had happened. **********This has led to a sense of bitterness in the east. Many easterners say that Germany was not really unified, because unification implies a blending or mixing that produces something new and different. They say that what happened in 1990 was not a unification but an anschluss, the gobbling up of one small and weak state by another that was infinitely richer and more self-confident. **********Travels throughout eastern Germany and conversations with scores of residents suggest that the mood here is not as negative as it is sometimes portrayed in the German press. Anger over the way unification was handled remains strong, but it is accompanied by a growing sense that slow progress is being made. **********Although eastern Germans resent the fact that they remain far behind their western cousins by nearly every standard, they realize that they are the envy of people in virtually every other formerly Communist country. Caught between these two impulses, they feel what the renowned German-American scholar Fritz Stern has called ""exuberant pessimism."" The Changes  A Transformation Produces Turmoil **********The economic progress that eastern Germany has made since unification is clearly visible, both in comparison with the old days and in comparison with lands farther east. **********""Seen from a strictly economic perspective, the great majority of eastern Germans are doing considerably better than four or five years ago,"" asserted Meinhard Miegel, who heads a Bonn-based economic research institute and also teaches at Leipzig University. **********""But many of them still think they can combine the best of two worlds. They want western levels of goods and services, but they also want the social and economic guarantees they had before. That can't work. In order to enjoy a western standard of living, they have to produce more and accept tougher competition."" **********""They say, 'Bring us jobs.' I tell them, make jobs yourself. They say, 'That's too hard.' Of course it's hard. It's hard in one place, why should it be easier anywhere else? Easterners want to have jobs, apartments, kindergarten places and everything else served to them. Who's supposed to provide all of this? The state? To do that we would have to go back to totalitarian rule."" **********Easterners, even the most sophisticated among them, view this problem from a somewhat different perspective. Joachim Gauck, a Lutheran clergyman who is custodian of the files left behind by the East German secret police, predicted that regardless of the level of economic progress in eastern states, it would take two generations for easterners to recover psychologically from the effects of life under repressive rule. **********""You have to remember that people here lived under dictatorship without interruption for almost 60 years,"" Mr. Gauck said.  ""That experience turns people into subjects.  It destroys their sense of what it means to be a citizen, an active participant in life and society. Only a minority of the people in eastern Germany understand what it is to design and be responsible for their own future. **********""Germany has been a sick society,"" he said. ""After 12 years of Nazism, the Allies arrived in West Germany, and they were the doctors who slowly cured people of their sickness by introducing democracy and free enterprise. Western Germany has recovered, and it is now healthy. Eastern Germany is not. We need time, a good deal of time, to recover from what was imposed on us for 60 years."" **********One sign of the insecurity that has spread through eastern Germany is the spectacular drop in birth rates here. The number of children being born in the five eastern states is less than half what it was before unification. In addition, the marriage rate has fallen by an astonishing 62 percent, and sterilizations, of which there were less than 400 per year during the Communist era, now total over 6,000 annually in the state of Brandenburg alone. **********Taken together, specialists say, these statistics mean that eastern Germany will lose 25 percent of its population by 2010. **********""We are in a situation of sudden and profound change,"" said Rainer Munz, a demographer in Berlin. ""Many people can't imagine how they will cope with the future."" The Background  How Germany Grew Apart **********Much complaining in eastern Germany is based on the deep-rooted economic problems here. Few outsiders, including specialists in West Germany who passed themselves off as experts, had any idea of how weak the East German economy had become by the time Communism finally collapsed in 1990. It seemed relatively healthy, but economists now say that appearances were deceiving in part because East German authorities falsified many statistics and in part because many industries depended entirely on now-vanished markets in other Communist countries. **********The land on which East Germany sat constituted 30 percent of the divided German nation and contained 20 percent of the total German population. Yet it accounted for only 8 percent of the combined German gross national product and just 2 percent of its industrial production. **********Making matters worse, the East German economy was based on about two dozen giant industrial complexes -- from textiles to electric power to steel -- each of which employed thousands or tens of thousands of people. Such complexes are dinosaurs in the modern world, and the process of dismantling them has been extremely painful. **********The Treuhand agency, set up after unification to administer and sell off companies formerly owned by the East German state, has dramatically slashed the work force at many of these complexes and has shut others completely. In so doing, it has thrown tens of thousands of people out of work and onto welfare rolls, including many over 50 who have little hope of ever finding new jobs. As a result, it has become the most hated public agency in eastern Germany. **********""Never in peacetime has so much social wealth been destroyed,"" proclaims a leaflet used by the Democratic Socialist Party, successor to the East German Communists, in recent election campaigns. ""With the goal of privatizing East German property in the shortest possible time, companies and property are being sold at far below their true value. The result is well known: de-industrialization and mass unemployment in the east."" **********In an interview, the head of the Treuhand, Birgid Breuel, an expert in public finance, insisted that her agency has sold its properties for the best possible price, and has sought commitments from buyers to maintain as many jobs as possible. **********""I understand that people who took to the streets in 1989 to demonstrate for freedom and are now unemployed don't feel very positive about what has happened,"" Mrs. Breuel acknowledged. ""They ask why unification has caused such painful shocks.  From a human standpoint, this is completely reasonable. But they are forgetting that we have to clean up the mess left behind by 40 years of backward economic policy. **********""I know we're not popular in the east, and of course it bothers me,"" she said. ""We think we're helping the development of the east, laying the groundwork for its future prosperity. But people in the east are constantly criticizing us and complaining about our work. They say we're driving them to unemployment and bankruptcy. It's not pleasant, but I understand it."" **********The unemployment rate in eastern Germany is officially put at 14.6 percent, compared with 8.8 percent in the west. It would be considerably higher if Bonn had not flooded the east with make-work projects which now employ hundreds of thousands of people. **********Easterners who have jobs earn an average of just 65 percent of what westerners earn for comparable work. Officials in Bonn say the difference must be maintained because businesses and public employers cannot afford to pay more, and because productivity in the east is lower than in the west. In addition, they say, if wages rise too quickly in the east, employers will be tempted not to invest here at all, preferring to set up shop in countries further east where workers can be hired for much less money. **********Despite these facts, the difference in wage scales for workers in eastern and western Germany is a source of great dissatisfaction in the east. Many people here take the difference as proof that westerners consider them second-class citizens. The Costs An Immense Bill That Still Rises **********Since German unification in 1990, the Bonn Government has poured huge amounts of money into the east, between $80 and $100 billion per year. The Government recently announced that the 7.5 percent income tax surcharge that Chancellor Helmut Kohl introduced in 1991, promising that it would last only one year, will be reinstated in 1995 and remain in effect for at least five more years. **********""This is an enormous sum we have to finance,"" said Friedrich Bohl, one of the Chancellor's top aides. ""No one can say with any certainty how long we will have to bear the burden left behind by socialism."" **********More hard currency flows into eastern Germany in the average week than some formerly Communist countries see in a year. This flow virtually guarantees that when the painful transition period finally ends, eastern Germany will be the most successful part of what was once the Communist world. It may also become one of the most modern regions in all of Europe, built almost from scratch to 21st-century standards at a cost of hundreds of billions. **********Most of the money which is supporting this vast reconstruction is coming from the pockets of western taxpayers, who grumble ever more loudly about the burden. When they hear easterners complaining about their problems, they often explode in disbelief. Many of them think easterners should be showering them with gratitude. **********Bonn's effort to promote investment in eastern Germany, which some westerners think is too expensive and many easterners consider too halfhearted, is showing results.  Chancellor Kohl recently attended ground-breaking ceremonies for two major new projects which he described as evidence that the eastern states ""are becoming highly modern centers of product development, research and production."" **********One of the new projects, a microchip factory backed by Siemens A.G. which will bring 1,200 new jobs to Dresden, was evidence that at least some important western companies are willing to invest in the region. The other, an oil refinery in Leuna which is to be the most modern in Europe when it opens in 1997, gave hope that the poisoned chemical region around Bitterfeld may not be dead after all. **********Few easterners have any background in private enterprise, but some have launched small companies of their own, and although many of the companies have quickly gone bankrupt, more than a few have survived and are growing. But they often face problems doing business in the west. **********For example, when the environmental organization Greenpeace offered a prize for development of a refrigerator that did not produce dangerous chloroflourocarbons, which erode the earth's protective ozone layer, a group of researchers in the east came up with the prize-winning design.  Western companies like Siemens at first scoffed at the design, saying the new refrigerator was too heavy and used too much energy, but they soon copied it. Now many dealers in western Germany urge customers to buy western models rather than the original prize-winner, which is made by easterners in the Saxon town of Scharfenstein. **********""Don't take a chance on that stuff from the east,"" one western dealer told a customer recently. ""You're much better off buying from Siemens or Bosch. Choose a company you know and trust."" The Outlook Will Healing Take Decades? **********Another factor inhibiting both economic growth and psychological peace in eastern Germany is the continuing battle over property rights. Under provisions of the 1990 Treaty of Unification, former owners of property in the east who were dispossessed by the Communist Government have the right not merely to seek compensation, but to reclaim their property, regardless of what has happened there in the intervening decades. **********In almost every city and town in eastern Germany, potential investors have been scared away by the maze of claims on prime real estate. None will take the chance of building on land which may, at some point in the future, be awarded to the descendants of some former owner. **********In Potsdam, most of the buildings on Helene-Lang-Strasse, potentially a prime development area, are the subject of property disputes. In the depressed industrial city of Halle, less than 15 percent of claims have been adjudicated. In Leipzig, the process of adjudication is expected to last until well into the next century. And in the town of Klein Machnow, near Berlin, more than half the homes have been claimed by former owners, so none of the current residents, many of whom have been there for decades, will spend a cent for renovation or maintenance. **********What makes this a psychological as well as an economic problem is that few of the claimants want to come back and live in the homes or to revitalize the factories they once owned. In fact, many claimants have never even seen the properties and do not want to see them. They are simply people from western Germany or from abroad who, upon reading about the Government's position, have dug up long-forgotten deeds left behind by parents or grandparents and filed claims. **********""I visit the Czech Republic quite often, and I'm struck by how much better the mood is there than it is here,"" said Lothar de Maiziere, who served in 1990 as East Germany's first and last non-Communist prime minister. **********""That shouldn't be the case, because people here are doing much better economically. I think the reason is that the Czechs designed their new system themselves, and they feel personally responsible for both its failures and successes. Here it's different.  Everything was imposed from Bonn. Even if the end result looks better on paper, people have the sense that they were not and are not masters of their own destiny. They feel that once again, things were done for them by some big brother who is supposed to know better."" **********""Remember that Moses led his people through the desert for 40 years, and that after 20 years people began to complain,"" Mr. de Maiziere added. ""They told Moses that life in the desert was too difficult, and that at least when they were slaves they had food and water and places to sleep. Moses' friends asked him how long he thought people would be complaining like this, and he replied, 'Until the last person born under slavery has died.' "" **********""Our situation here is very similar, Mr. de Maiziere said. ""The psychological gap between eastern and western Germany will last for at least a generation, or perhaps until the last person born under Communism passes away.""  Five Years Later **********Further reports on Eastern Europe after communism will examine the lessons learned from the outbreak of ethnic violence that engulfed the Balkans; the struggle to improve the environment, and the uneasy relationship between Russia and its former republics and Warsaw Pact allies. Previous articles explored the successes and pitgalls of introducing capitalism to countries long accustomed to state-run economies."

Japanese leaders spent the day preoccupied with strategies to salvage their Government after the defeat on Friday of legislation to clean up the country's political system. Even with deadlines looming on trade issues, a conflict with the Clinton Administration seemed the least of their problems. **********Today Mr. Hosokawa's Government still seemed shocked by the magnitude of its miscalculation. Though the bills had passed the more powerful lower house of Parliament in November, they were defeated in the upper house after the defection of some Socialists who feared the legislation would eventually wipe out their party's seats and influence. Compromise Bill Planned **********Mr. Hosokawa has vowed to try to work out a new, compromise bill before the Parliament goes out of session in a week. But the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, eager to embarrass Mr. Hosokawa after he helped oust them from power last summer, would not even agree on a meeting to discuss the issue. Many doubt a compromise is possible, out of a suspicion that the Liberal Democrats and many Socialists will seek to kill any reform bills that would disturb the status quo, if they can do so without taking the blame. **********""Hosokawa's coalition has completely lost its confidence,"" said Minoru Morita, a leading political commentator. ""Right now, there really isn't a Government."" If Mr. Hosokawa chooses to call a snap election in the hope of regaining a mandate to push through political reform legislation, the turmoil could go on for weeks. **********But the brunt of public criticism over the defeat of the legislation seemed to be aimed at Mr. Hosokawa's opponents. Several major newspapers warned the Prime Minister to hold fast and resist any temptation to give in to to the Liberal Democrats, especially on the regulation of political donations. **********Mr. Bentsen made a last-minute decision to add Tokyo to the end of his Asian tour even though the Japanese have made it clear he is an unwelcome guest. Treasury officials said President Clinton asked Mr. Bentsen to go to Tokyo to insure that Japan's political leaders, rather than its bureaucrats, begin taking control of the crucial decisions needed before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa meet on Feb. 11 in Washington. New Approach on Trade **********That date was chosen last July, when the two countries agreed on a new approach to solving trade issues. But in the interim, no progress has been made, and the two sides are still arguing over fundamental issues that were supposed to be solved last summer. **********After giving a grace period of several months to Mr. Hosokawa, who took office in August on a pledge to fight corruption in government, the Clinton Administration has declared that it is out of patience. **********When Mr. Bentsen decided earlier this week to come to Tokyo, the assumption was that he would be delivering the tough message to a Prime Minister empowered by an expected victory in securing passage of legislation to change the way campaigns are financed and members of Parliament are elected. **********Instead, Mr. Bentsen landed as Mr. Hosokawa was scrambling to hold on to his job. Even if he survives, he may be so weakened that there would be little he could do to override the Japanese bureaucrats who are running the negotiations with the United States and are resisting many of Washington's demands.  No 'Cosmetic Agreements' **********""We are not going to accept cosmetic agreements,"" said a senior Treasury Department official traveling with Mr. Bentsen. ""We can't reach a satisfactory agreement without political determination on both sides."" **********""There is no question that the Japanese Government has the capacity to take the steps necessary,"" the official added. ""We've shown quite a lot of understanding for a long time on the political issues in Japan."" **********Despite the stern words, there is very little the Clinton Administration can do to force concessions. Just as it has staked its bets for reform in Russia on President Boris N. Yeltsin, it has counted on Mr. Hosokawa and the movement that brought him to power to open up Japan's economy, deregulate many of its industries and press for greater access for imports. If Mr. Hosokawa's coalition collapsed, it would probably bring back the Liberal Democratic Party, which has expressed little commitment to such changes. **********Mr. Bentsen's aides suggested today that Mr. Hosokawa could move quickly to cut taxes to revive economic growth, but they made it sound far simpler than it seems to the Japanese. **********""Tax cuts are hardly a strain for any government,"" one American official asserted. ""They would not exactly weaken this Government."" **********In fact they might well do that. Japan's Finance Ministry has said that an income tax cut would mean a sharp and unpopular increase in Japan's 3 percent ""consumption tax,"" to avoid deficit spending by the Government. **********The battle over adding to the burden on consumers seems bound to raise more objections within the Socialist Party, and Mr. Hosokawa cannot afford to lose more of their votes."

They will meet again on Wednesday to decide how he will go about the assignment. **********Mr. Lasso, a former Ecuadorean diplomat whose post was created by the General Assembly at the end of last year, has the authority to intervene personally in particularly difficult situations. Heavy Shelling in the Capital **********In the Rwandan capital, Kigali, the small United Nations contingent of several hundred soldiers that remains there reported heavy shelling today, The Associated Press said. **********Also reported was a new surge of fighting between the Tutsis and moderate Hutus who back the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front and the Hutu forces loyal to the provisional government. **********The United Nations forces in Rwanda are guarding some 20,000 people who have fled for their safety into a hospital, a soccer stadium, United Nations buildings and several churches. **********They also tried unsucessfully to move some 300 Rwandans, mainly Tutsis, who took shelter in the Milles Collines Hotel in the capital to safer locations after getting permission from the local army commander. But militiamen stopped them. **********The Red Cross reported the slaying of 21 orphaned children between the ages of 3 and 12 in the southwestern town of Butare, along with 13 Rwandan Red Cross workers who tried to protect them. The agency said the children had been ""selected on an ethnic basis"" by militiamen from a group of 500 orphans who had been evacuated from Kigali. Call for an All-African Force **********During a visit to Oslo today, Mr. Boutros-Ghali also repeated his call for African countries to contribute troops to an all-African peacekeeping force to end the brutal killings in Rwanda. On Monday he wrote to all the heads of state of African countries that have contributed peacekeeping troops in the past, asking them to help set up the new force. **********He said such a force was necessary to ""defuse the conflict, to stop the genocide."" If the countries of West Africa can get together and send a regional force to help bring peace to Liberia, the Secretary General said, he believes that the countries of East and central Africa ought to do the same for Rwanda. **********American officials said today that the Clinton Administration favored involving the new High Commissioner for Human Rights in Rwanda, arguing that the more the international community was seen to be scrutinizing developments in that country, the better the chance of stopping the killings. **********These officials say the Administration is also considering a plan under which the United Nations might send some kind of guards to protect Rwandan refugees who have fled the country as well as internally displaced people still inside Rwanda before there is a general cease-fire and a peacekeeping force can be deployed. Precedent in Iraq **********A precedent of sorts for such a force exists in Iraq, where the United Nations has sent some 300 guards who protect aid workers and convoys and generally monitor conditions in the countryside. **********High-level delegations from the Rwandan provisional government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front showed up in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha today for an open-ended round of peace talks brokered by Tanzania. An earlier effort to get peace talks started in Arusha last week came to nothing. **********The negotiating team from the provisional government is led by Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura and includes the Ministers of the Interior and of Community Development as well as an army brigadier general. The rebel delegation is lead by the group's chairman, Alexis Kanyarengwe, and includes representatives of its political and military wings. **********President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania will lead the mediation effort, assisted by the United Nations mediator in Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh of Cameroon, observers from the United States, Belgium, France, Germany, Kenya and Zimbabwe and the Secretary General of the Organization for African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim. Violence Followed Fatal Crash **********Rwanda erupted into ethnic violence last month after President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, died in a mysterious plane crash at Kigali airport and the presidential guard went on a rampage, killing supporters of the R.P.F. as well as provisional government members who might try to succeed the President. **********This prompted the rebel forces, which were confined to the north of the country under a peace agreement signed last year ending several years of civil war, to invade the south, encircling Kigali and pushing down toward the Tanzanian border in the east around the town of Kibungu. **********Reports reaching here from Rwanda say the Hutu forces are deliberately attacking the largely Tutsi professional classes, looking for doctors, lawyers and other trained people. The United Nations also reports indications of systematic Tutsi reprisals in areas they control, directed against Hutu members of the militia and other paramilitary forces."

The President made clear that he was ready for a ""get tough"" policy, if the Japanese did not agree to American demands to open key sectors of their markets before the deadline of midnight Friday, aides said. **********But fearful that any sanctions would lead traders to sell dollars and buy yen -- as they did when American-Japanese trade talks collapsed in February -- the Administration took the unusual step of sending several top economic officials to Wall Street to speak with big currency traders and hedge fund managers, who often set market trends. **********Traders said several senior Treasury officials and representatives of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had sought in the last few weeks to assure them that if the Administration did impose sanctions on Japan for not opening certain markets, those sanctions would be limited, focused measures. Any sanctions that are imposed would not threaten the overall economic relationship between the two countries, and therefore would not justify sudden, major currency movements, the traders say they were told. **********The traders, who asked not to be identified, said they welcomed the contacts because in February they did not have a clear sense of where the Administration was heading. Likewise, they say, the Administration did not have a clear sense of where the big money managers and hedge funds that dominate the global financial markets were heading. **********As a result, both the bond markets and the dollar plunged steeply after the trade talks broke down. **********""Last February the Clinton people did not understand that they were going to get hit in the head if the Japan talks collapsed,"" one leading currency trader said, ""and we didn't know that they didn't know how we were going to react. Now they have opened lines of communication."" **********The move is interesting because it underscores the degree to which the balance of power between markets and governments has increasingly tilted in favor of the markets. **********In February, the Clinton Administration fell into the trap of being smarter than the market -- that is, the Administration knew what it was doing and was certain that any rational economic actor would understand what it was doing and therefore would not try to sell dollars in the belief that the Administration wanted a weaker currency to deal with Japan's $60 billion trade surplus. **********But driven by their own logic, intuitions and investment positions, traders sold dollars against the yen, regardless of whether it seemed economically rational to Washington. **********This current round of talks still seems headed for an ambiguous ending -- with some limited agreements in areas, like opening the Japanese insurance market, along with some limited sanctions because Japan did not open markets in autos or glass. Japan's Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono, and Trade Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, were scheduled to arrive in Washington on Friday for one last attempt to reach agreement. **********Administration officials said they believed that they could get away with imposing targeted sanctions on Japan, without disrupting global financial markets and putting the dollar on the skids, provided they made clear that the overall economic and political relationship with Tokyo remained sound. **********Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen seemed to be trying to prepare the financial markets for such a move during his news conference on Wednesday. ""I think there's a redoubling of efforts on both sides in trying to work out some of the differences insofar as our trade concerns with Japan,"" he said. ""If sanctions are imposed, I would expect them to be with great specificity and go to some of the more egregious areas. I would not expect some overall, broad-based sanctions."" **********Just in case the markets didn't get it, Mr. Bentsen added: ""I want to emphasize the point -- I don't see broad-based sanctions."" **********Any sanctions would probably involve slapping punitive tariffs on certain Japanese exports to the United States under the Title VII and Super 301 provisions of the Trade Act. Mr. Bentsen's efforts to persuade the markets that such limited sanctions on Japan would not upset the overall economic relationship enough to justify a big currency swing seem to have gotten through. **********""My view is that their analysis is right,"" said Richard Witten, top currency trader for Goldman, Sachs & Company. ""The dollar-yen relationship has not moved more than one percentage point for sometime now, and that is almost unprecedented. The big betting all over the world is that the two big guys will find a way to deal with this situation in a face-saving way, not a world-ending way.

But now it hardly matters. Virtually all its provisions have been adopted as President Clinton's policy toward Haiti. **********""It was a blueprint for what was done in the coming months,"" said a Congressional staffer who closely follows Haiti. ""This is what they rallied around and pushed for. And they got almost everything."" Growth of Black Caucus **********The Administration's adoption of the group's ideas is indicative of the political influence of the black caucus, whose numbers in Congress rose to 40 from 26 after the 1992 election. But in pushing the Administration to take more robust action on behalf of the ousted Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the caucus, in the eyes of some in Congress and the State Department, is leading the United States inexorably toward military intervention -- an issue that has divided the caucus itself. **********From the dismissal in May of Lawrence A. Pezzullo as the Administration's special adviser on Haiti and his replacement by William H. Gray 3d, a former member of the caucus, to the warmer embrace of Father Aristide and the new-found reluctance of his detractors in the Administration to make their private doubts public, the caucus has played a key role in steering Haiti policy in the Administration. **********Members of the caucus tend to describe its contribution to the Administration's Haiti policy in modest terms and to stress that others have also played a role. A Role in Policy Change **********""We've made legislative suggestions in a number of areas and have had limited success in a number of areas,"" said Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat and the highest-ranking black lawmaker on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""I think we certainly have played a role in the changing of the policy."" **********But others say the influence of the caucus is more profound. **********""The basic components of the black caucus approach -- the military is the problem, Aristide is the solution; we shouldn't move away from him even two inches; we should do nothing that smacks of any kind of alternative to Aristide, like work with a prime minister -- all that has been adopted,"" said a State Department official who requested anonymity. **********One lawmaker who follows Haiti grumbled that Administration officials consult more with key members of the black caucus about the crisis than they do with the chairmen and ranking members of House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over foreign policy or Caribbean affairs. **********But the solicitation of the views of the caucus and the appointment of Mr. Gray have failed to silence criticism of the Administration's policy by some caucus members. Last week, Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland, the caucus chairman, termed the Administration's efforts ""a policy of anarchy, one that changes by the moment."" **********Representative Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, suggested that the black caucus, having gotten much of what it wanted, is simply keeping the heat on. ""It has been a spiral of influence,"" he said. ""The President has listened and the voices have been raised. The President has responded and the voices have been raised further."" Hunger Strike by Robinson **********To be sure, the group cannot take credit alone for having altered Administration policy. It was a 27-day hunger strike by Randall Robinson, the director of the TransAfrica lobbying organization, that galvanized the public and the black caucus to place more pressure on Mr. Clinton to change his Haiti policy. Florida lawmakers and groups advocating the rights of refugees also played a role. **********Still, the caucus's interest in the issue kept it alive when many of the caucus members' colleagues in Congress and some in the Administration might have let it die. Its accusations of racism in the treatment of Haitian refugees got the attention of a Democratic President. **********The caucus's 40 votes -- 39 in the House and one in the Senate -- are an unspoken part of the calculation. While there has been no explicit quid pro quo, some in Congress and the Administration are counting on the caucus to provide critical support for domestic initiatives like health care, welfare reform and the crime bill. **********But while the caucus has helped push Mr. Clinton into a more confrontational stance against the military rulers who overthrew Father Aristide, the black lawmakers have yet to agree among themselves on the most critical question when it comes to Haiti: whether military force should be used to restore democracy. **********Some, like Representatives Major Owens of New York and Maxine Waters of California, have advocated armed intervention to restore Father Aristide. Others, like Representative Ron Dellums of California, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have voiced strong reservations on the use of military force. **********Indeed, the bill drafted by the caucus in March deliberately avoided taking a position on an armed invasion of Haiti because the caucus could not reach a consensus, Mr. Dellums acknowledged during a debate on the House floor in May. **********""We have not been, generally speaking, a group that supported gun-barrel diplomacy,"" said Mr. Payne. ""But we are seeing a changing world. I don't think any of the members of the caucus initially supported military intervention and there are still some who oppose it. But I do think the majority of the members are slowly moving toward the point where it might be the only solution at the present time."""

It's the Government's budget game you can't win without spilling the blood of millions. **********The lesson of the computer game released today by a Presidential panel on entitlement spending is that there is no easy way to keep these politically sacred payments -- Social Security and Medicare, in particular -- from consuming the entire Federal budget by 2030. **********Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat who is chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, said ""There will be a certain explosive nature"" to the proposal for a cure he intends to submit next week. **********Although budget specialists have long contended that that these giant programs will have to be curbed, the panel's much-heralded distribution of its interactive computer game dubbed ""Budget Shadows"" -- a model of policy options -- followed an election season in which virtually all candidates not only disavowed the notion of cuts but refused even to discuss the subject of Social Security. **********""With the first keystrokes, people will confront the long-term fiscal imbalance caused by simple demographic forces: more people tapping entitlement programs with fewer working people to pay for them,"" said John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who is retiring from the Senate and who serves as the commission's vice chairman. ""And they will see that the Social Security and Medicare trusts are on a course toward future insolvency."" **********The game, to be widely distributed on computer networks and on diskettes, does not even strictly aim to balance the budget. Instead, the goal is simply to hold the deficit to the same share of national output as at present, about 3 percent of gross domestic product. **********And the game's implacable scorer gives zero points for many politically appealing items, like slashing Congressional retirement benefits. **********But keeping a lid on the deficit is not easy. It takes 100 points to win ""Budget Shadows,"" a point being roughly equal to 20 billion of today's dollars. But while the panel expressed some anxiety that the game was ""too easy"" -- that is, you can win with a heartless flick of a finger -- real-life budget analysts who played at the request of The New York Times this afternoon showed it to be quite difficult when the potential human toll was taken into account. **********""What I could stomach added up to 41,"" said Max B. Sawicky, public finance specialist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-oriented research organization, when asked for his list of options to reach a score of 100. Scott A. Hodge, principal budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, did produce a list that added up to about 100, though not before complaining about a paucity of options. **********Mr. Sawicky, who wrote a paper earlier this month declaring that reducing the deficit ""is neither as important nor as urgent as is commonly believed,"" scored 17 points by only allowing deductions to be itemized at the lowest tax rate of 15 percent. He also scored 14 points for savings in health care -- 12 by lowering payments to doctors and hospitals and 2 by imposing a cap on spending for the acutely ill. **********The rest of his points came from removing the Social Security wage base cap for employers (5), taxing Social Security like a private pension (3), and taxing capital gains at death (2). **********The game allows tax increases related to specific programs -- but not income taxes -- and makes no allowance for options that would alter general economic or demographic conditions. **********Mr. Hodge, though lamenting the absence of such options as the use of vouchers for medical care that he said would introduce needed market discipline, reluctantly met the game's 100-point goal. **********Among his choices were to means test Social Security (9 points), raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 (5), require currently exempt state and local employees to join the Social Security system (2), raise eligibility for Medicare to age 70 (11), reduce payments to health providers (14) and both change the way various programs are indexed and the calculation of the Consumer Price Index itself. **********""Budget Shadows,"" designed for people with minimal familiarity with computers, runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, version 3.1 or later, and Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows, version 4.0 or later.

The exports clearly run counter to the Clinton Administration's goal, announced last year, of phasing out the production of new weapons fuel. They would also appear to undercut American arguments to the North Koreans that there is no reason for additional states in the North Pacific to develop nuclear weapons technology. **********Asked whether Greenpeace was correct that the exports violated American law, Michael G. Gauldin, a spokesman for the department, said, ""We think it's a valid question."" He said the exports were ""a remnant of the last Administration,"" and he said the Clinton Administration's policy was not to export reprocessing technology to anyone. **********The Energy Department said it would complete ""a comprehensive review"" within 60 days. A Greenpeace researcher, Shaun L. Burnie, said that under the nonproliferation act, the Government was supposed to evaluate the process to determine whether it was a ""sensitive nuclear technology,"" but the evaluation had not been carried out. **********The technology in question, which Greenpeace said was developed at American nuclear weapons plants, is a chemical and mechanical system for separating the plutonium made in breeder reactors from waste products. Japan insists that its breeder program is meant to produce fuel for nuclear reactors, not bombs. But the plutonium produced by its two breeders, Monju and Joyo, is a kind that is particularly well-suited to bombs, Greenpeace said. **********Whatever the intended use of the plutonium, the United States has previously expressed discomfort at the proliferation risk posed by separating the plutonium produced in civilian nuclear reactors from spent reactor fuel. It dropped its own breeder reactor program a decade ago. In the 1960's some fuel from conventional reactors was recovered for reuse in this country, but the technology was banned in this country by the Carter Administration 17 years ago. **********Nearly all reactors produce plutonium. Conventional reactors, using uranium and ordinary water, produce some plutonium but consume uranium faster. Breeders produce more nuclear fuel than they consume. But the plutonium must still be separated after it is produced, before it can be reused in another reactor. **********Britain and France reprocess such fuel on a commercial basis, and Russia is seeking to, but those countries already have nuclear weapons. **********All three of those countries have also reprocessed some fuel from breeder reactors. And Japan could develop the technology on its own, if it wanted to. **********Mr. Burnie pointed out that the Nonproliferation Treaty is up for renewal next year and that the Unied States and Japan are two of its strongest backers. Now, he said, those two countries ""are revealed to have engaged in illegal nuclear commerce."" **********Last June a former Prime Minister of Japan, Tsutomo Hata, set off a domestic furor when he said that ""Japan has the capability to produce nuclear weapons, but it has not made them."" Japan is the only country to have been the target of nuclear weapons, 49 years ago last month."

A. Taurus now accounts for about 10 percent of all handguns sold in the United States. **********With highly efficient assembly lines in this southern city, Brazil's largest handgun manufacturers feed American demand for reliable, inexpensive guns. The American market receives about 75 percent of Taurus exports and about one half of the production of Brazil's second-largest handgun maker, Amadeo Rossi S. A. **********According to one recent survey, Brazil exports 775,000 handguns a year -- three times the number sold annually in this country of 160 million people. **********The spread of Brazilian-made handguns was underscored in April when Mexican police officials identified a .38-caliber Taurus revolver as the weapon used to kill Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. The gun trail passes through a California gun shop to a Porto Alegre assembly line. **********Here in this gray workaday city, in the southeastern corner of Brazil nearly 700 miles from Rio de Janeiro, Taurus managers have applied the driving business techniques of industrialized countries to transform a dusty, 55-year-old company. **********Benefiting from a recent $20 million investment in new machinery, Taurus assembly lines churned out almost half a million handguns last year. Of these, about 230,000 went to the United States. Rossi, the only other Brazilian handgun exporter, has 3 percent of the United States market. **********The importance of the American market to gun makers is as clear as the plaque on Mr. Murgel's office wall: ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."" **********Because the Brazilian Government does not agree with that philosophy, Mr. Murgel has made exports the key to growth at his company. Last year, 80 percent of Taurus's $85 million in sales were to overseas markets. **********At home, a thicket of regulations discourages legal handgun ownership. **********With taxes accounting for nearly 75 percent of Brazilian sales prices for guns, Taurus revolvers are often twice as expensive here as in Miami. In addition, many Brazilian states require waiting periods before handgun purchases. After submitting proof of fixed residence and employment, a buyer has to wait up to two weeks for a criminal record check. **********In Rio de Janeiro, to get a permit to carry a handgun, an applicant must submit character references from three neighbors, results of medical and psychiatric tests and a certificate from a police firearms course. **********Responding to public nervousness about firearms and crime, Rio's Mayor, Cesar Maia, decreed in January a ban on all gun sales in Rio. The ban was ruled unconstitutional. **********Brazilian civilians are not allowed to carry handguns more powerful than a .38-caliber pistol. As a result, the Taurus line of high-powered weapons is almost entirely for export. **********Because of these and other restrictions, an estimated 400 small gun shops in Brazil have closed since 1990, the year Brazil entered a sharp recession. **********To guarantee access to the American market, Taurus has become a Brazilian multinational company, operating a subsidiary plant in Miami: Taurus International Manufacturing Inc. **********""My fear is that things will go too far in one direction,"" Mr. Murgel said when asked if he worried that controls will tighten on handgun sales in the United States. **********""We arms manufacturers are not criminals,"" he said. ""We make a product that could be a deterrent to crime."""

Griswold, vice president of the Intellectual Property Owners Association, said he believed that Jerome H. Lemelson's recently granted patent for ""apparatus and methods for automated analysis"" set a record in the world of ""submarine"" patents. **********A submarine patent is one that an applicant keeps submerged for years and sometimes decades at the Patent Office by drawing out the examination process and effectively pre-empting others from patenting the same invention. The advantage to the applicant is that anyone who makes a product based on that invention will owe the inventor licensing fees once the patent is granted. **********Postponing the granting of a patent until the technology that it fostered is in wide use can, in effect, extend the patent into that more profitable time. **********Mr. Lemelson applied for the patent almost 40 years ago. **********Mr. Griswold testified at a Congressional hearing last month in support of changing the term of patents so they would expire 20 years after their filing date, regardless of how long the Patent Office took to approve them. Patents currently are valid for 17 years from the date of issue. A 'Machine Vision' **********When a submarine patent surfaces, it can turn out to be a costly headache for companies that find themselves accused of infringement for products that have long been in use. **********Mr. Lemelson has received many millions of dollars in licensing fees from automobile and electronics manufacturers for what he calls his ""machine vision,"" which is covered by a cluster of patents springing from one original application made in December 1954. The patents outline methods, which are now routine in factories, for using robots and bar-coding scans. **********Gerald D. Hosier, Mr. Lemelson's lawyer, said the recently issued patent described various methods for image scanning a three-dimensional object and analyzing the resulting image signals by computer. **********Mr. Hosier said that having a patent expire in 20 years from the date of the filing of the application would squelch the contributions of inventors like Mr. Lemelson and favor corporations, which can afford to file applications broadly and frequently. Rights an Issue **********""In most pioneering inventions, you don't just file an invention and then it shows up in its perfected form on the market the next year,"" Mr. Hosier said. ""A 20-year rule is a mechanism to defeat the rights of the small inventor."" **********A 20-year system is imminent under the provisions of the recently approved accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, set to go into effect in 1995. And while Congress rather than the Administration has the ultimate authority to change the patent term, Patent Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman announced early this year that in exchange for a concession under which Japan's patent office would accept applications in English, the United States would move to a 20-year term before the GATT deadline. **********At any rate, Mr. Lemelson is destined to break his own record. The latest patent is the 16th of 17 machine vision patent applications, according to Mr. Hosier, who said the Patent Office recently notified Mr. Lemelson that the 17th patent -- the last part of the original package he filed 40 years ago -- had been allowed and that it would be issued soon. **********Mr. Lemelson received patent 5,283,641. Smokeless Smoking Gets Another Look **********Dr. David A. Kessler, Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, recently noted 33 patents that had been granted to tobacco companies that he said indicated the industry might be manipulating nicotine levels in cigarettes to foster addiction. **********The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recently received a patent that Dr. Kessler did not bring up but that merits attention, given the Federal Government's call on March 25 for an outright ban on smoking in the workplace because of concern about the health effects of second-hand smoke. **********The patent is for what appears to be a truly smokeless cigarette. In 1988 R. J. Reynolds tested what it called a smokeless cigarette. But it produced some smoke emanating from a tiny internal combustion chamber. That cigarette, called Premier, was swiftly pulled from test markets in Missouri and Arizona after consumers complained that it tasted and smelled like burning plastic and was too hot to hold. **********The new patent's 68 claims appear to cover broadly the concept of a cigarette that instead of burning to create smoke merely warms the tobacco to the point where it produces tobacco vapors. **********In the preferred embodiment described in the patent, the cigarette appears to have an internal chamber nearly the length of the cigarette and made of a waterproof material. Inside the chamber would be a mixture of metals like magnesium and nickel, as well as an electrolyte like potassium chloride. **********The internal chamber initially would protrude slightly from the end of the cigarette, patent drawings indicate; to ""smoke"" the cigarette, a person would press the chamber all the way into the cigarette. This would release a tiny bit of water into the mixture and start an electrochemical reaction whose heat would warm the tobacco, ""tobacco extracts,"" and flavoring agents around the waterproof chamber. **********The resulting vapors would be inhaled, much the way smoke is inhaled in standard cigarettes, the patent indicates. **********The patent says that the flavoring agents could include menthol, vanillin, cocoa, licorice and cinnamic aldehyde and that ""under normal puffing conditions, the cigarette will deliver the flavor and taste components for at least 7 minutes."" **********A spokeswoman for R. J. Reynolds, Peggy C. Carter, said the company would not comment on whether it was developing such a product. ""We don't want to tip our hand competitively,"" she said, noting that the company patented many ideas that were not commercialized. **********R. J. Reynolds was assigned patent 5,285,798. A Batting Machine That Offers Advice **********Michael T. Sudia, a father and Little League coach in Lafayette, Calif., has invented a batting machine with a computer voice that responds after each hit of the ball. Depending on the force and impact of the swing, Mr. Sudia said, the batter gets one of 22 responses, ranging from an enthusiastic ""Home run!"" to a stern admonition to ""get focused."" **********Unlike machines that pitch balls toward the hitter, Mr. Sudia's invention has a ball tethered by about a foot of nylon to the end of an aluminum arm that spins around. The arm is powered by a motor atop a tripod. **********Mr. Sudia said that his invention, when adjusted to a given height, could deliver the same pitch over and over again, allowing a batter to concentrate on form. Because the ball remains attached to the tether, the batting machine can be used in an 11- by 15-foot room, according to Mr. Sudia, who said he hoped baseball lovers might use it the way golf enthusiasts putt on indoor greens. **********Mr. Sudia, who has made 70 of the machines and is trying to sell them for $500 each, received patent 5,275,396."

The report accused the Government of ""a flagrant breach of internationally recognized standards on freedom of association and the right to organize."" **********The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Irawan Abidin, said in a telephone interview that criticism of Indonesia's human rights record reflected the views of only a ""handful of people,"" and that the timing of the new reports was meant to embarrass Indonesia. **********""I would say that we do have human rights in Indonesia,"" the spokesman said.

Dealt Setback On Hughes," **********A Federal judge ruled today that the Hughes Aircraft Company was entitled to only a small fraction of the $3 billion in royalties and back interest that it had sought from the Government in a 21-year-old legal dispute over a satellite-technology patent. **********The decision marked a setback to the parent company of Hughes, the General Motors Corporation, and could prevent the wave of patent claims against the Government that patent experts had predicted if Hughes had won a larger settlement. **********Hughes officials estimated that the decision would be worth $114 million, and said they had not decided whether to appeal the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals. 'Good-Sized Sum' **********""It's still $114 million -- it's a good-sized sum,"" said Richard Dore, a spokesman for Hughes. **********Judge James Turner of the United States Court of Federal Claims had ruled last year that the Government owed Hughes royalties for having used the technology for steering satellites during the last quarter century. **********But Judge Turner decided that Hughes was entitled to royalty payments of only 1 percent of the value of 81 Government satellites that used the disputed technology, rather than the 15 percent royalty that Hughes had sought. Hughes was not entitled to any more money because it had offered to license the patent to other companies in the 1970's for less than 3 percent of the value of satellites, Judge Turner ruled. 'Supported by the Evidence' **********Judge Turner awarded back interest according to a method proposed by Hughes and based on the interest rate applied by the Internal Revenue Service to overdue tax rebates. Hughes calculated that the verdict was worth nearly $36 million, plus $78 million in back interest; the Justice Department did not have an immediate estimate tonight. **********Government lawyers had argued that a royalty of 1 percent was appropriate, and welcomed today's ruling. ""It's really the rate that is supported by the evidence -- it's still a lot of money,"" said Vito J. DiPietro, a senior Justice Department lawyer who worked on the case. **********Many patent lawyers had anticipated that Judge Turner would split the difference between the Government's royalty figure and the Hughes figure, producing a verdict of at least $1 billion. **********The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Air Force and the Navy have all used satellites that incorporated the Hughes system. The Justice Department represented them in the case. **********Mr. DiPietro said he was not aware of any decision among the three agencies on how to divide the responsibility for paying the royalties, or where the money would come from. Hughes said in a statement that 68 of the 81 satellites were military. **********Mr. Dore of Hughes said it was also unclear whether the money would be paid directly to Hughes or to General Motors. **********Today's decision is the latest chapter in one of the longest and most complex patent cases in the country. **********At the core of the dispute is a satellite system invented in 1959 by a Hughes engineer, Donald Williams. He developed a simple method to control the position and spin of a satellite relative to the earth and the sun. The system made it possible to thrust a satellite from an orbit several hundred miles up into a geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles in space, where a satellite appears to maintain a fixed position over the rotating earth. **********Mr. Williams's invention was used in 1963 on the first geosynchronous satellite successfully launched, Syncom 2, and on some satellites used in low-earth orbits, like the Atmospheric Explorers. **********The system proposed by Mr. Williams called for two slits in the shape of a ""V"" on one side of a satellite. Ground controllers would measure the frequency with which each slit was exposed to the sun as the satellite spun so as to determine its position and order it to fire thruster rockets accordingly. **********The Government issued a patent to Mr. Williams in 1973, after Hughes had fought a seven-year battle with NASA in a patent appeals process. Hughes then filed suit seeking payment for the Government's use of the technology. Mr. Williams has since died. **********The Government contended that it did not owe Hughes anything because the company had won a Government contract to develop the technology in 1961. But Judge Turner ruled on Aug. 17, 1993, that the Government would have to pay royalties. Today's decision determined the amount of those royalties as a percentage of the satellites' value, which Judge Turner set at $3.58 billion in another decision on last April 29. **********Hughes based its claim of 15 percent royalties on a 1965 agreement with the Communications Satellite Corporation that used that figure. But Judge Turner ruled today that the agreement was not a good precedent because it was reached at a time when Hughes was the only company that had successfully launched a geosynchronous satellite, and so had a strong grip on the market. The 15 percent figure also applied to two technologies, not just Mr. Williams's system, Judge Turner wrote. **********Hughes later asked for more modest royalties from other satellite builders. Judge Turner asked in his decision today that if the system was worth 15 percent royalties, ""why was Hughes offering to license the Williams invention to its major commercial competitors early in the patent term -- the time of maximum value -- for less than 3 percent of total spacecraft cost (making no mention of the 1965 Comsat agreement), and why were there no takers among three of the world's leading satellite manufacturers, not even a counter-offer from two of them."""

Wherever he walks, his footprints linger. And he has left some deep footprints. **********Recently Mr. Ovitz has appeared to provoke, if not anger, the top levels of two big entertainment conglomerates, Time Warner and Sony, leading to speculation that Mr. Ovitz, the chairman of Creative Artists, is seeking to take control of those companies in the United States. **********How is the turmoil generated? Mostly, his rivals say, by anonymous comments to various magazines and newspapers about the poor state of both those companies and by the takeover talk at Time Warner. 'Rumor of the Day' **********Mr. Ovitz says these descriptions are nothing less than outrageous, and that he has no motivation in being critical of either company. **********""This has been off and on the rumor of the day for a month,"" Mr. Ovitz said in a telephone interview today. ""It wasn't true last week and it's not true now."" **********In fairness to Mr. Ovitz, the officers of the two companies hardly need Hollywood's top agent to cause unrest. Sony has lavished tens of millions of dollars on a buyout spree of executives and endured an embarrassing spate of flops at Columbia Pictures, including ""Last Action Hero,"" ""Lost in Yonkers,"" ""Geronimo"" and ""I'll Do Anything."" And the merger of Time and Warner still seems shaky, partly because of the persistent talk of takeover bids. **********Yet executives at the highest levels of both companies insist privately that Mr. Ovitz is playing a role in stirring turmoil at both companies. ""Submarine warfare,"" a top Sony executive said. ""Ten percent above the surface, 90 percent below."" **********In the case of Time Warner, Mr. Ovitz is an adviser to Edgar Bronfman Jr., the president of Seagram, the beverage giant that has announced it will accumulate up to 15 percent of Time Warner, raising speculation about a takeover. Although Time Warner responded with an anti-takeover device, the rumors persist that the company is in play, with Mr. Ovitz seen as taking over as chairman and chief executive from Gerald M. Levin. **********Privately, the somewhat reclusive Mr. Bronfman has said he has no intention of taking over Time Warner, that he is not unhappy with Mr. Levin and that while friendly with Mr. Ovitz he is not especially close to him. **********Such comments hardly calm Mr. Levin, who has shaped a strategy in the last few weeks with his top lieutenants to take on Mr. Ovitz in the news media. **********The same applies to Sony executives, under Mickey P. Schulhof, the president and chief executive of the Sony Corporation of America, who are eager to voice resentment about Mr. Ovitz. **********Peter Guber, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment; Mark Canton, chairman of the Columbia-Tristar Motion Picture Companies, and Terry Semel, chairman and co-chief executive of Warner Brothers, have expressed their own displeasure directly to Mr. Ovitz, according to people in the industry. A Machiavellian Motive? **********Whether these executives are unfairly blaming Mr. Ovitz for their own company's shortcomings, as some of Creative Artists' agents insist, or whether Mr. Ovitz has ambitions of running an entertainment company, as the executives insist, is part of the blurred quality of the board room drama. There is an even stranger element: Some agents of Creative Artists say Mr. Ovitz's rivals have a Machiavellian motive and would not mind destabilizing the agency because it has grown so powerful. **********But it is indisputable that the same studio executives and producers who resent Mr. Ovitz need him for his clients, respect his savvy and are quite fearful of him. **********Mr. Ovitz began his company in 1975 with four other young agents, employing their wives as receptionists and borrowing card tables to use as desks. Now Mr. Ovitz and his partner, Ron Meyer, are multimillionaires. **********From the sleek $16 million headquarters in Beverly Hills that the architect I. M. Pei designed for him, Mr. Ovitz and his agents represent superstars and directors, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner, Robin Williams, Barbra Streisand, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Robert Redford, Sydney Pollack and Sylvester Stallone. The company has also moved into advertising, with clients like Coca-Cola, corporate finance and technology. A Deal Maker **********At the same time, Mr. Ovitz has emerged as a significant force on Wall Street. Mr. Ovitz began his corporate deal-making on a significant level in 1989 when he advised Sony on its $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures. He helped act as a broker in the $6.6 billion takeover in 1991 of MCA Inc. by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which owns Universal Studios. And last July, Mr. Ovitz shaped a deal for Credit Lyonnais, the giant French bank, to rescue Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the once-great studio that has been crippled. **********Mr. Ovitz, in the interview, said: ""Every time we get involved in consulting for a company from Sony to Matsushita to Credit Lyonnais, there are accompanying rumors that we are going to run the acquired companies. The past is prologue here. Look at the history of this. It speaks for itself. I'm not running Columbia. I'm not running Universal. I'm not running MGM."" **********Yet Mr. Ovitz is plainly caught in a dilemma. Extraordinarily disciplined and far smarter and more complex than most of the people he represents, Mr. Ovitz rises each morning before dawn to practice an hour of aikido, a Japanese system of self-defense. He takes off several days each summer to plan his life in one, three and five-year cycles. He has raised tens of millions of dollars for various hospitals in Los Angeles, and lives a relatively unassuming life with his wife, Judy, and their three children in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. **********He speaks very quietly -- people strain to hear him -- and he can be mesmerizing, charming and a bit intimidating. Although thin-skinned about even the slightest criticism -- he avoided the press when he started his agency -- Mr. Ovitz has developed surprisingly close ties to some journalists and trade paper and magazine editors, leading his rivals to contend that he is often treated with kid gloves and rarely scrutinized. (Some of the journalists and editors may need Mr. Ovitz's help, ultimately becoming producers or executives in the movie business.) Mr. Ovitz laughs at such a notion, pointing out unflattering references to him in recent months. **********Mr. Ovitz's friends and associates say he is restless. His leverage rests almost entirely on the talent that makes Creative Artists the most powerful agency in Hollywood. But the care and feeding of movie stars, while lucrative, is not especially appealing to agents in their mid-life. Dealing with temperamental actors like Sean Connery, or indecisive ones like Warren Beatty, or difficult ones like Barbra Streisand or Dustin Hoffman takes its toll on Creative Artists' agents. But the rewards are considerable, with some agents earning more than $1 million a year. (Mr. Ovitz earns a seven-figure income, maybe more.) **********Mr. Ovitz has told several friends that his nightmare is ending up like the agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar, who died last year and was known, in the end, more for his fancy party after the Academy Awards than for his clients. Mr. Ovitz's idol is Lew R. Wasserman, 81, chairman of MCA. Mr. Wasserman is the eminence grise of Hollywood, a one-time agent whose power not only rested on the company he built, but also on his leverage in Washington and his ability to raise millions of dollars for political and charitable causes. It is a testament to Mr. Ovitz's own power that the Democratic National Committee called him earlier in the year to organize a fund-raiser at Creative Artists attended by President Clinton. **********What Mr. Ovitz wants is, according to friends, vague, perhaps even to him. Surprisingly, some friends say he has grown especially fond of New York City, where he has an apartment, and enjoys the worlds of Wall Street, Madison Avenue, art and publishing. Mr. Ovitz is friendly withinvestors like Herbert Allen Jr. and Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon. He tells friends with awe about meeting Henry A. Kissinger at dinner. **********Mr. Ovitz's extensive art collection -- Picassos, Lichtensteins, Schnabels, African antiquities -- was built up by New York dealers. Outside New York and Hollywood, he has developed friendships with high-technology millionaires like Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates 3d, and the former chairman of Apple Computer, John Sculley."

Yeltsin announced that he was preparing a ""September barrage"" against his sworn opposition in the Russian congress. By October, the metaphor had turned real, with tanks shelling the Parliament building. **********This August, there is an eerie stability. Monthly inflation is down to 6 percent compared with 26 percent a year ago. Salaries are worth more with the ruble stronger, and consumer spending is up. There is consensus on economic policy under Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has adopted the tight-money policies he criticized in January. Mr. Yeltsin appears more energetic, the new Parliament is behaving itself and a divided opposition is apparently looking more toward 1996 elections than to counterrevolution in the streets. **********On a trip this week down the Volga River, talking to ordinary Russians, Mr. Yeltsin had a new announcement: ""I see that in many regions the economic slide has stopped."" **********That is a vast improvement, but how stable is it? Made pessimistic by their tortured history, few Russians like to hazard any bets. The country has been in tumult so long that any extended period without calamity is deeply unsettling. **********Opinion polls still show ambivalence about the future, even as the newspapers debate whether the August 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail S. Gorbachev was an effort to save the country or to strangle it. Among Muscovites, traditionally the most cosmopolitan Russians, only 30 percent think capitalism will improve their lives and that of their families, while 37 percent say they still do not know. About 23 percent think things will become worse. A year ago, 26 percent expected improvement. **********There are enormous problems in Russia, from crime, corruption and moral disorder to growing unemployment, unpaid salaries and intercompany debt. But as Sergei Pavlenko, head of Russia's Center for Economic Reforms, says: ""The high-temperature fever crisis of the Russian economy is over."" **********A senior Western finance official put it differently: ""We're happy with Russia now. Why? Because it's not on the precipice anymore. It may get there again, but it's kind of back-burner. It's costing us less in money and less in nerves."" Trying to Buy Time for Stability **********For lack of a better strategy in an extended period of thin budgets and greater domestic demands, Washington and other Western allies seem simply to be trying to buy Russia time. **********Such a policy annoys Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, who fears that Western miserliness and strategic neglect now, in such sharp contrast to the effort made to contain the Soviet Union, may feed political extremism. But Mr. Kozyrev agrees that Western aid is far less important than private investment, and that time is precisely what Russia needs. **********Time to nurture democratic institutions, like political parties and juries. Time to pass practical laws governing free-market business. Time to learn new economic behavior. Time to get over the humiliation of the Soviet Union's collapse and regain some patriotic pride. Time to get rich enough not to feel embarrassed. Time to get used to stability itself. **********For all Russia's problems, Mr. Pavlenko said, ""Economic behavior among the population is beginning to change."" **********There are many positive signs this August. **********At the VDNKh center, built to display the glories of Soviet technology, memorials to Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, are ignored as Russians shop for imported televisions, videos, stereos and cars. VDNKh -- the All-Union Exhibition of the Achievements of the People's Economy -- is now a kind of shopping mall. **********Russian stores are full of better clothes and groceries. Russians fill nightclubs, restaurants and health clubs whose prices would make a New Yorker blanch. Russians are lunching and brunching with cellular phones, electronic diaries and Hugo Boss suits. Russians are building huge, crenellated brick dachas, restoring Moscow's tattered office buildings and hiring foreign accountants. Russians are pouring into once-forbidden European vacation spots like Cyprus and Rimini, let alone Paris and London. Hard-Line Influence Beginning to Wane **********For many people life is getting better. Their salaries buy more and they are spending more, with real household consumption up 18 percent over the same quarter last year. **********In January, Mr. Chernomyrdin lost the most visible Westernized reformers in a Government deeply divided over economic policy after the strong showing of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a hard-line nationalist, in December's elections. Mr. Chernomyrdin, a former Energy Minister and industrialist, spoke of the need for an expansionary, big-spending budget, with inflation going up to 18 percent a month. **********But pressed by the West and without reformers like Yegor T. Gaidar, Mr. Yeltsin's first Prime Minister, to blame, Mr. Chernomyrdin soon reversed himself. Not only did he begin to preach the need for low inflation and a tight hold on credits, he also enforced an economic consensus within the Government. The head of the Central Bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, without the former Parliament's support, took his cue from Mr. Chernomyrdin. Just as important, the bank stopped giving credits directly to enterprises, but only to the Government itself. **********Having once compared privatization to Stalinist collectivization, Mr. Chernomyrdin has come to support the Privatization Minister, Anatoly B. Chubais, and has echoed his calls for managers to reform their enterprises or face bankruptcy. **********Despite much wailing over steep drops in industrial production, much of that drop is statistically questionable because Russian figures barely touch the growing private economy. If in the old days production reports were inflated to meet quotas and earn bonuses, today they are minimized to reduce taxes and bribes. Economists also point to electricity consumption, which has dropped only about 2 percent despite higher prices, as a strong indicator that private production is taking up much of the slack. **********The second stage of privatization, in which the Government sells its remaining 49 percent share of many companies, will bring at least $2 billion into state coffers this half-year alone. There will be more money next year, a transfusion that will lessen pressure to raise taxes or finagle special loans from the International Monetary Fund. Foreign investment itself is increasing, and could total $6 billion this year. Benefit of Doubt From Power Elite **********As a centrist representative of the country's real power elite -- managers and bureaucrats -- Mr. Chernomyrdin has gotten a bigger benefit of the doubt than Mr. Gaidar, an academic economist who represents a much thinner slice of Russian life. Mr. Chernomyrdin, to the disgust of the Communist and nationalist opposition, has been carrying out the essence of Mr. Gaidar's policies. But with less dissent, he's doing a more effective job. **********He and Mr. Yeltsin, who has been moving into the political center, have made a reassuring team, both at home and abroad. They have been helped by the new Constitution forced through in December, which established a strong presidency. **********By stressing more muscular, nationalist themes, like fighting crime and enhancing Russian prestige, Mr. Yeltsin has been coopting the nationalist opposition, itself divided. **********Mr. Zhirinovsky, who won 22.8 percent of the party-preference vote and does not dominate Parliament, is tiring his own supporters, half of whom would not vote for him again, according to opinion surveys. The former Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who was in jail during the December election for leading the old Parliament's revolt, is pardoned and on the campaign trail, likely to dilute the nationalist vote in 1996 elections, if they happen at all. **********But if Russia follows other former Communist countries like Poland and Hungary, a lot of the disaffected vote will go to neo-Communists. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, speaks more like a social democrat. He's in favor of private property and ownership of land, he says, ""but the state, with honest officials, should regulate matters so the people are protected."" It's not Locke, but it's not Stalin, either. **********On the negative side, of course, there is a considerable weight of crime, corruption, confusion and economic distress. While most Russians seem to be doing better, many are not. In big military-industrial centers like Novosibirsk, huge factories are restructuring very slowly, keeping workers on minimum wages or forced vacations or not paying them at all for months. Underpaid nuclear scientists are striking. Companies, strapped for cash or preferring to invest it, are again running up huge debts to one another, totaling nearly $15 billion. Fighting Inflation Or Unemployment **********This is the other side of a tight-money policy, which can work only if companies are convinced that the Government will not bail them out. Mr. Chernomyrdin is talking tough, but pressure to spend is growing from military, agricultural and industrial lobbies. Inflation is likely to hit 10 percent a month by autumn -- not awful, but not the 10 percent a year that would mark economic stabilization. **********The Government continues to face a terrible choice between high inflation, with continued subsidies to industry, and rising unemployment, which could reach 10 percent of the workforce by year's end but produce faster recovery. High unemployment could also produce unrest, especially in cities like Novosibirsk. **********Finding a medium path would be easier if the Government could make strategic decisions about which sectors to help and how to create a solid social safety net for those displaced by change. **********The budget is also unreal, with tax revenues far below projections and new spending ""off budget"" to pacify vital players like the military. Deficit and other targets agreed on with the International Monetary Fund are sure to slip. **********To raise more money, the bureaucracy is imposing bizarre taxes, which can take 80 percent of profits. Such taxes encourage evasion and corruption and are a big disincentive to foreign investment. Mr. Chernomyrdin complains, but the bureaucrats remain a state unto themselves. **********In a more general way, there is a deep sense of moral disorder, with too many crooks profiting and too many honorable scholars scraping by. Russia's democratic roots are thin; its political parties are weak and personalized; its courts are laughable; the average Ivan has little more recourse against the state than he did under the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Yeltsin, when he's visible, acts more like a czar or a Communist general secretary than an elected President. The new Parliament is more interested in electioneering than in making laws, allowing Mr. Yeltsin to continue to rule by decree, many of which are ignored. **********Some Western diplomats, worried about 1996 elections, say few will complain if that vote, though mandated in the Constitution, is postponed until 1998 -- buying Russia a little more time. **********""Even if the situation improves just a little bit, and people feel this -- and I'm not talking about attaining world standards -- then this will help lessen the appeal of nationalism,"" said Kronid Lyubarsky, deputy editor of New Times magazine. ""If we can live through the next two or three years without a significant worsening of the economy, then I believe we'll overcome the greatest danger."""

As part of the deal, Generale des Eaux waived its pre-emptive right to buy the 64.6 percent stake. **********Pinault-Printemps-Redoute was already France's biggest retailer and ranked as about the 20th-largest business enterprise in the country, with sales of 63 billion francs and market capitalization of 22 billion.

Similarly, Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev to ""clear the air"" after sharp Russian opposition last week to American policy on issues like NATO enlargement, Bosnia and Iraq. **********But the air now smells of gunfire and smoke. The Russian invasion of Chechnya, and the manner in which it was done, will hardly help the Clinton Administration's efforts to preserve its aid-Russia policy with the new Republican Congress. **********Chechnya, a mountainous and obstreperous state of only 1.3 million people and seemingly as many feuding clans, is a part of Russia, and Moscow has never accepted its independence. The United States has taken the position that unlike the cases of Azerbaijan or Ukraine, what happens in Chechnya is ""an internal Russian affair"" and no business of any outside power. But Washington can hardly ignore what seems to be a new aggressiveness on the part of a Russia, with which it was talking of close partnership only a year ago. **********The way the Russian Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin has moved to subvert the Chechen leadership, with the establishment and financing of a ""liberation force"" and a nominally secret, though poorly hidden, military intervention, has all the ring of the old Soviet style in Africa and the third world. **********It seemed to be taken straight from old Soviet textbooks on destabilization, said Oleg Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general, and it is an indication of how much Mr. Yeltsin seems, these days, to be depending on the ""power ministries"" he controls -- the military and the intelligence services -- and paying less attention to either public or parliamentary opinion. **********""It's done in the old style, and it's a disaster, which the democrats and the intelligentsia cannot support,"" said Mr. Kalugin, who broke with the K.G.B. and considers himself a liberal. He pointed to the immediate opposition to the invasion expressed by former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who has been reluctant to break with Mr. Yeltsin on any other issue. ""It's a clear sign of the growing, if not overwhelming influence of the security people on Mr. Yeltsin,"" Mr. Kalugin said. **********It is also a sign of a Mr. Yeltsin who has made a different set of alliances. Three years ago, when he was the hero of the Russian democrats and was in the process of destroying the Soviet Union, Mr. Yeltsin listened to his former Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, and tried to crush the Chechen rebellion. **********But the Chechens resisted, and the Russian Parliament ordered him to pull the troops back. He complied. But it is unlikely that he would do so today. **********It is not just that Mr. Yeltsin has moved to the center, seeking support from nationalists and not just from democrats like Mr. Gaidar, who have not proven especially popular. **********To fail twice in Chechnya would destroy Mr. Yeltsin's authority, and it would also underline the weakness of the Russian central Government, which has been signally unsuccessful at getting the regions to pay the taxes they owe. **********The battle against Chechnya can be portrayed as a fight for Russian unity and against chaos and crime, given the prominence of Chechens in the so-called mafia that bedevils and corrupts all of Russia. And if Mr. Yeltsin is lucky, a Chechen population tired of three years of poverty and confusion under its current leaders will not strongly resist a Russian intervention on the side of more ""reasonable"" Chechens. **********But the Russian invasion is more likely to create a stronger Chechen patriotism in a region that was only conquered by the czars in 1878, after a long and nasty guerrilla war. And the Chechens have the capacity, should they choose, to bring the war home to Moscow, creating terrorist incidents in the capital. **********Nearly every Russian knows the Tolstoy story, Hadji Murat, about the betrayal of the honorable Chechen leader by scheming and indifferent Russian generals. Nearly every Russian knows some fragment of the Lermontov poem about the ""evil Chechen"" who crawls along the riverbank, ""sharpening his long knife."" **********More concretely, Russia is now faced with the traditional military problem, well-known to American troops in Vietnam or Somalia. It's easy to get in and hard to get out, especially if the population proves stubborn, aggressive or somehow immune to the blandishments of a great power. **********Mr. Yeltsin is in the hospital, recovering from a conveniently timed operation to his nose, apparently damaged in a childhood scrap, and it is probable that he will be unable to see Mr. Gore. It will also be interesting to see whom Mr. Perry gets to see, given the open opposition of some high-ranking military officers, including the conservative Deputy Defense Minister, Gen. Boris Gromov, to the Chechnya invasion. **********The Americans are almost condemned to find a new basis for continued partnership with Russia, which is too important to be ""lost,"" especially by a Clinton Administration in so much difficulty elsewhere. **********However, in Moscow, relations with Washington have seemed strained for a long time now. There is disappointment over the West's reluctance to trust Russia, give it enough aid or grant it the status Moscow thinks it deserves. The reason, and the result, has been a growing nationalist tone here and sharp differences with America over Bosnia, Iraq and NATO enlargement that long predate Mr. Yeltsin's warning last week of a ""cold peace."""

And next year the company will introduce the first two flavors in its new low-calorie line (Apple Raspberry and Tropical), which has yet to be named. The new offerings will have a third fewer calories than the 110 to 120 calories common to the current 16-ounce Fruitopia bottles. **********The announcement came on the same day that the Quaker Oats Company tried to reassure analysts that its planned acquisition of the Snapple Beverage Corporation was a sound investment. Snapple and Pepsico's Ocean Spray are Coca-Cola's main juice-drink competitors. **********Last week Quaker Oats, itself rumored as a takeover target, announced an agreement to buy Snapple for $1.7 billion, or $14 a share, in cash.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/25/business/california-seeks-solutions-to-prevent-insurance-crisis.html,Michael Quint,1994-06-25,,918,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,California Seeks Solutions To Prevent Insurance Crisis,California Seeks Solutions To Prevent Insurance Crisis," **********As more insurance companies cut back or even abandon their homeowners business in California because of earthquake risks, the state's officials are groping for solutions to prevent an insurance crisis that could derail California's economic recovery. **********Gov. Pete Wilson and his insurance adviser, Marjorie Burke, have scheduled a meeting on Monday with executives from 18 insurance companies to discuss the problem and the state's role in keeping earthquake insurance available to homeowners. **********California's Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, proposed on Wednesday that Governor Wilson declare a moratorium to stop companies from refusing to renew homeowner policies. **********""The problem in California is not just about insurance companies,"" said Robert Pike, general counsel for Allstate Insurance, ""it involves the California economy, which is just beginning to see an upturn, led by new housing starts."" **********Mr. Garamendi said a moratorium was needed to prevent an unmanageable surge of business into the state-run insurance program, called the FAIR plan, which Mr. Garamendi has proposed to make available to homeowners throughout the state. **********FAIR, an acronym for Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, was created in California to cover homeowners only in areas vulnerable to brush fires, where insurance companies would not issue policies. **********Last week Farmers Insurance, the third-largest insurer in the state, with about a million homeowner policies, said it would not accept applications from new customers in California.  ""We studied our experience and found that our risk of loss from earthquakes was more than would be prudent,"" said John C. Millen, a spokesman for Farmers. **********Because California law requires companies offering homeowner insurance to also offer earthquake insurance, the only way Farmers could reduce its exposure to earthquake loss in California was to stop accepting new homeowner customers. Its exposure in California was one reason that A. M. Best, an insurance rating company, lowered its rating last week to A-, the fourth highest of 15 ratings, from A, the third highest. **********Before the action by Farmers, Twentieth Century Insurance, a company based in Woodland Hills, Calif., that suffered severe losses from the Los Angeles earthquake in January, was given permission by California insurance regulators to stop renewing policies on its more than 200,000 homeowner policies. TIG Holdings, an insurer based in New York, is also cutting back its business in California because of earthquake risks and what it considers to be inadequate profits. **********Other companies have been trying to cut back on their homeowner business by instructing agents not to seek new business or changing their standards to stop accepting older houses, said Steve Young, director of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of California.  Too Many Applications **********The withdrawal of some companies is creating problems for the two largest insurers in the state, State Farm, which has a market share of nearly 26 percent, and Allstate, which has about 15 percent. Both said they were receiving more new applications than they would like. And executives at both companies said the losses from the recent earthquake -- $1.3 billion at State Farm and $950 million at Allstate -- showed that higher premiums were justified. **********Currently earthquake coverage costs an average of about $2 for $1,000 of insurance, with a deductible requiring homeowners to assume losses of 10 percent of the insured value. **********""When the pool of insurance companies shrinks, but the number of people needing insurance stays constant or grows, it forces the remaining companies to take on greater risk, and puts them in a position where they are under pressure to place moratoriums on accepting new business,"" said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, based in New York. **********So far, State Farm and Allstate have not declared moratoriums, though both want to hold their business stable in the state. State Farm, despite efforts to keep its new business from exceeding the amount of business it loses through attrition, has added 29,000 additional customers so far this year, raising its total earthquake insurance by $4 billion, to $66 billion. **********""We do not want to take actions that would create further problems, but we cannot afford to be the only game in town,"" said Jerry Choate, president of Allstate. **********Kim M. Brunner, a vice president of State Farm, said opening the FAIR plan to all California homeowners was not a wise move because it undermined companies' efforts to limit their risk. Insurers are required to cover the FAIR plan losses, and those payments are not covered by reinsurance, the insurance that insurance companies buy to protect themselves from heavy losss.  Alternative Plan Proposed **********Mr. Pike of Allstate said his company had discussed with California officials an alternative plan, similar to that developed in Florida after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 caused huge losses and some insurance companies wanted to cut back on their business in the state. **********The plan envisioned by Mr. Pike could include a moratorium on moves by insurance companies to leave the market, and the creation of a new organization for earthquake insurance to create a pool of money to cover earthquake claims, ideally without being taxed by the Federal Government. If that pool is not enough, the new organization could sell bonds and, as a last resort, collect additional money from insurance companies. **********Insurance company executives, as well as California's insurance commissioner and legislators in the state, are strong supporters of Federal legislation to protect the public and insurance companies from devastating losses caused by big disasters. So far that legislation has more than 150 supporters, but its advocates say the prospects for its passage this year are not bright."

To save his reform effort, Mr. Hosokawa agreed on Friday night to give in to many of the entrenched interests that he had vowed to fight when he took office six months ago, in effect reducing his early prescription of political shock therapy to an ever-so-gradual increase in voltage.  Diluted Legislation Passed **********This afternoon, in a near-unanimous voice vote, the Parliament that threatened only a day ago to oust the 56-year-old Prime Minister passed the watered-down version of the legislation that was negotiated on Friday night with the Liberal Democratic Party. After six years of scandal and debate that claimed four Prime Ministers, the final bills were rushed through so fast that many members of Parliament conceded that they did not know exactly what they contained. **********Mr. Hosokawa leads an eight-party coalition that includes his Japan New Party. His message to his bleary-eyed supporters this morning was simple: moving the country in the right direction is more important than sticking blindly to principle. It is an explanation heard often in Tokyo these days, as Mr. Hosokawa discovers that his mandate is a very limited one. **********His allies acknowledged that the reform package was half-baked; it does nothing, for example, to strengthen the weak laws against influence-peddling. The anti-corruption portion of the package is filled with loopholes obvious to any ingenious fund-raiser. But however diluted, it is reform, and after a succession of failed efforts, that alone is an accomplishment. **********""The people have been waiting almost 40 years for this,"" said Kozo Watanabe, a senior member of the coalition Government. ""We have begun to respond to the wishes of the people. Today we just made a start.""  Entrenched Interests Spared **********But in the end, everyone knew, almost every entrenched interest in the Japanese political system emerged unscathed, at least for a while. The links between Japanese companies and the politicians they pay millions of dollars to influence were not severed, just squeezed a bit. The Liberal Democrats, who lost power last summer after 38 years of rule, emerged fairly confident that the new electoral system would not force them to break up, because it creates enough seats for every current incumbent from their party to run. **********And just as Mr. Hosokawa celebrated the creation of single-seat electoral districts that many say will bring vibrancy and policy debate to Japanese elections, the press was hailing the agreement as a sign of the ultimate victory in Japanese culture: the magical creation of consensus among rivals. **********""Prime Minister Heading for Policy Cooperation With the Liberal Democrats,"" Yomiuri Shimbun, the nation's largest-circulation newspaper, blared across the front page this evening. The story suggested that the best of all worlds would come about if the coalition Government and the opposition Liberal Democrats used the accord as a precedent for agreeing on how to tackle all of the major issues facing the country. There was no discussion of the merit of disagreeing, creating a range of middle-of-the-road choices for Japanese voters. **********It is another sign of the wildly differing views in the United States and here in Japan of Mr. Hosokawa and his role. In Washington, Mr. Hosokawa is often seen as a very American-style leader -- he is, after all, the fellow who showed up in the leather jacket and the rakish scarf at the Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Seattle last year -- systematically dismantling the corrupt institutions that have made Japan a rigged market. **********But in Japanese political cartoons and on television here he is most often portrayed as a ""tonosama"" -- a feudal lord, like his famous samurai ancestors who controlled much of southern Japan. Like any skilled tonosama he stays above the fray, strategizing a bit from the castle, but mostly taking care that his territory is secure and that his subordinates only draw their swords when they have no other choice.  How It Looks Abroad **********Similarly, the movement toward reform here has a different image abroad than in Tokyo. ""Washington thinks Japan is caught up in the tide of democratization, and there is some truth to that,"" Susan Pharr, a professor of Japanese studies at Harvard, said the other day. ""The elite in Japan are listening to consumers and voters far more than in the past."" **********In Japan, where the players in the drama are much more familiar and their histories better known, things look quite different. ""It's easy to forget that many of the so-called reformers aren't reformers at all,"" Professor Pharr said, referring to many of Mr. Hosokawa's allies, who were deeply involved in the secretive influence-peddling of the Liberal Democratic Party's last years in power. One result of the chaos surrounding Mr. Hosokawa's fragile coalition, she said, is that ""the country is once again being run by the bureaucrats,"" rather than elected leaders. **********Koichi Kato, a relatively young but senior member of the Liberal Democratic Party, said, ""My East Coast intelligentsia friends in America all tell me that the reforms will solve everything that is wrong with Japan -- the corruption, even the trade balance."" **********He added, ""I don't think they understand."" **********Mr. Kato, who served as chief Cabinet secretary several years ago, opposed Mr. Hosokawa's reform plan, arguing that there was no evidence that electing one representative from each district -- instead of four or five under the current system -- would encourage policy debate and suppress vote buying. ""The society remains the same,"" he said. ""What we're changing is the power structure. This is a power struggle."" **********In fact, the missing ingredient in what some would like to portray as a miniature people-power revolution is the people. When Mr. Hosokawa appealed to the public to phone or fax their members of Parliament, he had trouble getting the evening news programs to broadcast the request, an odd one for a Japanese Prime Minister to make. The next day, parliamentary office buildings were not exactly choked by the response. Dealing With Recession **********In fact, the dominant emotion was get-on-with-it. There is a recession on, television commentators said, one of the worst in decades, and no one has patience for all this squabbling. Reform is nice, one heard time and again, but now let's talk about economic stimulus. This afternoon, Mr. Hosokawa did exactly that: at a press conference to mark the passage of the political reform bill, he talked chiefly about a ""reflation package"" for an economy whose growth last quarter was zero and whose unemployment rate is poised to cross 3 percent -- a startling figure by Japanese standards. **********That is hardly to say that Japanese are not interested in the changes going on around them. On television there is far more debate about politics than just a few years ago -- even a few American-style shout shows. The publishing industry is witnessing a remarkable burst of policy books, a trend started when Ichiro Ozawa, the shadow power behind Mr. Hosokawa's Government, published ""A Plan to Rebuild Japan."" **********The book has soared to the tops of the best-seller lists on the strength of its argument that the time has come for Japan to transform into a ""normal nation,"" one that contributes peacekeepers to the United Nations, speaks out and opens its markets wide for the good of its own consumers. That has led several of Mr. Ozawa's rivals to publish books of their own, a common phenomenon in most Western democracies but not here.  Little Policy Debate **********It is far too early to tell whether Mr. Ozawa's vision of the future of Japanese politics, in which two or three centrist-conservative parties emerge, each vying on policy grounds for the right to take over the Government, will ever come to pass. Japanese politics has almost never worked that way. And as the paucity of debate over the real goals of the political reform legislation indicates, voters are still leery about arguing on the basis of ideology. Instead, many view the legislation as an exercise in power-balancing. **********Mr. Ozawa, for example, is known not for his ideas about a stronger prime minister and a more independent country, but for his reputation as a canny politician, once the chief lieutenant of Japan's most infamous backroom dealer, Shin Kanemaru, who ran the country from behind a curtain until his fall in 1992. Mr. Kanemaru is now on trial for tax evasion. Yesterday, Mr. Ozawa sat at Mr. Hosokawa's side during the tense negotiations over the political reform bill, and by most accounts he cut the final deal. That should do his popular image a lot of good. **********""Often, the best leaders in Japan are not those who make issues clear, but those who are the mediators,"" said Shigetada Kishii, the managing editor of Mainichi Shimbun. ""That is what we are looking for now."""

It had planned to begin its expansion into Canada with a store in Vancouver, British Columbia, opening later this year, which it would operate out of the Pacific Northwest, where it has a handful of stores. **********But the purchase of Aikenhead's will give Home Depot a ready-made management team and operational infrastructure. Aikenhead's is headed by a former Home Depot executive, Stephen Bebis, who essentially cloned the Home Depot format and formula -- a wide assortment of merchandise stocked in depth and sold by highly trained employees who dole out helpful tips and instruction -- for Molson. **********Although Home Depot sued Mr. Bebis in 1991 when he left the company for prematurely exercising stock options, forcing him to return some gains, they have since reconciled their differences, and Mr. Bebis is expected to rejoin Home Depot as the head of its Canadian venture."

Morgado, the chairman and chief executive of the group, the world's biggest record distributor and the most profitable arm of Time Warner Inc. **********Company executives said that Mr. Morris, who in July was put in charge of the company's three record groups, Warner Brothers, Elektra and Atlantic Records, had a showdown with Mr. Morgado this week because he was not allowed to run the labels as he saw fit. At a meeting on Wednesday with Time Warner's chairman, Gerald M.

Rob Dickins, chairman of London-based Warner Music U.K., whom Mr. Morgado had favored to succeed Mr. Ostin as head of Warner Brothers Records, will not be offered the job. Mr. Morris, who is said to have objected to the selection, said he would announce his choice as a label head next week. **********But his first priority, he said, is to buy the 75 percent of Interscope Records Inc. that Time Warner does not already own.

Its value has been estimated at $300 million to $400 million and both Sony Records and Polygram are said to have made offers to Jimmy Iovine, cofounder of the label. **********Currently, Interscope, which is based in Los Angeles, is part of Atlantic Records, which along with Elektra has headquarters in New York. Warner Brothers is based in Burbank, Calif. **********But executives at Warner Music doubt that Mr. Morris and Mr. Morgado have truly worked out all their differences. ""This is going to be a fight to the death,"" one Warner Music executive said. ""No matter what kind of rubber-band, face-saving fix they put on this, there is no trust between them. This is far from a stabilizing development. Artists are't going to sign to a place with this much political infighting."" **********After Mr. Waronker's surprise decision this week not to succeed Mr. Ostin as chairman of Warner Brothers, several artists, including its biggest, R.E.M., have expressed nervousness about staying with the company."

Westinghouse Sells Supply Company"," **********The Westinghouse Electric Corporation has agreed to sell its electrical-products subsidiary for $340 million to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, a private investment firm, the two concerns announced yesterday. **********The subsidiary -- the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company, known as Westco -- is the second-largest company in the $45 billion market for electrical equipment in North America. It makes a variety of ingredients for other products -- ranging from lighting to motors to transmission components -- and had sales of $1.6 billion last year. **********The purchase price includes $265 million in cash and approximately $50 million in first-mortgage notes. Westinghouse will also retain a 10 percent stake in the company, worth approximately $25 million. **********Proceeds from the Westco sale will be used to further reduce its debt to $4 billion, from $5.2 billion at the end of last year and $8.4 billion at the end of 1992, when the company announced a restructuring. **********""By completing this sale in the first quarter, as expected, we continue to be ahead of schedule in our plan to rebuild the financial strength of Westinghouse,"" Westco's chairman, Michael H. Jordan, said. Burdened by Property Losses **********The electrical-products unit is one of several noncore businesses that Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse identified in the restructuring as for sale. It mounted these initiatives after losses, mostly in commercial real estate, by a financial-services subsidiary. **********Wanting to further reduce its debt, Westinghouse moved up to this year the planned sale of its real estate development subsidiary, Westinghouse Communities Inc. The company had planned to sell the subsidiary, which developed communities in Florida and California, in 1995. **********Westco is the 20th purchase by Clayton, Dubilier since its founding in 1978. With an equity pool of $1 billion, the New York-based investment firm specializes in buying businesses spun off by their parent companies. Its other businesses have combined sales of $10 billion. **********Westco had an operating profit of $10 million last year, but it lags behind competitors according to some financial benchmarks, said B. Charles Ames, a Clinton, Dubilier partner who will become chairman. Mr. Ames said changes would be made in order for Westco to meet Clayton, Dubilier's goal of a 40 percent return on investment. **********Among changes planned over the next two to three years: cutting wages by $200 million to $220 million, possibly by reducing the number of employees from the current 3,000; lowering shipping costs, which are eight percentage points higher for Westco than the industry average, and shrinking inventory from four and a half months to the industry average of two and a half months. ""There's about $50 million to $60 million too much inventory,"" Mr. Ames said. **********Westinghouse shares closed yesterday at $14.625, down 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange."

Derr, received more than $2.77 million in salary and bonuses last year as his total cash compensation rose 45.5 percent from 1992, according to the oil company's proxy statement. **********Mr. Derr, who is also Chevron's chairman, received $2.77 million in total cash compensation and 46,800 options to acquire Chevron stock in 2003 at $87.75 each, according to the proxy for the company's annual meeting on May 3. **********Mr. Derr held 117,900 exercisable options valued at about $2.09 million as of Dec. 31. **********In 1992, Mr. Derr received $1.91 million in total cash compensation and 47,300 options to acquire Chevron stock at $68.625 in 2002. Chevron's stock closed on Friday at $88.25, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Chevron, the third-largest United States oil company, saw its net income fall in 1993 as it incurred one-time costs to revamp American operations, moved to lay off workers and was hit hard by a 10 percent decline in average crude oil prices. **********The company's management compensation committee said Mr. Derr was rewarded for meeting goals for increased earnings and reduced operating costs. **********They also cited a project in Kazakhstan to develop an oilfield estimated to hold 25 billion barrels."

Europe!," **********IT'S another busy day at Hamster Productions, one of France's most successful television programming makers. Pierre Grimblat, Hamster's president, is putting the final touches on the musical score for ""L'Amour est un jeu d'enfants"" (""Love Is a Children's Game""), a movie for Canal Plus, the French pay-television service. Production is about to begin on the next installment of ""Navarro,"" a long-running cop series that is consistently among the top-rated shows on TF1, the biggest French network. **********""We are story makers and story tellers,"" said Mr. Grimblat, summoning up traditions that France has fought to defend against what it views as American cultural imperialism. **********Yet in this picture of French culture proudly at work, there is one jarring element: Hamster is one-third owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the parent of the ABC television network and one of the largest American media companies. Capital Cities/ABC does not interfere with Hamster's creative decisions, but the companies work closely in almost every other way, from exchanging scripts to hunting for acquisitions. **********""There is no day when we don't say, 'What would ABC have done?' "" Mr. Grimblat said. ""They are so modern and so knowledgeable about the international destiny of television."" **********France may have won a great victory in the world trade talks late last year by heading off demands from the United States for the European Union to drop its quotas and subsidies and throw open its markets for movies and television programs. But while Europeans can rest assured that their heritage is safe for now from limitless ""Dukes of Hazzard"" reruns, they are just recognizing the scale of a quieter but more far-reaching American invasion, one that has seen companies from the United States infiltrate nearly every corner of the European television business. **********As far as television goes, the GATT negotiations, in fact, may have missed the point. No longer does the American entertainment industry view Europe simply as a place to sell what Hollywood makes. Instead, American media and communications companies from Time Warner to Turner Broadcasting, Tele-Communications Inc., Viacom, Walt Disney, Cox Cable, U S West, NBC, Capital Cities and others are rushing to invest in the heart of the fast-growing, fast-changing European television industry. That means finding a place in European-based programming production, in broadcast stations, in cable and satellite networks and in the coming convergence of telecommunications and entertainment. **********Indeed, Europe has become the primary target of the American media and communications industries as they scour the globe for new opportunities. Latin America is also starting to draw American investment in media and entertainment, and many industry executives say the biggest long-term opportunity is in China and the other fast-growing markets of Asia. But neither Latin America nor Asia is yet affluent enough to support the kind of rapid growth in broadcasting -- and the advertising that supports it -- that has made Europe such an attractive target for investment from the United States. **********In European broadcasting, American media executives see a business that is being transformed rapidly by its evolution from an era of state ownership and boring programming to an age of commercial television and ever-increasing viewing choices. They see a huge need for money, for technical expertise and for programming -- all of which American companies can provide in abundance. And they see a huge market -- 350 million people in the 12 major Western European nations, and 650 million people overall west of Russia, many of them hungry for televised news and entertainment. **********""This is not a mature marketplace,"" said Richard F. Spinner, president of the ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group's European operations. ""There will be a very full broadcasting business in Europe before too long and our company intends to be a part of it and hopefully a significant part of it."" **********In most cases American investments have been made through joint ventures with eager European partners and in full compliance with limits on foreign ownership. No one is any closer to resolving the question of whether exposure to the likes of ""Beavis and Butt-head"" will lead to the downfall of European civilization. **********But there is no doubt that American companies are playing an increasingly influential and potentially sensitive role in Europe by virtue of owning all or part of the pipelines through which programming is delivered into homes, as well as by having a hand in making the programming itself. **********""There's a real prospect of American companies being the gatekeepers of entertainment distribution in large parts of Europe and indeed around the world,"" said Nick Lovegrove of McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, in London. **********The possibility that dominance of distribution networks by Americans will ultimately lead to domestic programming being squeezed out by ""Baywatch"" and its ilk has some Europeans nervous, and it has created an environment in which a backlash in the form of tighter limits on foreign investment and program distribution seem increasingly possible. **********Last fall France and Belgium barred Turner Broadcasting from distributing on their national cable systems a service combining its TNT movie channel and its Cartoon Network, asserting that even though the programming was dubbed the channels did not meet European Union requirements that a majority of programming be locally produced. The Turner networks, however, can be seen in 100,000 homes in France that have dishes to receive satellite broadcasts, which respect no borders. 'War Machine' **********Satellites beaming down American programs from the skies over Europe are ""a genuine war machine,"" Alain Carignon, the French Minister of Communications, wrote last month in Le Monde. The takeover fever in the entertainment industry in the United States, the marriage of cable and telecommunications, the huge investments in new technology -- all should serve as a warning signal to Europe of a looming American threat, he wrote. **********""Audiovisual is the major strategic prize of the next century and the European market the principal target of the big American communications groups,"" Mr. Carignon wrote. **********So far, the dollars being invested are relatively modest, at least by the standards of an industry in which $10 billion deals are becoming commonplace, and it is as yet unclear what kind of returns the investments will yield. But that has not stopped a flood of deals from getting done: *********** Time Warner, through its HBO International subsidiary, has started a pay-television service and invested in cable systems in Hungary, taken a stake in a local TV station in Berlin and helped start a 24-hour cable news channel in Germany. It has a pay-TV joint venture in Scandinavia, is co-producing programming with an English company and is reportedly interested in investing in a new national broadcast network in Poland. *********** Tele-Communications Inc., the Denver-based cable giant that is merging with the Bell Atlantic Corporation, has invested $450 million in cable programming networks and cable systems in Britain, Norway, Sweden, Hungary, Ireland and France, and expects its investment to reach $550 million by the end of the year. *********** Disney, which has greatly expanded its presence in Europe since opening the struggling Euro Disney theme park, just began a venture to produce children's programming in conjunction with the major broadcast networks in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The company also owns 25 percent of one of Britain's broadcast networks, GMTV. *********** Viacom over the past few years has built MTV Europe into a highly successful network that is already available in slightly more homes in Europe -- 60 million -- than in the United States. Viacom is about to launch its other music video channel, VH-1, in Britain. It has introduced its Nickelodeon network across Europe in partnership with British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite TV company half owned by Rupert Murdoch. *********** Twentieth Century Fox and its Fox Broadcasting television network, owned by Mr. Murdoch, have been funneling such programming as ""Beverly Hills 90210"" to British Sky. *********** A group of American investors, including Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir, have a 75 percent stake in the Czech Republic's first privately owned television station, which began broadcasting on Friday. *********** NBC acquired a pan-European network, now called the NBC Super Channel, last fall. **********""We're going to ruin your culture just like we ruined our own,"" jokes Jay Leno in a promotional spot for the European network. **********For many American companies, though, culture is not the issue. Wires are -- more specifically the fiber optic cables that are transforming communications and entertainment in Europe the same way they are expected to in the United States. The best example is Britain, where liberal rules on foreign ownership of cable systems and a near-total deregulation of the telephone business have created a unique laboratory for the companies that will be the prime contractors for the information superhighway in the United States. **********In Britain, the cable and telephone industries are in the process of merging into one, and it is American companies that are leading the way, creating a burgeoning demand for new sources of entertainment -- which in some cases those same companies are also supplying. **********Take Tele-Communications Inc., which is operating in Britain in a partnership with U S West called TeleWest. The joint venture is running neck-and-neck with Nynex as the largest cable service provider in the country. What makes the business so appealing to the American companies is that they are free to offer both cable and phone service over the same lines -- which they are only now starting to gain the freedom to do in the United States -- giving them two sources of income from their investment in laying fiber optic cable across the country. **********In a country where direct-to-home satellite transmission has always been the primary alternative to over-the-air television, the new cable systems are becoming increasingly popular with consumers. In Demand **********For one thing, they hold the promise of new services, such as video on demand, a sort of electronic version of a trip to the video store. Moreover, they have spurred competition in the telephone business, shaking up the primary service provider, British Telecommunications P.L.C., and setting off price wars. **********Other European nations are heading at varying speeds in the same direction. And although none of them are likely to be as wide open to American investment as Britain, all are expected to need the money and expertise that companies from the United States can provide. **********""Those opportunities are absolutely inevitable,"" said Adam Singer, vice president-international for Tele-Communications Inc. **********For T.C.I., the move toward more cable and more channel capacity means more demand for the programming networks it owns. T.C.I. is now one of the largest programming forces in Europe, owning or managing Bravo, the Children's Channel, Discovery and the Family Channel, among others. **********As the dominant owners of the networks that are carried over cable lines or sent direct into European homes by satellite, American companies also face a decision on how European they should be. In some cases, the logic behind an investment in a channel or a network is simply to provide another outlet for programming already produced and paid for in the United States. **********NBC, whose acquisition of Super Channel was its first major foray into Europe, has chosen to fill much of the pan-European network's schedule with NBC's own shows from the United States, including ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" ""Today"" and business news from its CNBC cable news operation. **********Disney, by contrast, co-produces versions of children's programming, such as its ""Disney Club,"" with local broadcasters to tailor the shows to local languages and customs. **********Some companies, like Capital Cities/ABC, have chosen to cover as many bases as they can. **********In addition to Hamster, it owns stakes in three other production companies, in Germany, Spain and Britain. It owns one third of Eurosport, a pan-European all-sports network along the lines of ESPN. It owns a stake in RTL-2, a German broadcaster, and in a Scandinavian broadcasting venture. And it is looking at investments in local television stations that are beginning to pop up across Europe, where nearly all broadcasting to date has been done through national channels. **********Central to ABC's strategy, said Herbert A. Granath, president of the ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group, is finding the right local partner -- like Mr. Grimblat of Hamster. But ABC executives said they have no desire to make Hamster any less French. Indeed, Mr. Grimblat and his No. 2, Nicolas Traube, continue to support production subsidies and programming quotas, at least for a few more years, positions anathema to the entertainment establishment in the United States. **********Still, there is no question that they feel very much a part of the inexorable globalization of the TV industry. **********""With ABC,"" Mr. Grimblat said, ""I have the impression of being a member of the family."" MTV EUROPE IS ROCKING TO A LOCAL BEAT LONDON **********BILL ROEDY, chief executive of MTV Europe, does not spend much time worrying about quotas or accusations of American cultural imperialism. **********""A non-issue for us,"" he said, explaining that 85 percent of the network's programming is produced in Europe or, in the case of music videos, features European artists. MTV Europe, he said, imports a lower proportion of its programming from outside Europe than TF1 or Rai Uno, the largest French and Italian broadcast networks. **********If any company has managed to graft an American television concept successfully onto a European sensibility, it is MTV. **********MTV Europe has clearly tapped into a European youth subculture. It is one in which English is the common second language and in which national borders and identities appear less important than global musical and life style influences. By the same token, it is one that does not always look to American culture for its lead. **********The network, which is owned by Viacom and is the largest of the company's attempts to extend the MTV concept worldwide, hasn't completely shed its American identification; it shows the quirky American-made animated program ""Beavis and Butt-head,"" for example. **********But the network has worked assiduously at reflecting the tastes of its rapidly growing pan-European audience. Its programs are hosted by a staff of European VJ's based in MTV's studio in London. It has developed news and public affairs programs specifically for European viewers. And it is increasingly featuring music from the European continent and decreasing its reliance on videos from the United States and Britain, long the dominant influences in popular music. **********Broadcast in English now, MTV Europe is considering adding versions in French, German, Italian and other languages. **********""Everything we do is European,"" said Mr. Roedy, 45, a West Point-educated former Army officer who is one of six Americans on a staff of 260. **********Surprisingly, only 3.2 million of the nearly 60 million homes in Europe that receive the network via satellite or cable are in its home base of Britain. Its biggest market by far is Germany, where it is available in more than 18 million households. In the Netherlands, the number is 5.2 million and in Belgium, 3.6 million. Millions of other viewers across Europe also receive MTV via limited agreements with local broadcasters, including 88 million in the former Soviet Union who can see it for one hour a week. **********Ultimately, though, it's not how many homes a network is in that determines success, but how many advertising dollars it is able to attract. **********Although ratings are fragmentary, they have been sufficient to attract more than 200 advertisers. MTV Europe's revenues last year were around $70 million and the network has been profitable for a year and a half. CATCHING LENO IN LONDON LONDON **********FOR homesick American travelers and expatriates throughout Europe, NBC Super Channel, which is available in 30 million homes and many hotels, is a godsend. There, every weeknight, is ""The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,"" a great way to keep up with the latest Tonya Harding and Lorena Bobbitt jokes. Want breaking news from the States? Super Channel televised KNBC-TV's live coverage of the Los Angeles earthquake. Need to know what's happening in the markets? Tune in CNBC's financial coverage from New York. **********The question is whether Super Channel, which was acquired last fall by the American network and quickly filled with NBC's news and entertainment programming, has any appeal to Europeans, especially the multilingual business executive who is NBC's primary target. **********Some European media executives think the answer is no. But Thomas S. Rogers, president of NBC Cable and Business Development, said the company is pleased with the network's overall performance so far, although no ratings figures are available yet and the company has not released any financial results. ""There's a lot of positive buzz and a lot of advertiser interest,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""Jay Leno is getting real good word of mouth in Germany."" **********Super Channel, which is run from London by Patrick Cox, a longtime European television executive, also carries considerable European-produced programming, particularly in news and business news. **********Mr. Rogers said the combination of European and American programming would provide a type of service that affluent, well-educated viewers cannot get elsewhere. ""It's not intended to be a vehicle that has a massive reach,"" he said. ""It's intended to have a very strong upscale reach. We believe that audience does exist and the indications are that we are reaching it."""

Now it's the Americans' turn. **********United States corporations and investors are poised for a new round of ventures in Mexico after the ruling party's recent victory in an election they regard as clean enough, at least, to be valid. **********Mexican stocks have jumped, anticipating and then responding to the success of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's presidential candidate. Corporate expansions and direct investments will come more gradually, however, since they take more than a phone call to arrange and can be much harder to reverse.  Dusting Off Proposals **********Already, though, the rustling and shuffling heard in many American corporate offices come from plans for Mexican investment being pulled out of the drawers and off the shelves where they had been put when the party, known as P.R.I., faltered early this year with the peasant rebellion in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas and the assassination of P.R.I.'s initial presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. **********""We were waiting to see the results of the election before we did anything,' said Sheila Gallagher, a spokeswoman for the Centex Corporation, the largest American home builder. Laurence E. Hirsch, Centex's chief executive, while refusing to describe his plans there, said, ""An election that didn't elect the P.R.I. would have led one to wonder about the consequences."" **********The Mexican Government, although committed to free markets, has a far greater role in the economy than the United States Government, thereby making national elections that much more of a business issue. Just as ancient Romans reckoned periods of time by consulships, Mexican business people frame their long-range plans by the sexenio, the six-year presidential term. **********Now, much more than before, Americans are planning for the coming sexenio as well. ""Is the politics -- let's call it an opening -- going to keep moving in the same direction as the economic opening?"" asked Hugo Verdegaal, the head of international corporate finance for Citibank in New York. ""The election confirmed to a lot of people that is the case."" **********Mr. Verdegaal said that rather than reacting suddenly to the vote, American and Mexican corporations began to breathe more easily a few months ago as the P.R.I. began to recover from the peasant uprising and Mr. Colosio's assassination. Citibank now expects to help finance Government infrastructure projects, especially in electric power, that were put off until after the election. **********United States investment in Mexico has grown rapidly in recent years, with a burst after Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement in November. Much new investment by American corporations is bound to be quiet, even furtive. They crank out news releases when they ship more products to Mexico, but not when they ship jobs. **********The investment momentum slowed this year, but Jaime Alatorre, president of the Mexican Investment Board, expects a strong revival. Just this week, he and his staff began calling back American companies that in the last few months had postponed decisions on Government projects or investments of their own. **********""Ports, power generation,"" he began in a phone interview, as if going down a list. ""A number of them in textiles, garments. Those projects will be moving much faster. There are projects in the area of auto parts."" **********Some apparel work for American corporations will soon move to Mexico from Asia to qualify for the trade pact's tariff reductions on exports to the United States, he said. As for auto parts, the Big Three auto companies are asking suppliers to set up factories near the auto makers' Mexican assembly plants. Hopeful About Reform **********American companies are encouraged not only by Mr. Zedillo's allegiance to current economic policies but also by the chances that he will revive other, stalled reforms. ""That's a main topic: the Government itself delaying liberalization until after the elections,"" said Ronald J. Johansson, a partner in the Kenneth Leventhal & Company real estate consulting firm. **********Despite opposition from the Mexican Legislature, the Government is already proposing to bundle home mortgages and sell them as investment securities. This step could vastly expand home ownership through more readily available mortgages, as well as create opportunities for American investors and financiers. **********The American real estate and financial services industries could be among the first to see business improve, not only from reforms but also from rising business confidence. Mexican executives, after all, were at least as jittery as American executives in their country. **********Eduardo Vidal, a partner with the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom law firm in New York, said he is leaving for Mexico next week to help two companies, including one building a water-treatment system for Cancun, raise money in the American markets. ""That's the biggest thing we export: services,"" he said. ""Lawyers, accountants, investment bankers."" **********Mexican companies seeking larger or more modern offices will find that even in Mexico City buildings with dependable elevators, air-conditioning and wiring for computers, phones and facsimile machines are scarce. Mr. Johansson speaks of one client, cautiously active in Mexico for a decade, who is now preparing to build office towers. A Crowded Market **********Still, prospects in Mexico are not as bright as some companies believe. Many will find Mexican markets already crowded, particularly in fields like American-style retailing. Market research is primitive and income disparities are increasing, with doubts about just how many Mexicans can consume in a manner to which Americans are accustomed. To fend off kidnappers, Mexican business leaders must employ their own platoons of bodyguards. **********Mark Robertson, the director of Cushman & Wakefield's real estate leasing partnership in Mexico, is resolutely upbeat, noting that the political fears raised by the Chiapas uprising and the assassination of Mr. Colosio have eased. But even he has some worries. ""If the people in Chiapas wave their rifles up and down and pull their ski masks back on,"" he said, ""those who have not made an investment may put it on hold."""

Michener's first collection of stories, ""Tales of the South Pacific,"" won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 and was the basis for the Broadway musical, ""South Pacific."" **********Although perhaps best known for his epic historical novels like ""Hawaii"" and ""The Source,"" Mr. Michener is also proud of his scholarly nonfiction works like ""Iberia"" and ""Japanese Prints."" **********He is the Jack G. Taylor Centennial professor emeritus at the Texas Center for Writers at the University of Texas at Austin. The university recently co-sponsored a conference called ""Making Money on the Internet."" Mr. Michener was in the front row. **********Question: Why are you here at an Internet conference? **********Answer: I teach young writers at the university. I'm constantly worried as to how they are going to fit into the system, which is changing so rapidly. This might be a way for young writers to get experience. **********Q: How is the writing system changing? **********A: My original contract with Random House was four foolscap pages, every phrase of which had been vetted by the Supreme Court, so that we all knew what a book is. My last contract was 48 pages because it had to deal with these new forms of distribution, and about half the forms were ones about which I didn't even know the definitions. **********Q: Forms of electronic distribution, not just hard cover, paperback and movie rights? **********A: Yes, and who owns the copyright, and things like that. **********Q: Do you look forward to having your books distributed electronically? **********A: Looking forward has two meanings. Am I prepared for the inevitability? Yes. Do I necessarily approve of it?  [ He shrugs ] . **********I worked overseas a great deal and I really never followed my financial operations, and held them rather in contempt. But the last two accountings have talking books and CD's and videos, and the income was substantial. My books are not particularly popular in those fields, but that's real income. **********It's the problem of the introduction of a new device. By and large if it's a device of the future, you'd better be along with it or you're going to lose greatly. **********Q: What kind of word processor do you use? **********A: I type all my long books with two fingers and I do a lot of retyping. But once I get it done, then we go to a word processor immediately, through my secretary, and we edit it furiously, right up to publication. **********Q: Has writing a first draft on a computer ever appealed to you? **********A: I never learned the keyboard. I am a man of the word of the printed page. I want a record of what I did, how I screwed up. I do a first draft, cut it apart, paste in corrections, make eliminations. I've done it all my life. I am 87 years old, sharply crippled, and I am working on three manuscripts, which are in three different stages of completion. **********Q: So, you're into parallel processing and multi-tasking.

Its value even eclipsed that of MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance telephone in the United States and a company that has served as DDI's corporate mentor. **********""The company's a real go-getter,"" said Chuck Goto, a managing director at Smith Barney Shearson in New York. ""They're trying to take away the local call business from Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, and their political jockeying has been impressive."" **********Yet Mr. Semmoto, 52, is quick to admit that his strategic thinking has its roots in the values of America, where he studied as a Fulbright scholar and earned his master's and doctoral degrees. **********While DDI's success shows that the Japanese economy can reward risk-takers, he said he feared society remains intolerant of the entrepreneurial spirit, a tendency that helped knock Japan out of first place in a worldwide study of international competitiveness published this week. Japan had been ranked first in every year since 1985. **********""I go to Silicon Valley every month, and I always enjoy a kind of excitement that I cannot find in Tokyo,"" he said. ""Here someone who wants to do something irregular is still not accepted."" **********""Japanese society is gradually changing, and there is hope, but I'm concerned with the timing. If it takes 10 years, Japan may not survive the competition with the United States or China."" **********For Mr. Semmoto, risk-taking has not meant going for the quick buck. In 1966, after receiving his doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, he was offered jobs at AT&T Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. **********But, fearing racial prejudice might prevent him from reaching the ranks of senior management and seeing signs of Japan's economic potential, he decided to pursue the more gradual but potentially greater career opportunities at NTT. **********""I'm not a WASP, and there was implicit racial prejudice against Asians,"" he said. ""NTT offered 10 percent as much money and a miserable atmosphere, but I thought I had more future."" **********He joined the fast track at NTT, then a government monopoly with 300,000 employees. As a major source of business for NEC, Fujitsu and other electronics companies, NTT's senior executives sat at the top of the industrial pecking order. **********But for a man who had been taken by American egalitarianism, the frustration was too much. ""I had seen a totally different world, but 99.9 percent of the people at NTT were living within a closed society,"" he said. ""Everything from hospitals to resorts was provided. It was a pure socialist planned economy with no competition, with only a few honchos controlling the rest."" **********After heading NTT's effort to coordinate the commercial manufacture of fiber-optic cables by Japanese companies, Mr. Semmoto became involved in network systems, a precursor to multimedia. While giving a speech to business executives in 1983, he met Mr. Inamori of Kyocera, an aggressive entrepreneur who developed the Kyoto-based company into the world's largest maker of ceramic packages for microchips. **********Mr. Inamori had the money, guts and the need to diversify. Mr. Semmoto brought the vision that Japan would in time be forced to open up its domestic telecommunications market to competition. But jumping ship into unknown waters was difficult. **********""People told me I was crazy,"" he recalled. ""In Japan, to leave a company is evil. To leave a first-class company like NTT is the most evil thing."" **********His vision was vindicated in 1985, when the government privatized NTT and permitted competition. In 1987, DDI was incorporated, getting its start in the domestic long-distance telephone business. In 1989, it became a provider of cellular telephone services in western Japan. **********To compete with the much larger NTT, he drew upon relationships with MCI and Ameritech Corp., which provided customer-service plans and sophisticated customer-management software. DDI also opted for Motorola Inc.'s cellular technology, greatly reducing the cost of infrastructure and handsets."

MILO always thought he did a pretty good job of stroking and motivating his ""direct reports,"" so it came as a surprise when some of his managers at the Phico Insurance Company, a large health insurer in Mechanicsburg, Pa., let Mr. Milo know they felt unappreciated. Well, not exactly unappreciated. ""Through further analysis, we discovered they felt praised,"" said Mr. Milo, the senior vice president for administration and planning for Phico. ""But when someone does a super job, they feel they aren't treated differently."" **********Mr. Milo learned of his very reparable flaw while he was scouting and testing leadership development programs for Phico, in search of solutions to problems posed by changes in the economy and the nature of his business. His is an industry in turmoil, both from the corporate desire for more efficiency and the country's desire for health care reform. ""Re-engineering's hit us,"" he said. ""We need to be much more flexible, more customer-focused. We need to get people to be more creative."" **********Among the programs he tried was an executive coaching seminar put on by the insurance practice of the Hay Group, the big consulting firm in New York. For three days last fall he was assessed, interviewed, benchmarked and mentored. He listened to feedback gathered before the seminar from colleagues, subordinates and supervisors and soaked it up from his co-participants. He learned that consultants had a word or phrase for every style of work, management, personality, learning or ability. **********He came away, he says, understanding better what the ""core competencies"" -- the crucial skills -- of a leader are, how to match them with Phico's strategic goals and how to encourage his people to acquire them. The course may have helped him understand himself better. ""It gives you an idea of what your motives are, whether for achievement or power or affiliation,"" he said. ""It gives you a look inside at what drives you."" **********Coaching -- as executive development has come to be called -- is not new. But corporate shrinkage and the dawning era of flexible, decentralized management are making obsolete the idea that executives can expect to muscle their way to a career pinnacle and then coast until retirement. Increasingly, they are expected to be, in the words of the anthropologist Harvey Sarles, ""auto-didacts,"" or self-teachers and lifelong learners, whose performance will evolve and improve. **********But it is not so easy to push senior managers into what is essentially a training mode. ""We think it's O.K. for first-line supervisors to get training, but not for higher ups,"" said Martin Leshner, managing director for the Hay Group and head of its insurance practice. When they think of improving their performance, most employees focus on gaining more technical skills, precisely what they don't need, in Mr. Leshner's view, especially if they are moving up the hierarchy. ""Mostly, people need the ability to influence people. The way organizations operate these days, you are interacting with people who don't work for you. You can't just make them do something,"" he said. **********Younger employees, in particular, are not receptive to the send-'em-to-the-principal school of management. ""They aren't chain of command-oriented,"" said Steven E. Lurie, head of Lurie Executive Development, a coaching firm based in Valley Stream, L.I. **********If learning to use influence rather than raw aggression is a frequent proximate cause for calling in a coach, failing to make the mental leap from technician to leader is another. One of Mr. Lurie's recent success stories, as he described it, was a manager in a small organization who had recently taken over the leadership of a team, and soon found himself at the center of struggle and tension. ""There was a lot of internal competition,"" Mr. Lurie said. ""He couldn't get straight answers or information from people, even though he was very open and available -- the opposite of the previous boss."" **********THE problem turned out to be that he thought his job was to tell his ""direct reports"" how to do their jobs. His employees felt insulted and devalued. ""They were professionals who needed to be left alone,"" Mr. Lurie said. The boss was panicked because he didn't know how to prove his effectiveness without measurable results, like sales figures, to show. ""That's pretty typical of business men and women I deal with,"" Mr. Lurie said. ""They get rewarded for very tangible accomplishments. Leadership is habitually referred to as the soft stuff."" The executive's developmental leap, as Mr. Lurie called it, was to be willing to trade his tangibles for ""just"" being a leader. **********Feedback played an important role in helping the executive modify his style. His employees noted his ability to bring them together as a team, to keep the unit visible at the corporate level and to garner good community relationships. **********For Phico's Mr. Milo, who has brought the Hay Group's program in-house so that all Phico managers may go through it, what he learned about feedback of all sorts may be the most valuable lessons of the seminar. He has already instituted more recognition programs so superachievement is acknowledged. And the strategic core competencies -- the ability to influence, for example -- rather than technical ability may become the basis of performance reviews. ""The biggest skill sets are coaching, counseling, giving and getting feedback and giving recognition,"" Mr. Milo said, adding, ""We're looking for managers to understand the impact they have on people."" WHAT COACHING CAN'T ACCOMPLISH **********IT is not impossible to coach a person's career back to life, but most executive development experts say companies should not regard coaching as the last chance for the employee to avoid being cashiered. ""Sometimes it's hard to ascertain the true motives of a company,"" said Martin Leshner, a development expert at the Hay Group. ""I ask them not to send people they have trouble with. It's an especially bad idea if the person goes and doesn't do well."" The message to other employees can be that coaching means their careers are on the line. **********Steven Lurie, head of his own executive development firm, frequently sees valued employees who are stalled for one reason or another, but he too is leery of taking on lost causes. ""If the person has no real future, but the company feels bad about not giving him feedback for 20 years, then it's a nonintervention,"" he said. ""If you want a 9 and he's a 3, it probably doesn't make sense."""

The sequel.,Economic Scene; Lower income taxes stimulate the economy. The sequel.," **********REMEMBER the Laffer curve? That was the back-of-the napkin illustration by the economist Arthur Laffer of his idea that in some cases lower tax rates actually increase government revenues. It inspired the immense rate reductions of the early Ronald Reagan era -- and later, the I-told-you-so chuckles from mainstream economists who never believed the rosy revenue forecasts. **********Well, nobody's laughing these days. The Laffer curve is alive and well, back at the heart of academic and political debates over the ""dynamic scoring"" proposed by some Republicans in computing how tax changes affect the budget. **********Although Republican leaders in Congress now say they will pare the budget before they cut taxes, much still hangs on how tax cuts are scored. If the ""supply siders"" who dominate the House Republicans have their way, Congress will be able to deliver a host of tax breaks without touching the budget perks of the middle class. **********Under the self-imposed rules of Congress, any bill that adds to the deficit must be offset by budget cuts or revenue ""enhancements,"" otherwise known as tax increases. The estimates are made by the Congressional Budget Office, using formulas created by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The final arbiter is the White House's Office of Management and Budget. If O.M.B. decides that Congress has, in effect, cooked the books, the President is obliged to hold back a portion of the appropriated funds. **********Everything turns on the assumptions used to project revenues. The most conservative stance is that tax rates do not affect the level of taxable transactions. **********Assume, for example, that Americans spend $100 billion a year on new cars. A truly ""static analysis"" would count a special 50 percent tax on cars as a $50 billion gain in revenue. **********This approach guarantees error: When you shoot at a flying duck, as the late Senator Russell Long once put it, you aim where the duck is heading, not where the duck is. In the case of the auto tax, people would presumably postpone purchases, buy cheaper vehicles or make payments under the table. **********That is why the Joint Tax Committee, contrary to some ill-informed claims by outsiders like Rush Limbaugh, does include some behavioral responses to tax changes. In estimating the revenue impact of cutting the capital gains tax rate, for instance, Congressional tax experts assume that big gains would be ""unlocked"" in the early years as people chose to sell appreciated assets. **********But dynamic scoring is a slippery slope. And the current debate focuses on just how dynamic the scorekeepers can be without sliding into never-never land. Most economists believe it is not legitimate to count the Keynesian ""demand side"" impact of a tax cut -- for example, the stimulus to taxable income that followed the Kennedy Administration's business-tax cuts in the early 1960's. **********Why? Because, when the economy is operating near its full capacity, ""the Federal Reserve just isn't going to let it happen,"" argues Martin Feldstein, the conservative president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Any such stimulus, he asserts, would be offset by tighter credit policies by the Fed to prevent higher inflation. **********What is at stake is how tax changes alter incentives to work, save and invest -- and thus increase total productive capacity and taxable income in the long run. While virtually all experts agree there are effects, the Joint Tax Committee assumes they are too small to matter much in the five-year horizon of budget planning. **********But supply-siders are partial to predictions that lower tax rates would stimulate a blizzard of new investment. Gary and Aldona Robbins, senior associates for Taxaction Analysis, a Texas-based research group, estimate that the House Republicans' capital gains cut would generate $167 billion in added revenue over seven years -- compared with the $17 billion cumulative loss estimated by the Joint Tax Committee. **********Is there a middle ground here? **********Maybe. Mr. Feldstein acknowledges that the short-term growth effects linked to increased investment and risk-taking are probably too modest to count in budget projections. But he argues that tax incentives can change hours worked relatively quickly. And he cites as evidence the doctoral thesis of one of his students at Harvard, Nada Eissa, who found that substantial numbers of upper-middle-income housewives joined the paid labor force after tax rates were cut in 1986. **********But even that may be going too far. Stanley Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, points out how skewed it would be to score the dynamic side effects of tax policy while ignoring any dynamic effects of government spending. To take just one example, one might assume that subsidies to science add more to productive capacity than an equivalent amount spent on consumer goods. Or a dollar taken from drug rehabilitation might reduce taxable income if it raised the cost of crime. **********In Mr. Collender's view, budgeting in the shadow of gigantic deficits ought to put the burden of proof on supply-siders. ""You want to be surprised by a deficit that's smaller than expected,"" he suggests, ""not larger."""

O'Brien, chairman of the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, the proof that business was feeling more bullish about the economy and intended to spend more was unmistakable: a $5 billion surge in the credit lines his bank extended to companies the last three months. **********The revival of business borrowing at PNC is just one of many signs the economy, now in its 34th month of stop-and-go expansion, has gotten back on a moderate growth track. Among the other indications: falling joblessness, consumers' improving mood, solid gains in spending on cars and other big-ticket items, rising industrial production and growing order backlogs. **********""We now have an expansion that's broad and deep enough so that I think we'll now see a sustained period of growth,"" said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's chief economist. **********Growth will probably not stay as strong as the 4 percent to 5 percent rate forecasters expect for the final quarter of 1993. Economists, in an unusually tight consensus, predict growth will average about 3 percent this year. **********They say there are too many negatives still facing the economy to make a boom probable: a hefty tax rise, more military cuts, a soggy world economy and a very low household savings rate. The plus is that most economists say they do not detect the kinds of imbalances -- creeping inflation, production bottlenecks or over leveraging -- that could short-circuit the recovery. **********""It's the well-rested economy phenomenon,"" said Laurence H. Meyers, president of Laurence H. Meyers & Associates in St. Louis and winner of the Sterling award for best predictions in 1993. ""We saved our strength, and some of it is coming out now."" **********Moderate growth has its virtues. Forecasters almost uniformly expect inflation to remain well behaved this year, citing an impressive array of forces -- from plenty of capacity to lively productivity growth to a vigilant Federal Reserve -- that are apt to keep it that way. Most see a repeat of last year's rise of about 3 percent in consumer prices. But some forecasters, including Larry Kimbell of the University of California at Los Angeles, think things will be even better than that. **********Economists also expect long-term interest rates, which determine the cost of buying a house or investing in new plant and equipment, to remain low by historical standards. **********Forecasters say a 3 percent growth rate is sufficiently solid to lift Americans' after-tax income in real terms and to whittle the unemployment rate. If the economy adds two million jobs, as the economists expect, the unemployment rate, now 6.4 percent, should edge down near 6 percent. In effect, that would mean full employment -- or something close to it -- in most states outside California and New York. **********Forecasters are rarely right on the money, though the blue-chip consensus only missed by a tenth of a percentage point on growth last year. This year most economists predict that any surprises are likely to be on the upside. **********""Since there was such weak economic growth from 1988 to 1992 and such limited job creation, Ms. Tyson said, ""there may be a fair amount of pent-up demand,"" which combined with low rates could lift consumer spending."

One Wall Street fund manager starts to sell when 25-year-old brokers, who have only been in the business for a year, start to call him by his first name. ""It means they are cocksure and riding for a fall,"" he said. **********When it comes to deciding the right time to buy and emerging market fund the calculation can be even more difficult. The secret is to use share price charts to pick up the bottom after the country has had one of its habitual corrections. The problem is that as soon as you sign the cheque your chosen market drops another 20 percent. **********Another technique is to watch the Asian expatriate community living in Berlin, New York or London. When they start investing money in their homelands it is often a sign that confidence is returning. However, sometimes they are too optimistic and get in too soon. **********To add to the difficulties, few of the people who poured money into emerging market funds last year get the chance to meet Polish taxi drivers, or talk to Mexican stockbrokers, or even have access to the charts. As a result a lot of them were sucked into funds close to the January peak on many exchanges. **********In 1993 record amounts of cash - estimated at $20 billion - was pumped into emerging market equity funds. By the end of the year there were 638 funds managing an estimated $80 billion. This volume of money helped chase these fashionable markets upwards. They seemed to offer far better returns than developed markets or staying in cash. **********""Emerging countries are growing at four times the rate of Western economies. They have become increasingly accessible for investment. And last year the final catalyst came with the economic liberalization of China,"" said Peter Jeffreys, managing director of Fund Research. **********But beginning in mid-January, many emerging markets went sharply into reverse. Investors who bought at the wrong time are learning the full, cruel meaning of the joke circulating in the financial community that ""emerging markets are markets that you can't emerge from in a crash."" **********Shortage of liquidity means that any selling pressure is magnified causing markets to plunge further than on Western stock exchanges. So far this year the scenario has unfolded in Turkey which is down over 60 percent and in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines to a lesser extent. **********Local speculators are often blamed for the panic selling that causes the sharp swings. But, today much of the ""hot money"" comes from Western investors, primarily the mutual funds that are nervous about their performance. Markets with the highest percentage of Western money are often the most volatile. **********One consolation for the investor is that mutual fund groups have performed better than the indexes in emerging markets over recent weeks. This is partly because the managers avoided some of the dubious recent flotations and because many foresaw a correction. **********However, the shakeout may not be over yet. ""Not all the speculative froth has been washed out. Essentially, we are seeing the flows of money drying up,"" said Bill McBride of Lipper Analytical Services in New York. ""These markets are unlikely to recover until the U.S. market becomes more settled."" **********He argues that U.S. money, which was behind much of last year's gains in emerging markets, will stay closer to home for the time being. Bonds are starting to look attractive in American and Europe which will take attention away from Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe. **********Some big fund managers, such as Scudder in America, are more optimistic. They see the recent correction in some markets as a good buying opportunity. For them, many of these emerging markets will resume their upward march when financial markets stabilize. **********But whether these emerging markets fall another 20 percent or the recovery starts now there is no doubt that investor confidence will return to these faster growing economies. The constant refrain from emerging market ""bulls"" is that developing countries contain around 80 percent of the world's population but only account for around 20 percent of world GDP."

Polish Eurobonds. Debt issued in Czech koruny by the Czech Republic's phone company. If you're wondering who would want to buy debt instruments like this, the answer is a small, but growing crowd of professional investors - including mutual fund managers. **********The case for buying debt in Central Europe's emerging markets, whether it is of the government or corporate type, is akin to the argument for buying U.S. ""junk"" bonds: high yields, deeply discounted prices, or both, to compensate for uncertainty and risk. **********The homework, warn the investors who deal in these markets, is complicated because the markets often have no benchmarks or liquidity. Inflation may be high, and monetary policies and politics uncertain. A vital part of the investment mentality is a conviction that the economies of these markets will improve, tempered with a keen instinct for when to get in and when to get out. **********Bulgaria, for example, would hardly seem a candidate for a fund portfolio. Its economy has suffered from close links with the former Soviet Union. Inflation is running at 68 percent, privatization programs have been delayed, and economic growth this year will be zero, at best, according to a research report from New York's Chemical Bank. **********Yet, ""Bulgaria is interesting,"" says Lincoln Rathnam, manager of the Scudder Emerging Markets Income fund. ""Industrial exports to Russia have picked up by about 50 percent, although from a very low point,"" he said. ""There's no government at the moment and bureaucrats are running the country, but there is good management at the Central Bank, and good relations with the International Monetary Fund."" **********Mr. Rathnam is one of a number of money managers who bought dollar-denominated Bulgarian Brady bonds when they were issued last July. Brady bonds, a key element in a country's return to credit- worthiness, are commercial bank debt that has been restructured to give countries more manageable payment terms. They are named for former U.S. Secretary of Treasury Nicholas Brady, who conceived the idea. **********By contrast, Hungary, which might have seemed a better bet, looks less tempting to some Central European market players these days. The country's budget deficit is growing, and disputes have erupted between the Central Bank and the Treasury as to how it should be financed. **********Helena Hessel of Standard & Poor's international rating group noted that S&P downgraded Hungary's sovereign rating from a BB ""positive"" to a BB ""stable"" last April. **********Sovereign ratings assess the credit-worthiness of a government and its ability to repay its debt in a timely fashion. **********But two of the brightest spots in Central Europe, in the opinion of some emerging- market experts, are Poland and the Czech Republic. Although inflation in Poland is still around 30 percent, it has been coming down steadily. **********""The economy is growing at about 4.5 percent, and even though there is some political uncertainty, the attitude at the Central Bank and Treasury has been conservative,"" said Kris Bledowski, Economic Adviser for the Warsaw-based Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund. **********The investment of choice for many foreign bond investors are Polish Brady bonds. And the next step in Poland's improving economic picture is the expectation that it will receive a sovereign rating in the next six months. **********""That's the missing link,"" said Mr. Bledowski, who estimates that this stamp of approval will probably boost the price of the country's Brady bonds from about 45 cents to 60 cents on the dollar. A sovereign rating would also have a positive effect on the Polish government's launch of its first issue of dollar-denominated Eurobonds in 1995, he added. **********Another recent development in Poland is the nascent commercial paper market in zlotys. Rather than borrow from banks at annual interest rates of about 35 percent, the Polish subsidiaries of household names like Pepsi-Cola and Unilever successfully issued commercial paper, backed by their parent companies, at rates between 26 and 27 percent. **********So far, investors have been locals, said Mr. Bledowski, but he expects the market to grow. ""Foreign investment banks are now jockeying to issue commercial paper,"" he said. ""We hope to have it like the Czech Republic, where the major companies are now issuing."" **********It's no surprise that Poland is looking to the Czech Republic, which is leading the way for the rest of Central Europe. With no external debt, inflation at 10 percent and falling, and a fiscally responsible government, it has the highest sovereign rating, BBB+, of all the former Eastern bloc countries, notes Peter Kysel, a director at John Govett, the London emerging-markets specialists. **********This coming week, CEZ, the czech electric utility, will launch a $150 million Eurobond on the international markets, the first corporation from the former Eastern block to do so. **********But with no Brady bonds, and only a small market in Eurobonds, Mr. Kysel thinks foreign investors will increasingly find Czech corporate bonds, issued in Czech koruny, worthwhile. **********""They're from large companies and banks, and while the quality is not as high as government bonds, it's still good,"" he said. ""The interest rates are 11 to 12 percent, compared with 9.5 to 10 percent for government bonds."" **********""I found it surprising that foreigners who bought the Czech economic story purchased equities, and are now sitting on 36 percent losses,"" Mr. Kysel commented, referring to the Prague stock market index, which has plunged from a peak of 1,244 last March to around 788 currently. ""They could have bought bonds in local currency yielding 12 percent, plus they would have received an 8 percent gain on price. They bought the wrong instruments."" **********Nevertheless, local bond markets are not without their caveats. The domestic market in the Czech Republic is tiny, only $1.7 billion, compared with $12 billion in the equity market, and the secondary market, where bonds are bought and sold is very limited. ""You must buy and hold your bonds,"" cautioned Mr. Kysel. **********Clearly, the only way for individual investors to take a stake in these markets is through a diversified emerging markets income fund, with the added warning that the ride can be a bumpy one. Three vehicles directed to U.S. investors that are beginning to buy some form of Central European debt are the Scudder Emerging Markets Income fund, the GT Global High-Income Fund, and Fidelity's New Markets Income Fund. **********The London-listed Central European Growth Fund, an investment trust, has a 14.2 percent position in fixed income from the Czech Republic, while the offshore arena offers Scudder's Sovereign High-Yield fund."

Coping With Change"," **********CLUTTERING bedroom dressers across America are pesky pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and the occasional Susan B. Anthony dollar. For most people, the unwanted pocket change is a nuisance that often winds up in piggy banks or shoe boxes instead of being rolled up and carted to the bank. **********Not for Gerald and Blanche Radder. Not anymore. **********On a recent Thursday, Mr. and Mrs. Radder made a special trip to the QFC supermarket here with a giant jar filled with who knew how many pennies and fed them into one of the nation's first self-service coin-sorting machines. **********From a steel tray, coins trickled automatically into the computerized sorter, as sensors sifted out lint, hair and other nonlegal tender. **********""This is great,"" said Mr. Radder, a 62-year-old retired warehouse manager. ""We're downsizing our junk piles. I can't believe I had collected that many pennies."" **********The coin sorters, distributed by Coinstar Inc. of Bellevue Wash., are now in 22 supermarkets in metropolitan Seattle, San Francisco and Sacramento. And Coinstar's founder and president, Jen Molbak, hopes to have 200 machines in supermarkets in the West by the end of the year. **********Mr. Molbak, 31, started the company with money from private investors shortly after he left Stanford five years ago with an M.B.A. and an entrepreneurial itch. Casting about for a niche to fill, he noticed that most banks refuse to accept unrolled coins, and those that do often charge a fee for accepting more than $50 worth of unrolled coins. **********Mr. Molbak and his wife, Blair, interviewed people emerging from supermarkets and found that most of them regarded the coin change they had just received as worthless. Mr. Molbak estimates that there is $5 to $10 billion in coins ""just out there lying around."" **********Data from the United States Mint may support his estimate. More than one-third of all pennies, nickels and dimes produced between 1965 and 1987 have fallen out of circulation, the mint says, and about a quarter of all quarters. **********""If we can just gather these coins and recycle them, we can reduce the mint's need to produce more coins and truly save the Government money,"" said Mr. Molbak, who comes from a prominent Seattle family that made its wealth in the greenhouse business. **********At its heart, each Coinstar sorter is a personal computer based on an Intel 386 microprocessor. The setup not only counts money and issues vouchers but also dispenses discount coupons for items in the store. **********The participating QFC supermarkets are operated by Quality Food Centers Inc. of Seattle. In California, the machines are being tested at Safeway supermarkets. **********Customers pay a fee of 10 cents on every dollar of pennies sorted and five cents on every dollar of sorted nickels, dimes and quarters, with the supermarkets and Coinstar sharing the proceeds. **********Mr. Molbak, who was on hand demonstrating the machine the day the Radders cashed in, nodded approvingly as the copper rained down on the stainless-steel tray. ""Every so often,"" he said, ""it sounds like a slot machine at Vegas.""MELANIE J. MAVRIDES"

It would require each country to notify American Embassy officials within 60 days after its police or customs officials seize a vehicle they believe to have been smuggled from the United States. **********In turn, if Washington has reason to believe a smuggled car has been seized or impounded by officials in one of the Central American countries, that government would be required to respond to the request and turn over the vehicle. **********The expenses incurred from returning, towing, storing and maintaining a recovered vehicle would be paid by the owner or his insurance company. When cars are not claimed, they would become the property of the Central American government and could be sold to help finance modernization of police forces. **********""I think the treaty is a tremendous step forward,"" said W. Joseph Pierron, director of Latin American operations for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a group financed by large insurance companies to fight auto theft and fraud. ""It is an absolute necessity if U.S. owners are to have any chance of recovering stolen property from that region."" **********Mr. Pierron noted that a similar treaty with Mexico had helped officials track down 5,000 stolen cars in Mexico last year, of which about half were returned to the United States. By comparison, only 500 stolen American cars were located in all of Central America, and few of those were returned to their owners. **********Ana Cristina Sol, El Salvador's Ambassador in Washington, said she welcomed the diplomatic initiative to fight auto theft, although she could not comment specifically about the treaty. ""In principle,"" she said, ""I could see no difficulty for our Government to participate in the efforts that will be done to stop this kind of theft."" **********An estimated 1.5 million vehicles were stolen in the United States in 1993. Of the 600,000 that were not recovered, one out of every three was smuggled abroad by individuals or organized crime groups, according to Government and auto insurance officials. Vehicle theft accounts for annual losses of $7.6 billion, or 50 percent of all reported property losses."

""In a way, I'd have liked the book to have been judged more as a book than as an event."" **********But in Britain the release of any scrap of news about the royal family is always an event, whether the scrap is true, sort of true or patently false. And Mr. Dimbleby, a serious journalist whose book was meticulously researched and painstakingly sourced, has benefited from this atmosphere as much as anyone. **********He is said to have received about $160,000 to write the book, which took him more than two years to complete and is based on hundreds of interviews and thousands of documents, including more than 10,000 letters. **********Mr. Dimbleby is also to receive a healthy share of the steep serialization rights, which were sold to The Sunday Times of London for a reported $320,000, and of the foreign sales in three countries. The book was published here on Nov. 3; in the United States, it was published in late November by William Morrow & Company, which rushed it into print with a healthy first printing of 150,000 to capitalize on the attention the book is receiving. **********Mr. Dimbleby joins a long string of authors to profit from books about the royal family. The books seem to come in waves, with periods of inactivity followed by periods of frenzy. Feeding the current hunger for royal news is ""Princess in Love,"" Anna Pasternak's breathless story of the five-year romance between Princess Diana and an army officer, and ""Diana: Her New Life,"" Andrew Morton's examination of what the Princess is doing now that she is on her own. **********As a group, the books have sold very well here, despite the fact that by the time they reached the stores, the newspapers had already printed much of the raciest new material. **********But ""The Prince of Wales"" has only 30 pages or so (out of a hefty 620) about the breakdown of the marriage between Prince Charles and Princess Diana, who is portrayed as creepily depressed and prone, in the early days of the marriage, to sitting for hours with her head buried in her hands. But those pages, Mr. Dimbleby said, were 30 more than he wanted to write. **********""I would have felt free not to have done it if the separation had not occurred,"" he said. ""It would have been possible to have made it clear that theirs was not the easiest marriage but they performed their public duties, and I could still explore the man without getting into that territory. Once the separation had happened, I had to write about it."" **********""The Prince of Wales"" is now in its second printing, with 157,000 copies in print, according to Rosalie Mcfarlane, the publicity director at Little, Brown U.K., and the book has been on the Sunday Times's best-seller list for the last month. At the same time, the publisher of ""Princess in Love,"" Bloomsbury, has printed well over 100,000 copies since early October and made a number of lucrative foreign deals, including with Penguin USA, before sales here began to fall off drastically. **********And ""Diana: Her New Life,"" which appeared in stores a week after the Dimbleby book with a printing of 100,000, has been on the Sunday Times best-seller list for the last three weeks. Foreign editions are appearing in Germany, France, Holland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, according to the publisher, Michael O'Mara, and in the United States, where it was published last month by Simon & Schuster. **********In part because Mr. Dimbleby's book is authorized, meaning that the author wrote it with the Prince's full cooperation, ""The Prince of Wales"" has stirred an unusual amount of controversy. The book includes details that some reviewers have found horrifyingly personal, including Charles's unhappy experiences in boarding school, documented in a series of miserable letters to his stiff-upper-lip father, and Charles's long-term interest in Camilla Parker-Bowles. **********But David Hooper, the branch manager of Waterstone's bookstore on High Street in Kensington, London, said the book was nonetheless selling ""jolly nicely, thank you,"" even better than the other royal books. Part of the explanation, he said, might be the scholarly nature of the book, which has a fat section of footnotes. **********""It's much more of a solid portrait of a man who a lot of people around here probably have a lot of time and a lot of respect for,"" Mr. Hooper said, ""and it's written by a reputable person. The others are much more melodramatic. As a Christmas gift, this would not be so embarrassing."""

Growth Is Raised To 3.9% for 3d Quarter,G.D.P. Growth Is Raised To 3.9% for 3d Quarter," **********The economy grew faster during the summer than had been previously estimated, pointing to a strong holiday shopping season, fresh Government figures showed today. **********Total output of goods and services expanded at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the third quarter as business investment boomed in the face of progressively higher interest rates. A month ago, the rise in gross domestic product for the July-September period was put at 3.4 percent. **********""This momentum is self-sustaining,"" said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, noting that today's revision showed a bigger contribution from business investment and personal consumption and no longer any contribution from goods moving into inventory. **********A buildup of inventories, which helped drive G.D.P. during the first half of the year, typically represents a borrowing of activity from future periods when factories slow while stocks are pared. **********Inflation associated with the G.D.P. accounts was revised slightly higher -- to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent as gauged by the fixed-weight index of domestic prices -- but neither economists nor the bond market expressed anxiety. **********In its initial tally of corporate profits for the quarter, the Commerce Department said profits from current production had climbed 2 percent, or $10.7 billion. While this was much less than the second-quarter surge of 7.5 percent, the earlier period benefited substantially from a rebound following the California earthquake in January. First-quarter profits slumped 4.8 percent. **********In a separate Government report, a Federal Reserve revision showed American industry operating a bit further below inflation-threat levels than previously thought. Factories, mines and utilities ran at 84.6 percent of capacity during October -- still the highest since April 1989 -- instead of the 84.9 percent reported two weeks ago. A utilization rate above 85 percent or so is considered in the danger area for accelerating inflation. **********As part of scheduled revisions of capacity and production data, the Fed said production was stronger in 1991 and 1992 than previously reported but slower in 1993 and 1994. The Fed also raised capacity growth for 1991, 1992 and 1993. But none of the changes significantly altered prospects for the economy, analysts said. **********Two other reports today, from corporate purchasing managers in two regions of the country, showed rising cost pressures similar to those found recently in other areas but which have yet to be much reflected at the consumer level or in wages. **********Purchasing managers in the Chicago area reported that the prices-paid component of its index had jumped to 79.4 from 72.5, while New York managers said the component there jumped to 77 from 70, nearly twice the average rise in the three preceding months. **********Still, it was the surprisingly large upward revision of G.D.P. that captured most of the attention today. **********For analysts, the 3.9 percent annual rate of expansion confirmed economic strength they had suspected. But the data also implied that vigorous growth would continue, and possibly accelerate, before higher interest rates take their toll on the economy in 1995. **********""The numbers make me feel more confident about our 4 1/2 percent G.D.P. forecast"" for the fourth quarter, said Michelle C. Laughlin, economist at Sanwa Securities in New York. **********The biggest upward revision was in fixed investment other than housing, which soared $11.2 billion, to a 14.4 percent rate of gain instead of the 7 percent initially estimated."

Fo...,7586,,International Herald Tribune,Your Money,,article,A Useful Checklist for an Executive Headed Abroad,A Useful Checklist for an Executive Headed Abroad," **********YOU don't have to be much of an economic historian to know that commerce is becoming increasingly international. To take advantage of the opportunities presented by global and North American economic pacts will require mobility and flexibility. For individual executives, and the companies that employ them, that means more international relocations. And that in turn raises several personal and financial issues that the executive and the company must jointly address. **********What are the key questions that any candidate for expatriation asks himself? What are his concerns and expectations, and, as a consequence, how can his company, if it has already experimented and established a ""mobility policy"" for guiding expatriate executives, respond to them? Or is he faced with an uncertain one- on-one negotiation of his expatriation where the results will create winners and losers and eventual jealousy between other expatriates and between expatriates and locals? **********Setting aside compensation, expatriation calls into question the impact on the executive's family. Recognizing that the great majority of expatriates are married and have children the high failure rate among expatriates is more often than not related to the problems encountered by the executive's family rather than by any failure on the part of the executive to adapt. The company must be available and positive in its approach, providing assistance to the executive and his family under the consistent terms of a written mobility policy. **********A mobility policy, circulated by the company and provided to the executive, is a necessity to a successfully managed program of sending executives overseas. At the same time the policy must distinguish between the various types of assignments, by duration and by objective, and be cost-effective. **********Here are some topics an executive should raise with his company: **********- **********Calculation of the salary to be paid in the home and host country and in what currency? **********- **********Calculation of merit increases? **********- **********Currency exchange-rate guarantee? **********- **********Coverage by tax equalization, tax protection or on your own? **********- **********Which social security system will apply (home or host) and will home retirement or medical benefits or family allowances be lost? **********- **********Hardship in the host location? **********- **********Incentives, premiums or cost of living allowances? **********- **********Housing differential allowance? **********- **********Moving household goods limits? **********- **********Schooling fees and until what age? **********- **********Benefits in kind and perquisites at host location? **********- **********Duration of assignment? **********- **********Guarantee of return to home country and company? **********- **********When become a ""local"" in host country? **********- **********Performance evaluation and impact on long-term career? **********- **********Cultural adaptation and language training for executive and family? **********- **********Relocation assistance in host country? **********- **********Preassignment familiarity trip? **********- **********Assistance for executive's working spouse to find new employment? **********- **********Home leave for the family? **********- **********Vacation on home or host rules? **********- **********Tax compliance and financial planning assistance? **********The first questions raised by the executive will concern the foreign assignment, its terms and the requirements for successful completion. More generally the expatriate will require the terms of his assignment and its impact on his future career. The era of departure abroad ""never to return"" and ""without career progression"" is over. If companies want to remain competitive, they must manage their expatriates' future careers, taking into account the benefits of an assignment in a foreign country in particular with regard to management adaptability. **********Many companies sell an assignment abroad as an advantage to be had over colleagues in the country of origin. This should translate into concrete examples being provided to the executive who will thus accept mobility and go abroad more positive and motivated in his approach, in the knowledge that his progress will be followed during his assignment and that he will be fairly managed. **********The expatriate will then be concerned with his departure, his adapting to the new location and the resulting impact on his family. A presentation on cultural adaptation should be given to the executive and his family - and should be intensive. Cultural training is most effective generally when it is offered in the host country. To the same end a trip to the host country for the employee and his spouse should be offered prior to the final departure and decision. **********There are important questions concerning arrival in the host country and center around the housing of his family and schooling of his children. Increasing numbers of companies are assisting their expatriates in seeking the solution to these concerns and are providing professional relocation assistance including the following: Home finding, school selection, greeting and orientation, spouse and family support, on-line support services. **********Next, the income tax and social security issues are key concerns to both the executive and the company and must be considered in detail. Although some companies talk about borderless regions of countries, such as the European Union, executives crossing borders will quickly see and be concerned by the variation in net income after taxes and social charges and the benefits from the applicable social security system. The chart below shows that for an executive who is married with two children, and before any expatriate planning is applied, his net compensation can vary from a high in Japan, Switzerland and France of 65 percent or more to a low of 54 percent - **********or less in Holland, Sweden or Canada. Planning can improve these percentages for the expatriate. For example, the application of the French headquarters ruling or Belgian coordination center rules as well as treaty provisions. **********The company will also be concerned by the substantial variation in the total cost of the expatriate's salary plus social charges as a percentage of gross salary. From a high in Italy, France and Sweden of 131 percent or more to a low of 103 percent or less in Australia, Canada or the United States. After the addition of all expatriate benefits and the impact of tax equalization, but before any planning, the unmanaged total employer cost can skyrocket. **********These substantial variations for the executive must be considered by the company in its mobility policy in order to equalize the employee and not create disincentives to expatriation - or to repatriation. Furthermore, the company must carefully use international treaties, regional agreements and local rules to reduce the income tax burden and apply either the home or host country's social security law for the maximum advantage of the executive and the company. For example, the chart shows that an expatriate transferring from Britain to France and who will remain on British social security under the European Union's agreements can increase his net income after lower British social charges and lower French income taxes (even after taking into account the deductibility of social charges for determining French income taxes). The company will also pay the lower British social charges. The same example can be seen for several other countries where treaties or regional rules apply. **********Mobility and relocation planning are important in order to increase the current low success rate of companies in sending executives abroad. Success depends upon the company developing a fair and cost-effective mobility policy. **********Jack Anderson is a tax and legal partner of Ernst & Young in Paris.

When negotiations began in March, the company said it planned to move all production offshore, eliminating more than 1,000 jobs. **********The new agreement includes none of the concessions that were in an agreement reached last year in an effort to protect all 1,000 jobs. Among those concessions was an increased workweek of 40 hours from 35 hours. **********But the earlier agreement was ruled invalid in June by Judge Tina L. Brozman of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, because it was reached after Leslie Fay filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. **********A spokesman for the company said a hearing is scheduled for Thursday morning in the bankruptcy court to seek approval of the new agreement. **********A spokesman for the union said the strike against Leslie Fay, under way since June 1, would end ""the moment the judge gives the O.K.""  The terms of the agreement include wage increases totaling 10 percent over the three years of the contract, which would run until May 31, 1997. The agreement also calls for increased payments by the company into a benefits fund that provides health insurance for workers, eliminating a payment of $23 a month by each worker after the fund ran short last year. The agreement also calls for $2.3 million for severance payments. **********The agreement also established a joint labor-management committee, to be led by William J. Usery, Labor Secretary in the Ford Administration, to explore new technology and methods of production so that the company can profitably produce moderately priced dresses in the United States. Mr. Usery mediated the negotiating sessions that lead to the agreement. **********The recommendation of the committee will be binding if the vote is unanimous; if they are not, Mr. Usery's decisions will be binding. **********The agreement requires the company to guarantee 600 jobs at its major plant in Wilkes-Barre for one year, until July 31, 1995. It is then to preserve 600 production jobs in the Wyoming Valley region of Pennsylvania, which includes Wilkes-Barre, for the life of the contract. **********Since the company has several smaller plants in the valley, the agreement appears structured to consolidate production in the Wilkes-Barre plant or a new plant.  Jay Mazur, president of the union, called the pact ""trailblazing."" ""It points the way to joint labor-management to preserve American manufacturing jobs,"" he said. **********John J. Pomerantz, chairman of Leslie Fay, said it would help the company to return to profitability ""so that it can emerge from Chapter 11 as a strong and viable competitor."" **********The tentative agreement was announced after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Leslie Fay shares closed at $2.625, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange."

Albright, the United States Representative to the United Nations, plans to raise the issue of the conspicuous spending on Iraq's palaces as part of the campaign to maintain economic sanctions on Iraq, an issue that has divided the allies. The information was released just before the embargo is to come before the Security Council again. **********Though Iraq has also done much to restore its electrical grid, public services and roads and bridges damaged in the war, the work on the residences for the elite underscores the contrast between rich and poor in Iraq, a nation of 20 million people where robberies are on the rise and even middle-class Iraqis are selling their furniture to make ends meet. **********American officials say the work for the Government elite will triple the number of their residences, which include a Presidential Palace at Lake Tharthar that is more than four times as large as the White House. **********American officials contend that Iraq has failed to meet all the United Nations' demands for lifting economic sanctions that were imposed after the gulf war. Now, pointing to the palaces, the officials say Iraq is crying poverty even as leaders squander money on themselves. **********""The fact that Saddam Hussein is spending hundreds of millions to build palaces and refusing to use the humanitarian program the United Nations has authorized shows the hypocrisy of his claims that he is concerned about his people's suffering,"" an American official said. **********The Central Intelligence Agency estimated the cost at $1 billion, though one American expert said that is, at best, a crude guess. **********The Security Council has authorized Iraq to sell up to $1.6 billion of oil under United Nations supervision, with much of the proceeds going for food and medicine. But Iraq has refused, saying the resolution is an infringement on its sovereignty. **********Critics of the sanctions policy also cite the opulent lifestyle of Iraq's rulers. They say that the palace construction shows that top Iraqi officials are firmly entrenched and have managed to insulate themselves from the effects of the embargo, leaving ordinary Iraqis to suffer. **********In an effort to lift the sanctions, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is to meet on Monday with Mrs. Albright, who is Security Council President this month. He is expected to present a declaration of Iraq's formal recognition of Kuwait. **********France and Russia, which support Iraq's position, want the Security Council to lift the embargo in six months. Iraq owes the Russians billions, which they hope to recoup from Iraqi oil revenues, while France also sees the possibility of lucrative deals with Baghdad. **********But the United States and Britain have been firmly against lifting sanctions, arguing that Iraq has not completely dismantled its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction, and has refused to renounce terrorism or refrain from repression at home. **********Western officials also insist that Iraq has kept property stolen from Kuwait during its occupation. Mrs. Albright plans to tell the Security Council that the United Nations has seen Kuwaiti vehicles and scientific equipment in Iraq, according to James P. Rubin, spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations. **********In addition, American officials note that the Iraqi forces that menaced Kuwait last month were equipped with captured Kuwaiti equipment, including more than 200 Soviet-made armored personnel carriers and a battalion's worth of American-made M-109 artillery pieces. **********As described by American officials, the Presidential complex at Tikrit contains at least 13 palaces and a lake that was created by diverting water from the Tigris river."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/business/interstate-banking-bill-gets-final-approval-in-congress.html,Keith Bradsher,1994-09-14,,1212,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Interstate-Banking Bill Gets Final Approval in Congress,Interstate-Banking Bill Gets Final Approval in Congress," **********The Senate overwhelmingly approved and sent to the President for signing today a bill that would allow banks to operate branches across the nation. **********The interstate banking bill has been the Clinton Administration's top legislative priority in banking this year, and Congressional approval of it represents a victory for the President and for big banks that want to set up branch networks nationwide. The bill would eliminate the remaining barriers to interstate banking in a dozen states and a requirement that banks operate separate subsidiaries in each state. **********Passage, on a 94-to-4 vote, came after the Treasury Department agreed this morning to a procedure for pursuing negligent insiders at failed savings and loan institutions. **********Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, had threatened a filibuster over a controversial provision in the bill that would have effectively limited Federal action against the officers, directors, lawyers and accountants of failed savings and loans. But he dropped his threat after the Office of Thrift Supervision, which is part of the Treasury Department, vowed to undertake what amounted to an end run around the provision. **********The House had already approved the interstate banking bill. The four Democratic Senators who opposed the bill today were David L. Boren of Oklahoma, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin. **********President Clinton welcomed the Senate action. ""Today this country took an historic step -- one that has been delayed for much too long -- to help American banks better meet the needs of our people, our communities and our economy,"" he said. **********The bill will make banking more convenient for Americans who live in one state and work in another. Under current law, for example, a customer of a bank branch in Connecticut typically cannot make a deposit at the same bank's New York branches. The interstate banking bill would eliminate this restriction, along with some of the large and duplicative bureaucracies that banks have established to operate separate subsidiaries in each state. **********Smaller banks initially opposed the interstate banking bill. But their hostility weakened when the bill was drafted so that big banks are virtually required, at least for the next few years, to buy a bank in another state before opening branches there. **********A conference of House and Senate lawmakers inserted the controversial savings and loan provision in late July. It effectively prevents two Federal agencies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, from pursuing most civil cases against the insiders. The House and now the Senate have approved the bill with this provision. Third Agency **********But under the procedure agreed upon today, a third agency not covered by the legislation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, told Congress that it would pursue the cases. The strategy does not require Congressional approval, Federal regulators said, because the agencies' budgets come from fees collected from the institutions they regulate, not money appropriated by Congress. **********The new strategy came under immediate criticism from lawmakers who contend that the F.D.I.C. and R.T.C. have waged a costly vendetta against anybody with any link to the savings and loan collapse, which has cost taxpayers $200 billion. **********""I personally think it's wrong for them to try this end run,"" said Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican who is a senior member of the House Banking Committee. **********Lawyers for the directors and officers of failed savings and loans also reacted angrily today to the plan. They said Congress never intended for the Office of Thrift Supervision to play such a large role. ""I think they lack the authority, and it will be litigated,"" said Ronald R. Glantz, a lawyer here who represents many people facing possible large fines. **********Most of the Federal cases against savings and loan insiders are filed by the F.D.I.C., which regulates state-chartered savings and loan associations, and the R.T.C., which disposes of failed savings and loans. Payment Plan **********Under today's plan, they would pay the thrift office to file some of these cases for them. The thrift office would then transfer back to the F.D.I.C. or the R.T.C. any money that it won in the lawsuits. **********Federal courts have ruled in the last year that state statutes of limitation run out quickly for cases filed by the F.D.I.C. and the R.T.C. But the Office of Thrift Supervision is covered only by Federal statutes of limitation, which run longer. **********A provision added to the interstate banking bill in the House-Senate conference in late July would extend the state statutes of limitation for cases of fraud and willful misconduct at savings and loan institutions, but not for cases involving negligence and gross negligence, the charges in more than four-fifths of all cases. Federal regulators criticized the statute of limitations provision in the interstate banking bill as worse than nothing. **********Jonathan L. Fiechter, the acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, sent a letter today to several senators describing the agency's new plans. While the thrift office has already begun fighting two other cases on behalf of the F.D.I.C., Mr. Fiechter said that it would try to negotiate a memorandum of understanding with the R.T.C. and the F.D.I.C. to pursue such a course more broadly. 'Reversal of Their Fortunes' **********The letter, a remarkable shift that the thrift office had long resisted, came after Mr. Metzenbaum threatened on Friday to filibuster the entire bill because of the savings and loan provision. **********A senior F.D.I.C. official expressed delight at the outcome. ""I think the directors and officers out there will definitely see this as a reversal of their fortunes,"" said the official, who requested anonymity. **********But the thrift office's enthusiasm for pursuing savings and loan wrongdoers remains unclear. The office announced in April that it would begin focusing on regulating the nation's remaining savings and loan institutions and, ""will rely increasingly on the R.T.C. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to seek restitution from wrongdoers associated with failed thrifts turned over to those agencies by O.T.S."" **********Carolyn Lieberman, the acting chief counsel of the thrift office, said in an interview today that the agency had not actually reversed its policy and that any shift today involved ""shades of emphasis."" She also said that while the thrift office could probably pursue R.T.C. and F.D.I.C. cases involving gross negligence, the thrift office's legal standard for pursuing litigation typically called for more wrongdoing than the basic negligence cases filed by the other two agencies. **********The interstate banking bill is formally known as the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, after two lawmakers who are retiring from Congress this year: Senator Donald Riegle, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Stephen L. Neal, the North Carolina Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee's panel on financial institutions. Banking lobbyists, led by officials of Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., have made interstate banking their top priority since the mid-1980's. **********Hugh L. McColl Jr., the chief executive of Nationsbank, sat with President Clinton in Charlotte last spring when the Arkansas Razorbacks won the national collegiate basketball championship."

Business School: A Traveler's Advisory"," **********I ATTENDED the Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1988 to 1990. Within just a few days, I discovered that business school would be a far more turbulent and, as they say in California, awesome experience than I had expected. And so I offer these notes, a record of my first year, as a simple act of decency. Like going back to the last calm bend in the river and nailing up a sign saying, ""Waterfall Ahead.""* Two Americas. My favorite item in the school library was a wall map called ""The Two Americas."" I expected the familiar theme that America was divided between rich and poor. Instead, the map was about purchasing patterns for mayonnaise. Apparently, the nation's North and West buy Miracle Whip, while the South and East go with Hellmann's. **********In business school, you learn to think much differently.* Gunnar's Plans. One evening, I had dinner with Gunnar Haakonsen. Gunnar was 6 feet 1, lean, muscled, handsome, blond. After majoring in economics at Amherst, he spent three years as an analyst at Bear, Stearns. Over beers and tostadas, he asked why I had come to business school. ""Because it's a year shorter than law school,"" I answered, only half jokingly. **********Why had he come? He leaned across the table and fixed me with a steely gaze. ""To position myself for a quantum career leap in financial services,"" he said. **********I knew how villagers must have felt when Viking ships appeared.* Tom Wolfe, Reconsidered. The interviewers from Dillon, Read kept asking if I was sure I wanted to go into investment banking after working in the White House. I was baffled. After all, in""The Bonfire of the Vanities,"" Tom Wolfe calls investment bankers ""masters of the universe."" How could they possibly wonder why I wanted to become one of them? **********I suspect that what took place in that hotel room was a collision of illusions. The Dillon, Read men considered the White House the seat of all earthly glory. I knew better; working at the White House involved a lot of long hours and merely routine toil. **********And I? I believed investment bankers existed on a higher plane of being. But maybe they knew better. Maybe their jobs involved . . . a lot of long hours and merely routine toil.* Romance, Adventure. The usual economic models say entrepreneurs start their ventures just to make money. Professor David Font disagreed. **********""According to Schumpeter,"" Mr. Font said, ""the puny motive of profit maximization barely explains anything about entrepreneurs at all. Just listen to this."" He picked up a dog-eared book, adjusted his glasses and read aloud. **********""There is the will to conquer, the impulse to fight, to prove oneself superior to others, to succeed for the sake, not of the fruits of success, but of success itself. Finally there is the joy of creating, of getting things done, or simply exercising one's energy and ingenuity."" **********Mr. Font set the book down. ""Capitalism,"" he said, ""is not a matter of counting coins. Capitalism is a romance and an adventure."" **********Mr. Font's understanding of business rose above technical disciplines to acknowledge the soul. But his classroom was often a third empty.* Worthy Questions. For all its trials, Stanford heightened my appreciation of the brains and talent and sheer creativity required in business. **********Driving in from the airport on Christmas break, I noticed for the first time that a number of high-tech firms had offices in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington. When I read the paper the next morning, I only skimmed the politics before reading the business section in detail. Then, at a department store one afternoon, I got impatient at the checkout counter. Shoppers all around were backing up and growing angry. **********""Where's the manager?"" I wondered, irritably. ""Doesn't he know he's incurring ill will? Can't he see that hiring more checkout people for the holidays would net him at least $200 an hour?"" **********Business school analyzes such problems. How does a company account for its costs? How does a factory decide how many cars to produce each week? How does an entrepreneur get backing? **********Are these the worthiest questions one can ponder? Clearly not. We're not talking about sin and redemption here. Yet business school can tell you a lot about your workplace, your grocery store or your bank, helping you to understand the economic activities that take up the larger part of your life. This is no small claim."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/05/business/vietnamese-delegation-seeking-american-capital.html,Michael Janofsky,1994-05-05,,1275,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Vietnamese Delegation Seeking American Capital,Vietnamese Delegation Seeking American Capital," **********Like many Vietnamese of his generation, Pham Chanh Truc protested against the American military presence in Vietnam. He was jailed once, escaped and worked eight years in the Vietcong underground before he was caught and jailed again. When Communist forces drove out the South Vietnamese Army in 1975, Saigon became Ho Chi Minh City and Mr. Truc joined its new Government. **********Now, nearly two decades later, as vice chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Truc is leading the first Vietnamese delegation to the United States since the American trade embargo was lifted in February. With an ambitious two-week tour to drum up financial investment for the city, the Vietnamese are, in effect, inviting Americans back to Vietnam. Forgoing Pride for Technology **********""I don't think I wasted my prime years,"" Mr. Truc said in an interview last week as the delegation headed to the headquarters of Pepsico in Somers, N.Y. ""I did the thing I believed in, the right thing, fighting for the independence and sovereignty of Vietnam. So I don't think this is an irony for me, but an advantage. I was able to participate in the first phase of gaining back our country, and I am still here, participating in its construction."" **********If the trip might strike some Americans as audacious, Mr. Truc viewed it through a lens of pragmatism and economics. With so much of Vietnam's essential services and facilities in need of repair, much of it because of ""the American war,"" as many Vietnamese call it, the delegates are turning to a country of proven engineering and technological skills, not to mention wealth. **********Ho Chi Minh City is the economic engine of Vietnam, with 60 percent of the industrial output and 27 percent of the gross national product, according to the city's latest economic reports. Its population last year was about four and a half million, well above the three million-plus of Hanoi, the capital, in the north. **********Yet beyond the city's threshold attempts to seek American financing for new ports, bridges, airfields, telecommunications, natural resource development and roads, the trip to New York and Boston last week, California and Seattle this week, was also planned to help Vietnam establish relationships with American interests at a time when few exist. **********The countries have no normal diplomatic relations, and only a handful of big American companies, including Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Mobil, have substantial operations in Vietnam. **********Further, many American companies are not likely to invest heavily until Vietnam gains most-favored-nation trading status, a designation that would enable it to export its goods to the United States under the lowest tariff rates. **********American experts in United States-Vietnam relations predict that gaining preferential trade status could take two years or more, largely because of lingering concern over American servicemen still listed as missing in action, and the controversy raised in the 1992 campaign over President Clinton's draft avoidance during the Vietnam War. **********With an obvious need for funds, Mr. Truc said, Ho Chi Minh City is willing to be patient. The cover article in last week's issue of The Saigon Times, a Government-subsidized weekly magazine, included a headline that said the country ""urgently needs foreign investment"" to develop adequate electricity supplies. And that is only one area of major need. Playing the America Card **********But the reasons Ho Chi Minh City and the rest of Vietnam appear eager to have Americans back might not be be altogether economic. **********Rather, the experts say that an expanded American presence in Vietnam would serve as a strategic buffer against other nations in the region, particularly China, whose economic might provides great advantages over developing nations like Vietnam. **********Thomas J. Vallely, director of the Vietnam Program at the Harvard Institute for International Development, cited as one hedge against China Hanoi's decision to grant Mobil exploration rights to the Blue Dragon oilfield in the South China Sea. ""A wise decision,"" he said of the grant. **********Two years ago, China signed a contract with another American company, the Crestone Energy Corporation, for rights to explore waters nearby. **********A recent analysis of Vietnam's economic situation by a team of Japanese and American scholars said the country also worried about China's dumping of cheap consumer goods in Vietnam and its building of airstrips on the Spratly Islands, disputed by the Chinese and the Vietnamese. **********""The Vietnam Government is not only anxious, it is almost desperate to have an American presence in the country,"" said Irwin Jay Robinson, president of the Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce in New York. The organization sponsored a business seminar for the visiting delegation last week. **********While the lifting of the American embargo by President Clinton in February was a watershed in the old adversaries' relationship, and the expected precursor to normalized trading, this green light hardly unleashed a heavy flow of business traffic into Ho Chi Minh City. **********One reason is that the Communist Government lifted its clamps on private enterprise in 1986, ushering in waves of investment from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, France and Malaysia. Companies from those areas all have a huge step up on American businesses, especially those that would make products for the domestic market. **********Imagine a land in which Marlboro, made by the Philip Morris Companies, is not among the leading foreign cigarettes. In Vietnam, the best-selling brand is 555, from B.A.T. Industries of Britain. Want More Than Wage Advantage **********More than $3 billion in foreign capital is currently financing about 300 projects in the metropolitan area, Mr. Truc said. **********The vast majority of that is from countries other than the United States. Until American interests can identify specific advantages for investing in Vietnam, there is little reason to expect change. While companies like Caterpillar and Boeing are eager to sell bulldozers and aircraft to satisfy Vietnam's development needs, far more American companies need more favorable trading conditions to tap the obvious benefits of skilled but cheap labor. **********""We're in a never-never land kind of relationship,"" said Virginia Foote, president of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in Washington. ""American companies are allowed to sell and invest in Vietnam, but they have no real opportunity to buy.

Rwanda Rights Effort Is Hurt by Understaffing," **********The United Nations efforts to monitor human rights in Rwanda and to bring to justice those suspected of taking part in massacres are understaffed and ill-equipped, officials said today. **********Only 3 of a planned 20 monitors have arrived in Rwanda and they do not have communication equipment or vehicles to allow them to move around the country. **********A minimum of 70 monitors but preferably 140 are needed, the United Nations special envoy to Rwanda, Shahyar Khan, said here today. The special representative of the newly established United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Rene Degni-Segui, has said 150 to 200 observers are necessary. **********""We are very anxious to have more visibility"" for the monitors, Mr. Khan said. ""Their very presence is a deterrence"" to killings. 3 Judges Arriving **********Three African judges who have been appointed to take testimony on the massacres are to arrive in Rwanda on Saturday but there are no plans to provide the support staff the judges say they need to do their job. **********The judges asked Western donors today for a team of 100 lawyers and 100 forensic specialists ""as quickly as possible,"" but it was not clear when or from where the help would come, said one of the judges, Amega Atsu-Koffi, the former president of the Supreme Court of Togo. The evidence collected by the judges and their staff is to be presented to an international tribunal on Rwanda, which has been called by the special representative of the rights commissioner but has not yet been approved by the United Nations Security Council. **********The United States has backed the formation of an international tribunal on crimes of genocide in Rwanda. **********The presence of credible human rights monitors is considered essential to help persuade the more than one million Rwandan refugees still in Zaire and Tanzania that it is safe to return home. Most of the refugees are Hutu, and some are suspected of having taken part in massacres in which an estimated 500,000 people, chiefly Tutsi, were killed. It is not only those guilty of taking part in the killings who fear revenge from the new Tutsi-dominated Government, but also the innocent. Reports of More Violence **********The longer the refugees stay in the camps, where members of the old Government are successfully waging an alarmist campaign against returning to Rwanda, the more difficult it will be to break up the camps, refugee experts say. **********There have been reports of increased violence in the camps against refugees who do attempt to return home. Five refugees were taken hostage by militant Hutu at the Goma refugee camp in Zaire today when they tried to head back to Rwanda, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. **********An American diplomat who has been involved in urging the new United Nations Commission for Human Rights in Geneva to act quickly on getting monitors into Rwanda said there had ""not been an adequate response yet."" Some Retribution Admitted **********Mr. Khan said today that the new Government of the Rwandan Patriotic Front acknowledged some of their troops had committed retribution killings but that he believed these were ""not a general pattern."" **********""It is not a terror campaign but there have been occasions of retributional killings,"" Mr. Khan said. The front has told the United Nations that it has detained 60 soldiers suspected of having taken part in the killings. **********Mr. Khan said the three African judges on the rights panel, who are expected to spend six days collecting evidence and listening to witnesses, were also critical to the process of getting the country back on its feet. He said the new Government had asked that the judges complete their report in two months instead of the four months mandated by the Security Council."

""A change of government is closer now than at any time since 1982,"" he said. **********But his low-key campaign highlighted few domestic or foreign policy differences with Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats. Both parties called for tight controls on government spending to cut the swollen deficits caused by unification, but offered few specifics on how to find jobs for Germany's 3.5 million unemployed. **********The only real issue was whether voters wanted things to continue as they were under Mr. Kohl. But the answer depends on whether they also give the Free Democrats at least the 5 percent of the vote they need to get into Parliament. **********In campaign appearances, Mr. Kohl insisted that many of his supporters would vote split tickets, as they often have in the past. But that was during the cold war, when the Foreign Minister was Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a Free Democrat who stood for the policy of balancing between east and west that brought German unification in 1990. **********Mr. Genscher helped the party win 11 percent of the votes then, but he resigned in 1992, and many Germans no longer see a clear reason to vote for the Free Democrats. **********For many Germans in both east and west, the 64-year-old Chancellor is the incarnation of self-satisfied West German prosperity, and he has struggled to counter the impression that he is unconcerned about the economic hardships in eastern Germany, which include an unemployment rate in the former Communist sector of nearly 14 percent. **********The former Communists, now called the Party of Democratic Socialism, are expected to win less than 5 percent of the vote nationwide. But under the complex German election rules, they could receive as many as 30 seats in Parliament by winning a plurality in at least three districts in the east where they retain their strength. **********But all parties agree that this election will be decided not in the east but the west, where the overwhelming majority of the voters are. **********""There will be no new government that depends in any way, shape or fashion on the Party of Democratic Socialism,"" Mr. Scharping said. **********But the Social Democratic leader refused to discuss whether he would serve under Mr. Kohl in a coalition government uniting both Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. **********Mr. Kohl has also poured cold water on the idea, saying that a coalition of the two biggest centrist parties could lead to a surge in both right-wing and left-wing extremism. The last so-called grand coalition, from 1966 to 1969, produced a left-wing protest movement that spawned urban guerrilla terrorist groups in the 1970's."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/15/business/economic-watch-big-trade-deficit-with-japan-some-think-it-s-no-problem.html,Peter Passell,1994-02-15,,1136,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Economic Watch; Big Trade Deficit With Japan: Some Think It's No Problem,Economic Watch; Big Trade Deficit With Japan: Some Think It's No Problem," **********""America's trade deficit with Japan is not very popular with the American people or the American Government,"" President Clinton allowed at the news conference with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan in which the two agreed to disagree over trade. ""It's hard to explain it, year in year out, always getting bigger,"" he added. **********Most economists would undoubtedly agree with Mr. Clinton that mega-deficits are not popular, nor easy to explain to the great majority of Americans who prefer their economics lessons in easy-to-swallow gel caps. But it is equally safe to say that few economists think the chronic trade deficit with Japan is a problem in itself worth much of a fuss -- or, for that matter, an economic problem at all.  Individual Complaints **********This does not necessarily mean that individual American exporters don't have a legitimate gripe with the Japanese: Motorola may encounter a lot of static when it tries to sell mobile phones in Tokyo, and Chrysler may hit a brick wall when the company tries to sign up dealers for its nifty little Neon runabout. But there is no reason to believe that free trade nirvana -- an entirely open world trading system -- would balance the Japanese-American account or even change it measurably. **********""The Japanese may be giving American exporters a hard time, but the bilateral deficit is not evidence of it,"" said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********By the same token, economists generally reject the idea that America's chronic trade deficit with the world (or Japan's chronic surplus) is linked to anyone's trade policy. ""America runs a deficit because Americans spend more than they produce at home,"" said Gary Saxonhouse, a University of Michigan specialist in the Japanese economy. ""We make up the difference in imports"" -- or at least we do as long as foreigners are willing to finance the transactions. **********The day may even come, Mr. Saxonhouse suggested, when America will regret demands that the Japanese spend more on themselves and lend less abroad to accommodate capital-scarce economies. ""It would be better to build bridges in Tadjikistan that are badly needed than more back home in overbuilt Tohoku Province,"" he argued. **********Start with the relatively easy part, the logic behind mainstream economists' near indifference to country-to-country deficits. ""I have a chronic deficit with my barber, who doesn't buy a darned thing from me,"" said Mr. Solow, who still manages to get by selling his expertise to a university -- which sells him nothing in return. The economist is satisfied as long as he earns enough to pay his bills and save for a rainy day; to try to balance his accounts one by one with the butcher, baker and laptop computer maker would be nothing short of absurd. **********Mr. Saxonhouse notes that Japan has virtually no energy or other natural resources of its own; much of its economy is devoted to manufacturing. Hence if, by accident or design, Japan were to buy exactly as much abroad as it sold each year, the island would almost certainly run surpluses with most countries (including America) that were not in the business of exporting oil. **********Of course, Japan does not balance its trade with the rest of the world. It exports roughly a third more than it imports, making up the difference with loans to foreigners or direct foreign investment in factories, office buildings and the like. Wouldn't the trade surplus of Japan with America, along with its political problems, be smaller if Tokyo did what was necessary to pare its surplus with the world? **********The answer is almost certainly yes. In 1989 and 1990, strong years for Japan's economy and weak ones for America's, the surplus of Japan with America fell roughly in proportion to the decline in its overall surplus. **********That is why James Tobin, an economist at Yale University and another Nobel laureate in economics, argues that ""the best thing Japan could do for us is to stimulate their economy,"" thereby sucking in more imports and giving Japan's traditionally export-minded manufacturers incentives to redirect their efforts toward the now-moribund home market. A Diplomatic Deception **********This point has not been lost on the White House. Indeed, the sophisticated economists working for President Clinton quietly insist that they are engaged in a form of diplomatic sleight of hand, blustering about unfair Japanese trade practices so that Tokyo will be frightened into doing what many Japanese after all would want them to do anyway: spend more at home. **********There's an immediate problem with this ostensible strategy, however: It has not worked. Japan's credit and monetary policy is already so loose that further loosening is apparently nearly pointless. What is more, the Ministry of Finance is deeply opposed to using deficit spending to increase domestic demand, and it has powerful political allies whose allegiances cut across the current reigning coalition and the out-of-office Liberal Democratic Party. **********Thus when Prime Minister Hosokawa proposed a big three-year tax cut on the eve of his trip to Washington, he was forced to settle for a one-year reduction unlikely to bring Japan out of recession or bring down the trade deficit very much. **********Badgering Tokyo to get its economy cooking may still work when the Japanese stop cheering Mr. Hosokawa for standing up to Uncle Sam and start remembering that fiscal stimulus is as much in Japan's interests as America's. But those who think that a reduction in America's deficit with Japan will make a significant difference in America's overall deficit with the world are probably mistaken, Mr. Tobin said.  Effect on U.S. Deficit Slight **********America's external deficit, remember, is the difference between what America produces and what it spends. Thus while a boom in Japanese demand may increase American exports, the change would be reflected in America's total deficit only if American output went up more than American domestic spending -- a possible but not especially likely occurrence. **********There is another reason why keeping up the pressure on the Japanese to spend more like Americans could prove problematic, Mr. Solow said. It is one thing to encourage Japan to avoid recessions; it is quite another to accelerate the maturing economy's drift toward higher consumption and lower savings. For if Japan does not produce the flood of goods and good credit terms needed to finance the development of poor countries along with the renaissance of the former Soviet bloc, who will? Apparently not America, which itself has been feeding at Japan's credit trough. **********In the final reckoning, Mr. Solow said, Japan's external deficit ""is nobody else's business."" **********""All we can legitimately ask,"" he said, ""is that they play fair on trade."""

Some Clinton Administration officials have been hoping that Japan's bureaucrats could be made to budge in the deadlocked trade talks by appealing to Japanese politicians. Part of a Campaign **********While Mr. Hosokawa's views have been stated previously, the release of the letter is part of a campaign by Japan to resist trade targets as the Feb. 11 deadline approaches for reaching several agreements under the new negotiating framework signed by the United States and Japan last July. **********Just today, an advisory committee to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry issued a report saying that targets were undesirable and that market share of foreign products was not an indication of whether a nation's markets were open or closed. **********And in a related matter, Japan's Government today resisted requests from the United States to take strong new steps to increase sales of foreign semiconductors in Japan. **********The American request and Japanese demurral came during an emergency meeting here today that had been called by the Clinton Administration, which is concerned that the foreign share of Japan's computer chip market has dropped below the 20 percent goal of a semiconductor trade agreement between the two nations. Loves the Letter **********Last September, about 40 economists and Japan experts, mainly from the United States, signed an open letter to President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa, saying that ""U.S. demands for managed trade are misguided."" Japan's Government loves this letter. **********In his written reply to three of the scholars -- Jagdish Bhagwati and Hugh Patrick of Columbia University and Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan -- Mr. Hosokawa said Japan would take ""voluntary steps"" to increase imports in an effort to achieve a ""highly significant"" reduction in Japan's current account surplus, as called for in the framework agreement reached between Mr. Hosokawa's predecessor and President Clinton. **********But he said Japan ""as a matter of principle, has sedulously avoided any approach of setting numerical targets, since such an approach could not fail to lead to excessive government intervention in the market and to managed trade."" **********Regarding semiconductors, an American trade official said after today's meeting that he was ""disappointed"" that Japan seemed to show a ""lack of appreciation of the seriousness of U.S. concern on this issue."" Officials in Washington will now discuss what to do next. **********In the 1991 semiconductor agreement, Japan recognized the expectation of the American side that foreign companies could gain 20 percent of Japan's semiconductor market by the end of 1992. The agreement also calls for a ""steady and gradual improvement in market access"" after 1992. No Crisis, Japan Says **********While foreign share inched above 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992, just in time to meet the deadline, it has fallen steadily since then and reached 18.1 percent in the third quarter of 1993 using the American calculation method, and 19.7 percent using the Japanese method. **********Japan does not see the situation as a crisis requiring emergency measures, a Japanese trade official said. Sales of foreign chips actually rose in the 1993 third quarter. The reason market share declined was that the size of the market grew even faster, with most of the growth being for the types of chips that Japanese companies specialize in. **********The semiconductor agreement has become a key reference point for the current framework talks. The American side uses it as evidence that setting targets is effective. Japan uses it as an example of how the United States takes even a vague goal -- the chip agreement clearly states that 20 percent foreign share is not a ""guarantee"" -- and treats it as a commitment by Japan. **********The Japanese official said the revival of controversy over the semiconductor issue could harden Japan's resolve against numerical indicators in the framework talks. ""This is the kind of thing that could happen in the future in the framework if we are not careful,"" he said."

The first steps in the economic program will involve the laying of sewers and construction of waste-disposal facilities in Gaza and Jericho. **********Other projects -- for improving housing, roads, health centers, telecommunications and water -- will follow as soon as the engineering studies are completed. **********""If the peace process has any hope of success, the Palestinians need to see improvements in their living conditions very quickly,"" said Caio Koch-Weser, the World Bank vice president for the Mideast and North Africa. **********""The program and the funds behind it,"" he said, ""are for the immediate needs of the Palestinians and will help create a new physical and social infrastructure, provided political stability can be maintained. But unless there is a visible improvement in social and economic conditions, in an equitable way, the very foundations of peace will be undermined."" **********The World Bank plan, released today, details how to spend half of the $2.4 billion over the next three years, and the rest later. The plan will be carried out by the P.L.O.'s Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, based in Jericho, in cooperation with the World Bank, Israel and the donor nations. **********World Bank officials caution that poverty will not be eliminated in Gaza and Jericho in one year, where the per-capita income is $1,275. But they have to start somewhere. **********While these officials would not say so, the plan provides both a blueprint for Palestinian economic development and a straitjacket intended to prevent corruption or the creation of show projects that are not economically viable. **********The P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, would have preferred a looser arrangement, under which the P.L.O. received money directly from donors to spend as it saw fit, and would have allowed Palestinian ministries to make deals with individual nations for projects. But such an approach can invite payoffs, kickbacks and the sort of uncontrolled development that has plagued other Mideast nations. **********This plan stipulates that any contracts financed or co-financed by the World Bank must be put up for competitive bidding, and there are tight rules for maintaining accountability. Meat and Muscle **********The connection between these projects and the Palestinian-Israeli economic agreement signed in Paris on Friday is this: the Paris accord basically established the rules in which the new Palestinian economy would operate -- what taxes can be collected, how many banks can open, what tariffs can be charged, from where oil is to be imported, and generally how the Palestinian administration will relate to Israel's economy. That was the skeleton for the Palestinian economy, and the World Bank program is the meat and muscle the Palestinians and the donor countries hope to put on that skeleton. **********In its first three years, the Emergency Assistance Program for the Occupied Territories, as it is formally called, is made up of these elements: ***********A total of $600 million will initially be spent on public investment in housing, transportation, sanitation, health, education, telecommunications, roads, electricity, agriculture and water projects. The West Bank will receive $366 million, and Gaza will get $234 million. ***********A total of $225 million will be spent on start-up costs for the central government, police force and other public institutions in Gaza and Jericho, as well as support for non-governmental relief organizations working there. The Palestinians plan to create a central administration to take over functions of daily life now performed by the Israeli civil administration. They will need money to establish their own bureau of statistics, budget office and data collection. ***********A total of $300 million will be spent to stimulate private investment in telecommunications, housing, agriculture and industry. This will involve financing to local credit institutions, developing a central Palestinian bank-supervisory agency and developing a uniform legal and regulatory framework to assure investors that property rights and contracts will be respected and enforced. ***********About $75 million will go for technical advice, ranging from helping Palestinians devise certain political institutions to undertaking feasibility studies and project preparation for further economic development. **********The underlying objective of all the projects is to stimulate job growth. A report issued today by the International Labor Organization said that at least a quarter of the labor force in the occupied territories is already out of work, and joblessness exceeds 40 percent in Gaza alone. **********World Bank experts hope that the Palestinians will avoid some of the mistakes that Arab governments have made in economic development. Economists say the Palestinians have one advantage of being economically underdeveloped: They can start from scratch in many areas. The hope is that they can be induced to follow the model of the East Asian economies, with their emphasis on private investment, personal saving and education, rather than that of Syria, Jordan and Egypt, with their legacies of socialism, government intervention and dependence on aid. **********This plan is intended to help foster a Palestinian economy in which the balance between public and private investment will be clearly tilted toward the private sector as the engine of economic growth, as is the case in East Asia. The plan assumes an economy with an open trading system and a non-protectionist approach to industrial development."

Jones, president and creative director at Caroline Jones Advertising in New York, who is among a handful of black female agency executives. **********""Most people cannot name an advertising agency,"" she added, ""and that aggravates a lack of exposure of the industry to young people."" **********Tina Scott, a junior at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has worked at Martin for almost two years under a minority internship program called Inroads, offered other reasons. **********""Historically, advertising has always been such a good old boy, male-dominated business,"" said Ms. Scott, who is 20. **********""It puzzles me and it upsets me,"" she added. ""To some extent, I feel I'm pushing against the tide."" **********A more recent reality exacerbating the problem has been the industry's severe recession, which began in 1989 and has forced the dismissals of thousands of employees and the closing of many agencies. **********""With so many people out on the street,"" Mike Hughes, vice chairman and creative director at Martin, said, ""it's hard to look people in the eye and say, 'We need to make this industry attractive to another 12 or 13 percent of the population.' "" **********Mr. Drake of the Four A's said that as a result, with opportunities limited in advertising, ""some of the very best and the very brightest"" members of minority groups ""have gone to work for client companies, the media and minority-owned agencies."" **********Still, the industry has been expanding programs intended to diversify its work force. Jay Chiat, chairman and chief executive at Chiat/Day Inc. in Venice, Calif., has been instrumental in developing and financing a Minority Advertising Training program in metropolitan Los Angeles. The Four A's sponsors a program called the Minority Advertising Intern Program, under which 40 to 50 college and graduate students spend their summers working at shops across the country. **********Ms. Scott, for one, is undaunted by the industry's dismal track record. **********Asked if she plans to go into advertising after graduating, she replied, ""Definitely."" **********""Working hard is something I've always done,"" she said. **********If Ms. Scott and other young people like her are unsuccessful in entering advertising, Mr. Muse has a warning that will likely strike fear in an essentially entrepreneurial industry. **********""If we don't do something about this ourselves,"" he said, ""the Government will come in and fix it."" **********""I'll find myself testifying against the agency business,"" he added. ""I don't want to, but if it has to happen, so be it."""

""I deeply regret it. I think it's a pity but I don't know if it could have been avoided."" **********At issue is the insistence of the Vatican and its few remaining allies that the final conference action plan should contain no language at all suggesting a universal right to abortion or implying that abortion has any role in the care of women, family planning or the politics of population. Abortion Language Diluted **********So far, the Vatican-led campaign has resulted in diluting language on abortion. Even so, when the conference ends next Tuesday, the Vatican is not expected to endorse the final document. **********""I don't think they'll join the consensus,"" said Nafis Sadik, the secretary general of the conference. ""The African countries are complaining to me bitterly that we have spent days on one paragraph when they wanted to discuss broad population policy and issues like how aid will be channeled to them."" **********At the start of the conference, the Vatican drew support in its opposition to abortion from Islamic countries as well as Latin American nations. After the concerns of the Islamic countries were met by revisions in the text of the draft document, the Vatican relied on Latin American and Maltese support to force a further delay on confronting the abortion issue until Friday, when a separate drafting committee is to produce a final version of the section on abortion. **********A new version of that section -- Chapter 8, paragraph 25 -- today reduced Latin American opposition. The new wording, like the previous version, begins by saying, ""In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning."" New Wording Adopted **********Moreover, it adds a World Health Organization definition of the term ""unsafe abortion,"" apparently to meet the Vatican's objection that no abortion can be ""safe"" for the fetus. **********The definition says in a footnote: ""Unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards or both."" **********Additionally, the new language deletes the phrase ""circumstances in which abortion is legal"" to ""circumstances in which abortion is not against the law."" Vatican Support Wains **********""It seems to take care of the anxieties of some delegations,"" Mr. Biegman said. Delegates reported that now only Honduras, along with Malta, remained firmly committed to the Vatican line. Other reports suggested that El Salvador, an important ally of the Vatican, may be wavering. **********The details of the lineup are expected to emerge on Friday when the so-called ""main committee"" of the conference reconvenes to force delegations to either join a consensus or register reservations on paragraph 25 of Chapter 8. Even then, a whole series of sections in Chapter 7 relating to ""reproductive health care"" and ""reproductive rights"" will almost certainly run into Vatican contentions that they advocate an international right to abortion. **********While this debate continues, however, other committees at the conference are debating other issues and one of them relates to how the whole population control project under discussion in Cairo will be financed. **********""If this conference is to make a difference, it must stimulate resources,"" said Joseph Speidel, President of Population Action International, a private, nonprofit research and advocacy organization based in Washington. ""A willingness to back rhetoric with hard cash will be the real test of commitment to the goals of this conference."" Spending Levels Agreed **********Timothy E. Wirth, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs and head of the United States delegation at the conference, said the negotiations on the levels of spending by both rich and poor countries to carry out the conference program was ""99 percent complete."" **********Delegates said donor nations had agreed to raise their share of the $17 billion to about a third of the total, leaving the remainder to developing countries. Currently, developing countries pay about four-fifths of the $5 billion spent around the world each year on population programs. **********Mr. Wirth said the United States commitment to aid programs for population, approved recently by Congress, was $585 million dollars for the fiscal year 1995, double the 1992 amount. **********Mr. Speidel said, however, that the United States would need to increase its commitment to $1.9 billion a year by 2000 and Japan should increase its contribution to $1.2 billion."

""For a disease as common as this one, we would have considered anything above 20 percent to be a success. But what we have been seeing is protection in the range of 30 to 60 percent."" **********Test results on 600 people vaccinated this year in Gambia are expected to be known by November, Dr. Greenwood said. **********While diseases like polio, yellow fever and leprosy, which gave coastal West Africa a reputation as a ""white man's grave"" in the colonial era, have given way to advances in science, malaria has proven stubbornly resistant. **********Health experts estimate that as many as 300 million people are infected with the plasmodium parasite, the organism that causes the disease. More than two million die from malaria each year, they say, 90 percent of them in tropical Africa. **********Dr. Greenwood, who leads the Gambian laboratories of the Medical Research Council, a British research agency, shares Dr. Patarroyo's enthusiasm. But his long clinical experience in West Africa, in which he has seen one technique after another bested by the disease, have also made him cautious. **********""Our first efforts were in chemoprophylaxis, and the results were good, except that administering drugs on a wide scale proved both unpopular and costly,"" Dr. Greenwood said of efforts to control malaria through the distribution of medicines. ""Eventually, the issue became moot, because of the problem of resistance,"" he noted. **********With a speed that has startled pharmacologists, the malarial variety responsible for most deaths, Plasmodium falciparum, has in the last decade developed a resistance to drugs used to treat the disease faster than new medicines can be produced. In some cases doctors have resorted to high doses of the oldest known treatment, quinine, which has serious side effects, to break the high fevers and hemorrhaging of red blood cells brought on by acute attacks of the disease. **********Frustrated by setbacks with drug treatments, Dr. Greenwood's center helped pioneer a simpler preventive approach encouraging the use of chemically treated mosquito nets to shield sleeping villagers from attack by the insects. If the tests in Gambia are successful, it is estimated that the three doses required for what is expected to be lifetime immunity could be produced for less than 30 cents for adults and less than half that cost for children. **********Even if the first generation of the vaccine provides protection for only 50 percent of those who receive it, the therapy could have a dramatic impact on public health in countries where the disease is endemic"

Competing Bid for Garden **********At this stage, the Liberty Media Corporation, the programming arm of Tele-Communications Inc., and a partnership of the ITT Corporation and Cablevision Systems Corporation appear to be competing for the Garden. **********Yesterday John Labatt Ltd., Canada's second-largest brewer and the owner of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, said it did not submit a bid for the properties. **********Last week Labatt said it was discussing a joint bid with a number of potential partners, including Liberty Media. **********Labatt's announcement followed last week's decision by Nike Inc. to drop out of the competition. Nike had also been rumored to be talking with Liberty Media about a potential bid. **********Viacom acquired the Madison Square Garden properties in its $9.7 billion purchase of Paramount Communications Inc. **********Viacom has said it intends to use proceeds from the sale of the Garden to reduce the debt it took on when it bought Paramount. **********Estimates about how much the winning bid for the Garden will be go as high $1 billion. But most Wall Street analysts say the property is worth much less, between $600 million and $750 million. **********Separately, Viacom said its second-quarter earnings surged more than fourfold, pushed up by its acquisition of Paramount Communications Inc. and a gain from selling its stake in the Lifetime cable television network. **********Net income rose to $221.7 million, or $1.44 a share, from $41.6 million a year earlier, or 35 cents. Revenues jumped to $1.7 billion from $496 million. **********The company said its 1994 second-quarter and first-half results reflected its 50.2 percent ownership of Paramount Communications Inc. by Viacom, effective March 1, 1994, and were not comparable to previous periods.   The latest quarter includes a $267 million pretax gain from the sale of Viacom's one-third interest in Lifetime to the Hearst Corporation and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. **********Among its operations that predate the Paramount takeover, Viacom pointed to the strength in its MTV Networks, which saw its operating earnings rise 20 percent in the second quarter. **********Wall Street showed little reaction to Viacom's earnings.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/23/business/export-fall-broadens-trade-gap.html,,1994-03-23,,865,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Export Fall Broadens Trade Gap,Export Fall Broadens Trade Gap," **********A record plunge in exports vastly widened the nation's overall trade deficit in January even as the imbalance with Japan narrowed, Government figures showed today. **********For the first time, the monthly tabulation counts services, an area that includes such things as tourism in which the United States has traditionally racked up surpluses that have significantly offset deficits in goods. **********The inclusion of services did little to limit the enlargement of the deficit.  Services, a steadier component than goods, according to monthly figures provided for the last two years, produced a $4.7 billion surplus in January, compared with $4.6 billion in December. **********For January, combined imports of goods and services exceeded exports by $6.3 billion, up from $4.1 billion in December when computed on the same basis and adjusted for normal seasonal variation. Weather Blamed **********While the enlargement was substantial -- and greater than generally expected -- analysts said that they were not alarmed because the trade figures, which are notoriously erratic, had also been affected by bad weather in various parts of the country, which held down both production and the transportation of goods to export markets. **********""These numbers are volatile,"" Michael P. Niemira, a specialist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, cautioned. ""I wouldn't read too much into the size of the decline in exports."" **********He and others noted that shipments of commercial aircraft alone tumbled by $462 million after a December surge, an almost inevitable sort of correction in a category of high-priced items where deliveries tend to be made in bunches. **********Analysts said they could not tell how much of the export drop reflected bad weather, statistical aberration or continued languishing of the economies of American trading partners. **********But they were heartened by separate, more recent indicators pointing to continued robust growth in the economy and the fact that exported goods ran nearly 2 percent higher in December and January combined than they had in October and November. **********""The worsening may be more statistical than real,"" said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official who is now chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. **********Imports, meanwhile, eased $600 million, the Commerce Department's report showed. Half this reduction was in crude oil, reflecting both lesser volumes and lower prices. **********Over all, a deficit in goods totaling $11 billion was partly offset by a surplus in services of $4.7 billion. For services alone, previously published only on a quarterly basis, exports were $15.7 billion and imports were $11 billion. **********Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown observed that $2 billion of the services surplus came from tourism, transportation and related activity; $1.3 billion was in royalties and fees from such intellectual property as trademarks and patents, and $1.7 billion came from finance, engineering, design, legal, accounting and similar work. **********Such earnings, he said, ""belie any image of the service sector as a low-productivity source of low-wage jobs."" Ploy Assertion Denied **********At a briefing, department officials brushed off suggestions that the inclusion of services was a ploy to minimize the size of the monthly reported trade deficit. They said the process had been under way for 18 months and that the change was endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences as well as by service industries and the nation's trade negotiators. **********Private economists generally concurred, backing the idea as sound -- though not as revealing as they might have hoped -- even if given some political impetus. **********One feature they would like is a breakdown of services by country or other geographic area, which statisticians say is not yet feasible. Nor are services presented in constant dollars to adjust for price changes. **********Today's report showed that the nation's goods deficit with Japan narrowed to $4.6 billion in January from $5.3 billion in December, with no adjustment for recurring seasonal factors. This was the smallest deficit since June. **********The United States, which ran a $59.3 billion deficit with Japan last year, is waiting to hear what Japan proposes to revive negotiations about American demands for specific goals to gauge pledges of increased access to Japanese markets. Those talks collapsed in February. Other Changes Made **********In addition to adding services, the new presentation shifts the emphasis for import and export values to a balance-of-payments basis. This produces somewhat higher levels than the previously featured set of figures, which relied on Customs Service documentation of physical movements across national boundaries. Goods can change ownership without being moved. **********If no accounting change had been made, January would have shown a deficit in merchandise trade of $9.8 billion, up from a $7.4 billion deficit in December that had been the smallest in a year. **********While services figure importantly in American trade -- the surplus rising steadily since 1986 -- the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company found little evidence of an American ""structural advantage"" in this area. **********""Trends in overall services trade mirror trends in goods trade,"" it stated. ""There is no noticeable trend toward a greater U.S. concentration of earnings from services."""

A tropical forest that has been clear-cut is lost for all economic purposes. **********Operating a rain forest for profit on a sustained yield basis is a serendipitous opportunity to maintain a critical part of the planet's ecosystem while simultaneously achieving higher returns with less risk than investing in United States timberlands.

In the Lipper Analytical Services' survey of closed-end investment funds, the best performers through August were the Brazilian Equity Fund and the Brazil Fund, each up nearly 60 percent for the year. Now that the monthly inflation rate has dropped from more than 50 percent in June to about 5 percent, Brazil is even more enticing. **********But money managers treat the country, the largest in Latin America and home to an economy the size of Russia's, like a beautifully wrapped present that on close inspection ticks ominously. Until the presidential elections are locked up in November and the leading candidate's currency stabilization program advances, caution is the byword, they say. **********""Brazil is not for beginners,"" said Eduardo de Faria, the fund manager for the Brazilian Investment Company, in London. **********If the country's program to stabilize the currency continues to work, research coverage of the more than 600 stocks on the Sao Paulo exchange will improve markedly and investor interest will probably soar. Institutions, wealthy investors and eventually individual investors of more modest means could profit as Brazil makes a long-anticipated conversion from an emerging market to a developed one. **********A recent political imbroglio underscored just why professional investors remain wary. Brazil's economy minister, Rubens Ricupero, said that he had helped distort inflation figures to bolster the campaign of the pro-business presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Mr. Ricupero, chagrined to discover that his casual remarks had been broadcast through an open microphone, abruptly resigned. **********Maria Elena Carrion, head of the Latin American equity team for the Bankers Trust Company in New York, said, ""It just shows how something can come out of left field in Brazil."" In June, she cut Brazilian exposure in the $200 million Latin American portfolio she manages to 20 percent from 30 percent. **********Although lower inflation -- prompted by the July 1 exchange of the old hyperinflated cruzeiros for a new currency, the real -- is key to Brazil's future, the minister's statement and resignation roiled the Brazilian stock market only briefly and have done little to hurt Mr. Cardoso's presidential campaign. Most commentators have dismissed the minister's remarks, noting that inflation figures are compiled by independent agencies. **********The market's volatility is another problem. Mr. de Faria, who manages $100 million, said: ""How's this for volatile? January to February, up 63.1 percent; February to May, down 44 percent; and May to August, up 106 percent. "" **********And for investors with long memories, the promise of Brazil is a case of deja vu all over again. John R. Hickling, portfolio manager of the $2.2 billion Fidelity Overseas Fund, has only 1 percent of his assets, or just $22 million, invested in Brazil. ""My father grew up in Argentina,"" Mr. Hickling said. ""People in Argentina say Brazil is the country of the future, and it will always be the country of the future."" **********For speculators and brave spirits, there are few opportunities to invest directly in Brazil. The only Brazilian stock easily acquired is Aracruz Celulose S.A., a paper processing company based in Rio de Janeiro, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depository receipts. The A.D.R.'s, which represent shares of the foreign company, have risen 57 percent this year to $13.875 yesterday, up 75 cents. **********A few diversified Brazilian funds are easily accessible. The Brazilian Equity Fund, based in New York, returned 58.7 percent in the first eight months of the year, making it the leading closed-end fund, according to Lipper. The Brazil Fund, also based in New York, came in a close second, at 58.2 percent. Shares of both are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Although handsome, these companies' returns did not beat out the gain in the Bovespa stock index. So why don't money managers set up an 83-stock index fund that mirrors the Bovespa? Because more than 40 percent of the index reflects one stock, Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras S.A., or Telebras, the national telephone company. For better or worse, fund managers are paid to set up diversified stock portfolios for the long term. **********The obvious choice for Americans are funds that invest throughout Latin America or even in emerging markets around the world. Most money managers follow a simple strategy in Brazil: buy blue-chips or economically sensitive stocks. Managers are buying Petroleo Brasileiro, a large oil company; Banco Itau, a big bank; and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, a mining and steel company. **********Even skeptics say Brazil's economic picture may be clearer in just six months. Mr. Hickling, of the Fidelity fund, said, ""If you could approach Brazil like a developed market, you could stock-pick your way through the country."""

Gen. Raoul Cedras and two other leaders of the junta to resign, according to Haitian officials and foreign diplomats here. **********The effort has run into difficulties, however, in part because of differences within the military as to who should succeed General Cedras as commander in chief. **********Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff, reportedly wants the job for himself, and has General Cedras's support. Lieut. Col. Michel Francois, the police commander and another of the three junta leaders whose resignation is being sought, is said to favor Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval, a man the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, once indicated is also his choice. **********""On the succession question, the army is very much divided,"" Senator Bernard Sansaricq, a supporter of the military leadership said this morning. ""General Cedras would definitely like to put Biamby in a position to succeed him, whereas normally under the chain of command the job would go to Duperval."" **********The United States and the United Nations say all three military leaders must resign before the international effort to isolate Haiti can end. **********Colonel Francois has indicated that he is willing to resign, but only ""providing that Cedras and Biamby step down also,"" according to a Haitian civilian who discussed the issue with the police chief late last week. **********General Cedras has repeatedly rejected all entreaties that he resign, most recently in an interview with CBS News in which he said he would rather die than leave in dishonor. **********But Haitian and foreign military analysts argue that General Cedras's own position within the military has so deteriorated that he has no choice but to take that hard line. **********Tonight, the Haitian Government had no immediate response to President Clinton's address, which was broadcast on several AM and FM radio frequencies here. Telephone calls to the Information and Foreign Ministries were not answered. **********But Frantz Monde, President of the Chamber of Deputies, said that Mr. Clinton was ""a liar"" for accusing the Haitian Government of human rights abuses, and predicted a blood bath if Father Aristide returned. ""He is not a democratic man, and if Clinton has a good memory he will remember that."" **********An hour after Mr. Clinton's speech ended, jet planes buzzed the capital, bringing people to their windows and out into the streets. Helicopters flew over moments later and several parachutes could be seen floating to the ground, with boxes attached containing radios. **********In the interview with CBS, which was before Mr. Clinton's address, General Cedras echoed Mr. Monde's line, saying that if the United States invaded ""first, you will have the resistance of the people, and then you will have a massacre, starting with a civil war."" **********""We have no desire to kill Americans,"" he said, ""but that is not the problem. We have the duty to defend our country. We are going to fight. A solution cannot be imposed on this country. What I'm interested in is not only the end of this crisis; it's the future of Haiti."" **********Asked whether he would leave under present conditions, he replied: ""If there is an invasion, I will not leave. I will stay and defend my country. I know I can die, but this is not important. I will remain in the memory of the people."" **********One Western diplomat pointed out that General Cedras and the other senior Haitian officers had to take such a position ""in order to maintain control of their subordinates, who are just as scared as they are."" **********That is said to be particularly true for General Cedras because of his lack of field experience and his remoteness from the troops. **********""Cedras has always been a bureaucrat, serving either at the military academy or at headquarters,"" said Kern Delince, a Haitian Army colonel who lives in exile in the United States and has written several books about the Haitian military. ""He has never been in charge of a unit in the field, and so he has never really been involved with the troops the way Francois and Biamby have."" **********Many high-ranking military officers also blame General Cedras for misjudgments that have led to a situation in which an invasion appears imminent. The officers particularly resent his decision not to kill Father Aristide during the military coup on Sept. 30, 1991, allowing the deposed President to go into exile. **********General Cedras's ability to maneuver has also been eroded by the military's lack of professionalism and cohesion. ""There is no hierarchy, no discipline, no structure,"" one Latin American diplomat here said. ""There are captains who are more important than colonels, and lieutenant colonels who count for more than generals."" **********One Latin American diplomat here recalls half-jokingly asking a captain he knows if he was going to ""resist the American invaders."" The vehemence of the officer's response surprised him, the diplomat said. **********""I don't have a house, a car and two mistresses,"" he quoted the officer as replying, referring to the fortunes that have falled to many top commanders have made since Father Aristide was overthrown. ""Why should I die for them?"" **********In the lower ranks, soldiers have not even been paid in well over a month. Many of them, recalling the instability that followed the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship, also fear retribution at the hands of Aristide supporters should the exiled President return. **********In that environment, General Cedras runs the risk of being arrested, overthrown or even killed if his fellow soldiers conclude he is about to accept a golden parachute. **********""If he tries to do that, he might not be able to leave,"" Senator Sansaricq said. ""If the army has a feeling that he is going to leave them to face this invasion, they would hold him responsible."" **********Ideally, Haitian and foreign military commentators agreed, General Cedras would like to step aside and see General Biamby, his friend and military academy classmate, move into his slot as a way of maintaining his own influence. ""You've never been able to talk about Cedras without Biamby,"" one diplomat said. ""You've got to think of them together even now."" **********But that is viewed as unworkable, not only because it is clearly unacceptable to Washington but also because it has run into opposition within the Haitian military. **********After the coup, General Cedras personally picked General Biamby as chief of staff, angering more-senior officers who were passed over.  General Biamby in turn filled many jobs with his proteges, alienating yet another group of officers. **********Colonel Francois, whose power has been waning, supports General Duperval because ""he needs protection,"" Senator Sansaricq said. From his exile, Father Aristide has already selected General Duperval as General Cedras's successor, but military analysts caution that does not mean Father Aristide is seeking an alliance with Colonel Francois. **********""Aristide has no personal relationship with Duperval,"" Colonel Delince said. ""He just wants to give the impression he is not about to destroy the army. He wants to follow the rules, and if they say Duperval is next after Cedras, that's what he will do."""

Says Zairians Seek Payoffs From Aid Flights,THE RWANDA DISASTER: THE SCENE; U.N. Says Zairians Seek Payoffs From Aid Flights," **********As more international relief flights began to reach the hundreds of Rwandans dying of cholera here today, the United Nations said local Zairian officials were trying to extort cash payoffs to permit planes to land. **********One senior relief worker said that in addition to limiting the number of flights, airport officials were seeking $2,000 ""under the table"" for each plane that comes in. **********The Zairian airport authorities allocate landing rights to the French military, which had been supporting early relief efforts here, as well as to relief flights and regular commercial flights. But a United Nations spokesman, Panos Moumtzis, said, ""A lot of non-aid flights are coming in."" **********Of the 36 scheduled flights on Thursday, 14 were French military craft, 10 were relief planes and 12 were Zairian commercial planes, the last group bringing in passengers as well as cargo like shampoo and mineral water, according to relief workers. Price Going Up **********Officially, relief flights are exempt from landing fees. But airport officials have been demanding them. Last week, it was $600 a plane. In the last few days, it has gone up to $2,000, relief agencies said. **********Two days ago, a Zairian Army colonel parked himself in front of one relief plane and said it could not leave unless he was paid $17,000, relief workers said. After long negotiations, he allowed it to depart, for $400. **********There is no indication that any relief flights have been turned away or that their cargo has been impounded. But the situation prompted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, to send a letter of protest to Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko. **********A United Nations official confirmed that Mrs. Ogata had sent a letter to President Mobutu complaining about the situation at the airport, but he declined to discuss its contents. **********With a cholera outbreak still out of control, the United Nations said today that it was reversing its position of the last few days and encouraging Rwandan refugees to leave the deadly camps here and return home. Officials had been concerned about the safety of the refugees at the hands of the victorious Rwandan rebel army but are now convinced that they would not be molested.  Zairians Block Way **********But when refugees who wanted to escape the almost certain death of cholera tried to cross back to Rwanda, they found their way blocked by Zairian soldiers and officials. **********It was unclear why the Zairians took such action, although there were reports that they were seeking to control border crossings to disarm soldiers who had been loyal to the defeated Rwandan Government Army. **********Today, at Munigi, three miles north of Goma, which had been hardest hit by cholera, the area set aside to treat cholera cases had expanded. By midday more than 200 had died. **********But the worst affected place is a section in Goma called Ngangi. At the entrance to the medical clinic in a cement block building, a woman on the hard ground appeared to be sleeping. She was dead. To her left was a boy lying on his side, his eyes and mouth wide open. He was also dead. **********A boy of about 15 lay stretched out on his back. He was surely dead. But then, there was a very slight movement of his shirt at his midsection. He was breathing, barely. But there was no one to call, no one to help pull him through. **********Ten deaths in a refugee population of 10,000 is considered ""catastrophic,"" said Isabel Pardieu of Doctors Without Borders. The refugee population in Ngangi is less than 8,000, said Sister Iraqi Sabina, a Roman Catholic nun and nurse here. **********A dump truck, already loaded with 60 bodies, arrived about 11 A.M. to pick up more than 70 bodies laid on the ground next to a partly finished concrete block building, part of the youth center in Ngangi. **********A man with a bundle in his arms walked around and over the dead and dying. When he reached the dump truck, he handed the bundle up. It was his dead 6-year-old daughter. **********Joseph Hakizimana, a 23-year-old student who tried unsuccessfully to cross back into Rwanda today, said: ""At least if they kill us on that side, they will bury us. Here they don't even bury us."" **********For several days, the new Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Government has been calling on all refugees, most of them from the rival Hutu tribe, to return. But its call has been met with doubt. **********Because of concerns about security, the United Nations had been reluctant until today to encourage refugees to return. But on Thursday, a special representative for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Michele Moussali, met with the top officials of the new Government. He came away convinced that the Government was sincere when it said all Rwandans were welcome to come back -- all, that is, except those who were responsible for the massacres in the civil war that erupted more than three months ago. **********""We believe now that it is safe enough for people who want to go back to do so,"" said Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the High Commissioner's office. ""We have not entered into this lightly."" **********One experienced relief worker said much more was needed than just encouragement to the refugees to return. ""If I had my way, tomorrow I would bring in 1,000 trucks and start taking the refugees back,"" said Michael McDonagh, director of Concern, an Irish relief organization. **********Mr. McDonagh, who has worked in just about every relief effort of the last decade, from Ethiopia and Bangladesh to Cambodia and Somalia, praised American plans to send troops and equipment to help with the refugee crisis here. ""It will make a massive difference,"" he said. **********He added, however, that some of the money intended for the relief effort would be better spent in Rwanda, so the refugees had something to return to. ""Two hundred million dollars is brilliant,"" he said, using a figure for the relief effort here. ""But it will go for fuel and for airplanes and for expatriates. If we got $200 million into Rwanda tomorrow, that could make such a difference."""

Clearest Indication **********The documents, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, reveal for the first time the details of the original plea bargain Mr. Hoffenberg negotiated with the Government in his effort to avoid a criminal trial -- and they show, in the sharpest terms so far, the severity of the penalties he will face if he is convicted of the charges filed against him after the pact was revoked by the Government. **********Mr. Hoffenberg is awaiting trial on Federal charges that he fraudulently used his flagship company, the Towers Financial Corporation, to conduct a vast Ponzi scheme that lasted from at least 1988 until early 1993 and then conspired to obstruct an investigation of Towers Financial by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If convicted, he would face much larger fines and roughly double the prison term outlined in the plea bargain, with little chance of leniency. **********In addition, he faces separate Federal criminal charges in Illinois which carry a jail term of up to 70 years and fines of $3.25 million. **********And the S.E.C. has filed a civil case charging violations of securities laws by Mr. Hoffenberg and Towers, which could result in additional fines. **********The existence of a plea agreement between Mr. Hoffenberg and the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan was first disclosed on Feb. 17, when the financier was arrested. A Federal complaint sworn out at that time indicated that Mr. Hoffenberg had cooperated with investigators under that agreement, and that the Government had then revoked the deal on the ground that Mr. Hoffenberg was not living up to its terms. **********But the documents filed this week by Mr. Hoffenberg's lawyer, Jeffrey Hoffman, reveal for the first time the number and the nature of the charges to which Mr. Hoffenberg is prepared to plead guilty -- and disclose additional crimes for which Mr. Hoffenberg would not be prosecuted in exchange for his guilty plea. **********These include, besides the pension fund case, an allegation that he participated in bribing a foreign official to obtain bank loans for Towers and in stealing money belonging to Towers customers. **********The papers also describe the events that apparently led the Government to revoke the plea agreement and take Mr. Hoffenberg to trial -- events that centered on Mr. Hoffenberg's testimony about his dealings with the Diversified Credit Corporation, a bill-collection company set up by a former Towers executive. **********According to the documents, Mr. Hoffenberg told prosecutors in June 1993 that he was merely an investor in Diversified and never received any money from the company. Two months later, Mr. Hoffenberg ""clarified"" that statement and disclosed that Diversified ""did pay some of his personal expenses, such as the salaries of his driver, boat captain and two maids."" **********In February, he further disclosed that he had received ""about $10,000 in reimbursed expenses"" from Diversified between May and July 1993, and that Diversified had paid the salary of some employees of Her New York, the unsuccessful newspaper that Mr. Hoffenberg operated for a few months last year. He also disclosed in February -- just three days before his arrest -- that he had transferred $200,000 to Diversified eight months earlier, at a time when he was subject to an asset freeze imposed at the S.E.C.'s request. **********Still, Mr. Hoffman argues in the court documents that his client has fully complied with the terms of the plea agreement. He is asking the court to force the Federal prosecutors to reinstate the original plea bargain. That request is scheduled to be heard by Federal Judge Robert W. Sweet on June 15, according to Mr. Hoffman. **********The deal that Mr. Hoffenberg wants the Government to honor calls for him to plead guilty to five specific criminal counts: conspiracy to fraudulently sell securities, conspiracy to obstruct justice, tax evasion and two counts of mail fraud, one involving Towers Financial and the other involving transactions with two Illinois insurance companies. **********Each of the five counts carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Thus, under Congressionally imposed sentencing guidelines, Mr. Hoffenberg could be jailed for up to 25 years and be fined up to $1.25 million under the plea bargain he now seeks to enforce. **********Although the agreement specifically notes that the sentence imposed on Mr. Hoffenberg ""remains within the sole discretion of the sentencing judge,"" his lawyer, Mr. Hoffman, said that he envisioned a much shorter sentence -- in fact, no prison term at all, or ""at most, a minimal sentence of perhaps 6 to 10 months."" **********Mr. Hoffman based that expectation, he said, on the fact that cooperative defendants are typically given sentences that run concurrently, rather than consecutively, when they plead guilty to more than one violation, and that prosecutors had agreed not to object if a more lenient sentence was imposed."

'This Is the First Time' **********""This is the first time this Government has linked us to terrorism,"" said Issam al-Irian, a senior Brotherhood leader, as he sat in a spartan office in central Cairo. ""It is part of a wide move by the Government to curtail all forms of democratic participation. It is an expression of the Government's weakness. But by narrowing the opportunities for democratic participation, the Government is creating more problems that it is solving."" **********The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, is the prototype for modern Islamic fundamentalist political parties throughout the Middle East and North Africa. **********Although it has been officially banned since 1954, with a membership estimated in the hundreds of thousands it is the largest Egyptian opposition movement -- legal or illegal -- and dominates many of the 14,000 private philanthropies that provide services from health clinics to primary schools. **********Its assets, with backing from supporters here and in Persian Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. **********The Brotherhood, which has its headquarters in central Cairo, calls for the establishment of an Islamic state by peaceful means. It rejects the violence used by outlawed organizations like the Islamic Group in their efforts to topple the Government. Control of Civic Institutions **********But at the same time, the Brotherhood has mounted an aggressive campaign to take control of a variety of civil and charitable institutions. It now dominates the largest of Egypt's 22 professional associations, including the medical, engineering and legal groups. And, aside from the rejection of the use of force, the goals of the Brotherhood dovetail with those of the underground groups. **********The wide reach of the Brotherhood is based on its charitable work, including scores of clinics, hospitals and schools. But it also appeals to many Egyptians, especially those in the professional classes, as the only credible opposition movement. **********""The Brotherhood, among the professional class, owes its support to the fact that it is an effective protest movement,"" said Said al-Naggar, the head of New Civic Forum, a liberal think tank. ""It is the only outlet many people have to express dissatisfaction with the current system. Many of the professionals do not necessarily support the Islamic ideology, although there is a feeling that Western-style opposition parties, whether socialist or democratic, have failed."" **********But there is a price for effective organization. Women, for example, must wear the hejab, or head scarf, if they want to enter the Physicians' Union, a former leftist stronghold with a membership of 80,000 that is now controlled by the Brotherhood.  Low-Cost Appliances **********""The Brotherhood provides loans, cars, furniture and even electrical appliances to union members, at low cost,"" said Mohammed al-Farhat, who is not a member of the Brotherhood. ""The union gives the physicians and their families the best quality health care at a minimal price. They have a reputation for being honest and careful with union funds."" That reputation has wide appeal in a country whose Government is seen as thoroughly corrupt. **********Until now, the Government concentrated its efforts on battling the Islamic Group, which has waged a two-year campaign of violence in which nearly 400 people, mainly police officers and militants, have been killed. But security forces have killed one militant commander and captured several others, putting the underground groups on the defensive. **********""The security situation over all is much better now than a few months ago,"" a Western diplomat said. ""This has made it easier to do this. The Government has the energy and the manpower available to go after what it sees as a second-tier organization."" **********But Brotherhood leaders say the Government wants to silence the only effective opposition in a country that nominally has a multiparty system, but where the same ruling group has been in power since 1952. **********While refusing to lift the ban on the Brotherhood, President Mubarak has, until now, allowed it to operate. Brotherhood members were even permitted to run in parliamentary elections in 1988, although the candidates ran as members of the tiny Liberal and once-moribund Socialist Labor Party, both of which the Brotherhood now controls.  Election Fraud Alleged **********The main opposition parties, including the Socialist Labor Party, have boycotted subsequent parliamentary elections because of what they say is fraud. But the tolerance of the Brotherhood appears to have ended. For the first time, President Mubarak has begun referring to the group as a ""terrorist"" organization in public statements. **********Government officials say documents discovered in February at the office of a company that had links to the Brotherhood directly tied the organization to violent groups. **********They also say a defector from the underground armed movement detailed payments by Brotherhood supporters to armed factions. **********And they have angrily criticized Brotherhood leaders for organizing a demonstration by hundreds of lawyers last month that turned violent. The demonstration was called to protest the death in police custody of a lawyer who defended jailed militants. Government critics and human rights groups say the lawyer, Abdel Harith Medani, was tortured to death. The Government denies the charge. **********""The Brotherhood is a ring trying to agitate disturbances on the street,"" said Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi. ""And this is also what the terrorists and the murderers are doing with their explosions and assassinations.""  Spiritual Leader Questioned **********The Government has taken a number of steps in its new campaign against the group. Hamed Aboul-Nasr, 81, the ailing spiritual leader of the Brotherhood, was called in for police questioning for two days this week, accused of writing anti-Government leaflets and inciting the lawyers' protest last month. Parliament has canceled the right of professors to elect the deans of university faculties, many of which are now dominated by the Brotherhood. **********Mayors and village council members, many of whom belong to the Brotherhood, will be appointed by the Government rather than elected. **********Brotherhood members, including most of the senior leaders around the country, have been arrested. A prominent clergyman was recently prevented from delivering a sermon to thousands of worshipers. And editors and reporters from Al Shaab, the paper of the Socialist Labor Party and a strong fundamentalist voice, have been hauled into court and imprisoned in recent weeks for articles critical of the Government. **********The crackdown worries many who fear that if the Brotherhood leaders are driven underground or imprisoned, they could call on their followers to join the armed movements.  Comparison to Algeria **********""I never believed that the Brotherhood represented the moderate branch of the Islamic movement,"" said Hussein Ahmed Amin, Egypt's former Ambassador to Algeria and a prominent writer. ""It was a matter of the distribution of roles. The Brotherhood preached a moderate line to get into Parliament and the Labor Party, which it came to dominate, as well as to appeal to those who wanted change, but deplored violence. **********""But the origin of the trouble in Egypt is the same as in Algeria. The rise in militancy is caused by the failure to create a democratic system, by social and economic grievances, Government corruption, a lack of housing, unemployment, immigration from the rural areas to the cities and a lack of competing ideologies. The Islamic movement will not disappear with repression. And if the Government presses the Brotherhood too hard it could become more overtly radical and put all its energy into acts of terror."" **********Brotherhood leaders are not shy about echoing such a threat. **********""If our supporters believe we cannot achieve our goals peacefully,"" said Mohammed Maamoun al-Hodaiby, the spokesman for the Brotherhood, ""then they may turn to more radical means to achieve them. **********""What do you expect?"""

So everybody sees their future dependent on a decision announced Friday in Washington that the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service will not renew a program that allowed tens of thousands of Salvadorans to live in the United States legally. **********""Without the money from the North we will dry up, "" said Aristides Gonzalez, who used the income he earned in the United States to start a small snack bar and grocery store here. Still, exactly what the decision will mean for them is not clear. **********The intent of the American program was to give temporary refuge to Salvadorans because the civil war made this country dangerous. But the war ended two years ago, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service determined that the political and human rights situation in El Salvador has improved significantly. **********The program expires at the end of the year. The Immigration Service said those covered by it have nine months to apply for political asylum under another program. **********An estimated one million Salvadorans live in the United States, about half of them with full legal status. Of the rest, according to American officials, nearly 200,000 orginally joined the temporary program that is now being abolished. Immigration officials say only 85,000 remain in the program, although other officials say the number is probably much higher. **********El Salvador's Central Bank estimates the Salvadorans covered by the program will send their families $302 million this year, more than the value of the country's main export, coffee. The total amount of remittances from all Salvadorans living abroad is expected to reach $1 billion this year. **********While waiting for hearings on their claims for asylum Salvadorans will be able to live and work in the United States legally. But it is not known how long it will take to hold the asylum hearings, let alone how many Salvadorans will be granted asylum. **********On their way to jobs or farm chores here in Santa Teresa, in central El Salvador, six men gathered around a table under the wobbly awning at Mr. Gonzalez's snack bar and talked about what Salvadorans in the United States mean to this village. **********Leonel Rivas pointed out that in contrast to the areas of El Salvador where people do not have many relatives in the United States, this village and those nearby have progressed remarkably. There is now a bridge over the ravine that once isolated several communities. Electricity has been extended to other villages, and dirt roads once barely passable have been paved. **********""It's only recently that people had a way to get to jobs in Zacatecoluca,"" Mr. Rivas said, referring to the closest city. ""Now farmers can get their crop to the market."" **********Local officials said the improvements were due in large part to taxes paid by the small businesses started and now sustained by the money earned in the United States. **********American officials in El Salvador warned the State Department that a sudden drop in remittances from Salvadorans could be disastrous for the poorest regions of the country.  The officials said if the Salvadoran economy could not provide jobs, then more Salvadorans would probably go to the United States illegally to find work."

We're happy,' "" said Mr. Fleury. **********""And they're waiting for Saturday,"" he said, referring to the day when Haiti's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is to return from exile. ""And then they make that party for every Haitian family in the city."" **********The Haitian-American community in the United States numbers 450,000, most of it concentrated in New York and Miami, and the joy of Mr. Fleury, co-owner of Le Jardin Cultural Art Gallery, seemed to typify the immediate reaction around New York. But elation was tempered by concern for the future of Haiti in light of its troubled history, its current occupation by United States forces and a wait-and-see attitude toward Father Aristide. **********Some people expressed frustration that General Cedras had been allowed to leave without punishment for the repression and bloodshed that marked his regime; others expressed pleasure that he had decided to leave peaceably. **********At the Impeccable Barber Shop and Beauty Parlor in Brooklyn's Flatbush section, Emanuel Trompnasse, the owner's son, said of the general: ""People are very happy he's leaving.

That's the way it's supposed to be."" **********Raymond A.

""He was named commander in chief Oct. 12, 1991, for three years. I have always written this: If you wait till Oct. 12, Cedras will be leaving anyway."" **********Mr. Joseph added: ""I think that it may be a good idea for Cedras to leave the country for some time, and it should be known it is not constitutional what they are doing, because the Constitution says no Haitian should be exiled."" **********Ernest Banatt, a member of the Haitian Information and Documentation Center, a community center on Flatbush Avenue, said he didn't think the general's resignation would affect Haiti's future. ""What I am unhappy about is the occupation of Haiti by the United States,"" he said. ""Cedras's leaving does nothing. Now Cedras is gone, but the U.S. remains. It is a changing of the guard, but the U.S. is still in charge."" **********At Le Jardin Cultural Art Gallery in Queens, Mr. Fleury said people were coming in for passport photos and planning to visit Haiti to do business and see relatives.

Millions," **********Gridlock in Congress may cause distress in middle America, but it is winning some fans in corporate America. **********Chrysler and General Motors are among the companies that have taken advantage this week of reduced fees for registering bond issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- a windfall made possible by Congressional inaction on the agency's budget. **********Together, the companies saved $2 million because the registration fees the agency charges were cut nearly in half last weekend. The fee cut is set in motion automatically at the end of a fiscal year when Congress has not authorized the commission's new budget. **********A succession of Republican senators who are up for re-election have used Senate procedural rules to continue blocking passage of the bill this week, while trying to attach special tax cuts and other politically popular provisions to the legislation. **********In the meantime, companies have raced to register bond issues before the fees could be raised back to usual levels. The reductions cost the S.E.C. $334,635 on Monday, $845,876 on Tuesday, $2.55 million on Wednesday and as much as $4 million today, said Arthur Levitt Jr., the commission's chairman. ""I think it is a fire sale, clearly,"" he said by telephone this evening. ""These funds will not be recovered."" **********Two big beneficiaries today were Chrysler, which registered a $4.5 billion bond issue, and G.M., which registered a $7.1 billion bond issue. Chrysler also registered an $11.1 billion bond issue on Wednesday, and has saved a total of $1.6 million in fees so far, Mr. Levitt said. **********James M. McConnell, the S.E.C.'s executive director, said companies registered securities at five times the pace of an average day. **********John R. Ferry, a Chrysler spokesman, said the fee cut was a consideration in the decision to register the bond issues this week. But he added that the company files many debt registrations each year. ""We're a regular customer that pays a lot of fees to the S.E.C.,"" he said. **********The charges dropped automatically last weekend to one-fiftieth of 1 percent of the value of issued securities. The usual assessment is one-twenty-ninth of 1 percent, but that rate has to be renewed by legislation each year. **********Congress did approve a bill this summer that provided $125 million of the S.E.C.'s $300 million annual budget, while deferring action on the rest, including the registration fees. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, both Republicans up for re-election, used Senate rules to block a vote on the bill early this week. **********Ms. Hutchison called for the bill to raise the tax-deferred or tax-deductible contributions that nonworking spouses can make to individual retirement accounts. Mr. Hatch said that he wanted the bill to allow self-employed Americans to deduct part of their health care expenses from their income taxes. **********Both Senators have since dropped their proposals after reassurances from colleagues and the Treasury Department that their concerns would be addressed next year. But in the meantime, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, who is also up for re-election, has taken up Mr. Hatch's health care cause and now he is blocking the bill. **********Verna W. Hensley, Senator Roth's press secretary, said tonight that he had long favored the tax break and was not using the S.E.C. budget to seek campaign support. ""It goes way back,"" she said. ""It's very important to our small businesses and farmers."" **********For lack of money, the S.E.C. has canceled all nonessential travel for its employees and slowed down investigations of business practices at brokerage firms and mutual funds.

Several other Asian nations, including China and Thailand, face similar problems. **********Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said in a recent interview that ""a serious scarcity problem will arise within three to five years"" in Jakarta and Surabaya - Indonesia's largest cities, where many factories are concentrated - unless action is taken to conserve water and use it more efficiently. **********He said that such a shortage would cause difficulties for a number of industries that need large amounts of water, including textiles, pulp and paper, and hotels. **********""If we have water shortages and rationing, it will have a serious economic impact on industry,"" said Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""We have to find ways of conserving water and then creating more of it, perhaps by desalination if it's economically feasible."" **********He said the chamber would be telling its members that even though water recycling and anti-pollution equipment was an added expense, ""it is not a negative investment."" **********Mr. Bakrie is unusual among businessmen in Indonesia because he is aware of the water problem and the need to do something about it. Many business people, including foreign investors, appear so preoccupied with growth and profits that they overlook the state of basic natural resources on which their operations depend. **********In a report to the Indonesian government this year, the World Bank cautioned that with growing congestion and pollution in its main urban centers, ""it will be increasingly difficult for Indonesia to compete for foreign investment, especially in the higher-technology industries needed to enhance the productivity of the labor force."" **********The bank said that heavy reliance on underground water to serve industrial and domestic needs in Indonesia's big cities could not continue indefinitely. It added that Jakarta and other cities, such as Surabaya on the north coast of Java, were particularly vulnerable. **********In those cities, the bank warned, water is being drawn from aquifers more quickly than it is being replenished, ""leading to saltwater intrusion and land subsidence with attendant increases in floods and waterlogging, which in turn aggravates groundwater pollution from septic tanks."" **********There are not enough dams to supply Jakarta or Surabaya, and nearby rivers are heavily contaminated with human and industrial waste. In the dry season, which is just ending, the water level falls and the pollution becomes worse. **********Environmental specialists at the bank estimate that industries, hotels and private consumers in Jakarta are using wells and pumps to draw more than 300 million cubic meters (about 10 billion cubic feet) of underground water a year - about three times the replenishment rate of the aquifers. **********As a result, seawater is seeping into the reservoirs, with the salinized area in the northern parts of the Indonesian capital expanding rapidly and now extending 15 kilometers (9 miles) in from the coast. **********More than 70 percent of industries in Jakarta use underground water, either because piped water supplies are inadequate or because it is substantially cheaper to do so. **********Indonesia has a population of more than 180 million. The number of people in Jakarta is expected to climb to 12 million by 2005, from 8.5 million today. **********Concerned with widespread wastage of water, President Suharto launched a national water-saving campaign last month aimed at preventing ""severe, long-term water shortages."" **********Mr. Sarwono, the environment minister, said a National Water Agency should be formed to coordinate water- related activities by the government that are now the responsibility of three ministries. **********He said the introduction of stricter pollution controls and industrial zoning regulations in the past two years had shown ""some results"" but that much more needed to be done. **********He also said he was worried that ""only a crisis will bring us around."" **********Jakarta's municipal water company concedes that it can supply only about 59 percent of the city's daily demand of 1.7 million cubic meters. Users often complain of pollution. **********The company's waterpipe network, which leaks badly, reaches only 44 percent of Jakarta's residents. Many of those who get no water are the urban poor. They have to buy from vendors who charge much more than the cost of piped water. **********In an effort to improve the situation, the government recently announced that it was opening major urban water supply projects, including treatment plants and transmission pipelines, to private investment. **********Radinal Moochtar, public works minister, said that of the $7.8 billion of water supply investment needed in Indonesia over the next five years, more than 70 percent was expected to come from the private sector, both local and foreign."

Hanson, one of the leaders in the movement to strengthen shareholders' rights, is expected to announce today that he is stepping down as the chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, on July 1. **********Mr. Hanson, who has run the fund -- widely known as Calpers -- for seven years, did not return phone calls to his Sacramento office yesterday. But acquaintances say he informed the 13 members of the board on Monday night, and restated his decision yesterday at an open board session in Anaheim. **********He is expected to announce his decision at a news conference today. **********The grapevine, however, was way ahead. **********""What Calpers has done while Dale has been there,"" said John A. Pound, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, ""is show how a major institutional investor can play the role of a catalyst and yet be perceived as a constructive and nondisruptive force. American institutional investors are playing a completely different role in the market than ever before, and he has consistently been one of the leaders in shaping what that role is."" **********Mr. Hanson was thought to have been in the running to head the General Motors' pension fund, but as of two weeks ago, it appeared that the job would go to an insider. ""I know his name was mentioned,"" said Jon Lukomnik, New York City's deputy comptroller for pensions and another advocate for shareholders. ""And I know he would have liked it."" Venture Capital Next? **********Some friends say Mr. Hanson wants to start a venture-capital fund that will concentrate on providing seed money for fledgling California companies. But one friend, Richard E. Damm, a Sacramento consultant, said Mr. Hanson was going to become partners with Thomas C. Stickel, a wealthy San Diego businessman and Republican fund-raiser who made his money repackaging mortgages into bonds for resale, including some he sold to a separate pension fund for California's teachers. **********The two of them, he believes, are seeking to drum up business opportunities that might be opening for United States and Mexican companies in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********In any case, Mr. Hanson will be less involved with the shareholder revolution where he made his stamp. **********""He's moving on,"" said Nell Minow, a principal with Lens Inc., a Washington money management firm that prods underperforming companies to improve their earnings. **********It is also clear that after a quarter of a century in public service, Mr. Hanson, who is 51, is interested in more lucrative employment. Even though he heads a pension fund with more than $80 billion in assets, and is ultimately responsible for the pensions of more than a million Californians, from firefighters to gravediggers, his salary is $110,000 a year. **********""For the amount of responsibility he had, that's not a tremendous amount of compensation he was receiving,"" Mr. Damm said. **********Many shareholder advocates say they will miss Mr. Hanson's contributions. Until he focused on underperformance by companies, institutional investors were busy debating the pros and cons of takeover repellents, raiders and other business trends of the 1980's.  Origins in Wisconsin **********Mr. Hanson, a Wisconsin native, was named to head the California fund in April 1987 after serving as No. 2 at Wisconsin's pension fund. **********In the last seven years, he has had a starring role in a revolution in corporate governance that has forced many companies to replace their chief executives and disclose more about how they pay them and others. **********Calpers got into shareholder advocacy because its huge holdings made it all but impossible for it to take the so-called Wall Street walk: voting with its feet if it disapproved of the way a company was performing. **********It discovered that it could improve returns from its investments if it agitated for change at underperforming companies and spoke out against abuse. That outspokenness did not always sit well with pro-business California politicians, and some believe Mr. Hanson's days were numbered ever since he had a messy showdown in 1991 with Gov. Pete Wilson. **********In the last couple of years the fund, personified by Mr. Hanson, has moderated its style in the interest of opening a dialogue with companies and the boards that oversee them. Some companies now seem to prefer consulting with their largest investors before making managerial or strategic decisions, rather than keep them in the dark. **********To some onlookers, the change in style, coupled with the exit from the business of other veterans like the United Shareholder Association, signaled the end of an era. But to others, the movement is entering a mature new phase. ""In my view, it is where this whole process has to go and has made them much more, not less, effective,"" Professor Pound said. **********If Mr. Hanson does go into venture capital, Professor Pound sees that as a logical sequel to the campaign he has waged the last few years. ""American venture capitalists are the ultimate relationship investors,"" he said. ""They understand how to take large positions and work constructively as members of the board."""

And with interest rates lower in the fixed-income market, the equity market became a more attractive alternative to investors. Life Left in the Bull **********""Today's market performance has renewed belief among some market participants that we have much more left in this bull market than first thought,"" said Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat, First Securities in Richmond. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, the closely watched market barometer, rose to yet another closing high of 3,945.43, up 19.13 points on the day and 30.95 points for the week. Traders said the rally was broad-based as many of the other market indexes also set closing highs. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 1.65 points to close at a high of 478.70, as did the Nasdaq composite, which was up 3.65 points yesterday to 796.53. **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 313.1 million shares, down from 346.5 million on Thursday, with 1,324 stocks rising and 770 declining. **********""The only negative in yesterday's extremely good report was that imports ran a little ahead of exports, and that subtracted from the G.D.P., Mr. Hays said. ""Autos and housing components continue to come on big, with technology adding more strength to the domestic product."" **********Most economists explained the bond rally by pointing to the inflation numbers. The Government's fixed-weight price index for gross domestic purchases rose 2.9 percent for the year, the smallest rise since 1986. **********The G.D.P. deflator, which captures shifts in what goods are purchased as well as price changes, rose a slim 1.3 percent for the quarter and was up just 2.2 percent on the year, the smallest increase since the 1960's. **********Some analysts argued that this performance meant that the Federal Reserve Board could wait longer to raise short-term interest rates. This could put a move by the Fed off into the second half of the year. Some analysts have forecast a rise in the Federal funds rate by spring. **********Looking ahead, there are few in the market who believe the economy will turn sour. Mr. Hays cited strong consumer sentiment and mending foreign economies as two reasons why the economy would continue to grow at about a 4 percent pace in the first quarter and 4.75 percent for the year. **********Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president at Tucker Anthony, said he thought the market's current momentum ""may be strong enough to carry the Dow industrials another two to three percentage points higher if we're lucky, but the stage is being set for a severe correction that could exceed 15 percent by autumn."" **********Mr. Laubscher thinks investors are soon likely to realize that the 5.9 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter was an aberration. **********In Tokyo, Japanese stocks declined.

But sales were down in the Northeast and South, the National Association of Realtors found. **********The report on durable goods, a category ranging from aircraft carriers to clothes dryers, was regarded by many analysts as a sign of slackening economic growth and thus would diminish pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again. **********""The economy has shifted into lower gear since the beginning of the new year,"" said Robert D.

Meyer, a consultant, said he saw ""waning"" economic momentum and cited three consecutive months of declines in orders for nonmilitary capital goods. **********But others had less pessimistic interpretations of the report on orders, pointing to the hefty rise in March that was at least sustained in April and to a jump of 8.6 percent last month in orders for electronic and other electrical equipment. **********""Durable goods manufacturing continues to be expanding meaningfully,"" said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official and now chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. **********Mark P. Vitner, economist at First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., largely agreed. ""There is not much of a letup in sight in the manufacturing sector,"" he said. ""There's plenty of fuel in the pipeline."" **********And Paul W. Boltz, economist at T. Rowe Price Associates, an investment firm in Baltimore, said, ""We're not worried yet."" **********Still, orders fell by seven-tenths of 1 percent when the Pentagon's orders are not counted, and overall orders -- 13.5 percent higher than in April 1993 -- have now fallen at an annual rate of 4 percent over the last three months. **********Primary metals posted the biggest decline last month, skidding by 6.6 percent after two solid gains. Transportation equipment, where declines for railroad equipment and motor vehicles more than offset an advance for aircraft, fell by 1.6 percent, the smallest of three consecutive declines. Industrial machinery rose by three-tenths of 1 percent. Total New Orders Up 2 Percent **********In capital goods, total new orders climbed by 2 percent as the relatively small military sector jumped by 23.3 percent, while the civilian sector fell by nine-tenths of 1 percent -- seven-tenths of 1 percent when aircraft are excluded. **********Shipments of durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, fell by six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Commerce Department figures also showed. It was the second decline in four months. **********Unfilled orders, or backlogs, inched up by one-tenth of 1 percent, to $423.8 billion, the first rise since January. **********The report on home resales listed increases of 5.4 percent in the West and 3 percent in the Middle West, partly offset by a second consecutive decline of 1.7 percent in the Northeast and a decline of 1.3 percent in the South. **********""With the start of the spring home-buying season, many consumers decided to lock in before volatile investment markets pushed the possibility of buying a home out of their financial reach,"" said Debbie Johnson, economist at C. J. Lawrence in New York, referring to a rush by home buyers to act before interest rates rose again."

Apparel International Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment group, holds a 54 percent stake in Hilfiger. **********""Tommy's name is on the door forever; he really has a lifetime contract here,"" said Benjamin Ng, executive vice president of Hilfiger. ""The title just sort of symbolizes that."" **********Mr. Hilfiger will continue to control the company's creative areas, including design and marketing. **********Jay Margolis, who left Liz Claiborne Inc. last summer to become chairman and chief executive of Pepe Jeans USA, a privately held company also owned by Apparel International, will become president and vice chairman of Hilfiger on April 1. He will oversee the introduction of the women's line and manage its licensing and retail programs. **********Mr. Margolis is widely admired on Wall Street for his hand in the growth of Liz Claiborne's business, and Mr. Hilfiger and Apparel International have made no secret of their desire to build Hilfiger into another Claiborne. **********Edwin Lewis, chief executive of Hilfiger, will replace Mr. Margolis as chairman and chief executive of Pepe Jeans USA. Mr. Lewis will also serve as vice chairman of Hilfiger with responsibility for the men's and boys' lines, which he is credited with building into a powerful force in the market. Production and Financial Matters **********Joel Horowitz, the president and chief operating officer of Hilfiger whose responsibilities include the company's operations, production and financial matters, will replace Mr. Lewis as Hilfiger's chief executive. **********""They're growing into other businesses, and they're trying to maximize the talents of the people they have,"" said Bruce Missett, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""It's part of the natural evolution of an apparel company moving into other areas."" **********Hilfiger has given the bastions of the men's sportswear business like Polo/Ralph Lauren, Land's End and J. Crew a run for their money with its competitively priced, jaunty casual clothing. It is one of the best-selling casual clothing lines in department stores at a time when apparel sales in general are weak. **********In the fiscal year that ended in March, Hilfiger's sales increased 29.5 percent, to $138.6 million. **********Hilfiger has teamed up with Hartmarx to manufacture and market a line of men's tailored clothing. And Hilfiger recently signed a licensing agreement to start a men's fragrance with the Estee Lauder Companies, the first licensing agreement the cosmetics company has ever signed. **********Analysts said Hilfiger is not likely to produce a women's line until late 1995 or early 1996. **********They also said that despite entering the women's market at a time when the segment is weak, Hilfiger might have a chance to capitalize on its marketing and production expertise. ""With the weakness in women's apparel not just in sales but in the manufacturing end as well, it might be an appropriate time for a smart, savvy operator to jump in,"" said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst with the Johnson Redbook Service."

Who are we?"" **********It is a subject that would hardly have been tackled so simplistically by Nadine Gordimer, never mind Joseph Conrad. But it sets a pop sociology benchmark in the kaleidoscopic rush toward free elections by wondering aloud about the state of white conscience after all these decades of racist hegemony. **********Consider Wilhelm Verwoerd, a white man who speaks before happy throngs of Nelson Mandela supporters night after night with an appropriately apologetic look, invoking a new age of integration. He is the shy but fervidly turned-about grandson of Hendrik Verwoerd, the stolid, infamous architect of apartheid, South Africa's system of formalized racism. 'Decisive Break' Needed **********On Tuesday night, a delighted Mandela crowd watched the lean, flaxen-haired Mr. Verwoerd, a 29-year-old university professor, as the personification of diabolism undone. **********""The success of apartheid exceeded what we thought was possible,"" he told an overflow crowd of several thousand at the town hall, warning of racism's continuing political appeal in this month's election, almost three decades after the assassination of his grandfather. ""This election is more than a competition between parties. It's one in which we have to make a decisive break with the past."" **********The crowd beamed at Mr. Verwoerd, who began his radical journey in his university student years at the side of his wife, Melanie. She is an activist-sprite who exults even more openly in the shedding of her own white, middle-class prejudices. She, too, politics everywhere on behalf of Mr. Mandela and his African National Congress. **********""It was agonizing for two or three years,"" she said of the ostracism in a Verwoerd family that includes devotees of white supremacist enclaves as the only antidote to a Mandela victory. **********White conscience is always difficult to judge in this country, Mrs. Verwoerd warned. She said she found her own awakening secured when her husband studied abroad and mailed her the banned transcripts of the trial leading to Mr. Mandela's 27 years of imprisonment for defying apartheid. Two Countries in One **********""A lot of white people come up to us and say they appreciate the fact that some Afrikaners are standing up now,"" she said. But Mrs. Verwoerd speaks more of deeds, of assuring that her two young children attend integrated schools and venture early into this land's vast black exurbs of jerry-built hovels, some of the world's most shame-ridden slums, that she never visited until she was 20. **********""I just realized in the late 80's that basically South Africa was two countries and I only knew one of them,"" she said, echoing her husband's celebration of the very first A.N.C. rally ever held here on the town hall stage, long a bulwark of white politics. **********""It's good to see an audience in this hall which more accurately reflects the community outside,"" Mr. Verwoerd told the throng that materialized from campus and vineyard, factory and squatter shambles. **********Pierre-Jeanne Gerber presents a different facet of white consciousness as he campaigns for office over in the rival camp of the National Party led by F. W. de Klerk, the final white President of apartheid who is overseeing the attempt at democratic transition in the elections April 27 and 28. **********""It's rubbish to call our party racist,"" insists Mr. Gerber, a 31-year-old real-estate tyro and candidate for regional parliament who is startling the party rank and file here in the western Cape by tracking and restoring onetime ""colored"" owners of some of his marginal properties. They were forced off decades ago because of their mixed racial backgrounds. He has transferred two deeds thus far and is tracking owners of half a dozen other modest plots that were expropriated as race laws herded nonwhites off to designated ghettoes. **********The interesting thing about Mr. Gerber's budding avocation is his insistence that white conscience has little to do with it. ""I never did it out of guilt,"" he asserted, describing a new breed of young National Party pragmatists interested in ""kick-starting"" social improvement and prosperity and expunging the old ""stupid laws."" **********He remembers one ""stupid law"" -- land confiscation that overtook a friendly nonwhite family in a mixed neighborhood where he spent his boyhood. ""One day their house was empty and I never saw them again -- all because of some law,"" he said. **********That is as strongly as Mr. Gerber goes into the moral implications of white history. The bits of property restoration may be simply shrewd politics for him in the current tidal shift of South African society. But he says land, not a white man's need for justification, is his compass. **********""Land never really belongs to a person; the person belongs to the land,"" he explained. ""And I can imagine how someone felt, losing his land simply because of some stupid law."" He said his grandfather lost his farm under an unfair bankruptcy law that seared his family history. **********""Land is stability,"" Mr. Gerber said. He said that property transfers and fast prefab block construction might be a good start in restoring some of the nonwhite majority to the land. **********""Just get them going in something that's not a tin shack,"" he said. Mr. Gerber is convinced that self-interest in the land will ignite unimaginable progress. For this task, he argues, the National Party has the management know-how. 'Apartheid Was Darkness' **********The Verwoerds hardly agree in conscience with Mr. Gerber as all three prepare for far different places in their land after election day. ""Apartheid was darkness masquerading as the light,"" Mr. Verwoerd emphasized to the crowd, warning against creating a new politics devoid of history's full accounting. **********His wife explained that only the pain and truth of history could provide the key to progress for all South Africans, especially Afrikaners as they finally retreat from dominance to ponder whether it is, indeed, all right to be white. **********""History does show that Afrikaners can adapt,"" Mrs. Verwoerd said. ""And once they change, they really tend to go the whole way."""

The latest tally showed the congress behind by 5 percentage points, with about half the vote still uncounted. **********""We believe Inkatha had its own pirate polling stations, 54 of them,"" Ronnie Mamoepa, an African National Congress spokesman said. Other irregularities alleged by the African National Congress included tampering with the plastic seals used to close ballot boxes, chasing electoral monitors from polling stations and intimidating voters. **********The Inkatha leader, Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi, described the accusations as ""quite extraordinary."" **********Speaking to reporters in Ulundi, the capital of the former Zulu homeland of KwaZulu, Chief Buthelezi reacted indignantly, saying the allegations were made because ""we are whipping the A.N.C."" in the region of six million people. ""I don't know what the aim of this is,"" Chief Buthelezi said.  And he added that if the congress continues to level charges against Inkatha, ""they'll be opening a Pandora's box."" **********Another senior Inkatha official, Themba Khoza, told reporters in Johannesburg that the elections had not been free and fair. ""We were robbed,"" he said. **********It was difficult to assess the various charges. Members of the Independent Electoral Commission, while expressing concern, said they were not persuaded that these incidents, taken together, constituted proof of systematic election fraud. **********At the same time, however, Johann Kriegler, the chairman of the electoral commission, said that computer sabotage was part of the reason for delays in the ballot counting. But Mr. Kriegler insisted that the incident had made ""a very trivial difference"" on overall trends in election results.  A Volatile Region **********The contest in Natal is being closely watched because the province was the scene of nearly half of the country's political killings in the last decade. A five-week-old state of emergency remains in force throughout the region on the country's eastern coast. **********A victory by Inkatha, which has its strongest following in Natal, would probably go a long way toward defusing many of the pent-up factional tensions in the region that have fed the bloodshed, while analysts believe that an African National Congress victory would likely do the opposite. **********After a brief nationwide lull in violence during the four election days last week, clashes flared over the weekend in Natal, leading to at least 29 deaths, the police said. **********Still incomplete national election returns gave the African National Congress a solid 64.9 percent of the vote and the National Party 20.5 percent, with the Inkatha Freedom Party in third place with 8.1 percent. The rest of the vote was divided among the 16 other parties in the election.  Results of Provincial Races **********In the overall counting for the nine provincial legislatures, the African National Congress was ahead in seven. The National Party had a sturdy lead in the Western Cape, and Inkatha was slightly ahead of the African National Congress in Natal, 43 percent to 38 percent. **********The slowness in counting the estimated 23 million votes caused the first meeting of the new Parliament, originally scheduled for Friday in Cape Town, to be put off until Monday. Its first task will be to officially choose Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, as the country's first black president. Mr. Mandela is then scheduled to be inaugurated Tuesday in Pretoria, a date the authorities say cannot be changed because so many foreign dignitaries are expected to attend the ceremonies. **********The electoral commission has counted just over half of the votes cast during the balloting last week. Asked when the figures would be complete, Mr. Kriegler said only that the count would be finished before the presidential inauguration on Tuesday.  Slowdown Is Charged **********While disputes over counting procedures -- and to a lesser extent, computer tampering -- are the main reasons given for delays in tabulating, officials say labor disputes have also played a large part. Here in Durban, in particular, officials say their efforts to speed up the process has been frustrated by a series of work stoppages and ""go-slows."" **********""They're trying to slow up the counting so that they can get more money,' said one election official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. He said workers get paid by the day, so they have a strong incentive to do their work as slowly as possible. **********Workers counter that they are being exploited by election officials. **********Eric Naidoo, a 24-year-old university student, said: ""A few people are doing the work, while most are just sitting around doing nothing. The process is so confusing that nobody knows what's going on. **********""If people could see what's going on inside,"" he said, ""it would be a national scandal."""

It cl...",6329,,International Herald Tribune,Your Money,,article,Assessing Risk: It's in Eye of the Beholder,Assessing Risk: It's in Eye of the Beholder," **********CALL it derivative, call it hedged, call it quantitative investment, but one thing at least is clear: Investment managers claim they are offering something different from the usual trade-off between return and risk. **********But what exactly is risk? It clearly means different things to different different investors. What is the most effective way to measure and avoid risk? What's the difference between ""perceived"" and ""actual"" risk, and when does the former become the latter? The growth of derivatives funds, which some see as relatively low-risk propositions despite being invested in highly leveraged financial instruments, has helped spark a lively debate on these questions. **********To the individual investor, mainstream securities have had a somewhat traditional pecking order regarding risk. Government Treasury bonds and bills have often been perceived as the safest (assuming a stable government), followed by bank deposits, investment-grade bonds, equities, and finally noninvestment-grade bonds. Some fortunes were made in the 1980s by those who believed that, generally speaking, junk bonds, as noninvestment-grade bonds are known, were not as risky as most people thought. **********Many professional investors, however, when asked what the term ""risk"" means to them, reply with a question: ""From whose point of view?"" **********""To the retail investor, risk means the probability of losing money,"" said Trevor Robinson, head of derivatives at Fidelity International in London. ""But that's not usually what risk means to a traditional fund manager who is managing his money."" **********Mr. Robinson cited the example of a fund manager who runs a fund linked to a particular benchmark, such as a stock index or industrial sector. The manager might decide that he doesn't particularly like the market's prospects and elect to keep, say, 20 percent of the fund in cash. To him, risk means not being fully invested if the market continues to go up. **********Moreover, added Mr. Robinson, that fund manager sees his job as beating the benchmark. If the market is down by 25 percent and the fund is only down by 15 percent, accolades might be coming the manager's way from superiors. But no kudos are likely to come from the retail investor. **********""In that case,"" said Mr. Robinson, ""the fund manager can say, 'Look, I've beaten the index by 10 percent, so I've done a good job.' But the investor might reply, 'You've lost 15 percent of my money!'"" **********There are, of course, textbook- type definitions of risk. Of these, perhaps the most frequently used by professional investors is the so- called Sharpe ratio, which is a statistical measure of an investment's return relative to the degree of risk undertaken. Essentially, the Sharpe ratio is found through dividing the annualized rate of return over a fixed period, minus the risk-free rate, by the annualized standard deviation of returns. A three-year time frame is often used to take changing investment climates into account. **********Some analysts put a good deal of faith in such statistical approaches to measuring risk. This year for the first time, the London-based fund tracking firm Micropal calculated the winners of its annual performance awards using risk-adjusted returns that were calculated with a formula similar but not identical to the Sharpe ratio. **********But measuring risk by previous performance opens the doors to the murky realm of how much the past has to do with the future. In many cases, say analysts, there is little, if any correlation. **********""Sometimes the past is meaningful and sometimes it's not,"" said Bruce Johnson, head of global research at Baring Securities in London. ""I wouldn't, for example, look at what German companies were doing five years ago relative to the future because things in Germany have changed."" **********Mr. Johnson said that in assessing the risk of a fund, he would first look at its total return over a period of time and the degree to which the return varied. **********""But you also have to look at the stability of that ratio,"" he said. ""If it is stable, then I would consider past performance as relating to future performance."" **********Perhaps equally chancy as determining future risk by past performance is trying to decide which types of risk are ""real"" and which, in the sense of that nebulous force known as market sentiment, are ""perceived."" Take, for example, the way in which investors perceive the risk factor of bonds rated Triple-A versus those rated Triple-B. In times of a bull market, investors are often less concerned about risk and are less willing to pay a high premium for the high-quality bond. In a bear market, however, investors typically are more willing to pay the premium and, moreover, expect a larger discount for the lower quality bond. **********The perceived risk, of course, in the context of the bull or bear climate, could turn out to have no basis in reality if the market ends up defying prevailing sentiment. ""There are usually gains to be made by understanding that investors might generally be too relaxed or too nervous about a given market situation,"" said Mr. Johnson. **********Didier Varlet, chief executive of Chicago-based Carr Asset Management, a derivatives management subsidiary of Banque Indosuez, said risk is the first thing he considers when taking a market position, before even estimating possible returns. He also said that a large element of what he thinks of as risk depends upon the size of the portfolio. **********For the small investor, however, most experts say that managing risk is chiefly a matter of diversification. ""Investing across different markets is an incredibly valuable risk-management tool for the individual investor,"" said Clifford W. Smith Jr., a finance professor at the University of Rochester who spoke at a recent conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where the pros and cons of derivatives were debated. **********Mr. Smith continued: ""He should be thinking about degrees of exposure to equity and fixed- income securities, and then, what kind of mix he wants across different equity markets like the United States, Europe and Asia. And mutual funds are likely to be the most attractive vehicle."""

But in a statement today, the negotiator, Manuel Camacho Solis, said that in a few days the rebels would respond to a list of 32 proposals made by the Government two months ago. **********The dramatic face-to-face meeting between Mr. Camacho and the rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos comes amid growing political and social unrest in Mexico. **********While more than three months have gone by without reports of fighting between the rebels' Zapatista National Liberation Army and more than 10,000 federal troops in Chiapas, a southern state, the delays in getting both sides back to the negotiating table have raised concerns about how long the cease-fire can hold. **********The mediator, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia of San Cristobal de las Casas, said in today's communique that he was worried about ""events that could present obstacles to the process of peace,"" but that he was heartened to see the dialogue continuing. **********Mr. Camacho and Bishop Ruiz, accompanied by two members of Mr. Camacho's staff, left San Cristobal at 3:45 A.M. and drove six hours in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to Guadalupe Tepeyac, a rebel stronghold near the Guatemalan border. **********The Zapatistas had prepared a small cabin with a table and chairs and placed the hut under heavy guard. The rebels and local residents had also staged demonstrations before the meeting to press their demands. **********Mr. Camacho met with Subcommander Marcos and 10 members of the Zapatistas' executive committee, who will decide whether to accept the conditions offered by the Government in March to end the uprising. **********The Government agreed to 32 Zapatista demands for social programs, public works projects and more political access. The Zapatistas then returned to their mountain hideouts to consult with residents. That process was suspended in late March after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the leading presidential candidate; the Zapatistas feared the killing was a prelude to a resumption in the fighting."

More Exports? Free Farms' Idle Acres"," **********HOWEVER heated the debate over GATT becomes, everyone agrees that the stakes in the Congressional vote next month will be high. But, in fact, for one group the treaty may mean much less than it might: American farmers. For with or without the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, our misguided domestic policies insure that farmers will continue to see their share of the global market shrink. **********This is no small matter. Since 1982, worldwide consumption of agricultural products has increased by nearly 13 percent, from 3.26 billion metric tons to 3.67 billion. And when global population doubles in the next 50 years, this massive market is expected to triple, as growing living standards in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America raise consumption per person. **********But, despite our productive land and advanced agricultural technology, American farm exports have fallen, from 187 million metric tons in 1982 to 147 million in 1993. The future? It looks as bleak as the past, and for the same reason: Longstanding policies, with goals as varied as protectionism, income maintenance and conservation, force millions of our farm acres into idleness. **********Two major culprits are the Agriculture Department's acreage-reduction, or set-aside, programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. On average, these programs idle more than 15 percent of farmland each year; the latter program alone shelves 36 million acres. **********To appreciate this, imagine if, as global demand burgeoned, the Government reduced the computer industry's capacity by 15 percent each and every year! **********Then there is the Export Enhancement Program, which is intended to subsidize and thus help farm exports. But besides its conflict with the free-trade principles of GATT, the program actually depresses world prices, undermining certain export markets and harming the nation with the greatest export growth potential -- the United States. **********Many of these programs have noble intentions. The acreage set-asides, for example, are attempts to stabilize farmers' notoriously variable incomes. And the conservation program aims to protect erodible cropland by paying rent to farmers for land idled for 10 years. **********But as world markets grow, these goals must be re-examined. And the United States will have an opportunity to do just that next year, when the farm bill, which normally carries a five-year term, comes up for renewal in Congress. **********What must Congress do in 1995? First, eliminate the acreage-reduction programs. American farmers' income can be better assured by full access to the world's 6 billion people than by raising farm prices, through restricted supply, for America's 250 million consumers. The legislators must get rid of the Export Enhancement Program as well. **********And the conservation program must be sharply narrowed. Of its 36 million idle acres, 22 million have low danger of erosion, under the Agriculture Department's own classification system. Just 4 million acres are highly erodible, while 10 million acres fall somewhere in between. Much of this land can be returned to production, and on it practices like no-till plowing can be used to minimize the dangers of erosion. **********Such reforms will pay handsome returns. A recent study for the National Grain and Feed Foundation estimated that returning 38 million idle farm acres to use would increase gross farm revenue by $8 billion a year, or $4 billion net. Because stepped-up farm activity ripples far into the economy -- affecting seed, fertilizer and chemical companies; food processors and distributors; equipment makers and transporters, and the retail and service sectors -- this revenue can lift annual national income by nearly $29 billion and add 225,000 full-time jobs. **********United States negotiators fought hard to include farm products in GATT -- a first for the rules of international trade. But American farmers cannot exploit this pioneering accomplishment unless and until domestic farm policy is radically altered. And, even without GATT, the United States will not resume its position as breadbasket to the world until its own laws allow it to do so."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/11/business/the-executive-computer-from-novell-a-customer-designed-wordperfect-suite.html,Laurie Flynn,1994-09-11,,1356,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"The Executive Computer; From Novell, a Customer-Designed Wordperfect 'Suite'","The Executive Computer; From Novell, a Customer-Designed Wordperfect 'Suite'"," **********EVER since the software ""suite"" wars flared up two years ago, customers have embraced the idea of suites, or packages of programs, as a way to save money, even if it meant they would be buying some software they didn't need. After all, if they were getting five programs for the price of three, could they complain if they were using only four? **********But Novell Inc.'s newly acquired Wordperfect unit wants to change the rules of the game. **********Novell, currently third in a three-way contest with the Microsoft Corporation and the Lotus Development Corporation, plans to let customers design their own suites by selecting only those programs they actually need and then paying a reduced price for having bought them together. Customers may still get, for example, five programs for the price any three of them would total separately, but they will also be allowed to choose exactly which ones they want. And the more they buy, the better the deal will be. **********The strategy, which Novell's Wordperfect group will initiate later this year or in early 1995 with a version of its suite on a CD-ROM called Perfect office Select, has sparked a debate in the software business between some industry executives who see the start of a trend and those who see a desperate marketing ploy by a last-place contender. **********Although Novell is the leader in network software for linking desktop computers, its Windows applications software, which now includes the Wordperfect word processor and the Quattro Pro spreadsheet acquired from Borland, trails products like Microsoft's Excel and Word for Windows and Lotus's 1-2-3. Novell says its new suite strategy is simply a solution to a widely recognized customer problem. **********""Customers were telling us, 'I don't like some vendor telling me what to buy,' "" said Glen Mella, vice president of marketing for business applications in Novell's Wordperfect group, based in Provo, Utah. **********Software suites typically include anywhere from four to eight programs for about half the price of what it would cost to buy the programs separately. **********For example, the estimated selling price of Microsoft Office, with four programs, is $500; a user would pay almost $1,100 for the programs separately. Likewise, the $795 suggested retail price of Lotus's Smartsuite is less than half the regular price of the separate components. ( A new version of Smartsuite is selling for as little as $200 for a short time because of a special promotion.) The suggested retail price of the floppy-disk version of Novell's Perfectoffice standard edition, with six full programs, will be $659 (or $299 as an upgrade). Perfectoffice is the major overhaul of Wordperfect's suite offering that the company will release in the fourth quarter. **********The CD-ROM version of Perfect office will including the eight major applications that make up the Per fectoffice professional edition. Besides the standard programs, like word processing, spreadsheet, data base and presentations, it will include roughly 20 programs from third-party developers, like templates and dictionaries for law offices and other industries, Mr. Mella said. The CD-ROM will also include a chart comparing the suite price with the cost of buying the programs separately. **********Customers may select the programs they want and order them through an ""800"" number. But instead of shipping the customer a shrink-wrapped copy of the program complete with printed documentation, Wordperfect will supply an authorization code that the customer uses to ""unlock"" the software and install it right off the Select CD-ROM, a plan similar to the many try-before-you-buy CD-ROM's available from some computer companies and software distributors. **********""You've got discovery, evaluation and purchase all at the same time,"" Mr. Mella said. **********Regardless of whether this roll-your-own approach takes off, nobody is disputing the advantages of distributing software on a CD-ROM. The silvery disks can each hold 660 megabytes of data -- the equivalent of about 450 floppy disks. A single CD-ROM can hold 100 or more programs. **********In fact, many companies are already making heavy use of CD-ROM distribution. Microsoft started selling a CD-ROM version of Office in July, and sold 30,000 to 40,000 copies the first month. Lotus will sell a CD-ROM version of Smartsuite this fall. **********And according to Pete Higgins, senior vice president of desktop applications at Microsoft, the company is considering offering third-party software on its CD-ROM products as well, possibly even using unlocking schemes. **********""Any unused space on a CD is a merchandising opportunity,"" Mr. Higgins said. But, he said, Microsoft does not intend to use CD-ROM's as a means of offering customized suites. **********To Wordperfect's competitors, the company's new marketing plan misses the point. Microsoft and Lotus executives argue that Wordperfect's roll-your-own strategy is at odds with one of the major principles of suites -- that customers benefit from using an entire collection of programs from one company that are designed to work together, with a common interface and techniques for sharing data among the programs. A suite should be viewed not as collection of separate applications but as one big, homogeneous program, they say. **********""The office suite is about consistency and integration,"" Mr. Higgins said. Suites make it easy to share data among the various programs, which each have a similar look-and-feel. (And, for example, each one has a central control panel -- called MOM by Microsoft, for Microsoft Office manager, and DAD by Novell, for desktop application director.) **********Mr. Higgins said Microsoft has no plans to offer roll-your-own suites soon, and with 80 percent of the market for suite software, it appears to be in no hurry to alter its strategy. Wordperfect, on the other hand, with only about 5 percent of the market, is scrambling to differentiate its offering, some analysts said. **********""When you're Wordperfect, you can afford to be radical,"" said Dwight Davis, editor of Windows Watcher, an industry newsletter near Microsoft's home in Redmond, Wash. ""Anything they can do to cut into Microsoft's lead is probably worth it."" **********Still, many industry observers and customers say the build-it-yourself suite could not have arrived too soon. **********""Why do we want 75 copies of Quattro Pro if only four people are going to use it?"" said Eric Goldreich, director of information systems at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, a large Los Angeles law firm with about 500 PC's. The firm started buying software on CD-ROM long ago, including individual programs from Wordperfect, and so is prepared to take advantage of the Wordperfect strategy of assembling suites from a CD-ROM package. **********""It solves a customer problem,"" said David Coursey, editor of PC Letter, an industry newsletter in San Mateo, Calif. ""You buy a suite today, and you get a bunch of software you just don't want. The world would be a better place if everybody did this."" **********But executives at Novell and Lotus dispute the notion that a large number of applications within suites are going unused. Microsoft contends that 75 percent of its suite customers use the presentations component, the least-popular application in the suite. Lotus also says that, over time, the majority of its suite customers use most of what they've paid for. **********""I think customers eventually evolve to using the full suite, though initially they might not,"" said John O'Loughlin, marketing manager for multimedia technology at Lotus. **********Distribution aside, the suite wars continue to heat up. Last month, Lotus released a major new edition of its Smartsuite program for Windows that is more closely tied to its Notes groupware program. The package, version 3.0, also includes new versions of 1-2-3 and the Approach data base. Microsoft released a new version of Microsoft Office this spring, and in the fall will deliver new versions for Windows NT and Macintosh. **********The soaring popularity of suites shows no sign of abating -- the category remains the fastest-growing segment of business software. Suite sales amounted to nearly $1 billion last year and are expected to grow 25 percent to 30 percent annually the next three years. Perhaps by then, Novell will have convinced the software industry that even a custom suite is still a suite."

Lewis's unused office is a Hollywood vision of corporate grandeur. The bright Persian rug, fortress of a desk and trunk-like humidor of Monte Cristo cigars bespeak wealth and power. Outside the floor-to-ceiling window, Central Park, in all its fall glory, seems to rush in. **********Mr. Lewis's office is a mere shrine these days, though; a new chief executive has settled into more utilitarian digs at the far end of the building. Here, nearly two years after her husband died of brain cancer at 50, Loida Nicolas Lewis has taken the helm of the company he built, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. **********It has been an eventful year for Loida Lewis. At first she was unsure how much corporate control she wanted, and until this month she declined to give interviews. But with strong financial results under her belt, and a book about her husband in the stores, she is stepping into the open. The book, ""Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?"" (Wiley), is an autobiography that was completed, by Blair Walker, after Mr. Lewis's death. **********And now that she has stepped forward, Mrs. Lewis is willing to talk of her successes since replacing Jean Fugett Jr., Mr. Lewis's half-brother, who ran the company last year. ""When I just came in,"" she said, in a pronounced Filipino accent, ""my consultants said you can't raise $20 million in bridge loans. But we did it in a month. When we wanted to sell the corporate plane, they bet me that our prospective buyer didn't have the money to close. But he paid us $14 million."" **********Since becoming chairwoman in February and chief executive in July, Mrs. Lewis has also quickly sold several subpar subsidiaries, slashed the staff and size of her Manhattan headquarters and hired a new chief financial officer. And just last month she oversaw the refinancing of a $170 million bank loan. **********To remind those around her of this winning streak, Mrs. Lewis uses a graphic yet good-natured scorecard. She has stuck a half-dozen $10 bills in the frame of a painting on her office wall -- winnings, she said, from colleagues who had doubted her. **********Still, not all the doubters have disappeared. Some analysts and shareholders remain leery of her qualifications -- she is an immigration lawyer with no formal business background -- to run TLC Beatrice, a European-based food manufacturing and retailing company. A good part of the company's recent financial results, the skeptics say, can be attributed to a rebound of the European economy.Battling With Dissidents **********And while Mrs. Lewis has calmed at least some minority stockholders, who were shaken by her husband's death and disclosures about the rocky condition of the company's business, she is now embroiled in a bitter lawsuit with one stockholder group, Carlton Investments, over the amount of Mr. Lewis's past compensation. The group, which originally included Michael Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bankers, was key to the financing of TLC, the product of a 1987 leveraged buyout of the foreign businesses of the Beatrice Companies. Mrs. Lewis says the suit is a subterfuge; what the investors really want, she says, is to cash out of the private company by forcing an ill-timed initial public offering or a sale of valuable assets. Representatives of Carlton declined to comment on her charge. **********The fortunes of TLC Beatrice have been closely watched ever since the buyout, the largest ever of an American company with all its assets abroad and one that created the country's largest black-owned business. Based on cash flow, TLC has a market value of $729 million, said David Wells, an analyst at Bear Stearns. **********TLC -- which stands for The Lewis Company -- now has 16 subsidiaries in Western Europe with a workforce of 4,500. Its gems are its wholesale grocery operation and two French convenience-store chains, Franprix and Leader Price. Dennis Jones, executive vice president for operations, estimates that 1994 revenues will hit $1.6 billion. **********IN 1992, the year before Mr. Lewis died, his net worth was put at $400 million. Mrs. Lewis, 51, and her daughter Leslie, a college senior, control 48 percent of the shares, from Mr. Lewis's estate, and altogether the family controls just over 50 percent. Because of Leslie's interest, both women still call the company black-owned. The publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, Earl Graves Sr., agrees, saying that the board ""is African American for the most part, the people Mrs. Lewis surrounds herself with are black."" **********At a celebrity-studded reception last month at TLC's headquarters on West 57th Street, held to mark the publication of the autobiography, Mrs. Lewis said her husband had proven that people of color could scale the heights in business. He was her ""first and only beloved,"" she said later, impishly advising her guests to ""read all about it in Chapter 6."" In an interview later, she vowed never to remarry. **********Loida Lewis took a painful route to the top, starting in January 1993, when her husband died the day after the company announced that he had slipped into a coma. A week earlier, Mr. Lewis had named Mr. Fugett to head the company. **********""We needed someone right away so the minority shareholders wouldn't think things were going down the tubes,"" said Lee Archer, a long-time director. According to Mr. Archer, Mr. Fugett was to remain in charge only ""until Mrs. Lewis could get emotionally together to tell us how she wanted the company run."" Mrs. Lewis, a devout Catholic who these days opens board meetings with a prayer, remained in mourning for nearly a year. **********By September 1993, though, TLC Beatrice was running into trouble. The European consumer market was gasping through a prolonged recession. And while Mr. Fugett made some changes, a mutiny by the company's private shareholders hastened his exit. **********One problem was the company's secrecy. In the summer of 1993, many shareholders opened newspapers to find that Mr. Fugett wanted to acquire the Baltimore Orioles, a puzzling stretch for a food company. Mrs. Lewis will not comment on that idea, which was eventually dropped. **********Soon after, jumpy investors got another shock. Beatrice had just approached the bond market for $150 million, requiring it to open its books. Suddenly Wall Street found out not only that Mr. Lewis had been paid $22 million in bonuses in the previous five years but that TLC had sizable losses and cash-flow problems. Quicker than a New York minute, several shareholder groups demanded that the stock be taken public, on the theory that the market would make it liquid enough to pick up some value. **********Partly as a result, Mr. Fugett soon handed the reins to Mrs. Lewis. There was speculation at the time that Mr. Fugett was urged to leave by his brother, Anthony, a TLC director, and by Frank E. Richardson, another director, president of Wesray Capital. **********Mrs. Lewis tells it differently, saying that she and Mr. Fugett, who owns no TLC shares, had various talks about her future role. Then, before an executive committee meeting in December, she says she prayed, and later phoned Mr. Fugett and said, ""Jean, I'm ready."" She says he told her, ""Loida, it's yours to take."" **********There was, she said, no boardroom drama -- ""it was all very cordial."" (Mr. Fugett did not respond to requests for an interview.) **********Gerry Schwartz, who bought the Beatrice Canada division from Reginald Lewis, said, ""She was not only a wonderful wife, she was a business partner. She sat in on many meetings, and she understood his strategy. It's her family's money at stake. She understands the business. Why shouldn't she step in and run the company?"" **********WHEN she took over, it was a wrenching decision for the family, but it prompted Carlton Investments, the largest nonfamily shareholder group, to withdraw its demand that the group's shares be offered publicly. As part of TLC's original stockholders' agreement, Carlton had the right to demand a limited offering, which generally makes the stock harder to trade than an offering of all of a company's shares. **********Mr. Milken, who was part of Carlton, not only financed the 1987 buyout through Drexel but also provided Mr. Lewis with the credibility he needed to persuade Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, then the owner of the Beatrice Companies, that he could handle the deal. In return, Mr. Milken and other former Drexel partners received 26 percent of TLC Beatrice's equity. **********Mr. Lewis paid Kohlberg, Kravis $985 million for Beatrice International, which consisted of 64 companies outside the United States. Bea trice's domestic businesses were sold to Conagra. **********Mrs. Lewis's defusing of that initial insider revolt might well have stood as her main accomplishment this year, but in May, Carlton brought a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court asserting that the $22 million in payments to Mr. Lewis were ""in flagrant violation"" of the stockholders' agreement. **********Mr. Milken was not consulted about the lawsuit and has distanced himself from the matter by separating his assets from Carlton's. Since he was released from prison last year, after serving time for securities-law violations, he has been battling prostate cancer -- so far, successfully. ""I'm not familiar with the lawsuit,"" he said in a recent interview. ""Life is too short to get into these types of disputes."" **********Paul Biddelman, one of four directors of Carlton's general partner, the CS Manager Corporation, as well as a TLC director, said that while Mr. Milken can do what he wants, Carlton must make decisions on behalf of some 150 former Drexel employees in the partnership. **********But TLC executives assert that Mr. Lewis asked his board for payment to compensate him for hands-on managing he never expected to have to do. Expecting to be just the owner, he also became chief executive. ""Reg Lewis stopped everything else he was doing,"" said Reynaldo P. Glover, TLC's general counsel. ""He moved his entire family to France. He ran around Europe to see that his division managers were developing budgets, planning for growth, seeing that sales plans were on target. He earned the payment."" **********ON a recent evening, Mrs. Lewis met with a visitor in her Upper East Side co-op. From the immense living room, decorated in 18th-century French style, the skyscraper housing the TLC headquarters was visible to the south. At a mention of the lawsuit, Mrs. Lewis responded firmly, yet calmly. ""They're trying to pressure me to follow what they want for their exit strategy,"" she said. ""We have tried several times to come to common ground, and it's always no go."" Her spokesman, Rene S. Meily, called Carlton's suit an attempt to ""tarnish"" Mr. Lewis's memory. **********For Loida Lewis, after a nearly 25-year marriage, that memory is always palpable. Born and raised in the Philippines, Loida Nicolas first visited New York on a 1968 trip that was a gift from her father after she passed the bar exam. While here, she took a job briefly with Mr. Glover. He nudged her into a blind date with Mr. Lewis, then an associate at a Wall Street law firm. **********They were married in 1969 and had two daughters, Leslie and Christina. While the girls were small, Mrs. Lewis published a magazine for Filipinos in the United States that detailed how President Ferdinand Marcos was violating Filipinos' human rights. **********In 1974, Mrs. Lewis tried and failed to get a job in the New York office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. She later learned that her qualifications exceeded those of the applicants hired. In 1979, she won a protracted discrimination lawsuit, then worked as a lawyer for the agency for 11 years. During that time, she also wrote three books on immigration law. **********ALTHOUGH she has never run a company before, Mrs. Lewis insists she is not at a loss for experience. ""I had the best tutor, Reginald Lewis,"" she said. And there was business in her background, too: her father founded Nicfur, a successful Philippine furniture-store chain. **********Even so, the pert, stately Mrs. Lewis has a persona more akin to a diplomat than a corporate chieftain. These days, she spends about half of each month in Europe. She maintains a home in Paris, and hops between plants and stores in Ireland, the Canary Islands, Spain and five other countries to meet with TLC managers. Her key advisers are Mr. Glover; Carl Brody, a senior vice president, and her sister, Imelda Nicolas, her executive assistant. **********The president of her retail and wholesale operations in France, Daniel Jux, says her amiable formality serves her well. ""The greatest comment about Mrs. Lewis is her common sense, her knowledge of European habits and her ability to talk the local languages,"" he said. ""Mr. Lewis was really an L.B.O. man. She is in a position to run the post-L.B.O. business."" **********In the third quarter, her first full one as chief executive, net income rose 29 percent, to $9.2 million. And in the last nine months, with her essentially running things as chairwoman, net income rose 46 percent, to $15.4 million. **********Despite those numbers, not everyone is convinced. ""I'm not sure that she is qualified to run the business,"" said Sally Overstreet, an analyst at Jefferies & Company. **********Others are a bit more sanguine. ""The jury is still out, but we're happy so far,"" said Gerald Unterman, whose GEM Capital Management oversees more than 300,000 TLC shares. Mr. Unterman and some analysts feel that the company stock, now trading on the private-placement market at about $40 a share, down from $50 in January, is undervalued by perhaps 50 percent. Mr. Unterman expects that next year, to lift shareholder value, there will be an initial public offering or a spinoff of a division to shareholders. **********Mrs. Lewis said she wants to wait to make an offering until the time is right, and she can push performance, just as her late husband did. ""You saw what happened to my companies that were nonperforming,"" she warned -- then, almost surprised by her own honesty, she burst into laughter. **********Next month, she will disclose to her board a report from McKinsey & Company that sets out a plan to open 450 more stores in France within two years, less than half the time her officers were planning on. The company now has 572 stores there. She even envisions opening discount convenience stores in America one day. ""I've had one good quarter,"" she said. ""I'm not beating my breast. Give me three quarters, until July. Then let my shareholders judge me. **********""Go for the stars,"" she said. ""That was a favorite expression of Mr. Lewis.""Loida Nicolas Lewis  Born: Dec. 23, 1942; Sorsogon, the Philippines. Education: St. Theresa's College, Manila; law degree, University of Philippines.

He identified his partners as the Zullig Financial Group of Switzerland and four Mexican investors, whom he did not name. **********His decision to pull out did not come as a surprise here. Mexican analysts believe that financial institutions were unwilling to lend Mr. Dominguez the money needed to complete the transaction because he had severely overextended himself on the deal. **********Mr. Dominguez's seven-year-old company, DSC Ingenieria Inmobiliaria, is primarily involved in residential construction in Mexico. It also runs the small Qualton hotel chain, a travel agency and a few hardware stores. **********When he announced on Feb. 14 that he would buy 74 Westin hotels in the United States, Mexico, South America and Europe for $708 million, Mr. Dominguez was portrayed as a brash new kind of Mexican businessman. His purchase of an international hotel chain, a month and a half after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, was seen as an indication that Mexican businesses would not be content simply to be acquired by others. **********But financial analysts here said Mr. Dominguez may have acted too aggressively and had not built up sufficient confidence among Mexican and United States financial institutions to get the money he needed to buy Westin. The skepticism about his ability to close the deal was strengthened by a widespread belief that he was overpaying for Westin in offering the owner, Aoki of Japan, its full asking price, or close to it, while most bids were hundreds of millions of dollars lower. **********In an interview at the time, Mr. Dominguez said he considered the Westin hotels a long-term investment that would greatly appreciate with time. **********Analysts now say that his high purchase price may have made it impossible for the hotels to produce the kind of returns that would have made his investment profitable, especially as interest rates in the United States kept rising. **********Aoki bought the entire hotel chain for $1.53 billion in 1988 but had trouble carrying the debt. Its deal with Mr. Dominguez did not include 14 Westin hotels in Asia and 6 in Canada. **********The purchase was supposed to have been completed by June. Mr. Dominguez's lawyers could not say whether he would have to pay a penalty or to surrender his deposit for failing to complete the deal."

Sophisticated software, secretly planted on various computers throughout the Internet, has allowed unknown intruders to steal passwords and electronic addresses from legitimate users, computer security experts said yesterday. **********Although there were apparently no reports of significant damage to big computer systems on the Internet, and although similar attempts to breach Internet security systems have been fairly common in the past, the sheer volume of the reported security violations caused alarm among some computer administrators. The attacks also underscored the vulnerability of computer networks at a time when more and more companies and consumers have begun using them to communicate and conduct business. **********""This potentially affects tens of thousands of computer accounts,"" said Terry McGillen, a spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response Team, a group of security experts at Carnegie-Mellon University that serves as a clearinghouse for Internet security issues. ""We now know that an unknown number of intruders have the information they need to get access to thousands of additional computers, including entire networks."" **********In theory, the intruders could use the stolen information to gain access to government, educational, commercial and private files on unprotected computers connected to the Internet. Depending on the type of password captured, an intruder could also damage, alter or erase files shared by thousands of users on a network. **********Security experts say it is impossible to assess the motives of the intruders, but the attacks will force thousands of computer system administrators to do the costly and time-consuming work of inspecting and cleaning their systems. **********Officials of the response team declined to name specific institutions affected by the break-ins, although the University of Texas and Rice University were among the organizations that identified themselves as having found evidence of the intruders. The response team said last night that reports were still being analyzed to determine whether the intruders had used the captured passwords with malicious intent, or whether they were merely pranksters trying to ""crack"" the system. **********The organization advised computer administrators to review their systems and to make sure users changed their passwords frequently. **********Some computer security officials said that because of previous security problems on the network, the latest wave of break-ins posed little real risk to sensitive information. **********""Most prudent organizations no longer keep sensitive or classified information on any computer attached to the Internet,"" said David Fisher, computer security manager for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. He said NASA had not experienced any unusual increase in computer security violations in recent days.  'Trojan Horse' Program **********According to a response team advisory sent to Internet computer sites late Thursday night, the latest wave of attacks involves a ""Trojan horse"" program that primarily affects certain versions of computer operating system software produced by Sun Microsystems Inc. and Solbourne Computer Inc. **********A Trojan-horse program appears to be harmless to a casual observer -- if it is noticed at all. But it contains a more sinister program that in this case secretly captures the password and account information for anyone trying to gain access to the computer from a remote site. The information is stored and can be retrieved later by the person who planted the Trojan horse program in the computer. **********The technique has been used to steal information on the Internet since the mid-1980's, said Cliff Stoll, an astrophysicist and author in Oakland, Calif., who discovered such a scheme, conducted by East German spies, on computers used by United States Government researchers. He recounted the tale in the book ""The Cuckoo's Egg."" **********Mr. Stoll said the current outbreak was apparently more widespread than anything in the past."

Vitner, economist at the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., noting that orders for capital goods were 14.7 percent above those of October 1993. ""I just don't see the slowdown out there."" **********Another skeptic was Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. Factories are ""very much alive and well,"" he said, noting that durables figures are highly erratic and that main sectors that fell in October -- transportation and the military -- had surged in preceding months. **********Separately, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits were unchanged at 326,000 in the week ended last Saturday, with the four-week average edging up 500, to 326,750. **********And the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence eased to 91.6 in November from 92.7 last month, according to subscribers to its survey. **********The report on durable goods, products made to last at least three years, was dominated by a 9.4 percent drop for transportation orders. But analysts said this was not a sign of real weakness because of various production problems in the auto industry, where, because vehicles can be turned out virtually on demand, there is no distinction between orders and shipments. **********Transportation equipment was about unchanged in September but had soared 20.1 percent in August. Excluding transportation, orders for durables climbed 1.1 percent in October. **********Similarly, military orders slumped 16.9 percent in October, the first month of the new fiscal year, after gains of 11.6 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, in September and August. **********Not counting this sector, durable goods would have fallen eight-tenths of 1 percent, the report showed. **********But the other major categories all posted gains, albeit fractional ones -- industrial machinery eight-tenths of 1 percent, electronic equipment five-tenths of 1 percent and primary metals three-tenths of 1 percent. **********For capital goods alone, new orders fell 5 percent but this drop was pared to 2.9 percent, mainly reflecting communications equipment, when the military is excluded and to four-tenths of 1 percent when both the military and the aircraft and parts categories are excluded. **********Shipments of durables last month fell 1.2 percent, the second straight decline and the third in four months, but this also reflected the big decline in auto production. **********Unfilled orders edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, to $424.8 billion, the report also showed, with industrial machinery up 2 percent and primary metals up 3.4 percent. **********Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, pointing to a 1.7 percent advance in unfilled orders for nonmilitary capital goods other than aircraft, said this indicated ""growing backlog problems in the manufacturing sector of the economy and continued momentum going forward."" **********On the other hand, Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said the decline in orders ""clearly indicates the economy is slowing down."""

""The bond market is worried that the Fed will raise rates again and the bond market is uppermost in everybody's mind."" **********On May 17, the Federal Reserve's policy-making council is scheduled to meet and many analysts expect another increase in short-term interest rates at that time. The Fed has already raised its short-term interest rate target, which is now 3.75 percent, three times this year. **********Yesterday bond prices dropped for the fourth consecutive trading session and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction correspondingly increased to 7.35 percent, from 7.33 percent on Monday. **********The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,714.41, up 13.39 points.  ""There is a general flight to industrial stocks during periods of recovery from a recession,"" Mr. Ehrenkrantz added. ""The Dow is now leading the market."" **********In contrast, the broader Nasdaq composite index fell 1.31 points, to 739.37 and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks barely closed on the upside with a 0.01 point gain to 453.03. Declining stocks on the New York Stock Exchange topped advancers by 1,112 to 993. Volume totaled 288.5 million shares, down slightly from the 297.1 million shares changing hands Monday. **********For the second straight session, drug stocks were strong. Two major transactions were announced yesterday -- SmithKline Beecham buying the drug distribution unit of United Healthcare and Pfizer and Value Health forming a joint venture -- on the heels of the acquisition of Syntex by Roche Holding, which was announced Monday. As a result, drug companies that might participate in other consolidations rallied, including Eli Lilly, up 1 3/8, to 53, and Upjohn, up 3/8, to 28 7/8. **********Gains were also posted by cable stocks, fueled by heightened takeover rumors involving Time Warner, which rose 3 3/8, to 40. Among the cable companies closing on the upside were Tele-Communications A, which advanced 1 1/8, to 20 5/8, and Comcast, which increased 1 5/16 , to 17 5/16 . **********But interest-rate-sensitive utility stocks were weak, as evidenced by the 1.06-point decline in the Dow Jones utility average. Northern States Power fell 1/4, to 41 3/8; Duke Power fell 1/4, to 36 3/8, and Pacific Gas and Electric declined 3/4, to 25 3/8. **********Some of the tobacco stocks were affected adversely by a report that manufacturers could face greater liability in Florida for the cost of treating smoking-related ailments if it becomes easier for the state to recover some of its Medicaid costs. For instance, Philip Morris was off 1/2, to 53 1/2. **********Eastman Kodak advanced 1 3/8, to 46 1/8, after it formally announced that it will sell its pharmaceutical subsidiary and two other divisions to improve its financial performance. On Monday, Kodak rose another 3 1/4 on indications that such a divestiture would occur. **********However, Valence Technology, a battery-technology company, sank 4 1/4, to 5 1/4, after it announced a review of its 1992 purchase agreement with Motorola. Cobra Industries, a recreational vehicle manufacturer, declined 5/8, to 5, following a sharp drop in first-quarter profits. And TRM Copy Centers, which operates self-service photocopiers in retail stores, fell 2, to 6 3/4, also as a result of a lower earnings report."

Haft, patriarch of the feuding family that once controlled a vast empire of discount bookstores and drugstores, filed suit today against one of his sons, Ronald S. Haft, charging that he took part in a plan to misappropriate at least $7 million from him. **********The suit, filed in Superior Court of the District of Columbia, names Ronald Haft and Donald Bourassa, an executive of Combined Properties Inc., the family's privately held land management company. **********It accuses them of a variety of illegal activities, ""including securities violations, misappropriation of funds, and breach of fiduciary responsibility,"" said Mike Sitrick, a spokesman for Herbert Haft. Mr. Haft contended that the two had issued securities illegally and the suit asked that the securities be returned to Combined Properties. **********Mr. Bourassa and Ronald Haft could not be reached for comment today; Ronald Haft's lawyer, Steven Snider, said, ""The allegations in the suit are false and will be proven to be false."" **********The Haft family controls the Dart Group, a public company that owns large stakes in Crown Books, Trak Auto, Shoppers Food Warehouse and Total Beverage. Herbert Haft created his family empire from a single discount drugstore in Washington and went on to create Crown Books with another son, Robert, based on the latter's thesis written at Harvard Business School. **********Father and son began feuding late this summer, with Ronald helping to depose his father on Sept. 3 as chairman of Combined Properties, one of Washington's most lucrative commercial real estate companies. Ronald had been his father's only family ally in an earlier family dispute with Herbert Haft's wife, Gloria, his daughter, Linda, and older son Robert. **********That dispute involved Herbert Haft's ouster of Robert from Dart Group, the senior Mr. Haft's wife and daughter taking Robert Haft's side. A May settlement, in which Mr. Haft and his wife were divorced, was supposed to have brought peace. **********""I'd like to sit down and work this out with Ronald, but Ronald has refused to sit, so I just don't know what to do,"" the senior Mr. Haft said today."

With a raft of elections and sometimes a multitude of parties, their governments are beginning to tolerate a once forbidden sound -- that of the political opponent. **********Already the drive for political rights south of the Sahara has consigned the archetypal autocrat -- the ""president for life"" who rules with a fly whisk and a squadron of secret police -- to the same graveyard as apartheid, African socialism and the ships that brought the first European colonizers 500 years ago. **********But what lies ahead is uncertain. The trend toward reform is not uniform and certainly not universal. **********Most ominously, there are signs that in some countries political liberalization may be widening ethnic cleavages. These rivalries could touch off movements for secession or even lead to the kind of horrific tribal massacres convulsing Rwanda. **********A more open political process can lay bare ethnic tensions that have long simmered under the suppression of a dictator's boot. Having several political parties may mean that they will take on ethnic identities. And underneath all the rallies and hoopla of a campaign, there is the danger that groups may jostle for control or that a ruling minority will sense the risk of being turned out of power and resort to subversion and violence. **********A rise in ethnic tension, while part of the worldwide explosion of claims of sovereignty and self-determination in the post-cold-war era, is particularly dangerous in Africa, where the boundaries inherited from colonialism do not correspond to the areas inhabited by ethnic groups. **********The political ferment has unquestionably led to new freedoms. More than half of the 48 countries south of the Sahara have held or promised multiparty elections. Fifteen years ago, only two -- Nigeria and Kenya -- could be said to have had influential and independent newspapers. Now most have them. Groups to monitor human rights have sprung up everywhere, even in repressive countries like Zaire. **********Africans welcome these changes. They are glad to wave good-bye to the old world of one-man rule. It ended symbolically several weeks ago when Hastings Kamuzu Banda, the last surviving independence leader, shuffled off Malawi's stage, turned out by voters after running the country like a private preserve for 30 years. **********But conversations with scores of Africans in the course of a six-week trip to nine countries suggest that these changes are only a first step. Genuine democracy, they say, has yet to arrive in most countries. **********In some it has been stymied by the old power elite or hijacked by a new one. In others, the opposition is so fragmented -- sometimes into a plethora of parties following ethnic divisions -- that it is too ineffectual for the system to function. De facto single-party rule returns by default. **********""They say the newspapers are free, but a minister can still put a journalist in jail,"" said Halidou Ouedraogo, president of the Burkina Faso Movement for the Rights of Man. ""They say the courts are independent, but there are always pressures from behind the scenes. We still don't have real participation of the people at a grass-roots level. **********""Take Rwanda and Burundi. Both signed the International Convention for Protection and Defense of Human Rights. But look at the massacres. The gap between a piece of paper and what is reality can be frightening, truly frightening."" **********Significantly, the continent's political reform is proceeding under a giant question mark because it coincides with a downward economic plunge. Throughout the 1980's and into the 1990's, the vast majority of the countries -- with a few exceptions like diamond-producing Botswana -- experienced a decline in per capita production. **********This means that these nations are experimenting with bold new political ideas and structures at a time when living standards are dropping, health and education are declining and the people are consequently most prone to strikes, demonstrations and the appeals of demagogues. **********It is not lost on the experts that the country that has made the most economic progress, according to the World Bank, is Ghana and that it did so during the decade when it was under the tight military rule of Jerry J. Rawlings, who has since won election as President. Authoritarian rule makes it possible to impose the stringent measures that the international financial institutions demand. **********And what is sound economically may clash with what is politically sensible. In January, at the stroke of a pen, the value of the French-backed currency called the C.F.A. franc was cut in half. It was a move that most financial experts felt was long overdue, but overnight it destabilized 14 countries in West and Central Africa. The Alternatives Hope and Horror In Two Nations **********The imaginations of Africans everywhere, it is clear, have been seized by two seismic events in recent months. One is the election of President Nelson Mandela in South Africa. It was not just that Mr. Mandela triumphed in the last redoubt of white minority rule. It was that he welcomed his former foes, F. W. de Klerk and Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi, into his administration with open arms, providing an object lesson in the value of tolerating the opposition as a form of good, stable, even shrewd government. **********The other is Rwanda. To the outside world, the tribal massacres there were an inexplicable horror, an atavistic replaying of ancient hatreds. But to many Africans, there is another troubling aspect. **********The slaughter of Tutsi by Hutu represents what can happen when there is a dangerous brew and the lid is lifted off too quickly, they say. It is a parable of reform-minded change under the prodding of Western countries gone horribly wrong. **********Some assert that the West shares the blame by pushing for a democratic form of government that would inevitably mean power-sharing between the Tutsi, who had a privileged position during colonial days, and the more numerous Hutu, who were beginning to control the army. **********From the point of view of Western diplomats, talks involving regional governments held over the course of two years at Arusha, Tanzania, were aimed at smoothing out the differences between the two hostile groups by providing for such things as integration of the armed forces. But this is not the way some Africans perceive it. **********""The outside powers, Belgium, France, the U.S., they all exerted a lot of pressure on Rwanda,"" said Alberto Bento Ribeiro, the Angolan Ambassador to Zimbabwe. ""They wanted to get the Hutu into the power structure, to move them up in the army. All that upset the established order, which had Tutsi at the top. **********""Democracies can work in our countries only if the internal forces are allowed to work without outside manipulation,"" he concluded. **********Jonathan Moyo, a political scientist now working for the Ford Foundation in Nairobi, drew a parallel between Rwanda and white-ruled South Africa. ""The cruelty of the system of oppression is the same. When you set one group above another and close all channels of political expression, you sow the seeds of eruption further down the line. **********""The difference is, South Africa underwent a process of managed change. It started in 1986. If they had suddenly lifted the lid off back then, people would have been slaughtering each other, too. That's what happened in Rwanda -- it was too much too quickly for a system that had been totally closed. **********""Today the one-party structure is ending all over Africa and people demand elections within 21 days,"" Mr. Moyo said. ""The South Africa experience teaches us it should be done gradually by people of vision, allowing the structures to evolve and preaching values of tolerance the whole way.""  The Danger Ethnic Tensions Erupt Into Strife **********Everywhere, the point is the same: Africa cannot just transplant foreign models, like the parliamentary system, and hope it will take root in native soil. **********""It's a mistake to copy Western democracies because it's artificial,"" observed Cyril Goungounga, an engineer and national assembly deputy in Burkina Faso. ""Look at the U.S. You elect a President. He's in office for four years, eight years. Then he's out. That's what the Constitution says. **********""We have a Constitution too,"" he said. ""But it doesn't work. It's just a piece of paper. Because we have two civilizations here. The Western one on top where everything is fine and differences are submerged in talk of national unity. And a parallel one underneath, an African one, where ethnic groups are a reality."" **********The ""reality"" is readily apparent when it reaches the point of armed conflict. For decades, the conventional wisdom was that Africa was the scene of so many wars because the superpowers were fighting each other through their client states. But now that the superpowers have withdrawn their sponsorship, many of the conflicts are continuing. The reason, experts say, is that they have a strong ethnic component. **********In some countries, like Liberia and Somalia, ethnic turmoil followed victories by insurgents. In others, like Angola and southern Sudan, ideological differences have largely dropped away and the contending factions are becoming more sharply defined by ethnicity or religion. **********What's more, new outbreaks of tribal violence and ""ethnic cleansing"" are erupting in backwaters where foreigners rarely venture to tell the outside world about it -- places like eastern Zaire, northern Ghana, and northern Mali and Niger. **********Togo is a prime example of a country where the step toward democracy proved inflammatory. For years President Gnassingbe Eyadema based his dictatorial rule on his own group, the Kabye, from the north. Through clever manipulation, he has managed to cling to power through two elections by splintering and out-foxing the opposition, based largely on southern tribes like the Ewe. Now his dictatorship still reigns, and ethnic strife is so high that several hundred thousand people have fled to neighboring countries. **********Scholars point out that the ethnic divide has been there all along but sometimes was hidden. **********""Many military coups of the 1960's and 70's had an ethnically based component,"" said Donald L. Horowitz, author of ""Ethnic Groups in Conflict"" (University of California Press, 1985). ""After the coup, things settled down in a quieter pattern. It didn't mean ethnicity had been suppressed. It meant competition had been suppressed. So in the early 80's, it felt as if a lot of these conflicts had gone away while in fact they were simply driven underground."" **********Two countries are in fact experimenting with new political systems to try to overcome the legacy of ethnicity. **********One is Uganda, where President Yoweri Museveni, who came to power as head of a rebel military group in 1986, is deeply conscious of the country's agony of the last 23 years. The despotic regimes of both Idi Amin and Milton Obote were thinly disguised masks for tit-for-tat ethnic subjugation and slaughter. **********The 50-year-old President argues that multiparty systems were created by industrial societies and fit them because they tend to divide along fluid lines of class. But in pre-industrial Africa, countries split vertically, along rigid tribal lines, and so party competition can lead to group warfare. **********His broadly based National Resistance Movement suspended party politics and instead is trying to promulgate a system for grass-roots participation through ""national resistance councils."" It claims to be a sort of grand coalition, through critics charge it is a one-party state by another name. Voting was held in March to elect a constituent assembly. The delegates are largely supporters of the movement and may well decide to try the new system for five years and then hold a referendum. **********The opposite approach is unfolding in Ethiopia, where the Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, was overthrown in 1991. Ethiopia has long been an uneasy assemblage of regions dominated by distinct groups and under the sway of the Amhara in the center. In the north the Eritreans successfully prosecuted a 30-year war and became the only secessionist movement to achieve an independent state in Africa. **********The example has not been lost on other groups, like the Tigreans and the Oromo. Now temporarily under the fractious Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, Ethiopia appears to be headed toward a federal system with strong regional governments. By their very nature they would become avowedly ethnic -- another first for the continent.  The Legacy  Closing the Book On One-Man Rule **********The rush toward new democratic forms of rule has been called by Colin Legum, a British scholar and writer on Africa, a ""second independence."" The era of one-man rule that began when hastily constructed parliamentary regimes collapsed in the 1960's was widely conceded to be disastrous. **********Though these dictators managed to hold their countries together, that was about all they did. They were often corrupt, like Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, or monomaniacally doctrinaire, like Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea, or mad like Jean-Bedel Bokassa of the Central African Empire. **********Even when they were relatively benign and paternalistic, like Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, they favored their own groups, in his case the Baoule. With no check on their power, they often pursued ruinous economic policies. By the time Houphouet-Boigny died in December, after squandering millions on grandiose monuments, the Ivory Coast, once hailed as the ""economic miracle"" of West Africa, was $16 billion in debt. **********For over a decade there were only four multiparty states on the continent -- Mauritius, Gambia, Senegal and Botswana. When the political map began to change in 1990, it did so with a vengeance, prompted in part by the dramatic spectacle of Communist regimes falling like bowling pins throughout Eastern Europe. **********The causes were both internal and external. Growing economic discontent gave rise to opposition movements and emboldened them, especially among hundreds of thousands of young graduates who could find no work and saw little reason to respect doddering leaders. In February 1990 France told its client states that it would no longer prop up single-party governments. Then in June Britain told its former colonies that henceforth aid would be tied to political pluralism and good government. **********The unraveling began with Benin, a sliver of a West African country that had been under military-type Marxist rule for 17 years. Under pressure, the Beninese strongman, President Mathieu Kerekou, convened a ""national conference"" of eminent citizens to recommend reforms. The conference promptly declared itself sovereign and set off on a course that led to elections and Mr. Kerekou's defeat. **********By 1993 nine countries -- all of them French-speaking -- had held such conferences. Six resulted in a change in regime, most notably in Congo, Mali and Niger. In Zambia, the longtime ""African humanist"" leader, Kenneth D. Kaunda, was forced to hold an election and when he lost he gracefully stepped down. **********The process has been a failure elsewhere. In Nigeria the military Government, which had been laying plans for six years to return to civilian rule, abruptly reneged on the promise after presidential elections in June. In Ghana and Burkina Faso, military leaders who came to power in coups were able to sail through elections and gain an imprimatur of legitimacy. **********Cameroon and Gabon have made no strides toward democracy. And in Zaire, President Mobutu has successfully confounded the opposition during four years of maneuvering that has seen two competing prime ministers, two Cabinets and two constitutions -- a development aptly labeled ""le doublement d'institutions."" The Holdout  Kenya's Leader Defies the Trend **********Perhaps nowhere has the failure been as flagrant as in Kenya. President Daniel arap Moi, a 69-year-old given to seeing plots in the air, has been an implacable opponent of democracy, warning that it would breed ethnic strife. Meanwhile, he has flagrantly played the tribal card himself, ousting the once-powerful Kikuyu from all positions of influence and replacing them with members of his own Kalenjin and related groups. **********Forced by a cutoff of foreign aid to call elections in December 1992, President Moi split the opposition, which divided on ethnic lines, and won what most diplomats view as rigged balloting. Opponents, whom the President once called rats, have been harassed, jailed and even killed. Thirty-six members of the opposition were arrested last year and 14 so far this year. **********Even more unsettling have been the armed attacks, beginning in 1991, by Kalenjin raiders against Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya communities in the lush farmland of the Rift Valley. About 1,000 people have been killed and some 250,000 run off their land. Diplomats and many Kenyans are convinced the Government is behind the raids, and indeed Government figures declare publicly that what was once called the White Highlands belongs to their ethnic group. **********""Kenya is sitting on a volcano,"" one Kikuyu said. ""I don't know what would happen tomorrow if Moi chokes on a chicken bone."" **********All this has proved disillusioning to Africans in everyday life. ""Look at Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire,"" said Aliou Boly, a young Ph.D. in business management in Ouagadougou. ""If that's democratization, I'm not for it. Look at Togo -- worse off than before. Benin, Mali, Zambia. They've all had elections but it didn't change anything. There's a new elite but it behaves the same as the old one."" **********The political liberalization means that many countries where dissent once meant courting imprisonment or execution now have a free and at times boisterous press. There is an increasingly independent judiciary, even functioning human rights groups that are not afraid to post their names on their doors. **********But there are still obstacles on the road to full democracy. Sometimes there are too many opposition parties -- Zaire has 200 -- for the system to function. Sometimes the levers of power and state-controlled television and radio are temptations too strong for an incumbent to resist. And many politicians have learned how to win an election, but not how to lose one. **********""No country in Africa since the winds of change started blowing four years ago has really achieved democracy,"" said Mr. Moyo, of the Ford Foundation. **********""The triggering of change has led to political liberalization but not to democracy. Democracy is much more far-reaching. It requires changes in institutions. They have to become strong and competing and they have to recognize each other's legitimacy. That's far down the line. Who knows how far it really is?"" **********TODAY: From one-man rule to multiparty government, but at a price. **********YESTERDAY: Bailing out the bankrupt, and a laboratory for optimism. **********SUNDAY: Poverty, misery and despair: the deadly legacy of decline.  AFRICA, POLITICALLY The current leaders for selected countries are pictured. ANGOLA  Rich in resources but racked by civil war, now in its 19th year. Peace talks muddling along in Lusaka, Zambia. Jose Eduardo dos Santos is the current leader.  BENIN  First French-speaking country to successfully navigate the shoals from dictatorship to muliiparty state. BOTSWANA  Long an island of relative prosperity and democracy in a once troubled region of black-white, East-West conflicts. BURKINA FASO Desperately poor, drifting since the 1987 coup that killed the radical, charismatic military leader, Thomas Sankara. Blaise Compaore is the current leader. BURUNDI Scene of recurring tribal massacres, lost its chance for reconciliation with last year's coup that killed first Hutu president. CAMEROON  Split between French- and English-speakers, fighting with Nigeria and the World Bank, ruled by an ethnically based and repressive elite. CAPE VERDE  A nation of volcanic Atlantic islands that abandoned Marxist economics but needs aid to survive; chronically drought-stricken. CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC Undergoing a difficult but so far successful passage to democracy. Former Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa, now out of jail, wanders in white robes. GAMBIA  The English-speaking sliver in French-speaking Senegal has long practiced multiparty politics.  GHANA  Africa's first in everything in the post-war wave of decolonization - in revolving-door coups, in hitting bottom and in climbing back through I.M.F program. Jerry J. Rawlings is the current leader. GUINEA  Saw a hotly contested election; still unable to shake off legacy of Ahmed Sekou Touri's African socialism, which bankrupted a once-rich land. GUINEA-BISSAU The Government has allowed a multiparty system to descend slowly, almost reluctantly, on a backwater former Portuguese colony. IVORY COAST  Former economic ""miracle"" now down on its luck; the new President, Henri Konan Bedie, jails journalists for writing insulting articles. CHAD Long in the shadow of Libya's territorial claims, rife with jockeying among clans; President ldriss Deby's guards commit human rights violations.  COMOROS Had been run for years by a French mercenary who helped South Africa evade sanctions; still the scene of intrigue that undercuts elections. CONGO  Held elections to replace long-time Marxist dictator, unsettled by fighting between ethnic militias. DJIBOUTI Elections inspired by Paris uncovered deep divisions between two main groups, Afars and Issas; French maintain large military presence. EQUATORIAL GUINEA One of Africa's true horrors, now ruled by the nephew of Macias Nguema Biyoko, who once slaughtered opponents in soccer stadium as rock music was played. ERITREA The only country to change colonial-era boundaries, after a 30- year independence war with Ethiopia; self-reliant and tough. ETHIOPIA  Threw out its brutal Soviet-backed dictator in 1991; the old empire is breaking into ethnic groupings to prepare for more elections. GABON Swimming in oil and also swimming in discontent and debt; the longtime leader Omar Bongo's claim to have won December election widely disbelieved. KENYA Heading downhill fast under Jomo Kenyatta's successor, Daniel arap Moi, who plays tribal politics, crushes dissidents and is widely accused of corruption. LESOTHO  The tiny kingdom surrounded by South Africa has byzantine politics and a restive, underpaid army that killed the Deputy Prime Minister in April. LIBERIA  Civil war has claimed more than 150,000 lives, brought in an all-African intervention force; peace talks reduce fighting but it continues. MADAGASCAR Had successful elections, lengthy but free; the new President, Albert Zafy, faces huge economic decline after 20 years of one-man rule. MALAWI  With the old tyrant in a homburg hat, Hastings Kamuzu Banda, struck down at the polls, his successor, Bakili Muluzi, promises reforms. MALI  The revolution that dumped the dictator Moussa Traore has given way to elected Government, but it faces poverty and uprisings by Tuaregs in the north. MAURITANIA Opposition boycott of elections has kept old powers in control, the Maurs still dominate the blacks, and the desert encroaches.  MAURITIUS Its economic growth rates, stability and assiduous regard for multiparty democracy have made it an island in more ways than one. MOZAMBIQUE At long last the civil war is winding down and a peace agreement is holding; every depends on demobilization of armies and elections.  NAMBIA Under its new Swapo leadership, it is practicing democratic Government and market economics; future is closely tied to South Africa next door. NIGER A multiparty system voted into place in 1992; Government is fighting on all fronts - rebel Tuaregs, falling uranium prices, growing Islamic militance. NIGERIA  Gen. Ibrahim Babangida led the swaggering giant of West Africa until August 1993, when he was forced out after rejecting election results. The country is now ruled by a confused military government. RWANDA  Africa's hell, pure and simple, with prospects ahead of more grisly killings by either Hutu or Tutsi, barring outside intervention. SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE A smooth democratic transition, helped by much aid from France and Portugal, has a decade of mismanagement to overcome. SENEGAL  Long a multiparty democracy, has been unsettled by February riots over devaluation; two principal opposition leaders held in jail without trial. SEYCHELLES Its strongman, France Albert Rend, won 1991 election; the biggest problem for the island paradise is a decline in tourism caused by European recession.  SIERRA LEONE  Besieged in the east by Liberian-supported rebels, lacking in popular support, a corrupt military Government has promised civilian rule. SOMALIA The case study in the failure of international intervention; Gen Mohammed Farah Aidid is still a power, the clans are still battling. SOUTH AFRICA  The recent election serves as a model throughout Africa; leaders admire President Nelson Mandela's courage in embracing the opposition.  SUDAN Africa's largest country is devastated by Africa's longest war, the Islamic Government in the north against the Christian-animist rebels in south. SWAZILAND  King Mswati II is still following a conservative course of maintaining traditional practices but with a slight opening to democratic principles. TANZANIA  Facing a long uphill climb to economic recovery; former President Julius K. Nyerere's high-minded but disastrous rule is receding; elections scheduled. TOGO  A popular push for democracy was thwarted by sleight of hand from the longtime dictator, Gnassingbe Eyadema; turmoil and ethnic tensions result. UGANDA  Trying to overcome a two-decade curse of dictatorship and ethnic warfare, President Yoweri Museveni is experimenting with single- ""movement"" politics. ZAIRE  The gold standard in greed and mismanagement, the personality cult rule of Mobutu Sese Seko is gradually fading away amid anarchy and poverty. ZAMBIA  'Kenneth D. Kaunda surprisingly lost elections and surprisingly turned over power; new President, Frederick J.T. Chiluba, beset by burden of economic catastrophes. ZIMBABWE An economic and political success under President Robert Mugabe, though still fraught with tensions involving white, parties and land."

His commercial real estate company, which is also Germany's largest, filed for bankruptcy on April 15. Nearly $715 million of his loans came from Deutsche Bank. **********The debts, though huge, have relatively little impact on the balance sheet of Deutsche Bank, but they have tarnished its reputation as one of the world's premier financial institutions. **********The German news media have criticized the bank for allowing the 59-year-old Mr. Schneider, whose whereabouts are unknown, to borrow huge sums of money on the basis of what the bank now says were false documents. **********Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl commented on the case, asking why it is difficult for an average factory foreman to get a home loan, when billions are doled out to dubious tycoons.Estimate of Losses **********At a news conference in Frankfurt today, the bank's managing board chairman, Hilmar Kopper, said that the 59-year-old Mr. Schneider and his wife had absconded with about $130 million owed to construction companies and craftsmen. He added that while it was impossible to say with certainty how much Deutsche Bank would have to write off, ""it could be several hundred million marks."" There are 1.68 marks to the dollar. **********Mr. Kopper said that Deutsche Bank had been the victim of ""premeditated, systematic credit fraud,"" and that Mr. Schneider had ""evidently applied himself to the task with criminal energy."" **********The collapse of the Schneider real estate empire was Deutsche Bank's second big setback in corporate lending since December, when Metallgesellschaft A.G., Germany's 14th-largest company, nearly failed after losing $1.33 billion through oil-futures trading in New York. Metallgesell-schaft was bailed out at the last minute by a consortium of its creditor banks, including Deutsche Bank, which holds 12.6 percent of the company's stock. **********Today Mr. Kopper, engaging in a rare bit of public spin control, presented Deutsche Bank's version of its involvement in the Schneider group, saying that ""actually, only the banks have been damaged -- no one else."" **********He said the extent of the bank's loans to Mr. Schneider and his company constituted only three one-thousandths of its lending volume. **********""There can be no doubt about the standing of Deutsche Bank or the German banking system as a whole,"" Mr. Kopper continued. ""There is no cause whatsoever for a crisis of confidence."" **********But in a statement released before the news conference, he acknowledged that ""the loss of image"" was more far-reaching. **********Mr. Kopper said the bank would pay all bills from construction companies working on the three Schneider projects it financed and that are still under construction. ""There is no threat of lost income,"" he said, adding that the sum involved was less than 50 million marks -- $29.5 million, which he called ""peanuts.""Falsification Charged **********Mr. Kopper said Mr. Schneider's company had presented falsified documents from certified real estate appraisers to Deutsche Bank's mortgage subsidiary, Centralboden, and that these forgeries played the decisive part in the disaster. The Schneider group also presented manipulated rental contracts, he said. **********As an example, Deutsche Bank officials cited the Zeil Galerie shopping mall in downtown Frankfurt. They said the Schneider group had asserted that when the mall was completed, its shops would have 20,000 square meters of floor space generating $19.5 million in rent a month. The actual structure, opened in 1993, has 9,000 square meters of shop space and monthly rents totaling $3 million to $4 million. **********Banking industry experts said the damage to Deutsche Bank's reputation was not likely to seriously undermine its operations. **********""Deutsche Bank's image has suffered, but I don't think it will really affect their business,"" said Hans-Joachim Pilz, research chief at M. M. Warburg & Company, a private bank in Hamburg. ""Maybe some smaller customers will switch their savings account to another bank. But it is the biggest bank in the country, so it is to be expected that it would be very involved in companies the size of Metallgesellschaft and Schneider."" **********The Frankfurt state prosecutor's office said it was continuing to search for the Schneiders. ""We don't know where he is,"" said Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office."

Because the law is retroactive to 1993, high earners face even bigger hits on April 15. **********Given the tax increase, investors will make after-tax performance an increasingly important yardstick for mutual funds, investment professionals predict. **********""My industry is only now beginning to think about after-tax returns,"" said Fred B. Taylor, chief investment officer and vice chairman of the U.S. Trust Company. ""But there will be more and more people who report on an after-tax basis."" **********Contributing to the bottom-line orientation will be an era of lower absolute returns, many investment professionals say. Neal Litvack, executive vice president for marketing at Fidelity Investments, said there was ""no way performance will be as good going forward in the next few years as it has been in the past, particularly in bond funds,"" and added, ""That will force people to maximize whatever returns they can get."" **********Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago began tracking fund performance last year on an after-tax basis, as well as pretax. ""We want to see which funds have been most tax-efficient,"" said Don Phillips, Morningstar publisher. **********For its calculations, Morningstar assumes the highest Federal tax rate for income distributed by funds each year. The tax on long-term capital gains, investments held more than a year, remains lower than the top income tax bracket, at 28 percent. **********Funds that keep turnover low, like index funds, tend to be more tax-efficient, Mr. Phillips said. Funds that rely on capital gains tend to higher after-tax returns than income funds. **********Fidelity, which has begun monitoring after-tax returns for internal records, responded to investor concerns by adding the Fidelity Spartan Bond Strategist last year. This no-load fund aims to optimize after-tax returns through a combination of tax-exempt and taxable bonds. So far, it has attracted about $22 million. **********""It is probably an idea that is about 12 months to 18 months before its time,"" Mr. Litvack said. ""The reality of the new tax law needs to sink in."" **********To be sure, after-tax performance should not be the only consideration when selecting a fund. ""Ultimately, total long-term return performance ought to be the primary determinant,"" said Mr. Taylor of U.S. Trust. **********That said, a little homework can indicate the gap between a fund's pretax and after-tax performance. **********""When buying funds,"" said Ron Santangelo, manager of mutual fund research at Merrill Lynch, ""you need to know what their average turnover has been in a given year, if they have consistently paid out capital gains at the end of every year compared to what they have paid out in income."" Investors who buy funds with large unrealized capital gains, he said, are taking on a tax liability. **********A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, cautions investors not to place too much emphasis on past performance. ""Carried to extremes, investors could be driven into funds that have big unrealized capital appreciation,"" he said. ""Before getting into one of those funds, investors ought to try to determine what sort of event would trigger a fund to cash in those gains."" **********Some of the most tax-inefficient funds over the last five years had one unusual year, Mr. Phillips of Morningstar said. Merrill Lynch's Healthcare funds paid out very large capital gains in 1991. **********Similarly, Dean Witter's high-yield securities fund paid big dividends in 1990, even though its net asset value plummeted with the collapse of the junk bond market. The fund made smaller income distributions the next year, Mr. Phillips said, and could become ""one of the most tax-efficient funds, because they have a huge tax-loss carry-forward."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/business/wall-street-beware-management-talking-poor.html,Alison Cowan,1994-02-13,,956,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Wall Street; Beware Management Talking Poor,Wall Street; Beware Management Talking Poor," **********MOST investors are wary of managements that hype their stocks. What they don't realize is that with bankrupt companies, they can get just as burned by managers who are purposely too pessimistic about a company's future. **********For junior creditors this undervaluing game is becoming a regular occurrence that is increasing their losses while allowing savvy senior creditors to make out like bandits by winning large portions of undervalued stock that suddenly jump in value after the company emerges from bankruptcy. **********The potential for mischief exists because managers of bankrupt companies are torn between their own interests and those of their vulnerable creditors and shareholders. When companies file for bankruptcy, managers naturally want job security and, if possible, to profit from helping revive the company. **********Those most likely to oblige them -- or at least to pretend to -- are the senior creditors. They have first call on the assets of a company and get their share before any leftovers are given to junior creditors. With the help of management, senior creditors can convince the bankruptcy judge that the company has little value and walk off with fistfuls of equity in addition to any cash or new debt. If the stock appreciates, as it should if it was being talked down, they can make much more than 100 cents on the dollar. **********That is precisely what is going on in several recent cases. **********Leon Black, a sharp-elbowed senior creditor, won control of E-II Holdings, the consumer products company, but only with the assistance of his bankers at Bear Stearns, who provided a helpful valuation of the company, and E-II's president, Steven Green. Bear Stearns testified in court that Mr. Black would have to get the lion's share of the equity, since there was not enough cash or debt to satisfy his claim. Mr. Green is said to have given Mr. Black a peek at the real value of the company before he bought his block. And Mr. Green got a good deal too: 3 percent of the equity and a $21 million, three-year employment contract to run the company. **********The most talked about example is National Gypsum. Despite protests from junior bondholders and stockholders that management was deliberately pushing down revenue projections, allegations supported by internal memos, a Dallas bankruptcy judge backed a conservative plan that awarded nearly the whole company to the senior creditors and stiffed just about everyone else. **********After the plan was confirmed, surprise! Management, which had been angling for lucrative employment contracts, suddenly discovered it could raise prices and save $30 million a year by slashing its work force. The stock, which management insisted was worth no more than $12.50 a share, closed Friday at $40. In other words, management's estimates were off by $27.50 a share. **********That additional $605 million could have helped make junior creditors whole. Instead, a cadre of senior creditors -- chiefly Fidelity Investments, Trust Company of the West and Goldman Sach's Water Street Fund -- ended up making 200 cents on the dollar, twice what the Federal Bankruptcy Code intends creditors to make. **********But managements that go along by winking at low projections do so at their own peril. In National Gypsum's case, as soon as senior creditors won control of the company, the company's top officers left, apparently at the new owners' insistence. **********""Undervaluation is the game these days,"" said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for National Gypsum's bondholders. ""Very few people other than the senior bondholders understand it. But this explains a lot of what you're seeing in the marketplace."" **********A National Gypsum spokesman, Allan Cecil, does not buy it. ""Those charges were made before in a court and found to be without merit and are still without merit,"" he said. **********James Rubin, an institutional investor who made a killing in National Gypsum's new stock, agrees. He credits the stock jump to a rebound in housing starts that fueled demand for National Gypsum's building materials. **********Whatever the culprit, the gross mispricings persist. In a preliminary study of 90 companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, Allan C. Eberhart, a professor at New York University, found an average jump of 7.1 percent more than the overall market in the two days after trading resumes, before commissions are included. In some cases, long-term performance bordered on the spectacular. Charter Medical, for instance, has climbed 190 percent since coming out of bankruptcy, while Orion Pictures and Ames Department Stores are up 83 percent and 69 percent, respectively. **********With so many stocks being systematically undervalued, senior creditors can reap windfall profits. But it also means that junior creditors or stockholders probably receive less than they should if the bankruptcy court full appreciated the company's true value. **********Who's to blame for these undeserved windfalls? Not the judges, who, given the number of emerging companies that relapse into bankruptcy, want to err on the side of caution. And certainly not the senior creditors, who can hardly be faulted for feigning interest if a management team is foolish enough to try to ingratiate itself to them. **********Investors do blame management. Fumes Mr. Bienenstock about National Gypsum, ""It appears to me that the company was essentially saying to its senior bondholders, 'We will give you the benefit of undervaluation if you give us employment contracts.' "" **********Junior creditors are wising up. They are pushing judges to name trustees whose views on valuation may be more tamperproof than management's. Wilbur Ross, the financial adviser to National Gypsum bondholders, recommends temporarily withholding advisory fees and paying only if and when the predictions hold water. **********Unfortunately, until managers stop putting their own interests ahead of creditors and shareholders, even such radical changes are unlikely to make the problem go away."

They are largely passive investors concerned mostly with cashing dividend checks. They know little about the companies they own or the trends in the industry because they are apt to have others, such as brokers, choose the companies to buy. **********Well, such investors had better start paying attention. Some utilities, after paying ever-increasing dividends, have begun to cut back those payouts to prepare for tougher competition ahead. **********For current shareholders, such dividend cuts are a blow, cutting their annual yield and the stock price. But for new investors, the stocks of companies making such cuts might become more attractive because of the potential for both increasing dividends and rising share prices. **********On Monday the FPL Group, the parent of the Florida Power and Light Company, stung its shareholders with such a dividend cut, slashing it by 32 percent, from 62 cents a share to 42 cents. **********The action caught shareholders off guard. They have enjoyed small dividend rises for 42 straight years. Moreover, Florida Power and Light is not facing any financial squeeze. Utilities have generally cut dividends only when facing strains caused by, for example, a denied rate increase. **********James L. Broadhead, the chairman of FPL Group, conceded there was no immediate financial problem on the horizon that could put the utility at a disadvantage with its rivals soon. **********Some utilities are worrying about future competition because of a recent California Public Utilities Commission proposal that would let major industrial customers shop for power wherever they wanted in 1996. Though the move would put only California utilities under pressure at first, competition is expected to spread to other states. **********But Mr. Broadhead said that Florida was not headed in that direction. And even if it did, he said, only 4 percent of F.P.& L. customers are the industrial type that could shop elsewhere. **********So why did management take such a radical step? **********Mr. Broadhead called FPL Group one of the industry's most generous companies, paying out 90 percent of earnings in dividends. It had reached so high a level, he said, that it faced the prospect of a dividend freeze. Such a freeze, he said, would have eventually frustrated shareholders. **********Instead, he said, it was decided to take a large cut and bring the utility more in line with many rivals that pay about 60 to 65 percent of their earnings in dividends. **********FPL Group will use some savings to buy back about 10 million outstanding shares, a move that could strengthen the share price. Mr. Broadhead said that shareholders could benefit not only from a higher stock price but also from the fact that capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than dividend income. **********And by lowering the payout rate, he said, the company will be able to increase dividends again. He said a dividend rise of 5 percent was a good bet for February. **********That may be fine for those buying the stock now. But current investors are still reeling. FPL's stock fell by $4.375 a share on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $27.50, and has since rebounded only to $28.625, leaving owners with a 10.2 percent price drop along with a dividend cut. **********Nathan Partain, the utility analyst for Duff & Phelps, said the contention of gains in the long haul does not help many shareholders who depend on the dividend. ""You tell them that over the long term you will increase their value,"" he said, ""but they have to eat next week."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/24/business/four-seasons-sour-footnotes.html,Alison Cowan,1994-01-24,,1852,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Four Seasons' Sour Footnotes,Four Seasons' Sour Footnotes," **********The annual report for Four Seasons Hotels Inc. is as inviting as a turned-down bed in one of the company's five-star hotels. The photographs are of dreamy places, the tone is reassuring and the ledgers show the company to be solidly in the black. **********But the market is beginning to wonder how healthy the Toronto-based company really is. The stock trades in Toronto at $12.75 Canadian a share, or about $9.70 American, 35 percent less than when the company last sold equity to the public in December 1992. **********One surprising critic: John W. Young, an analyst at Scotia McLeod, a brokerage firm that helped underwrite the 1992 stock offering for the company and is owned by the Bank of Nova Scotia, one of Four Seasons' major lenders. Though many analysts suppress their doubts to stick by a client, Mr. Young has been recommending selling the stock. **********Competition in the hotel business has roughed up even the high-styled hotels of Four Seasons. Low occupancy rates industrywide and price-conscious consumers have exposed deep flaws in a strategy adopted in recent years by the company and many of its rivals to minimize risks. A Prosperous Image **********In hopes of escaping the expense of owning hotels in such a risky climate, Four Seasons turned to managing them for a fee. But owners these days make a habit of leaning on their deep-pocketed managers to keep afloat -- a severe cash drain for Four Seasons. **********So far, those liabilities -- and even the ones created by properties it owns outright -- have barely tarnished Four Seasons' books. To portray itself as prosperous, it has resorted to some clever financial alchemy that papers over the problems -- for now. **********Its books, which are all reported in Canadian dollars, show it made $7.7 million in 1992 and another $5.2 million in the first nine months of 1993, though losses on many properties are being obscured because of the accounting. Traders say the company is fast running through cash -- $25 million a quarter -- and could have to raise capital again soon, when a new $80 million credit line runs out. **********""From an economic standpoint, the company is in a weak position,"" said Howard M. Schilit, an accounting professor at American University who wrote a Dec. 20 report on the company for institutional investors. ""The financial statements are misleading, even if they're not in technical violation of the rules."" **********The company's chairman and cofounder, Isadore Sharp, would not be interviewed for this article. But he has better reason than anyone to want the stock price high. His 20 percent stake in the company is worth $74 million at current prices, down $52 million from its high. The company guaranteed some debt on the aging Toronto Inn-on-the-Park hotel when he and two of his friends on the board owned it personally. And the company also owes Mr. Sharp an unusual incentive payment that fully vested on Dec. 19 and hinges on the stock's trading range. **********The financial gimmicks Four Seasons uses take many forms, but one of the most serious allows it to issue quarterly profit-and-loss statements that hide the troubled financial health of many of its holdings. **********The company manages 44 hotels and resorts, but by stretching an accounting loophole almost to the breaking point, its quarterly results fully reflect only three: its wholly owned Minaki Lodge in Ontario; a 25 percent stake in the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago, and a half-interest in the Four Seasons Hotel in London, the former Inn-on-the-Park. Profits and losses on the other 41 properties remain strictly off the books. **********The accounting loophole reflects the widely held view that within limits the day-to-day ups and downs of a small, passive stake in a business are generally not relevant to a company's overall financial position. Four Seasons has such passive, minority stakes in nine hotel properties. Nor would anyone fault it for failing to report on the financial health of the 16 for which it acts solely as the property's manager or on the 6 that are under development. **********But it has managed to take further advantage of the loophole by converting big ownership positions in six other hotels into small passive stakes. In 1992, it transferred the six hotels to a partnership. A partner contributed four more luxury hotels. For its share, Four Seasons took a 19.9 percent stake in the joint venture. **********Poof! The six hotels now appear nowhere on Four Seasons' quarterly income statements. Because of the loophole, in fact, its 9 minority-owned hotels, plus the 10 in the partnership, could be losing money and investors would never know.  Still Maintains Risk **********The company has no qualms about describing the transfer of the six properties to the partnership as a ""sale,"" which is remarkable because both partners are fully responsible for losses on the properties they contributed. And if the hotels' performance fails to improve by the end of 1996, the deal can be unwound. In other words, the transfer of risk that usually accompanies a sale may never take place, and both partners may still end up taking the bath that they have artfully dodged. **********The accounting has the blessing of the company's auditors at Peat Marwick Thorne. But a company spokeswoman, Sandra Scott, acknowledged that the company, under United States standards, would probably have to show its share of the profits or losses from the hotels it shunted off its books in the 1992 transaction. **********The company engages in other forms of financial acrobatics that make performance hard to judge. Before 1992, the company always depreciated its hotel assets before calculating operating margins. Then, without any fanfare, it began lumping the cost of depreciation into other administrative costs so that the cost would no longer harm operating margins. The barely detectable shift made the 1991 improvement in operating margins appear better than it was. Tough Corner of a Tough Market **********That the company has financial problems is no surprise. Up until last year, the hotel industry as a whole had lost money every year since 1982, according to Bjorn Hansen, Coopers & Lybrand's hospitality expert. Moreover, luxury hotels have a tougher time than most. With fewer overnight visitors helping foot the bill in hard times, such amenities as round-the-clock room service weigh heavily on bottom lines. **********Four Seasons' steadfast reluctance to skimp on service emerged again last fall when it opened a swanky new hotel in Manhattan, which it managesbut technically owns very little of because it is in the partnership. The fully appointed, 367-room Four Seasons on East 57th Street, between Park and Madison Avenues, cost in excess of $1 million a room to build -- five times the price fetched by other luxury hotel rooms in Manhattan that have changed hands recently. **********""This is a company that offers tremendous service because they really overdo it,"" said Roger S. Cline, worldwide director for hospitality consulting services for Arthur Andersen. ""But there's a cost to this, and you can't earn a return with that level of service."" **********In theory, Four Seasons should have long ago freed itself from having to worry about the costs of delivering spare-no-expense service, since it has been working to transform itself from an active owner of hotels to a passive manager. The idea was that investors would reward the company for replacing uncertain real estate income with the more predictable and less-capital-intensive earnings of management contracts. **********But the pall in new construction and drop in occupancy rates have put hotel management companies on the losing end, Mr. Hansen explained. With 906 management companies competing for the 200 new hotels beginning construction in 1993, winning new contracts often comes down to who can promise the deepest pockets. **********Four Seasons' experience is a case in point. It has no financial stake in 16 hotels it manages, yet it is constantly digging into its pocket to rescue clients who cannot pay their bills. At the end of 1992, the company had advanced $66.9 million to hotels under management. It wrote off $22.8 million of that amount as a reserve against future losses. Nonetheless, within nine months, continuing shortfalls pushed the figure back up to $53.5 million. **********Such loans appear on the balance sheet as ""notes and mortgages receivables,"" or assets. The trouble is the more money the hotels under management lose, the bigger this Four Seasons' ""asset"" gets. **********If Four Seasons lends heavily to hotels it manages, it opens its checkbook even wider for hotels it owns. And each time Four Seasons advances money to the six hotels in the 1992 partnership, it marks up an asset on its books called ""investment in hotel partnerships."" By the end of September, the account had reached $268.9 million, up sharply from $231.5 million at the end of 1992. **********H. Roger Garland, a Four Seasons' executive vice president, said the money the company advances to its hotels ""will come back to us as the properties are sold or the market recovers."" But Professor Schilit is skeptical. ""It's questionable whether that asset really represents a future benefit at all,"" he said. **********Management clearly hopes that it can survive until the luxury hotel business rebounds by selling six hotels. The trick will be to unload the ownership stakes without forfeiting the management contracts. **********It had better succeed because it cannot keep the high-wire act going indefinitely. Receivables -- much of which represent fees owed from hotel clients under contract -- reached $37.9 million as of Sept. 30. That represents five months' worth of revenue -- twice the backlog of unpaid bills at year-end 1991. Growing Debt **********Debt is also ballooning. Four Seasons had borrowed $348.2 million from its lenders by the end of the third quarter of 1993, 20 percent more than what it owed at the end of 1992. Moreover, huge leasing obligations that could run as high as $200 million appear nowhere on the books. **********One reason the company gets away with as much as it does is that its financials are so difficult to decipher. Business publications barely scratch the surface: they often confuse what the company describes as the money generated by every Four Seasons hotel worldwide ($878 million in 1992) with the management company's actual share of the pie ($135 million). **********The board also leaves a lot to be desired. Looking out for shareholders' interests are Mr. Sharp and three other company insiders; two of Mr. Sharp's brothers-in-law; his 91-year-old father, Max; one of Mr. Sharp's earliest backers; a prep-school chum of Mr. Sharp's, who is also the executor of his estate; a tax specialist who had worked for the company's auditors at Peat Marwick, and a Japanese banker who recently extended a small credit line to the company. **********These relationships have paid off in spades for Mr. Sharp. For instance, he must have been thrilled when a newspaper connected to one of his director's named him Canada's C.E.O. of the Year in 1992. If he wins the award a second time after righting Four Seasons' listing ship, he will have truly earned it."

The conference is organized by Dataquest, a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. subsidiary. **********Home-grown European companies have little presence in the personal computer market. Most of the business of supplying PC chips is done by subsidiaries of U.S. and Japanese concerns. The big European chip makers - SGS Thomson, Microelectronics, Siemens, Philips and GEC Plessey - are most competitive in semiconductors used in such industries as telecommunications and automobiles. **********Although the overall market for semiconductors is surging, with global sales this year expected to rise to $101 billion from $85.6 billion in 1993, capital spending has slowed, Dataquest analysts said, especially in Europe and Japan. **********Nonetheless, huge demand for personal computers, a trend that cannot last indefinitely, has helped the Europeans to report good profits on their chip operations in the past few years. About 25 percent of the European market for chips is related to personal computers, David Moorhouse, a Dataquest analyst, said. **********Last year, there were 10.2 million personal computers made in Europe, and that is expected to grow to 18.1 million in 1998, accounting for a third of the Continent's semiconductor market. **********But weak investment means Europe does not have many chip foundries and silicon-wafer factories, making it vulnerable to supply problems that are expected to arise because of the global growth in demand for semiconductors, whose sales are expected to double to $200 billion by 2000. **********Already, some executives attending the conference said, supply constraints are beginning to show up for technologically advanced chips. About 40 factories around the world are expected to open soon, but few of these will be in Europe. Meanwhile, advanced chips are becoming vital for companies that make computers and other electronic devices because upgraded products are brought to market with increasing rapidity. **********European chip investment in 1993 was estimated at about $1.5 billion, rising to just under $2 billion this year. That compares with about $4 billion in Japan last year, $5 billion in the United States and more than $3 billion in the Asia/Pacific region. **********Meanwhile, Dataquest forecast that much of the growth in the world would come from the Asian market, which was forecast to use $50 billion of chips in 2000, reflecting demand for all kinds of electronics devices in China, followed by Taiwan and Korea. It also said semiconductors would make up about 20 percent of electronics products. **********For the near term, the European market is expected to grow 12 percent this year, led by wireless communications, personal computers and telephone switching equipment, according to Gene Norrett, a Dataquest executive. **********Also at the conference, Dataquest gave Motorola Inc. its European Vendor of the Year award, the third time the American company has won the three-year-old award. The award is based on voting by about 40 European companies that use semiconductors in their products and reflects the availability of chips, their quality, price and performance, and support and service by the supplier. Philips Electronics NV won a prize for the best quality and technical support, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. was identified as the best midsized vendor."

Tenneco announced its plan early yesterday morning but did not estimate how much the offering might be worth. **********The chemicals unit is the smallest of Tenneco's six divisions, with $914 million in revenue last year, or about 7 percent of Tenneco's total revenue of $13.2 billion. It makes phosphates, specialty chemicals and surfactants used in detergents, toiletries, metal finishing, agriculture and textiles. **********Yesterday, the unit said that it had bought a 50 percent interest in a venture with a Mexican phosphate producer. **********Concerning the stock buyback, Dana G. Mead, the chairman and chief executive of Tenneco, said the company's board had viewed the shares as undervalued and a good investment. Tenneco said it would purchase shares on the open market or in negotiated sales, with the timing depending on market conditions. **********The announcements were the latest of recent moves by Tenneco to redirect its assets into high-return businesses and investments. **********The company, which is based in Houston, has said it wants to concentrate on its three businesses with the best growth prospects -- natural gas, automotive parts and packaging. As part of the refocusing, Tenneco sold 55 percent of the Case Corporation, a farm and construction equipment company, to the public this year, raising about $750 million. **********Proceeds from that offering and the chemicals business offering will be used for acquisitions and other investments in the core businesses, Mr. Mead said. He added that the company would make other announcements in the next week or so, though he would not be more specific. **********""Tenneco's transformation is progressing steadily and we're gaining momentum,"" Mr. Mead said. **********Several analysts said they expected Tenneco to eventually sell the remaining 45 percent of Case and to divest itself of a shipbuilding business in Newport News, Va. But Mr. Mead said Tenneco currently had no such plans. **********Analysts said the price of Tenneco shares was dampened in recent months by investors' fears that the company was involved in too many cyclical industries, including chemicals and heavy equipment. **********""An awful lot of attention has been put on the cyclicality of certain industries,"" said David C. MacKay, chairman of Williams MacKay Jordan & Company in Houston. ""If investors decide a company is cyclical, that's about like death these days."""

Appeals for Clemency **********Mr. Fay has appealed for clemency. President Clinton has called the caning sentence ""excessive"" and has protested the punishment, which lacerates the skin, leaving permanent scars, and is so painful that prisoners typically go into shock. Yet public opinion polls in the United States suggest that Singapore's methods have broad support among Americans fed up with crime in their own neighborhoods. **********Mr. Lee stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990 after 31 years in power, but his views are known to carry great weight among Government officials, presumably including President Ong Teng Cheong, who will review Mr. Fay's clemency appeal. **********""Which is more important, the interests of the whole society or those of an individual?"" Mr. Lee asked in the Chinese-language broadcast. ""The majority of our people support the Government's efforts in protecting the interests of the society. This is the right thing to do."" **********Arguing that the Western concept of individual rights had been taken to extremes and had left the United States in a crisis, he catalogued a list of social ills that plague the United States but scarcely exist in Singapore -- street violence, homelessness, unemployment.  'Out of Control' **********""Just look at the problem of drug abuse,"" he said. ""It has gone out of control. In Singapore, if your behavior is questionable and the police or officials suspect you are taking drugs, they can have your urine tested. If you are tested positive, you'll be dealt with. For three or four months, you will be kept away from drugs until you are rehabilitated."" **********""In the States, you will not be able to do anything like that"" because of laws that limit government drug testing as an infringement of civil rights.

Others kneel in excavation trenches, using trowels and brushes to uncover what remains of the earliest known village in southeastern Anatolia. **********Dust swirls in the wind, and the sun burns like a brush fire. Occasionally, convoys of Turkish Army troops pass by, raising more dust as they head north into the mountains in search of Kurdish guerrillas. **********Last summer the archeologists here left in a hurry after the local army commander warned that they might be attacked by guerrillas of the separatist Kurdish Workers Party, known by its Kurdish initials as the P.K.K. The pullout cost precious time. Now there are only two years left before Hallan Cemi, a village that flourished around 8000 B.C., goes under water. **********Moving from trench to trench, Mesut Yaman, the 13-year-old son of the leader of the nearby village of Kaletepe, shows off his new Philadelphia Phillies hat as he pours cold spring water for the workmen. From one of the trenches, Shoki Goodarzi, 32, an Iranian who is working on her doctorate in Near Eastern studies at the University of California at Berkeley, whistles the local hit of the week: ""Winter Wonderland."" **********The improbable tune and the proximity of the soldiers lend a hint of Indiana Jones to Hallan Cemi. But the five people from American universities who are doing field work here do not like it when life imitates the movies. **********""I prefer it when things are dull,"" said Dr. Michael Rosenberg, a 48-year-old assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Delaware, who heads the excavation here. ""Dull is much better."" **********Hallan Cemi, which means ""eroding spring"" in Turkish, stands beside the Sason River, a tributary of the Tigris. Today the Sason has shrunk to a silvery crescent in the stony river bed. But by 1996 Hallan Cemi is supposed to lie under a 17-square-milelake formed by the Batman Dam, one of 22 major dams that the Turkish Government is planning as part of the vast Southeast Anatolia Project. **********The project is planned to bring irrigation and electricity to one of the country's poorest regions. It will also flood hundreds of archeologically important sites between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. **********""This is a salvage operation,"" said Thomas Strasser, 33, a team member with a doctorate in classical archeology from the University of Indiana. Most excavations are more leisurely, he said. As theories change and new technology develops, archeologists can re-examine the sites decades after they are discovered. ""But in this case, we have to work fast."" **********That is why Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues have kept coming for 8 to 10 weeks every summer since 1991, even though Hallan Cemi lies in the heart of a war that has killed 12,000 people since it started in 1984. **********In late 1991, it killed two archeologists -- graduate students from Ankara University whose vehicle was blown up by a land mine or a bomb.  All excavations sponsored by the Turkish Government for 1992 were canceled in the Tigris area. In 1993, and again this year, Dr. Rosenberg's team was the only one operating there. **********""Last year we had ringside seats to a couple of battles,"" Dr. Rosenberg said. ""Once we saw Turkish Air Force jets bomb a P.K.K. stronghold on the other side of the hills a few miles north."" **********So far this year they have not seen or heard any fighting. People who live in the area say things have been relatively calm since the spring. **********Nevertheless, few Turks dare to visit the region. ""It brings pain to explain it,"" said Dr. Olus Arik, an archeologist at the University of Ankara.  ""But nobody will come with me."" He said he had hoped to resume work this summer at Hasankeyf, a mountain village on the Tigris south of the city of Batman that is dominated by a Roman fortress, but was unable to assemble a team. **********""You cannot press anyone to go to such a region,"" he said, referring to the summary executions of local officials caught in roadblocks set up after dark by the P.K.K. ""It is a matter of one second,"" he said. ""It can never happen, but if it does, it is a whole life."" **********The army has warned Dr. Rosenberg's team, which has been staying in Batman, about 45 minutes away, not to arrive at Hallan Cemi before 7 A.M. and to leave by midafternoon. **********The army offered to provide guards. Dr. Rosenberg declined, fearing that the presence of soldiers might provoke an attack and would create tensions with the Kurdish villagers who are pressed by the separatists for recruits and protection money and by soldiers who suspect them of aiding the guerrillas. **********""We don't talk about politics with the workmen or anyone else,"" Dr. Rosenberg said. ""We want to make clear that we are neutral, that we are here for the work and nothing else."" **********For Dr. Rosenberg, who is studying the human transition from hunting and gathering to settled life, Hallan Cemi is a rich vein to be mined.  Farmers from Kaletepe first led him to the site, then a tobacco field, in 1990 after he and another colleague, Ayla Akin, 34, a Turkish woman who is working on a doctorate at the University of Virginia, showed them Stone Age artifacts and asked if they had seen anything similar. **********Since then, the team has uncovered the remains of several circular stone houses and dozens of tools fashioned out of fish and animal bones, stone mortars for grinding nuts and other food, and smooth, oval-shaped rocks that may have been used as slingshot ammunition. **********Among the most surprising discoveries were the bones of domesticated pigs that may have been the first animals raised for food. **********Some anthropologists theorize that people first settled in areas where wild grains and other food sources were naturally abundant. But Dr. Rosenberg maintains that population pressures forced nomads to stake out their territory and develop whatever resources were available. ""If you stay in the same place, you run the risk of resource depletion,"" he said. ""Animal husbandry is a way to compensate."" **********Each afternoon the day's findings are placed in wooden boxes in the courtyard of the house in Batman. As he sifted through the artifacts, Brian Peasnall, 34, a University of Pennsylvania anthropologist, said: **********""There's a lot of monotony and drudgery. But each shovelful is part of the missing link. That's where the romance is -- in uncovering something that has not been seen in 10,000 years. That's the part I love about it."""

In his cellblock, there were 5 men to a cell, 344 men for one bathroom. **********Packed to three times its recommended capacity, Caracas's main prison is regularly engulfed by murderous violence. In November 1992, 63 inmates died in a breakout attempt. Most were killed by guards who waited until the prisoners were over a wall -- technically ""in flight"" -- before shooting them in the back. **********From the days of Spanish rule, Latin American prisons have always been considered nightmarish. But the spotlight fell with special harshness on Venezuela in June when a visiting delegation from Amnesty International declared that prisons here were ""the most dangerous in Latin America."" **********Backing the charge with statistics, the London-based human rights group said that from January 1990 to April 1994, 2,138 inmates were killed in Venezuelan prisons. During that time, the prison population fluctuated around 26,000. **********The charge is all the more striking because Venezuela has long been known as one of Latin America's most affluent nations, an oil exporter with a per capita income of $3,000. While Venezuela's 33 prisons are filled to nearly double their intended capacity, the prisons of neighboring Colombia, a poorer country, run 10 percent over their capacity. **********Many Americans may have the impression that Venezuelans are well heeled, thinking of the shoppers who clog Miami malls and the middle-class youths who study at American universities on generous Government scholarships. But Venezuela has a gritty underside. According to Government figures, five years of low prices, political instability and capital flight have combined to almost triple the portion of Venezuela's 21 million people who live in poverty, from 14 percent in 1989 to 38 percent in 1993. **********The plunge in living standards has led to a surge in crime. Here in the capital, homicides doubled in three years, hitting 3,720 in 1993. **********Feeling increasingly cornered by crime, Venezuela quietly follows a policy of locking up the suspects and virtually throwing away the key. According to the Justice Ministry, only 40 percent of Venezuela's prisoners have been tried. The rest await trial, a process that can take up to five years. **********""In a jail where there should be 700 prisoners, there are 2,100,"" Ruben Creizems, Venezuela's Justice Minister, complained recently. ""In a system where there are 33 jails, there should be 99."" **********With the goal of cutting the prison population by a quarter by the end of next year, the ministry has conducted a computerized prison census, started to computerize court files to speed trials, introduced a program of releases for good behavior and started offering voluntary repatriation to Colombian prisoners. **********About 10 percent of Venezuela's prison population is from Colombia, a factor often cited to explain the Venezuelan taxpayers' resistance to new prison construction. Despite critical news reports on the severe overcrowding, Venezuela's proposed 1995 budget actually cuts prison spending by 17 percent, to $13 million. **********""The national Government insists on treating the jail problems as an image problem,"" said Mary Eva Caguaripano, prisons coordinator for Provea, Venezuela's leading human rights group. ""What most worries them is the bad image overseas."" **********The worst publicity came last January, when 127 prisoners in Sabaneta Prison in Maracaibo were killed in Venezuela's worst prison riot in history. Ten of the dead should not have been in jail, but administrators had lost their release orders. **********""While security personnel stood by, a group of prisoners set fire to a prison housing building and then hit and stabbed prisoners who tried to escape the inferno,"" said Americas Watch, the New York-based human rights group. ""The responsibility for this appalling violence falls squarely on the Venezuelan Government."" **********Today Sabaneta's inmate population stands at 2,600 -- one-third more than at the time of the riot. Here at Catia, the inmate population is larger than it was when the mass killings occurred two years ago. **********Built 26 years ago to house 700 men, this hulking structure on a recent day housed 2,241. Smoke-scarred and moldy, the jail is a factory for corruption. Each guard oversees 125 inmates and earns $80 a month. The prison budget limits expenditures to about 50 cents a day for each inmate. **********""The jail has become an industry, a lot of money changes hands here,"" the deputy director admitted. ""Prisoners sell mattresses for drugs, or weapons. There is an absolute law of silence."" **********Beyond a prison mess hall where prisoners lined up with battered cups for a thin gruel, a grizzled veteran lay on a cement bench in the prison infirmary. Stitches closed a raw wound to his ribs, undoubtedly caused by a homemade knife. Asked what happened, he said, ""I fell on the stairs."""

The planes, overloaded by hundreds of pounds, lumber down the runway so weighted down that they occasionally crash land in an adjacent game park. **********Only after all these planes have taken off does the airport open for its daily public business. **********The daily flights of khat to Somalia are part of a multimillion-dollar export business and a foreign exchange earner in Kenya. **********The trade in khat, a leafy stimulant that became familiar during the United Nations mission in Somalia, is a legal business here. But it is a cash-only business with a powerful lobby that involves smuggling, enormous competition, corruption and most of all speed -- all for a red leaf that must be chewed within 48 hours after it is picked. **********The khat business has a separate culture, beginning with the farmers whose families have grown it for decades to the rough middlemen who buy it in ramshackle markets in central Kenya to the drivers who deliver it at breakneck speed to Nairobi and the freelance pilots paid by the kilogram to fly it to Somalia. **********The trade is almost completely monopolized by Somalis, in particular at the top by a few individuals in the faction of Mohammad Farah Aidid. Western diplomats are concerned that the profits are going to buy weapons that fuel the civil war in Somalia. **********The United Nations plans to complete its withdrawal from Somalia on March 31. While diplomats and politicians debate the effect of the withdrawal on future peacekeeping missions, people in Mogadishu discuss its potential effect on the khat trade: the United Nations spends large quantities of cash in Mogadishu, money that helps support the khat trade. **********There is little official information about the trade, with figures on prices and tonnage gleaned from individual farmers, dealers or pilots. An official at the Kenya External Trade Authority, which monitors exports, said he could not find figures on the khat trade because they were likely filed under the leaf's Latin name, which no one in the office knew. **********But pilots at Wilson Airport said that about 15 to 20 planes take off every day, each with about a ton of khat. Pilots and dealers said the profit margin before the sale in Somalia was about $1,000 a plane. **********""The best-organized clan whose khat was cut the latest and will get to Somalia the earliest with the fastest car, the fastest plane and the earliest take-off will sell the most at the best price,"" said a pilot who has followed the trade for more than a decade. ""It is a protected industry by the Somalis, so much so that they keep everyone else out."" **********Khat is legal in three countries where it grows: Kenya, Ethiopia and Yemen. Most of it is consumed in Somalia, Yemen and Djibouti, and it is used to a lesser extent in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. It is also legal in Britain, and is sold in London and in Cardiff, Wales, where many of the dockworkers are Somali. It is illegal in the United States. **********The reddish leaf most popular with users is the newest shoot of the gnarled, moss-covered miraa tree, which grows at high altitudes. In Kenya it grows only near Mt. Meru, about 200 miles east of Nairobi, where farmers say it has been cultivated for centuries. **********The leaf -- bitter and unpleasant to first-time users -- must be chewed for hours to get an amphetamine-like high. Doctors say it causes euphoria and excitement and reduces appetite, fatigue and sexual drive. Used in excess it can cause hallucinations and paranoia. Depression and headaches are common when the high is wearing off, and large amounts of liquor are often drunk to counter the stimulant effect of the drug. **********Historically, it has been chewed socially and by nomads in caravans who valued the qualities that cut appetite and fatigue. Those same attributes appeal to long-distance truck drivers today on the Horn of Africa, many of whom are Somalis. **********The Governments of Saudi Arabia and Sudan say it is banned by Koranic law, and the former President of Somalia, Mohammed Siad Barre, barred its import. During the civil war in Somalia, faction leaders paid their militias in part with khat and the men were often heavily drugged and highly aggressive. **********""If I don't chew, my body is not comfortable or happy,"" said Festus Mathindi, 43, a khat farmer near the town of Maua. ""I chew even when I harvest. It's like cooking -- you have to taste."" **********In Kenya, the khat trade was revolutionized by the automobile and the airplane. The road to Meru and beyond was paved, making it a four-hour drive to the airport, and the number of plane-chartering companies multiplied. **********Still, the khat-growing areas have changed little this century and are steeped in miserable poverty. Though farmers earn much more than their counterparts elsewhere in Kenya, they squander their money on liquor and many of their children are put to work picking khat leaves rather than being sent to school, villagers say. **********One of the biggest markets is in Muringene, a village near Maua, idyllically set in green, rolling hills and miraa orchards. The rutted, mud-caked square is littered with rotting garbage and surrounded by one-story concrete buildings, mostly hotels and bars. **********Ragged farmers carry bunches of stalks of khat on their heads and under their arms, taking it to market where it is wrapped in banana leaves and then sewn into 16- to 20-pound plastic bags. Many of the dealers chew as they buy and load. **********The farmers say that khat is good for everyone. ""It's part of our culture,"" said Steven Kiogora, who runs the local medical dispensary. ""It's what our great-great-grandparents did. Miraa brings people together. The crime rate here is very low."" **********The khat that goes to Somalia is picked by torchlight in the middle of the night so that it will be as fresh as possible for the morning flight out of Nairobi. It is driven by pickup truck 200 miles to Nairobi's airport. Pilots and charter company officials say customs, immigration and civil aviation authorities are all paid off by the dealers. Customs duty is paid only on a minimum payload and airport officials ignore overloaded planes. **********The control tower officially opens only at 7 A.M., but pilots pay off officials to get it open earlier, pilots say. Pilots, paid in cash and in advance, earn about $300 a trip and bring back to the dealers money from the deliveries in Somalia. **********Many of the pilots are former Kenyan Air Force pilots, who on the return trip from Somalia come back with undocumented Somalis, entering Kenya illegally after paying bribes. Recently, a Caravan Cessna 406 with a 14-passenger capacity landed with 35 Somalis on board, pilots said. **********""What appeals to the miraa dealers is speed,"" said a Kenyan-born Somali who runs an air chartering service at the airport. ""Miraa offers a lot of money. The warlords control it. They account for 80 percent of the miraa trade, in particular Aidid. I think miraa is not more dangerous than a bottle of whisky."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/business/viewpoints-electric-vehicles-they-re-practical-now.html,S. Freeman,1994-08-28,,748,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Viewpoints; Electric Vehicles: They're Practical Now,Viewpoints; Electric Vehicles: They're Practical Now," **********WHEN people talk about electric cars, someone usually argues that their ""range"" must be improved before they are ""really practical."" Well, that's just not true. **********Of course, the range of these vehicles is improving all the time. While today's batteries will power an electric car for 60 to 80 miles without recharging, batteries with a range of 120 miles are being tested commercially. And in May a Geo Metro, converted to electricity, completed more than 214 miles without stopping for a recharge. **********Good though this progress is, focusing on it can obscure other dimensions of the practicality of electric vehicles. One such dimension is not their possible range, but their necessary range. **********Today's electric vehicles can go far enough to get millions of people in small and medium-sized communities to work and back. And in just 11 of the nation's urban areas, more than 250,000 parking spaces are available for commuters using ""station cars"" that travel much less than 60 miles daily to get to mass transit. **********For example, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which transports about 100,000 people to and from Manhattan each weekday, provides 27,000 parking spaces. And the Long Island Rail Road, which brings 103,000 riders into and out of Manhattan daily, has about 25,000 spaces at its stations. For many passengers who use these spots, the range of today's batteries is more than adequate. **********And they are not alone. Many delivery and service vans operate comfortably within short ranges. Think of all the postal vehicles, package delivery vans, florist trucks and the like that fill our streets. Utilities also own thousands of vehicles that are used in short-range applications, and, in California and Tennessee, battery-powered buses are already operating commercially as a clean and quiet alternative to diesel-fueled vehicles. These are just the tip of the potential market. **********Moreover, the range question can be answered from another direction: recharge time. Today, electric cars have a recharge time of four to six hours at 220 volts A.C. But fast-recharge technology -- usually based on rapid pulses of high energy to the battery -- is being perfected. One technology being tested can recharge a battery in 10 to 15 minutes. A converted pickup truck recently ran 831 miles in 24 hours by using a fast recharger. **********Soon, a recharge will take no longer than the time to ""fill 'er up."" And when that happens, range will be irrelevant. Who asks about the range of a gasoline-powered vehicle? **********To ""fill 'er up"" requires a place to do so, of course, and in this regard electric vehicles are in a much better position than were gasoline vehicles at a similar stage. When Henry Ford started mass producing his cars, filling stations had to be built and a whole gasoline transportation industry created. But electric power is already everywhere. **********In this task, electric utilities can lead the way. When I headed a utility in Sacramento, Calif., for example, we refueled our fleet of electric vehicles in the parking lot, plugging them into a ""filling station"" powered by a solar photovoltaic cell. Indeed, drivers can recharge their batteries at home or wherever they park. They can do so at night, too, when there is surplus capacity. **********Like faster recharge, ease of recharge offers another answer to the range question. **********Finally come flywheels. A flywheel battery can supplement a conventional chemical battery by providing surges of power during start-up and acceleration. American Flywheel Systems and Honeywell have made progress in flywheel research, and United Technologies has already delivered such devices to the German auto maker BMW and the American Government for testing. Because power surges can take a lot out of conventional batteries, flywheels may extend battery ranges to 200 miles to 300 miles in a few years. Fuel cells, which produce electricity by combining hydrogen with oxygen from the air, offer still greater potential for increasing range. **********The range of electric cars will only get better -- especially as research progresses and as many states impose minimum-sale requirements for these vehicles on auto companies. But electric cars are ""really practical"" already, and progress in areas other than range will only make them more so. As work proceeds on all these fronts, we will benefit from the cleaner air, quieter streets and reduced dependence on foreign oil that electric vehicles will bring."

Indeed, the cellular phone settlement offers a ray of hope that part of the deadlock will be broken in overall trade negotiations. **********In these broad talks under the so-called trade framework, the United States has been seeking agreements that include benchmarks for measuring progress in opening Japanese markets in cars, insurance and other products. Japan has resisted such requests for quantifiable targets, saying that such an approach amounts to ""managed trade."" Revenue in Urban Japan **********But the cellular telephone agreement, which is separate from the broader trade talks, calls for a Japanese company to accelerate its construction of a mobile-phone system in the densely populated corridor between Tokyo and Nagoya, about 175 miles to the southwest, using equipment developed by Motorola Inc. The agreement includes specific goals as to how many base stations and channels will be constructed and by what date. **********In short, it includes numerical targets. In terms of specificity, it goes beyond managed trade to what might be called micro-managed trade. **********The Japanese Government, despite its aversion to targets, agreed to the numbers because it can say that they are part of a private contract between two companies, Motorola and the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, or IDO, one of three providers of cellular service in Japan. **********Of course, Motorola and IDO would not have reached such an agreement had it not been for Washington's threats of sanctions and prodding by officials in Tokyo. But by considering the construction timetable a private agreement, both sides could avoid what Walter F. Mondale, the United States Ambassador to Japan, calls the ""metaphysical debate"" about targets and managed trade. **********""Neither side ever got into that old debate,"" Mr. Mondale said on Saturday night, announcing the cellular phone agreement at a news conference here. New Tone in Negotiations **********""We just sat down and said, 'How can we work out an enforceable agreement that is satisfactory to both sides?' "" the former Vice President continued. ""I find it an encouraging example of what can happen when we get rid of the sterile debate."" **********To be sure, there are no targets as to how many Motorola phones will be bought or leased by consumers. That will depend on how Motorola does in the market. Motorola currently sells less than half the phones that work with its cellular phone system; the rest are supplied by Japanese companies. **********It would be difficult to apply the cellular telephone formula to the overall trade talks. Those negotiations involve many more companies, as well as issues like government procurement, that did not arise in the case of cellular phones. **********Still, a similar solution appears to be emerging with automobiles. As early as this week, Japan's leading car makers are expected to announce plans to buy American auto parts in 1995 and possibly beyond. **********These will be portrayed as strictly private initiatives, though there is ample evidence that the influential Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been pushing the cellular phone industry to make such announcements. **********Setting goals for the number of dealers carrying American cars would be somewhat analogous to specifying the number of base stations for cellular telephone relay. It would determine how much access Japanese consumers have to American products without specifying how many consumers would buy them. **********Still, it seems that requiring the United States and Japan to monitor construction projects or contracts of individual companies is not practical on a wide basis. Indeed, what has shocked some Japanese about the cellular phone controversy is how much effort Washington has exerted for what appears here to be the narrow interests of a single company. **********The agreement requires that IDO buy all of its base stations from Motorola. One-hundred fifty-nine of these relay stations are to be built in the next 18 months, meaning several hundred million dollars of revenue for Motorola, regardless of how many customers eventually sign up for cellular service or choose Motorola phones. **********One might wonder why the agreement was not fashioned to specify 159 stations conforming to American technology, but allowing other vendors to bid to supply them. **********Arnold Brenner, executive vice president of Motorola, said it was typical for cellular-phone service providers to have only one vendor of basic equipment because it makes maintenance and repairs easier. Technology or Trade Barrier? **********The crux of the dispute over cellular phones is that Japan's cellular technology is unique. The United States Government and Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., complained in the mid-1980's that the Japanese standard was intended as a trade barrier. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the onetime Government-owned telephone monopoly, has a history of going its own way so it can keep control of technology for itself and its family of Japanese suppliers. **********If one believes that the technological standard was a trade barrier, then what has followed has been a series of market-opening measures and then new obstacles. Around 1987, the Japanese Government agreed to let the American system into the country, but at first only outside the Tokyo-Nagoya region. **********Then, in a 1989 agreement, it allowed the American system into this area, assigning IDO the frequencies. But IDO, which was already building a system using the Japanese standard, failed to build the Motorola system quickly enough. Now, under the agreement announced on Saturday, IDO will complete the Motorola system within 18 months. **********Yet if one believes that Japan is entitled to its own cellular telephone standard, then Motorola should have built phones to match the Japanese system, just as Japanese companies have been making phones for the American market. Indeed, Motorola is now building and selling phones that meet the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone standard, in addition to phones for its own technology. **********Japan started cellular phone service before any other country, including the United States. So in some sense, it had to have its own standard. Moreover, it is not the case that Japan has one system and the rest of the world, another. The system used in most of Europe is different from that in either the United States or Japan. **********No country has two different standards, and most nations would react negatively if an outside supplier, or another country, tried to force it to adopt a second, incompatible technology. Yet, with the help of the United States Government, ""Motorola wished to force its own cellular communication system on Japan,"" said Yoshi Tsurumi, a professor at Baruch College of the City University of New York. ""Motorola has never made the same demand on Germany or France."" **********Motorola and Washington have at various times in recent years agreed to several compromises, only to come back a year or two later with more demands. A Victim Is Compensated **********As for IDO, it has painted itself as the victim, having to shoulder the burden of building two incompatible systems. But in 1989, in return for accepting the task of building a Motorola system, IDO was given three megahertz of scarce frequencies, which will ultimately enable it to take on more customers. **********""Any cellular provider in the world would die for those frequencies,"" said an executive of an American telecommunications company, who asked not to be further identified. ""It's a license to print money."" **********Indeed, IDO's problems are largely of its own making. The DDI Corporation, which competes with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in the cellular-phone business outside the Tokyo-Nagoya region, chose from the start to use Motorola equipment. DDI has about half the cellular phone customers in the areas in which it competes and it has healthy profits. **********But IDO has only about 30 to 35 percent of the cellular customers in its service area and is essentially unprofitable. **********While IDO's debt is high, it has strong shareholders, like the Toyota Motor Corporation and Tokyo Electric Power. Because of the pressure from Washington, these shareholders will now chip in to give IDO more money than it would otherwise have had, to accelerate what it would have done anyway -- build up its Motorola system."

The tit for tat would be Israeli recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights, paving the way for an eventual withdrawal. **********Despite more than two years of talks and occasional glimmers of hoped-for progress, the two nations have basically gone nowhere. Syria offers peace, but says it first wants Israel to commit itself to leaving the Golan, where about 13,000 Israelis live. Israel says it is prepared to pull back, at least partly, but first wants to hear what the Syrians mean by peace. They have been like that, the Alphonse and Gaston of Middle East diplomacy, for many months. **********The question now is whether the equation is about to change and, if so, whether it will qualify as a breakthrough. **********Some Israeli officials and academic experts see an imminent shift, arguing that Mr. Assad will not risk going to Geneva empty-handed if he wants to improve relations with the United States, especially to get Syria scratched from Washington's list of countries that sponsor terrorism. **********There are other subjects likely to be taken up with Mr. Clinton, including the fate of several hundred Jews remaining in Syria, the alleged Syrian involvement in Middle East drug trafficking, Syria's links to Iran, its abetment of radical Palestinian groups and its continued purchases of advanced weapons like Scud missiles from North Korea. **********But the core issue is generally considered to be the future of the Golan, a source of much of Israel's water and a plateau that Syria had used before 1967 to shell northern Israeli settlements. **********""I would guess that this is the time for Assad to say publicly, or at least to whisper in Mr. Clinton's ear, what he means by full peace,"" said Moshe Maoz, a Hebrew University professor who specializes in Syrian affairs. **********Optimists here have been encouraged by signals like reported remarks last week by Abdel Halim Khaddam, Syria's Vice President, that ""normalization"" is a part of talks with Israel. **********If the talks in Geneva go well, the United States is expected to announce a resumption of long-suspended peace talks in Washington on Jan. 24, not only between Israel and Syria but also between Israel and Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. The Palestinian track, however, has been overtaken by the ""declaration of principles"" signed in September by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, whose negotiators are still struggling to turn it into a workable agreement. **********Not all Israelis are sure they will hear magic words from Geneva. **********Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, normally a leading optimist, cautioned today that Mr. Assad ""keeps the cards very close to his chest"" and that while the meeting with Mr. Clinton ""is an opportunity, it is not yet progress."" **********Opinion polls suggest that Israelis overwhelmingly oppose a full withdrawal from the Golan, many of them convinced that the main reason for years of quiet on the Syrian border is that fact that their tanks command the plateau, 40 miles from Damascus."

Robert Levine is that kind of guy, and he has brought this same aggressiveness to his rapidly growing computer equipment company. In the process, he has rubbed more than a few people the wrong way. **********Earlier this year, after a New Hampshire bank turned down Cabletron's bid to help overhaul its computer network operations, Cabletron began pulling its payroll of almost $80 million from the bank and urged its own employees to remove their accounts. **********When the utility selling electricity to Cabletron refused a bid for a computer networking contract, Cabletron threatened to get electricity elsewhere. Now the utility has agreed to negotiate lower rates for Cabletron. **********The man knows how to get his way, but some shake their heads over his methods. Barbara Ley Toffler, who specializes in corporate ethics at Resources for Responsible Management, a consulting firm in Boston, calls Cabletron's tactics ""stupid"" and ""irresponsible."" **********""They must think they have such a spectacular product that it will sell anyway,"" she said. ""It sure isn't the way most of us would like to do business."" **********But many of Cabletron's shareholders and customers have a different view. Mr. Levine's take-no-prisoners approach to business has helped sales jump almost 500 percent in five years, to a projected $600 million for the year ending tomorrow, and rewarded shareholders with a sevenfold increase in Cabletron's stock. **********""I think sophisticated investors don't really focus on that sort of thing, the personality of the management,"" said Danielle Danese, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York. ""They are simply looking to make money."" Of Cabletron's executives, she said, ""Who am I to judge their ethics?"" **********MR. LEVINE, 36, who is also president, runs Cabletron with Craig R. Benson, 39, chairman and chief operating officer. With headquarters in this city in southeastern New Hampshire, the company manufactures, sells and installs computer networking equipment, employing 3,300 people in 70 offices around the world. **********Cabletron started in 1983 in Mr. Levine's garage in Ashland, Mass. Mr. Levine, a sales representative for some cable companies, teamed up with Mr. Benson, one of his customers. That was when businesses with personal computers were beginning to realize the need for linking office computers into a network. **********Cabletron, which went public in 1989 at $15.50 a share and closed at $121 a share on Friday, offers diagnostic equipment that allows office computer users to adjust to networking problems without tearing out their hardware. The company has expanded into so-called smart hubs, hardware that guides networked traffic among office and corporate personal computers. Earlier this month, Cabletron introduced a switch that more efficiently connects computers; analysts say the new product should help the company continue its strong growth. **********""Cabletron will emerge as the most powerful company in the market for networking equipment by mid-1996, and it likely will grow in both revenues and earnings by greater than 30 percent per year,"" said Paul Johnson, an analyst for CS First Boston in New York. ""I don't think investors and Wall Street fully appreciate how well positioned in the market and how well managed it is."" **********Cabletron has few middle-management executives. Most of the key decisions are made by the two top men. **********Mr. Levine's office says a lot about how he does business. It is a 10- by 15-foot cubicle suggestive not of a chief executive but of a middle manager fighting his way to the top. There is nothing plush or lavish about it, no suggestion that this is the office of someone whose personal fortune is estimated at more than $700 million. **********""I don't operate that way, and in that type of atmosphere,"" Mr. Levine said. ""Can't do it. Don't like it."" **********A dress shirt hangs over one of the two cloth-covered chairs, piled high with papers, reports and marketing brochures; there is a set of dumbbells in the corner, which he uses to tone his short, muscular frame. There is a metal desk messy with more paper and vitamin bottles. **********The meetings at Cabletron are as no-nonsense as Mr. Levine's office. Many are in a tiny room with a waist-high table but no chairs. The idea is to keep the meetings brief. **********Like a religious zealot, Mr. Levine talks about keeping promises, customer service and aggressive marketing. ""You have to have passion and show it to make things work,"" he said. **********That passion, and the resulting publicity, makes some of the company's customers nervous, said Cabletron's marketing director, Michael Welts, who tries to apply a softer spin to the company's hard-edged reputation. **********One stinging article about Cabletron appeared last April in The Wall Street Journal. It described how Mr. Levine had startled sales recruits at a ""foul-mouthed pep talk"" by plunging a large combat knife into a beach ball that bore the name of their chief competitor, SynOptics Communications of Santa Clara, Calif., and exhorting his staff to ""go get them."" **********There is also an infamous internal Cabletron memorandum about SynOptics, in which Mr. Levine, adopting a line from General Patton, wrote to his staff, ""I don't want to stop until every last trace of that company is wiped off the face of this earth."" **********In 1992 Cabletron got into trouble with the New Hampshire attorney general for soliciting contributions for the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial candidate it backed, Ed Dupont. The company wrote to its suppliers making it clear that it would have difficulty doing business with those who did not contribute to Mr. Dupont. **********The attorney general warned Cabletron against repeating such political solicitations, and Mr. Dupont returned the contributions generated by Cabletron's actions. Mr. Dupont is now the company's lobbyist at the state capital. **********Mr. Benson said he feared that some news accounts had distorted Cabletron's image. ""I don't think we're as bad as the press says we are,"" he said. **********Mr. Benson, who unlike Mr. Levine has an M.B.A., has personal wealth exceeding $590 million. His tidy office is next to Mr. Levine's. Discussing the most recent Cabletron imbroglio involving First NH Bank, Mr. Benson said: ""What they did simply didn't make business sense. It was dumb."" **********The bank rejected a Cabletron bid for a computer networking contract, estimated to be worth $250,000, and gave it to SynOptics. **********Mr. Levine and Mr. Benson were furious. In a memorandum to the company's work force on Jan. 10, Mr. Levine said the bank's automatic teller machine at the Cabletron headquarters had been disconnected. ""We are severing all ties with the bank, and to the extent that you can do business with other banks, we would appreciate it,"" the memo said. **********Then, this month, Cabletron began pulling its almost $80 million payroll account out of the bank. **********Mr. Benson, who said he thought some bank executives considered him and Mr. Levine ""yahoos and cowboys,"" said: ""We competed for business at First NH. We had our payroll account there and we told them right up front we expected this to be a two-way relationship."" **********Cabletron also played tough with the utility giant Northeast Utilities of Connecticut, parent of New Hampshire's largest utility, the Public Service Company of New Hampshire. **********Last fall, Northeast Utilities rejected Cabletron's bid for an $8 million contract to link the utility's corporate network computers, instead awarding the contract to SynOptics. **********Mr. Benson complained to New Hampshire's Congressional delegation, saying, ""That particular job would have meant 80 new jobs in New Hampshire."" He swore Cabletron would find cheaper electricity elsewhere. **********Since then, the utility has agreed to negotiate a new rate contract with Cabletron. **********Andrew K. Ludwick, president and chief executive of SynOptics, said Cabletron's actions with First NH Bank and Northeast Utilities were part of a pattern of tough sales tactics. ""It poses a challenge to answer those tactics while not becoming just like them,"" he said. ""I think it's fair to say we think what they do is outrageous. **********""However, they've been a successful company, and as long as they comply with the law, I guess the market will have to deal with them."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/24/business/consumer-spending-up-again.html,,1994-12-24,,819,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Consumer Spending Up Again,Consumer Spending Up Again," **********American consumers are on a late-year spending binge that may produce headaches in 1995, according to economic reports released today. **********Despite a slight drop in personal income last month, consumer spending climbed briskly again in November, rising six-tenths of 1 percent and embracing a wide variety of goods and services, the Commerce Department reported. **********Indeed, it is possible, economists say, that overextended households could cause the economy to slow more than policy makers at the Federal Reserve desire and stir fears of recession. **********""What we have is strong spending and weak incomes,"" said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ""Over time, that can't last."" **********Personal income fell one-tenth of a percent in November, after a big 1.4 percent advance in October that largely reflected bonus payments in the auto industry and one-time subsidy payments to farmers. **********Despite this squeeze, which depressed the personal savings rate last month to 4.1 percent from a 4.8 percent rate in October, consumers actually became more confident with the approach of the gift-buying holidays. The University of Michigan's confidence index was put at 95.1 for December, subscribers to its service said today, up from 91.6 in November. **********In still another report on the economy today, orders to the nation's factories for long-lived goods, from camcorders to artillery shells, surged 3.4 percent in November. **********Although this was a bigger advance than generally expected, close scrutiny suggested that this sector of the economy might already be softening after buttressing the business expansion for the last two years. The increase was concentrated in airplanes and cars. Orders for durables -- goods intended to last at least three years -- were up only eight-tenths of 1 percent when transportation equipment was excluded. The transportation sector rebounded by a strong 12.5 percent after a 9.5 percent plunge in October. **********Orders for primary metals eased 1.2 percent, the first decline since July, and orders for industrial machinery were unchanged. Moreover, said Laurence H. Meyer, a financial consultant in St. Louis, orders for capital goods other than aircraft and military items -- a closely watched indicator of investment in new factories -- fell 1.2 percent last month. **********Still, the biggest threat to the business expansion -- the last economic downturn ended in March 1991 -- is the consumer, whose spending at retail counters and for such things as medical care and college tuition accounts for two-thirds of all business activity. **********Personal savings, at scarcely 4 percent for 1993 and 1994, is at the lowest rate since records began being compiled in 1929, providing little extra cushion against post-holiday bills. **********More confident about their own job prospects and less worried about the future, consumers have been running up big credit card bills to finance personal spending. But some analysts wonder how long Americans can maintain the pace at which they have been borrowing. Consumer installment credit, the Federal Reserve reported early this month, grew at a 15.8 percent annual rate in October as all three categories posted double-digit increases. **********""There is a lot of borrowing -- but it will slow,"" said David Littmann, senior economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit. **********By spring, Mr. Littman added, households may be pinched as higher interest rates start to bite. Still, many analysts say the Federal Reserve can succeed in its effort to slow the pace of the economy without producing a stall. The quarter that ends next week is expected to be the second straight in which domestic output will rise at an annual pace of 4 percent or more. **********""The consumer can't keep up this rapid pace,"" said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. But he said any pullback would not be too sharp as long as job growth remained solid. **********Mr. Dederick largely dismissed today's report of lower personal income because of the special factors that had produced an exceptionally big gain for October. In addition to the subsidy payments to farmers and bonuses to auto workers, there was a sharp increase, reversed in November, in the length of the workweek. **********Looking forward, the consumer sentiment index may also be pointing to troubles down the road. The University of Michigan's index, though 3.5 points higher for December as a whole, eased to 95.1 at the end of the month from its midmonth reading of 97.7. Consumers' assessment of current conditions, at 104.9, is more optimistic than the 88.8 for the months ahead. **********The Commerce Department's report on orders for durable goods included a 7.7 percent decline for military hardware after a 16.8 percent October drop. **********Shipments of durables rebounded 2.8 percent after two straight declines while unfilled orders climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, the third straight monthly increase."

""We are poorer now than three years ago, and we have fewer jobs."" An Orderly Crowd **********Fearing violence and congestion, the police closed the center of the city to most traffic for scores of blocks. An estimated 20,000 officers backed by armored cars mounted with water cannons lined the streets. **********There were no reports of violence, and after the two-hour protest, the demonstrators disbanded peacefully. **********The crowd filled Plaza de Mayo, where throngs had gathered in the 1950's to cheer Juan Peron and his beautiful and popular wife, Eva; where military leaders were cheered when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982, and where the mothers of Argentine leftists who had disappeared marched in silence every Thursday during Argentina's ""dirty war"" in the 1980's. **********There were unionists of all kinds, representing state workers, teachers, truck drivers, pharmaceutical workers, electricians and farmers. There were right-wingers, Communists, Socialists, homosexual organizations. **********The protesters betrayed anger and frustration in their voices as they stood in the cold, beating drums, chanting and holding banners. **********They talked of their salaries, which they said did not cover living expenses, and their sense that in many provinces, there was no economic future. They spoke of corruption among Government leaders and the vast new wealth that many entrepreneurs in Buenos Aires are accumulating. Macro vs. Micro **********Leticia Molina pulled out her monthly statement showing what she received from a Government pension and Social Security: $218.50. **********""What can I do with that,"" she said. ""How can the Government expect me to live, to eat. We have grandmothers now walking the streets because they don't have enough."" **********Indeed, the march today highlighted one of the great problems for Mr. Menem and his Economy Minister, Domingo F. Cavallo. The Government has brought inflation down from more than 5,000 percent in 1989 to under 5 percent today. Argentina's economic and industrial growth has been among the highest in the world since 1991, and the country has received tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment as it sold off huge state enterprises. It is, among Latin American countries, a model for change and modernization. **********But while Mr. Menem has focused on macro-economic issues, he has neglected new social programs, the retraining of laid-off Government workers, education, health care and housing. Unemployment has doubled, to more than 10 percent. And the impact of the economic growth has been slight in the far provinces, where businesses have shut down and the state has been left to subsidize workers at paltry sums. Have-Nots in the Countryside **********In the province of Catamarca, workers in the capital get $230 a month, while state workers in the countryside get $130. Mario Rodriguez, a state worker from the agricultural province of La Pampa, said he gets $280 a month. **********""We have to break the neo-liberal model of Menem and Cavallo,"" Mr. Rodriguez said. ""The lower-middle-class worker is paying for this adjustment, not the businessman. He is just getting richer."" **********For his part, Mr. Menem described the march as ""a direct attack on the country, not on the Government"" and said the protest ""would accomplish absolutely nothing."" **********Still, the Government worries about growing social unrest in the provinces. Last December, in the northwestern province of Santiago del Estero, Government workers burned and sacked offices, the court house and the legislature. Workers have staged more moderate uprisings in Jujuy, La Rioja, Catamarca, Salta and Tierra del Fuego. **********""The real initiators of this march are the people from the interior of the country,"" said Carlos Alvarez, a member of Congress who has formed a leftist alliance, the Broad Front, to oppose Mr. Menem. ""They feel they are left out. The Government cannot ignore this."""

The very logic of an international information superhighway, he insisted, would be undermined by imposing national regulations. **********""If Europe doesn't get a grip on this, it will fall further and further and further behind the United States and Japan,"" he said. **********The call for a free and open telecommunications market is gathering steam just as 17 public telephone companies in 15 European countries are about to test an integrated broadband network designed to control transmission and delivery of high-speed data, voice and video data. **********The tests, to begin by summer, are expected to involve businesses that might use the system for high-quality videoconferencing or transferring large quantities of information. **********Building a multimedia network is expected to cost Europe hundreds of billions of dollars. But industry leaders say investors would not be attracted to such a venture as long as European telecommunications companies - the likely operators of such a highway - are protected and constrained by regulations. **********They seek freedom to make alliances, to go after cross-border markets and to let supply and demand determine prices. **********Voice telephone services in the European Union are to be opened to competition by the start of 1998. But there has been no agreement about freeing the market for infrastructure items, and none is expected in the next few years. As a result, national operators are guaranteed monopolies in their home countries and are prevented from laying cables in markets beyond their frontiers. **********In addition, under current regulations, telecommunications services must be priced according to the cost of delivery, rather than to what it might be worth to the customer. **********Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti SpA, said that unless it makes a drastic break from its national, monopolistic tradition, Europe will be sabotaging its brightest hope for fighting unemployment. **********""The only thing which unites Europe today is unemployment,"" he said. ""Europe cannot compete in low-value products and labor costs. It has to compete in activities based on knowledge and professional skills."" An information superhighway, he said, would facilitate development of such activities - but it cannot be built in today's regulatory environment. **********""People have to realize that out-and-out defense of nonmarket conditions in the communications industry will benefit no one and penalize everyone,"" he said. ""The monopoly environment is our weakness."" **********Before investors will help build a multimedia network in Europe, the industry leaders said, telephone companies that transmit and organize the flow of data through the system will need freedom to charge what the market will pay for their services. **********Mr. Vallance said operators of such systems should be able to charge according to the value of the information that is passing through their networks, rather than by current ""cost-accounting"" restrictions, which require the operators to deliver services based on the actual cost of transmitting data through the system. **********""If I dig up a nugget of gold and have to hand it over for the price of digging it up, is that fair?"" he asked. **********In the case of a multimedia network, industry proponents argue that operators and ""content providers"" should be able to charge much more for a blockbuster movie delivered over the system than for a classic from the archives or for two hours of electronic browsing through an interactive encyclopedia. **********But investors' need for value-based pricing is likely to conflict with demands by European governments that all citizens have economical access to the system and its services. **********""The real question is whether an information superhighway should be considered a universal service, to be affordable to everyone, or whether it should be viewed as an extra, like mobile telephones,"" a telecommunications policy official at the European Commission said. ""There will be a lot of political pressure to make it universal, and that means price controls."""

An I.R.S. Loan -- With a Big Catch","YOUR TAXES;
An I.R.S. Loan -- With a Big Catch"," **********MANY upper-income taxpayers who were counting on a two-year interest-free loan from the Government to help finance their additional 1993 taxes will get an unpleasant surprise in the next few weeks. **********One of the final additions to last year's tax law allows people to pay additional taxes owed because of the two new brackets -- 36 percent and 39.6 percent -- in three installments. The payments are due April 15, 1994; April 17, 1995, and April 15, 1996. **********The measure was added to create a sense of fairness in light of the retroactive nature of the law. Withholding tables were not changed last year, and estimated quarterly payments did not have to reflect the rates, even though the higher brackets apply to all 1993 income. **********Many high-income people can expect a hefty tax bill on April 15. ""We have clients who will owe an extra $100,000,"" said Stuart Kessler, a partner in Goldstein, Golub, Kessler & Company in New York. ""It's great to have that interest-free loan."" **********The spoiler is the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., which was enacted by Congress several years ago to make certain that even people with a number of tax breaks pay some tax. All taxpayers who want to use the two-year deferral must figure out what their tax liability would be under the alternative tax. If the taxpayer's A.M.T. is higher than his regular tax, he must pay the higher amount; no deferral is allowed. **********But even taxpayers relieved to find they do not have to pay the alternative tax face another hurdle. Deferrals are limited to the difference between taxes owed under the old rates and the lower of the 1993 regular tax bill, or the 1993 A.M.T. tax bill. Many people are caught in this trap. **********""We're finding that most of our clients will not be entitled to spread their additional tax over the three years because they are subject to the creeping A.M.T.,"" said Laurence I. Foster, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick in New York. **********Eligible for the deferral are single people with taxable income of more than $115,000, couples filing jointly with income of more than $140,000 and head-of-household filers with more than $127,500 in income -- all of which fall in the 36 percent bracket. All taxpayers with taxable income of more than $250,000 are in the 39.6 percent bracket. **********A taxpayer with a 1993 tax bill of $100,000 who would have paid $90,000 under the old rates is entitled to spread the extra $10,000 over three payments. He has to pay $93,333 by April 15, postponing $6,666. To claim the deferral, he also has to file a new form, 8841, with his return. **********Accountants emphasize that it is important to pay enough in the first installment. ""The I.R.S. said it will reserve the right to call in the whole amount if you do not pay enough by April 15,"" said James E. Velten, senior tax manager in the New York office of Coopers & Lybrand. **********But other accountants say most of their clients do not receive all the necessary information by that date and must file form 4868 for an extension until Aug. 15. ""More than half of our clients are on extension every year and that cannot be avoided,"" Mr. Velten said. **********Filing for an extension will not automatically eliminate the installment option. But figuring out how much to pay will be difficult without all the completed paperwork. ""I don't think most people are aware of how critical it is to have an accurate estimate on April 15,"" Mr. Kessler said. **********Taxpayers who file for an extension must send a check and form 4868, the request for an extension, by April 15. Any shortfall incurs a penalty of half a percent a month and interest of 7 percent a year, which adds up to a 13 percent annual interest rate. And paying too little will automatically rule out the two-year deferral. **********Pay too little, and the I.R.S. calls in the loan. Pay too much, and you've defeated the purpose. Barry Salzberg, partner in charge of the personal tax practice for Deloitte & Touche, said, ""It would behoove people to get as close as they can, because the interest-free loan is valuable and should not be given up cavalierly."" **********Still, accountants say that as many as half their clients are disappointed when they discover how little they can defer. **********""I use an example in my lectures where a couple would anticipate they would be able to defer $9,800 based on the regular tax rates,"" said William G. Brennan, a financial consultant in Washington. ""Because of the A.M.T., they ended up with a deferral of $829."""

He reportedly told the Cabinet at its weekly meeting that Israel could no longer rely on oral agreements with the Palestinian leadership and would insist that everything be put down on paper from now on. **********As a result of his stern remarks, it seems increasingly doubtful that the Israelis and Palestinians will resume their negotiations in the next few days, as has been expected. Both Sides Willing to Talk **********A senior P.L.O. negotiator, Nabil Shaath, said in Cairo that while both sides were ready to talk, ""the conditions for going back"" were unclear. **********Aides to Mr. Rabin insisted that there was no crisis and predicted that the two sides would ultimately clear away the obstacles that had caused them to miss their target date of Dec. 13 for the start of an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. **********""This is like a Middle East bazaar, and we're playing by Middle East rules,"" said Gad Ben-Ari, a spokesman for Mr. Rabin. ""You have to play it cool and with lot of patience."" **********But while the impasse may largely reflect brinkmanship on both sides, it underlines how flimsy the two sides' trust is despite the heralded agreement in September that supposedly turned Israel and the P.L.O. into partners for peace. It also casts doubt on the entire timetable for an assumption of Palestinian self-rule in the territories. Pullback of Troops Delayed **********For example, Israeli leaders said repeatedly that the scheduled Dec. 13 start of the pullback from Gaza and Jericho was far less important than the April 13 target for completing it. Lately, they have begun to question whether April 13 is reasonable. And that, in turn, throws a shadow over plans for Palestinian elections and a companion spread of self-rule throughout the West Bank by mid-July. **********In interviews over the last few days Mr. Rabin has sounded relaxed about deadlines, saying that time was on Israel's side and that he would take as long as needed to reach a satisfactory agreement. The state-owned radio quoted him as having delivered the same message to his Cabinet today. **********""We are not in a rush,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Let them sweat."" **********The immediate dispute is over whether Israel and the P.L.O. came to terms during talks in Cairo last week on crucial issues like the size of the autonomous Jericho district, checks at border crossings and other security arrangements. 'Meeting of Minds' **********Israel insists that there was a ""meeting of minds,"" a point repeated today by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who led the Israeli negotiators in Cairo. He said he and his P.L.O. counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, had reached understandings, with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on hand as a witness. **********Just as insistently, P.L.O. leaders say the so-called agreement was nothing but a draft of the Israeli position. It was subsequently rejected by Mr. Arafat, who offered his latest thoughts on border controls and Jericho's size in a letter sent to Mr. Rabin by fax several days ago. **********It is an important dispute, for Mr. Rabin asserts that the basis for future talks is the accord he says was reached in Cairo. Mr. Arafat is now backpedaling, the Prime Minister charges. And if that is the case, he warns, everything can be renegotiated as though from the beginning. **********The P.L.O. leader has taken a similarly tough stand, warning that Palestinians will not accept what he calls Israeli attempts to ""humiliate"" them. Mr. Arafat argues that Israel's insistence on control over border passages for security reasons would turn Gaza and Jericho into equivalents of bantu stans, the so-called black ""homelands"" created under apartheid rule in South Africa. **********""We will not live in bantustans,"" he told a Palestinian gathering in Jericho today by telephone from his headquarters in Tunis. **********As the tug-of-war continues, there are signs that Israel may rechannel its energies into long-stalled talks with Syria. **********In two weeks, President Clinton is supposed to meet with President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva, and some officials here say the Syrian leader is unlikely to go empty-handed. **********Possible new directions were suggested this weekend, with disclosures that Israeli and Syrian academics had met secretly in Norway in October, agreeing on a document in which the Syrians spelled out a detailed vision of ""full peace"" that would take effect in return for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967. **********While neither side represented an official position, an Israeli participant, Yossi Olmert, said the Israeli Government had been kept informed and that the Syrians had been there with their Government's blessing. **********""The positions they express may be a little ahead of the official Government position, but it will become the official Government position in due course,"" said Mr. Olmert, who negotiated with Syria under the previous Israeli Government, led by the Likud Party. **********--------------------       A P.L.O. CHALLENGE TO ARAFAT **********AMMAN, JORDAN, Jan. 2 (Reuters) -- A group of P.L.O. leaders flew to Tunis today to call for changes in what they see as Yasir Arafat's autocratic style of management. **********""We want to broaden the bases for decision-making so it will not stand in the hands"" of Mr. Arafat alone, said the leader of the delegation, Haidar Abdelshafi, the chief Palestinian negotiator at peace talks with Israel, after arriving in Tunis. **********The group's demands are the widest challenge yet to Mr. Arafat's style of leadership from the Palestinian establishment since the P.L.O. signed its accord with Israel."

In a California speech reported around 1 P.M., Eastern time, yesterday, Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco and a proponent of higher rates, said, ""We still have a way to go"" in fighting inflation. **********Mr. Parry gave his speech the day after the Fed raised short-term interest rates for the third time in less than three months. **********The bond market, whose securities lose value when rates rise, understandably reeled from the news. But the stock market plunged even more steeply. Shortly before 1:45 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 31 points. Then traders took less than an hour to bid up the Dow industrials to recover the lost ground. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 had a similar recovery. **********Generally strong first-quarter earnings ought to have sustained the rally but did not. Chrysler, Philip Morris, Citicorp, GTE, Lockheed and Sprint all reported higher first-quarter profits. But after gyrating wildly, two stocks closed down and two closed up, but only feebly. The exceptions were Philip Morris, which closed up 1 3/4, to 51 7/8, and GTE, which closed up 1 1/2, to 31 5/8. Dow Industrials Down **********Over all, the Dow and the S. & P. 500 were essentially unchanged yesterday and the Nasdaq composite index continued its decline. The Dow industrials fell 0.60 point, to 3,619.82, and the S. & P. 500 rose 0.08 point, to 442.54. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index fell 7.60 points, to 712.85. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.33 point, to 245.37. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,491 to 749. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 2.90 points, to 431.10. **********Many traders took advantage of the lower prices for stocks and came in from the sidelines to buy. Volume yesterday for the New York Stock exchange totaled nearly 324 million shares, or more than 6 percent above this year's average of about 304 million shares. **********Stock traders may deepen their concern about the effect of higher interest rates on housing. The Government is scheduled to report March housing starts today and the consensus estimate of Wall Street economists is for a 7.9 percent rise. **********""There'll be a tremendous amount of interest in the housing numbers,"" said Mary C. Farrell, an investment strategist for Paine Webber. If the housing figure is higher, it will confirm traders' fears of inflation. If it is lower, the figure may accelerate some worries about an economy slowed by rising interest rates, Ms. Farrell said. **********The new interest-rate arithmetic so far is painful for home buyers. One of the cheapest mortgages available goes for 8.26 percent, up from 7.13 percent in January. That means on a 30-year, $100,000 mortgage, the monthly payment has risen almost $80, to $750. **********Yesterday, lumber prices fell for the 14th time in 16 trading sessions.

""He's a specialist in horsepower,"" explains Bill Ruger Sr., the chief executive of the Sturm Ruger Firearms Company, who is also a Callaway customer. ""If Callaway weren't independent, he could be a top researcher for one of the big auto makers."" **********But the past successes and apparently realistic ambitions of the man and his eponymous car company with just 35 employees also suggest some surprising things about manufacturing in general and the auto industry in particular. For while small shops have been modifying cars to exotic tastes for decades, the latest generation of computers and machine tools now gives nimble entrepreneurs the opportunity to mesh the organizational advantages of small size with advanced design and production techniques. **********The new Callaway will compete head to head with the best from Ferrari and Porsche. And a new engine the company is building for a consortium of military contractors will be the first to use space-age alloys. ""Large scale can be an albatross,"" notes David E. Davis, the editor of Automobile Magazine. **********Mr. Callaway, the son of a textile industry executive, was car-crazy from an early age, souping up an Austin-Healy on his own in high school and restoring an old Ferrari as his senior project in fine arts at Amherst. After a few years on the professional racing circuit, ""I decided I couldn't earn a living as a driver,"" remembers Mr. Callaway. So he persuaded BMW to let him attach a turbocharger to one of the company's crisply handling but underpowered compacts. **********That modest project led to the creation of Callaway Turbosystems, which made a promotional splash adding turbo-thrust to Alfa Romeo coupes and eventually caught the eye of executives at Chevrolet. ""Cars need a shot of publicity in the middle of the product cycle,"" allows Mr. Callaway. **********In an arrangement without precedent for General Motors, Chevrolet sold and warrantied Callaway Twin Turbo Corvettes through its own dealer network. All told, 500 copies of the $60,000 car that Motor Trend Magazine called the ""pacemaker for the heartbeat of America"" were sold before Chevrolet retooled the Corvette engine in 1992. **********NOW Callaway has moved on, reworking Chevrolet's mass-market Camaro into the 400-horsepower Callaway Super Natural C8 -- in Mr. Davis's opinion, ""a wonderful example of where hot-rodding is going."" **********The C8, incidentally, improves the 0-60 miles-an-hour time of the already powerful stock Camaro from 6.3 seconds to 4.8. And while the $40,000 C8, along with a Corvette with the Super Natural engine, are likely to remain the financial mainstays of the company for some time, Mr. Callaway never pauses to smell the scorched rubber. **********Under an agreement with Bill Ruger Sr. the company is transforming the most advanced mass production engine of the 1930's, the 150-horsepower, 8-cylinder Stutz DV32, into a fuel-injected, electronically controlled 300-horsepower behemoth. And with money from NASA and a group of private contractors, Callaway is designing a 1.5 liter V-8 engine roughly the size of a cinder block that will generate 200 horsepower. The idea, says Richard Delagi, a senior scientist at Texas Instruments, which is leading the effort, is to demonstrate the commercial potential of ultralight, ultrastrong materials -- everything from titanium aluminides to a composite of iron, chromium, aluminum and yttrium. **********BUT Mr. Callaway's first love is racing. In 1989 he built the one-of-a-kind, 880-horsepower Sledgehammer, which set a closed-course speed record for a car that could be used for everyday driving -- a remarkable 254 miles an hour. That same year he built an engine for Aston-Martin that helped the British car manufacturer achieve a respectable 11th place finish in the Le Mans endurance race. And last summer he put his own V-8 in a modified Corvette, which performed well in a handful of endurance races in Europe and Japan. **********A comparable 560-horsepower engine is currently being fitted to a freshly designed carbon-fiber body and chassis. Mr. Callaway plans to race what the company has dubbed the C7 during the 1995 season, and then sell a street-legal ""grand touring"" version in 1996 for $150,000. **********That is a lot of money, even for a powerful, luxurious sports car, but a lot less than the price of the comparably styled and powered Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bugattis already on the road. And with a horsepower-to-weight ratio that rivals motorcycles built for racing, it promises to be the highest performance car on earth that can meet American emissions requirements. **********Reeves Callaway's relentless pursuit of speed is interesting in its own right. What makes it more interesting is that the enterprise is successful in a market cluttered with the products of huge corporations. **********One explanation for the company's success is that small, highly motivated organizations have inherent advantages over big ones. Mass production auto makers spend much of their effort coordinating the activities of task forces, argues Derek Peacock, Callaway's engine development manager. **********""YOU could just not get the quick reaction time from a Ford or a Porsche,"" agrees Mr. Delagi of Texas Instruments. And sometimes it shows in spectacular ways: the car that Callaway raced last summer went from conception to track in just three months. **********But the David-Goliath analogy is, in part, misleading. The internal combustion engine is a mature technology, explains Mr. Callaway. ""There are no breakthrough ideas left."" Hence the big car makers devote most of their engineering budgets to finding least-cost solutions to well-understood problems. ""Our job is the glory end,"" he says, where cost is a secondary consideration and the manufacturer is not constrained by the need to produce hundreds of reliable copies each day. **********Another explanation, suggest Mr. Davis, is that American auto makers have created a pool of engine technology that is no longer fashionable, but can be relatively easily modified for whiz-bang performance. While Japanese and European engine makers are mostly heading toward small-displacement engines that can achieve enormous power only by turning over very rapidly, Callaway's new engines are variations of older American designs that can generate a lot of power at low R.P.M.'s because the cylinders are very large. **********That makes them easier to build with standardized components and more reliable under the stress of racing. It also permits gut-wrenching acceleration from a standing start -- the special muscle-car feel that resonates in the hearts of American boys of all ages. **********Yet another explanation is that advances in technology do not always favor those with the deepest pockets. While Nissan depends on supercomputers to design stiffer auto frames, high technology also makes it possible for very small scale producers like Callaway to achieve high standards at affordable cost. **********OFF-THE-SHELF software permits Derek Peacock to simulate engine performance the way Boeing simulates the lift of a newly designed wing. Questions that used to take weeks or months to answer with a mock-up on a test bed can now be answered on a personal computer in a matter of seconds. **********A pair of computer-controlled machine tools, small enough to fit in a pick-up truck, give Callaway the capacity to cut metal in an infinite variety of shapes, and to tolerances of ten-thousandth's of an inch. Hence, cast cylinder heads can be precision-modified, and custom-designed engine parts can be duplicated with great accuracy. **********Modern engines all depend on computerized controls that could not possibly be made in the Callaway factory, which is little more than a well-equipped garage. But with the cooperation of other manufacturers existing digital engine controllers, which regulate everything from fuel injection to the cooling fan, can be reprogrammed to match the needs of high performance engines. **********Indeed, the electronics revolution has dramatically simplified small-scale engine production by allowing microprocessors to do the work of exceptionally complicated and delicate mechanical systems. ""We can do almost anything with engines,"" concludes Mr. Peacock. **********Will ""anything"" include winning at Le Mans and then selling the whole car as the first American super-exotic car since the Duesenberg? Mr. Callaway makes no secret of his compulsion to make waves. ""If I can't lead,"" he says, ""I can certainly push."""

But the deadline came and went with at least half that number still behind bars, captives to differences between Israel and the P.L.O. over the terms of the deal they had struck. **********The dispute led to a standoff tonight between Israel and the Palestinians over about 250 other prisoners that the Israelis had tried to take to Jericho, on the West Bank. Touches a Nerve **********The issue is an emotional one for many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank because they regard their estimated 9,000 compatriots in Israeli hands as political prisoners, even prisoners of war, in the anti-Israel resistance. Virtually every one of the two million Palestinians in the territories has done prison time or has a relative or friend who has. **********Many Israelis also consider it a delicate matter. From their vantage, they have locked up criminals, including terrorists. In fact, some Israelis label all Palestinian prisoners terrorists. While many did commit violent acts, people from the territories have also been held for writing nationalist graffiti and displaying Palestinian flags, and for other political activities that are now carried out openly. **********The May 4 agreement that put Palestinian self-rule in motion in Gaza and Jericho said about 5,000 prisoners would be freed by June 8. And it created two categories: people who would be released outright and others who would be ""turned over"" to the Palestinian National Authority, the provisional government for Gaza and Jericho, which is still being formed. **********Those who are to be ""turned over"" -- actual numbers were not mentioned -- would have to stay in Gaza or Jericho ""for the remainder of their sentences."" Defining Opponents **********As an added wrinkle, Israel tried to make sure it would not free active opponents of the peace talks, especially loyalists of the militant Muslim groups Hamas and Islamic Holy War. Israel insisted, as a condition for their release, that prisoners pledge to live in Gaza or Jericho, regardless of their origin, to renounce violence and to support the May 4 accord. **********In recent days many prisoners have balked at these requirements, arguing that it is unfair to exile them to Gaza or Jericho and to force them to follow a certain political line, one that endorses the agreement. Under internal pressure to champion the prisoners' cause, the P.L.O. also announced this week that it would not accept Israel's conditions, especially the one requiring people to remain in Gaza or Jericho. **********""This is from the chairman himself, and I informed the Israelis of this,"" Jamil al-Tarifi, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said, referring to Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader. **********To show it means business, the Palestinian police force in Jericho said that about 250 newly freed prisoners sent there tonight by Israel on buses could not enter. As the buses waited at a checkpoint outside town, it was not clear what would happen to those men. Jewish Blood vs. Arab Blood **********Israel has shown signs of flexibility, reflected in the composition of the 180 prisoners who were let go today and who wept and kissed the ground after arriving in Gaza. **********Initially, Israeli officials had said they would not release anyone with ""blood on his hands."" That has been modified, an army officer said, to Palestinians with ""Jewish blood on their hands."" **********Among those freed today were men who had killed fellow Palestinians accused of collaborating with the Israelis. Perhaps 50 or more fell into that category, including many sentenced to life imprisonment, Palestinians familiar with the cases said. **********Some of those released were also from Hamas, and the demand for pledges of support for the peace talks is effectively dead, an Israeli officer said. But the dispute on whether some prisoners must remain in Gaza and Jericho is still alive. It was not dealt with today because every prisoner released was said to have been a resident of Gaza."

Stock prices also stumbled briefly, But most of the major market indicators recovered in heavy trading. **********The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at 3,904.06, up 9.28 points. **********Some stock traders may have interpreted the selloff in the currency markets as beneficial to stocks, at least in the short run. The cheaper dollar is expected to help American exports. But the surge in the Japanese yen could also hurt Japan's ability to rebound from the recession. 'A Bad Thing' **********""For the U.S. economy, people are going to erroneously see this selloff as a piece of good news"" because it lowers the price of American exports, said David F. DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. ""I'm not a diplomat, I'm just a trader. But this is a bad thing because it's in our interest to see Japan come out of this terrible recession."" **********Stock traders are likely to focus on the turbulent currency markets today, even though much of the economic news this week is expected to be good. The Government is to report on January's industrial production today and January's Consumer Price Index on Thursday. **********Investors continue to be skittish because of the rise in short-term interest rates. ""The market is looking for an excuse to trade down,"" said Gregory A. Nie, vice president of technical research at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. ""It's looking to get disappointed."" **********Meanwhile, some traders are looking for the yen to possibly reach a historic level of fewer than 100 to the dollar if the Japanese central bank does not intervene to support the American currency. Dow's Retreat **********Yesterday's sharp selloff in the dollar culminated around 2:15 P.M. in a sharp drop in the bond market, possibly because of fear of renewed American inflation if Japanese-made goods rise in price. That in turn cascaded into a 15-point retreat in the Dow industrials within 15 minutes. **********Currency traders were astonished to see the Clinton Administration follow up the bitter breakup of the trade talks on Friday with the threat of sanctions. Traders interpreted the threats as a deliberate attempt to bring the yen-to-dollar ratio to 100. **********Still, the stock market recovered somewhat from the afternoon shakeout. Along with the Dow, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed with a slight gain for day, up 0.05 of a point, to 470.23. The Nasdaq composite index also closed up, rising 4.06 points, to 785.45. **********But the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 0.05 point, to 261.26. The American Stock Exchange composite index closed down 2.32 points at 474.91. **********Volume on the Big Board totaled 263.2 million shares, up from 213.7 million shares on Friday, when a severe snowstorm in New York City forced stock trading to end 90 minutes early. **********Paramount Communications was the most actively traded stock yesterday, closing down 3/4 at 76 1/8 on volume of 4.7 million shares. Traders and analysts widely expected Viacom to win the long battle for Paramount after QVC Network reiterated yesterday that it would not sweeten its bid for Paramount. **********Spectrum Information Technologies, the troubled company shaken by management disputes following the sudden resignation of its chief executive, John Sculley, was the second-most-active stock at 4.7 million shares. It closed up 1/16 at 37/16 . Rockefeller Center **********A notable decliner yesterday was Rockefeller Center Properties, which fell 1 3/8, to 6 3/8, on volume of 1.93 million shares. An article in Barron's questioned whether Rockefeller Center was recovering enough from its rent to cover its interest payments. **********Investors bid up the shares of economically sensitive stocks yesterday. Led by United Technologies, which rose 2, to 67 3/8, such companies as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Philip Morris, Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, I.B.M. and General Motors contributed the most to the 9.28-point rise in the Dow average."

But the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.80 points, to 764.28. **********Traders were wary in advance of tomorrow's report on the Producer Price Index and sold shares. Although inflation has remained modest so far this year, traders will scrutinize the report for signs it is heating up. Rising bond yields also coaxed money away from stocks, as the dollar steadied slightly. **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was about normal, with 292.1 million shares changing hands, about 2 percent above this year's average of 286 million shares. **********Yesterday was the seventh consecutive session where the Dow was at or near 3,900. Many analysts interpret the Dow's recent listlessness as an indication that the market will return to a ""sideways"" trend with the Dow bobbing up and down in a wide range. Between April and late August, the Dow generally traded between 3,600 and 3,800. **********William Dodge, chief investment strategist for Dean Witter Reynolds, predicts such an environment for September and October, with a higher trading range but a potential for a sharp downturn a few times. **********""You wind up more frustrated and pulling out your hair than really damaged,"" with a ruined portfolio, Mr. Dodge, a former portfolio manager, said. ""You're vulnerable to losing a little and not likely to make a whole lot."" Dollar Steadies Overseas **********The dollar steadied on international markets yesterday, in part because a Bundesbank official said that Germany had room to cut interest rates slightly, if it wanted to do so. **********The dollar's strength is significant for stock investors because it influences whether foreign investors will want to buy assets valued in dollars, like stocks and bonds. The Dow has gained 8.28 percent over the last year in dollars, but risen only 2.07 percent in terms of Japanese yen and 3.98 percent in German marks. **********But bond traders, far from bidding up dollar-denominated securities, focused on a small rise in commodities prices, after three consecutive days of decline. They bid bond prices down, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 7.56 percent from 7.54 percent. **********The stock market often takes its cue from the bond market. When prices of bonds fall, their interest rates, or yields, rise in order to attract more buyers. Thus, if yields rise, meaning bond prices are falling, many traders will sell or hold off buying stocks, thus driving stock prices down, especially stocks in the Dow and S. &P. 500 because they are the most easily sold. **********Economically sensitive stocks tended to be sold heavily, including three component stocks of the Dow. Du Pont fell 1 1/8, to 58 7/8; Union Carbide dropped 1 1/8, to 33, on no news that would account for the drop, although bidding for its Indian chemicals unit closed Tuesday, and Caterpillar fell 7/8, to 55 1/8, following a stock split Tuesday. Altogether 18 of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials fell **********Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 259 fell, led by Wal-Mart, which fell by 3/8, to 24 3/8, despite analysts' forecast of a potentially stronger September for retail sales. **********The most active stock, at 20.8 million shares, was Hanson, which fell 1/8, to 19 5/8, for its American depository receipts, possibly because of large selling of shares in London. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.33 point, to 259.78, with advancing stocks slightly lagging behind declining stocks, 1,036 to 1,114. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.68, to 455.32."

Sewing and Welding **********Perhaps most startling of these latest accusations are charges that Rockwell employees who were assigned to make sleeping bags and other gear for the space shuttle were making dresses and clothing for their families and friends, and that welders who were supposed to be making equipment for the shuttle were making parts for a racing car or doing their homework for outside classes. **********""For weeks at a time there was nothing to do but my homework,"" said Nancy Blanchard, who was a welder at a Rockwell research and development workshop in Houston from 1983 to 1986. ""I got a 4.0 grade point average that semester, and NASA paid for it."" **********She said that Rockwell supervisors instructed her and other employees to sign time cards indicating that they had worked full days. She said she objected to signing them. **********Rockwell officials say they find these accusations hard to believe because Rockwell has a rigorous internal policing program, including random spot-checks by auditors, extensive ethics training, a special telephone hot line that employees can call to report fraud and a computerized system to insure that work is billed to the correct contract. **********Last year, the hot line received 1,500 calls, Rockwell officials said, adding that between 1986 and 1993 the company dismissed 244 employees for time-charge violations and took disciplinary action against 1,115 workers for such abuses. **********Ms. Blanchard said that she reported the fraud she observed in Houston to Rockwell's hot line. Rockwell officials would not discuss her particular accusations but they said that in the mid-1980's company officials in Houston discovered an employee using sewing equipment for personal items at the plant where Ms. Blanchard worked. Disciplinary action was taken and improper time charges were corrected, the Rockwell officials said. A Company Response **********""No system is foolproof, but it seems highly unlikely that these allegations are true,"" said Robert Minor, president of Rockwell's Space Systems unit, in an interview at his office in Downey. ""You have to realize that more than 3,500 people have been laid off from this plant alone in our downsizing, and when people lose their jobs they are sometimes bitter."" **********Still, Jennifer Bremer, an assistant United States attorney in Los Angeles, said the Government was pressing ahead with the whistle-blower lawsuit, which was filed by David Vosoughkia, a former machinist at the Downey plant. ""The Justice Department rarely takes over the prosecution of whistle-blower lawsuits, and we would not have intervened in the Rockwell case if we didn't think it had merit,"" Ms. Bremer said. **********It is not known whether the former employees making the latest accusations intend to file whistle-blower lawsuits. Whistle-blowers share in any money recovered by the Government in such suits. **********Among the accusations in the Downey whistle-blower lawsuit are that Rockwell supervisors billed a NASA contract for work performed on a contract to make parts for the B-2 bomber and that the company charged NASA for time that shop employees used to make ashtrays and trophies for supervisors. **********Rockwell has said that so far its internal investigation has found no evidence of wrongdoing at Downey. **********Ms. Bremer declined to comment on the latest accusations involving Rockwell shops in Canoga Park and Houston, but private lawyers familiar with the Justice Department's inquiry said the agency was looking into the new accusations. **********The Canoga Park accusations come from a supervising machinist who worked at Rockwell's Rocketdyne machine shop there. He said that during the late 1980's he observed supervisors billing the space shuttle account for work done on the MX missile. The machinist, who lost his job in 1992 in a round of layoffs, spoke on condition that his name not be used for fear that Rockwell would remove him from the list of former employees who could be called back to work. **********The machinist said that in one instance a manager ordered him to change the paperwork for work on the space shuttle so that NASA would be billed at a higher rate. ""He told me that we were crossing contracts and that I should keep my mouth shut,"" the machinist said. **********Bill Blanning, a Rockwell spokesman, said the company could not respond to accusations made by the ""unnamed"" machinist at the Rocketdyne machine shop because ""we don't know who he is."" The spokesman said the shop had a computerized tracking system that would make it extremely difficult for someone to cross contracts, that is, charge work on one contract to another contract with a higher billing rate or some other feature more advantageous to the company.  No NASA Comment **********Asked to comment on the accusations, Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman, declined, saying that it would be inappropriate for the agency to do so while the Justice Department was investigating. **********This is not the first time that a Rockwell-operated machine shop has faced such questions. Last year, Rockwell paid $450,000 to settle a lawsuit by a whistle-blower who said that gift items had been manufactured at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, which Rockwell managed. The suit contended that the labor to make the gifts, which included gold- and silver-plated jewelry, wine presses, and memorial plaques, was billed to the Government. **********Rockwell officials said Rocky Flats was a difficult situation to monitor because it was a classified operation where security was so tight that even the local Rockwell vice president in charge was not admitted without an appointment."

New Mall Attracting Retailers"," **********A shopping mall scheduled to open next March in Westchester County is bucking a national slowdown in the mall business, but its owners say it is already 90 percent leased. **********The Westchester, an 850,000-square-foot mall on Bloomingdale Road in White Plains, will be anchored by two department stores, an existing Neiman Marcus and a new Nordstrom's. The 206,000-square-foot Nordstrom's will be the first outlet in New York for the Seattle-based retailer, which has a store at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J. **********The mall, on three levels, will also contain 155 specialty stores, each with an average 3,000 square feet, said John E. Phelan Jr., a senior vice president at the O'Connor Group, the mall's developer and manager. The shopping mall, on 11.7 acres, is owned jointly by Nomura Real Estate USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Nomura Real Estate in Tokyo, and Shopping Center Associates, a private real estate investment trust. **********Among the larger specialty store tenants are Tiffany & Company, the jewelry retailer, which is taking 6,000 square feet, Williams-Sonoma Inc., the cooking equipment store, which is taking 10,000 square feet, and Talbots, a clothing store chain, which is taking 7,000 square feet. Leases at the mall are for 10 to 15 years. Annual rents start at $45 a square foot, excluding real estate taxes, utilities and maintenance, Mr. Phelan said. **********Last year only four shopping malls larger than 800,000 square feet opened nationwide, compared with 27 in 1989, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Mark Schoifet, a spokesman for the trade group based in Manhattan, said many of the new large shopping malls, like the Westchester, were aimed at well-heeled shoppers. Malls that offer moderately priced merchandise have been hurt by the discount-store shopping centers, the fastest-growing segment of the retail market, he said. **********Mr. Phelan attributed the strong demand by retailers for space in the Westchester in part to the relatively high income levels of the county's 875,000 residents. The O'Connor Group estimates there is only 3.2 square feet of mall retail space for each person in Westchester County, compared with a national average of 5.4 square feet per person. Federal Express **********Federal Express is moving its New York executive offices to 32,692 square feet, the entire 26th floor, at One Penn Plaza, the 55-story, 2.4 million-square-foot office building above Pennsylvania Station at 32d Street and Seventh Avenue. **********The lease is valued at $15 million over its 15-year term, according to real estate executives familiar with the transaction. **********Federal Express, based in Memphis, is moving because it needs more space, a company spokesman said. The company now occupies 23,000 square feet at Five Penn Plaza, where its lease is expiring, he said. The move, scheduled for September, is expected to involve 70 employees. **********One Penn Plaza is about 85 percent leased, said Daniel North, director of management and leasing at Helmsley-Spear Inc., which manages One Penn Plaza. The building is owned by Mid-City Associates, a partnership of Metropolitan Life and the real estate developers Harry B. Helmsley and Peter L. Malkin.London Fog Deal **********The London Fog Corporation, a maker of raincoats and other outerwear, is consolidating its New York showrooms in 24,000 square feet of space at 8 West 40th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. **********The lease is valued at $11.5 million over its 15-year term, according to real estate executives familiar with the deal. **********London Fog will occupy the top five levels, including the penthouse, of the 21-story building owned by Jack Resnick & Sons Inc. Under the terms of the lease, 8 West 40th Street will be known as the London Fog Building, said Paul Revson, a broker at Julien J. Studley, which represented the tenant in the transaction. **********The move, scheduled for October, will involve about 60 employees, said John Varvatos, vice chairman and executive vice president at London Fog, a privately held concern based in Eldersburg, Md. **********The London Fog name on the building ""reflects our solid base in New York,"" Mr. Varvatos said. The new space will be used for London Fog's three showrooms, a showroom for a new sportswear division the company plans to start next year, and also a showroom for Pacific Trail, a manufacturer of outerwear London Fog bought two months ago, he said. **********The London Fog showrooms will be moving from 1290 Avenue of the Americas and 512 Seventh Avenue.New York Life **********The New York Life Insurance Company is moving its midtown sales office to Three Park Avenue, taking 28,800 square feet in the 41-story building at Park and 34th Street. **********The lease is valued at $8 million over its 10-year term, said Charles S. Cohen, president of the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation, the building's leasing and managing agent. New York Life will occupy the 36th floor and part of the 35th. The move, from 90 Park Avenue, is set for July."

He was speaking of the fugitive Haitian slaves who overthrew French colonial rule nearly 200 years ago, and his allusion was to the use of voodoo as one of their weapons. **********For William H. Gray 3d, President Clinton's special adviser on Haitian affairs, the speech was worthy only of derision. ""I doubt very seriously that it has any impact,"" Mr. Gray said. He said that the fact that the speech was given at 2 A.M. was proof of its irrelevance. **********But in a society where the symbolic and mythical often take precedence over what to most Westerners would seem objective or logical, many Haitians said Mr. Gray's response betrayed a profound American ignorance of their culture. **********While the United States is leading international efforts aimed at restoring the democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, many Haitians, including his supporters, see the actions of foreigners as posing a grave menace to the sovereignty of their nation. And in times of great national stress, like these, Haitians traditionally turn to voodoo for answers. **********Since he was installed by the army last month, Mr. Jonassaint's public references to Haiti's traditional, African-inspired religion have multiplied. In recent weeks, he has boasted that voodoo spells will protect his nation from attacking aircraft and that invisible Haitian warriors will meet the enemy, haunting their every footstep. **********Intimates of the de facto President say that in private, Mr. Jonassaint's visions are, if anything, more apocalyptic, and go beyond anything embraced by traditional religion. **********""He has been telling people that Haiti is the last remnant of the lost continent of Atlantis, and that the whites want to invade to steal the magical philosopher's stone,"" said a businessman who has recently been privy to Mr. Jonassaint's views. ""For him, this is a question of destiny. His mission has nothing to do with politics. He believes he was chosen to save the nation from sinking into the sea."" **********If Mr. Jonassaint's views seem eccentric to outsiders, he is far from alone in bathing himself in mysticism. In recent weeks the recalcitrant army commanders who overthrew Father Aristide in 1991 have themselves been consulting voodoo priests, or houngans, seeking advice and protection. **********This week a pro-military political group promised in a public ceremony to combine the powers of voodoo with an arsenal of weapons including ""poison, darts, traps and poisoned water"" to defeat any foreign force that tries to intervene here. **********For foreign diplomats seeking to arrange a settlement of the political crisis, Haiti's mysticism has long been a complicating factor. **********""There is a very African sense of time here,"" said a diplomat who has served in Africa and is respectful of voodoo as a tool to give courage to Haitian resistance. ""How do you engage people when everything is played out in the present, when there is no future?"" **********Another diplomat who has served here in two years of continual crisis also expressed his frustration: ""When you talk to the political actors here, and I mean across the board, you often come away with the feeling that their grasp of reality is very tenuous."" **********Haitians at ease in both worlds, the empiricism of the West and the eclectic mysticism of traditional Haitian society, chuckle at the confusion of outsiders but warn that the lack of appreciation of Haitian realities makes the thickening foreign involvement here more dangerous for all. **********""For many Haitians, everything he sees, the trees, the rocks, even foreign journalists, are merely the pale reflection of a real world which is alive beneath us, under the sea,"" said Dr. Jeanne Philippe, a 58-year-old Haitian psychiatrist who was trained in Haiti, France and Canada. ""You might find us resigned or unrealistic, but that may be because, as people of all social categories will tell you, this is not the real world. **********""Many Haitians will tell you that they have visited that world, under the water, and everything is beautiful there. To them, that is what counts."" **********Basking in the cool morning air of his peristyle, or voodoo temple, Ceuis Saint Louis answered enigmatically when asked what role voodoo might play in the denouement of Haiti's crisis, or whether it could be used as a weapon against foreigners. **********""We don't believe in doing harm like so many of you people think,"" said the 82-year-old houngan, who was long close to the dictator Francois Duvalier. ""What we offer is protection for people who are doing good. All of Haiti is waiting to embrace someone who can do good here."""

Under its stern new president, the former International Monetary Fund managing director Jacques de Larosière, however, the bank has been recast from an enfant terrible to a staid pillar of the financial world. **********Mr. de Larosière, who was brought into the EBRD last September in the wake of scandals over the bank's free spending and slow lending, saw his installation as a mandate for change and he has seized upon it. **********That transformation can be seen in everything from the EBRD's impressive lending statistics - 1993 loan commitments are up 90 percent and disbursements have risen 257 percent - to the agenda for the bank's third annual meeting. That agenda is expected to be dominated by new proposals to steer the bank back to its roots. **********On the table will be proposals that will not only reaffirm the bank's commitment to devote 60 percent of its resources to private sector investments, but also go one step further: They will single out small and medium- sized enterprises as priority targets, even though those investments require a great deal of manpower to prepare and monitor each dollar invested. **********[One such smallish deal, but for a state-owned company, was announced on Sunday, as the bank opened a $10.3-million line of credit for Russia's Khrunichev concern to launch a European communications satellite with a Russian Proton rocket, AFP-Extel News reported. The Russian prime minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, and Mr. de Larosière signed the contract in St. Petersburg.] **********""It is relatively easy to go out and lend $200 million to General Motors for a new plant in Eastern Europe,"" a member of the bank's board said. ""To find Polish entrepreneurs and assess the credit risks, for instance, takes more time."" **********Suddenly, under Mr. de Larosière, the European Bank has slipped from overdrive to neutral. The hugely ambitious agenda of its first president, Jacques Attali, has been supplanted this year at any rate by what one senior bank official called a ""year of pause."" **********The bank now have a hiring freeze and its budget will be held at £116 million ($170.7 million). More controversially, its loan commitments for this year will be held at last year's levels as well. Mr. de Larosière is expected to unveil projections in St. Petersburg that estimate loan commitments for 1994 roughly equal to last year's 1.8 billion European currency units ($2.03 billion). **********Those members of the bank's board who represent some of its 25 borrower nations have expressed frustration with those down- sized goals. Some have contrasted them with their countries' ballooning financing needs. **********Nonetheless, many of those directors from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union also join with their counterparts from the donor nations in conceding that the down-sizing is a necessary evil. **********The logic is simple. If Mr. de Larosière can put the bank's affairs in order, and if he can convince his 56 mainly government shareholders that he has done that, next year's annual meeting could have a far more ambitious and upbeat agenda. **********Certainly, the example of the bank's regional counterpart for Latin America, the Inter-American Development Bank, provides ample inspiration. At its annual meeting in Mexico last week, that bank's shareholders approved a massive increase in its capital. **********Bank directors say that Mr. de Larosière has already made major strides in his efforts to restore the EBRD's credibility with its donor members. His decision last November to shelve the bank's old structure that had divided it into an arm for the private sector and another devoted to the public sector is now seen as a key success. **********Mr. de Larosière decided instead to set up one group that looks after the bank's loans and investments in the countries of a newly defined northern region and another that looks after the south. **********As part of the shift from an organization defined by its products to one defined by its countries of operation, the bank has achieved another priority of the new president, a greater country focus. **********One of the more significant decisions this week will concern the naming of a successor to Mario Sarcinelli, vice president for the southern region, who is leaving the bank to head Banca Nazionale del Lavoro."

Under the plan, Rochester Tel will restructure into a competitive company, R-Com, and a regulated network company, R-Net. In addition, local phone prices for consumers in Rochester will be reduced or frozen for seven years. The plan, pending shareholder approval, will go into effect on Jan. 1.

For conservative investors with a pot of cash, that means short-term Treasuries now have a substantial edge. **********The annual yield on three-month Treasury bills has soared almost three-tenths of a percentage point, to 3.48 percent, since the Federal Reserve nudged up rates on Feb. 4. Meanwhile, the average annual percentage yield on bank certificates of deposit has inched up six-hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.61 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, North Palm Beach, Fla. A year ago, the returns on these two short-term investments were much closer: 2.95 percent for the T-bill and 2.76 percent for the C.D. **********The gap is unusually wide,"" said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Chemical Bank. ""Banks are not scrambling for consumer deposits right now because loan demand is relatively weak."" **********The banks' delayed response is just part of the story. The Treasury market has factored in more than the Fed's quarter-point rise last month in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans. ""There are normally long lags before the rates banks pay on C.D.'s catch up with short-term interest rates,"" Allen Sinai, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, said. ""But now the markets are anticipating more tightening and at least one more increase by the Federal Reserve."" **********For the person who wants to invest $10,000, the smallest denomination of a T-bill, Treasuries are certainly the more attractive choice. Treasury securities of other sizes and types are also available at favorable spreads to bank deposits. The yield on a six-month T-bill is 3.76 percent, compared with 2.85 percent for a six-month C.D.; the yield on a one-year T-bill is 4.26 percent, compared with 3.16 percent for a one-year C.D. **********Treasury securities can be purchased at no charge in person or by mail at one of the 37 Federal Reserve banks or branches. Purchases through brokerage firms and banks typically incur a fee of about $50. **********Depending on the Fed's actions, it could take months for the gap to narrow. ""Don't hold your breath until C.D. rates take off like a rocket again,"" warned Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor."

Gerber, which was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, jumped $15.50 a share, or 45 percent, to close at $50.125. **********Gerber, which has been plagued by falling demand as American birth rates declined sharply in the last three years, had been spending heavily to expand overseas with little success. Sandoz, which already has a large worldwide sales force for its own consumer brands, said it wanted the Gerber baby-food line to expand its business, especially in the United States. Gerber's products dominate the American market with a 71 percent share. **********Sandoz, based in Basel, is the second big Swiss drug company to announce plans recently to acquire an American company. On May 2, Roche Holdings said it planned to buy Syntex Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., drug maker, for $5.3 billion. **********""There's more coming,"" Samuel D. Isaly, a pharmaceutical analyst with Mehta & Isaly in New York, said. He said Swiss companies were rushing to act before a change in international accounting practices took effect on Jan. 1. The change will force the Swiss companies to report good will, the difference between a purchase price and the book value of an acquisition, as a charge that is amortized over the years against earnings. American companies already do this. **********But Mr. Isaly said that under current Swiss accounting rules, companies like Sandoz and Roche could write off billions of dollars of good will against shareholder equity. Many Swiss companies are sitting on the equivalent of billions of dollars in cash. **********Tim Croasdaile, a spokesman for Gerber, said the company, which is based in Fremont, Mich., had discussed joint ventures and other deals with a number of companies. He said the Gerber board initiated ""a strategic planning process"" last fall to look for ways of expanding the company's business. **********Analysts said several weeks ago that Nestle, the giant Swiss food company that dominates baby-food sales in Europe, was also interested in acquiring Gerber. That might explain the high price Sandoz paid, more than 21 times Gerber's pretax earnings of $171 million in the recently ended fiscal year. Nestle officials could not be reached for comment yesterday. **********Swiss markets were closed yesterday for a holiday. **********Gerber stock options were among the most actively traded on Friday, leading analysts to suspect that some people had advance knowledge of yesterday's deal. The analysts said there was similar activity before the Roche-Syntex announcement. A Stalled Franchise **********Analysts said that while the agreement was a great deal for Gerber shareholders, Sandoz would be overpaying for a franchise that has stagnated. Gerber said yesterday that its food sales rose 2 percent, to $209 million in the first three months of this year after declining slightly to $799.5 million for the 12 months ending March 31. **********""They're obviously paying an awful lot of money,"" Susan Haylock, an analyst in London with NatWest Securities, said. She said the Gerber brand was ""not well known in Europe, where there is a well-established competitive market"" in baby food. Other strong players there include H. J. Heinz and in Britain, Boots P.L.C. **********Rolf Schweizer, chief executive of Sandoz, said ""Gerber's position in North America strengthens our existing base of nutrition products there."" These Sandoz products include the food drink Ovaltine, Wasa crackers and Isostar, a sports drink that is strong in Europe. **********Les Pugh, a food analyst at Salomon Brothers, said baby food is ""a great market to be in, but the people at Gerber recognized that they couldn't go any further under their own steam."" **********But Ms. Haylock said she doubted the Gerber name would help sell ""a crisp bread or a sports drink."" And William Leach, at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the acquisition was ""extremely puzzling"" because Gerber has ""sluggish growth products,"" tied to the birth rate. The United States birth rate for each 1,000 in population declined from 16.3 in 1991 to 15 in 1992 and 14.7 last year, according to provisional Census Bureau projections. A Request for Strainedianed Peas **********The concern was founded as a Michigan canning company by Frank Gerber in 1901. The family started selling baby food in 1928 after his daughter-in-law requested a better way to obtain strained peas for her infant. The company also makes clothing and infant-care products. **********Alfred Piergallini, Gerber's chairman and chief executive, said the deal would speed the company's growth overseas. He added that the transaction ""represents exceptional value for our shareholders."" **********Mr. Piergallini, who has headed Gerber since 1990, is among them. He championed a requirement that company executives invest heavily in Gerber stock. According to the latest proxy statement, issued a year ago, Mr. Piergallini had 228,000 shares, which he could now sell to Sandoz for $12 million."

But when the troops fled as rebel forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front advanced, a quarter of a million Rwandans moved across a two-lane cement bridge to this northwestern Tanzanian town at the rate of more than 10,000 people an hour. **********Most of the refugees are from the majority Hutu tribe and came from southeastern Rwanda around Kibungo.  'They Are Killing People' **********""We fled the R.P.F.,"" said Ramu Munyurabihizi, 27, who had been walking for four days. ""They are killing people. We hardly saw any Rwandan military on the road. They all left before us. I had to leave everything behind. I do not know where my family is. All my commune left. We were about 30,000 people."" **********Those on foot have walked for as long as two weeks carrying suitcases, mattresses and cooking pots on their heads and cans full of water. Goats and long-horn cattle trailed behind them. **********Others rode bicycles, with as many as five people piled on. Some made the journey by wheelchair. **********They brought corn, plantains, even milk, and some carried radios tuned to news of Rwanda or to music. Today, some were already selling their meager belongings on the side of the road. **********The refugees were slowly beginning to gather tonight in a 20-square-mile open plain about 15 miles west of the border town of Rusumo, where the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is planning to build a camp. By nightfall, the refugees had spread out, lying down in the grass, setting up camp fires and cooking meager meals. The smoke of the fires filled the plain. 'It's Unbelievable' **********Even though the night fell, many still kept on walking under the starlit sky, weighed down by children and their belongings. **********""It's unbelievable when you consider what has been happening to drive people out and the gentleness that we've seen with this population,"" said Maureen Connolly, the team leader here for the refugee commissioner. **********Most of this group of refugees were in good health, unlike members of the Tutsi ethnic group who streamed into Burundi with wounds from machetes ad spears. **********The biggest problem facing these refugees will be food and hygiene.  The World Food Program will require daily 100 tons of grain, 30 tons of beans, 6 tons of oil and a ton of salt, said Bradley Guerrant of the World Food Program. **********""The initial distribution is difficult,"" Mr. Guerrant said. ""The refugees are so spread out, so chaotic, doing an orderly distribution will be difficult.""  Maintaining Control **********The United Nations refugees commission was preparing for an influx of 50,000 refugees. It needs clean water and will have to build upwards to 10,000 latrines. **********""If we lose control of sanitation, we lost control of water, we lose control of everything,"" Ms. Connolly said. ""Everybody is all over the place. People are too close together for the moment. This poses a health risk."" **********When the influx began on Thursday afternoon, Tanzanian officials let the refugees in the country without any problem, only disarming them of hundreds of machetes and hoes. **********Today, the machetes littered the ground in front of the border posts.  Customs officials have promised to provide United Nations aid workers with the machetes and hoes to help them build the latrines. **********Tonight, aside from several rebel soldier manning a guard post across the border, the closest town in Rwanda seemed completely deserted. Corpses floated down the Kagera River separating the two countries. **********From a plane flying low over the nearby Rwandan hills, the villages looked completely empty, without a sign of humans or animals."

""I'm relieved that the prices are going back up. But when I finally get all my money back, then I'm out of the stock market, for good."" **********If Mr. Li is far more dour than his fellow Chinese investors -- and he must be, given the amount of money that flooded into the markets here this week -- he still has something in common with millions of other Chinese who have embraced capitalism and put their money into stocks since 1990. **********They have learned a nail-biting lesson about how quickly prices can climb, collapse and then climb again on what has become one of the most volatile stock markets in the developing world. A Quick Rebound **********On the Shanghai exchange, the index of so-called A shares, available only to Chinese buyers, was above the 10,000 level in February 1993. By the end of last month, it had fallen more than 80 percent, to 1,744.01. But it exploded this week, sparked by the Government's decision to halt all new listings for the rest of the year. **********[ By Friday, the A index had climbed back to 3,716.14, more than twice its level a week earlier. ] **********The index for B shares, which are for foreigners only, has also risen this week, but only marginally, as overseas investors continued to question the wisdom of buying equities in the Chinese markets. **********Outside China, many securities analysts say they remain unimpressed with China's stock regulators and their ability to establish any degree of confidence in the markets. The package of reforms announced last week, which included the ban on new issues and proposals for opening the A-share market to foreign buyers, had been anticipated by analysts in Hong Kong and New York. **********""I don't think the fundamental problems with this market have been resolved,"" said Allan Ng, an analyst with S. G. Warburg Investments in Hong Kong. ""And I don't think the problems will be resolved for a long, long time. The market is still not properly regulated. Suspending share issues for a moment is not going to cure the problems."" **********In December 1990, the Chinese Communist Government proved that Communism was dead here and opened the first local stock market in more than 40 years -- in Shanghai, China's financial center and largest city. The new Chinese stock market, the Communists declared, would be the centerpiece of a ""socialist market economy,"" an effort to reconcile Mao Zedong's ideology with capitalist theory. **********In July 1991, a second exchange opened in Shenzhen, the booming southern coastal city across the border from Hong Kong. The newly reborn Chinese stock market created quick fortunes for a handful of investors. Tighter Credit, Lower Prices **********But after hitting record highs early last year, the market turned sour. The drop could be explained in part by the Government's moves to tighten credit, a policy intended to cool an economy in danger of overheating. China's economy grew by nearly 12 percent last year. **********In recent months, the markets came close to collapse, robbing many first-time Chinese investors of their life savings as they sold off shares in panic. **********The impact was most obvious in Shanghai, a city of nine million people where nearly one million people are estimated to own stock. ""Some of my friends have lost everything,"" said Zhu Ke, 29, an office worker here. **********In January, the widow of a stock market speculator who committed suicide after running up huge debts in the nearby city of Hangzhou filed suit against the securities company that let him trade on credit. The speculator jumped from the 11th floor of a building that housed the securities firm. **********Skepticism about the Chinese markets set in far earlier among foreign investors, and their doubts have continued. Even as the index for the A shares was surging this week, the index in Shanghai for foreigners-only B shares was rising by only a few percentage points. **********""People are really, really down on B shares,"" said Warren B. Bailey, an associate professor of finance at Cornell University who studies Asian markets. ""I was in Hong Kong recently, and people there said they wouldn't touch B shares with a 39-foot pole. There's a very strong sense that there are a lot of rip-offs."" A Lack of Information **********Foreign investors have become especially uncomfortable with the scant information made available by listed companies in China. Some companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen have never bothered to issue an annual report. Others are hesitant to receive foreign shareholders and analysts when they visit China. **********""It's crazy,"" said an analyst with a New York-based investment firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared offending his business contacts in China. ""You fly halfway round the world to talk to the people who run these companies. But instead of a C.E.O., you get some young executive who knows nothing about the current financial picture. They're still playing by the old Communist rules: don't share information. But that just doesn't work for capitalist investors."" **********Foreign investors with holdings here have also found themselves victims of a lack of liquidity in the markets. With so few shares changing hands, it is often impossible to buy or sell a sizable block of stock. **********Trading is especially slow in Shenzhen, where the daily turnover in the shares of the 22 companies listed on the B market has been as little as $150,000, less than the daily trading in many individual stocks in Hong Kong. Visitors to the trading floor in Shenzhen have been startled to see stock exchange workers napping or playing with hand-held electronic games because they had so little work to do. **********Some analysts question whether there will be the need for a Shenzhen market after 1997, when neighboring Hong Kong and its solid financial markets are absorbed into China. **********""Shenzhen has got problems both with liquidity and the fact that the quality of the companies in Shenzhen is just not as high as in Shanghai,"" said Billy Chan Lee-Wang, manager of a $62 million China investment fund run by G. T. Management in Hong Kong. **********Many large foreign investors have found what they consider to be a far more reliable way to invest in China's explosive economic growth -- through the recent listings of Chinese companies on stock exchanges in Hong Kong and elsewhere that impose far more stringent reporting requirements. Several Chinese companies are represented in New York markets through A.D.R.'s, or American depository receipts, for shares listed in Hong Kong. **********But foreign stock markets are inaccessible to millions of Chinese investors who, despite their heavy losses in the last year, retain a passion for the concept of stocks, and for the risks of capitalism. **********Zhao Xuhu, 39, an accountant in Shanghai, acknowledged reluctantly that he and two brothers had lost about $4,500 in the stock market over the last three years. ""A fortune,"" he said. **********But Mr. Zhao, who was among the Chinese investors wandering the offices of a large Shanghai investment firm this week, swelled with pride when he said the Chinese have a time-honored tradition of gambling. **********As he paced the floor, plotting his next purchases in the city's stock exchange, Mr. Zhao talked about winning back all of his losses. ""I want to believe in the stock market,"" he said. ""I want to believe."""

Narasimha Rao. ""We cannot stand still."" **********At the same time, Mr. Singh is turning India's attention toward the successful fast-growing economic of East Asia. **********India's current push to broaden reform comes less than three years after economic crisis prompted Mr. Singh and Mr. Rao's governing Congress (I) Party to make radical changes to an inward-looking economy that was quickly going broke. **********Now the country's exports are surging, the rupee is partly convertible and strengthening, and foreign investors are scrambling for a stake in mushrooming local businesses via stocks or direct investments in sectors only recently opened to them. **********Moves to reduce tariffs and taxes, reform antiquated banking and financial systems, privatize parts of the massive public sector, and dismantle a permit system for private business that interfered in nearly every aspect of industry, have trimmed inflation and spurred annual economic growth of 5 percent. **********Mr. Singh said his government, which only recently gained a majority in parliament, was in its strongest position yet to attack the vested interests blocking further reforms. ""If we look at the results of various opinion polls, there is the broadest possible support for changes,"" he said. ""I am confident that this process can go only in one direction. There is no prospect of these changes being reversed."" **********But the man most closely identified with a changing India must balance the need for further restructuring against the demands of the nation's enormous underclass. At the same time, he warned against unrealistic expectations of a ""Big Bang"" style budget. **********""I am confident any informed observer of the Indian economy knows India's potential, India's problems and India's capability to tackle them,"" Mr. Singh said. He added, ""We do need much higher growth rates. We need 6 to 7 percent."" **********""I know of no country which in the first two years of the program of adjustment-cum-structural reforms managed to achieve those sort of growth rates,"" he said. **********Although he was not implicated in the affair, in late December Mr. Singh offered his resignation as finance minister to take responsibility for a massive stock market scandal centered on n Bombay. **********Mr. Rao, encouraged by a display of widespread public support from the local and international business community for Mr. Singh and his policies, rejected the offer to step down after several days of national debate. **********""They needed him then,"" said Australia's high commissioner to India, David Evans. ""And they need him now."" **********Meantime, India is looking abroad. **********""Our future is East more than West,"" Mr. Singh said. ""We would like to retain our links with our traditional partners. But Asia today is the center of economic activity and we would like to be a partner in that process."" **********Still, East Asia's most dynamic economic success story, China, is not Mr. Singh's idea of a blueprint. **********""Much as I admire the Chinese achievements, we cannot go the Chinese way,"" he said. **********The finance minister also spoke of India's ""advantages"" in the longer term, notably its strong economic institutions, its legal system derived from British law and its functioning market economy. **********""We have also a constitution and government committed to the rule of law and an open society in which our weaknesses are as visible as our strengths,"" Mr. Singh said."

Both spent their entire professional lives at one employer, and both rose to the top early enough to have a long tenure that shaped the character and the prospects of their companies. **********Both men were unquestionably dedicated to their jobs, and both made serious mistakes that severely damaged the firms they loved and led. **********The men are John Gutfreund, who ran Salomon Brothers for 13 years, ending in a scandal in 1991, and Roger Smith, who spent a decade atop General Motors. Mr. Smith pushed G.M. into expensive diversifications and into costly and ill-conceived automation. As much as anyone else, he deserves the blame for G.M. losing its dominance of the American car industry. **********Mr. Gutfreund's Salomon was a sometimes harsh place, in which he was not above firing someone he described as his best friend, but it was generally a successful one that inspired loyalty among many clients. **********Three years ago last week, Mr. Gutfreund left Salomon. He had failed to act promptly when evidence arose of improper conduct by a bond trader, and the resulting scandal threatened to destroy the firm if the Government chose to take harsh retribution. Thanks in large part to damage control by Warren Buffett, who became Salomon's chairman until the crisis passed, the firm survived. **********Now Salomon is prospering again, notwithstanding recent trading losses. Much of the credit for that should no doubt go to the new leadership, but it is also evidence that Mr. Gutfreund left behind a solid operation that could do well if given a chance. His mistakes, serious as they were, proved far less costly to his employer than Mr. Smith's did to his. **********When Mr. Smith retired four years ago, the G.M. board acted, as have so many other boards, with generosity. It raised executive pensions, giving Mr. Smith $1.25 million a year instead of $700,000. The payout has since been cut back a bit. **********At Salomon, the reaction could not have been more different. There are disputes about whether promises were made, but the board deferred any real action for more than a year, allowing time for investigations to be completed. When they were, it offered Mr. Gutfreund and two other departed officials packages that were a mere fraction of what they would have been entitled to had they not left under a cloud. **********Mr. Gutfreund, unwisely it now seems, chose to fight. Salomon's lawyers responded by blaming him for everything they could think of, and an arbitration panel agreed. So now it appears that Mr. Gutfreund will get nothing from his old employer, having seen both restricted stock and stock options go up in smoke. Having paid millions in legal fees to win nothing, he now faces the threat of being forced to pay more millions in damages to shareholders. **********The old way -- letting failed executives walk away with corporate largesse -- did not seem right. Somehow the new one doesn't seem all that attractive either."

Supporters say the bill will produce more diversity in the prices and types of insurance policies. **********Some insurers, including small- and medium-sized companies represented by the National Association of Independent Insurers, remain opposed to the proposal.   Mr. Brooks said the bill he planned to introduce would revoke the insurance industry's 49-year-old exemption from antitrust laws except for activities where cooperation among companies is thought to help make insurance more widely available. **********For example, insurers could continue to use similar policy forms and band together to insure large risks like nuclear reactors. States could continue to require companies to join pools to insure customers who might be shunned by individual companies. **********An important part of Mr. Brooks's proposal would change the way insurance companies analyze data about claims and costs to set their prices. Companies could continue to share information about losses, but they would have to stop using industry-owned organizations to make estimates about inflation, interest rates, overhead costs and legal trends. Rather than use industry-run organizations, insurers would be required to make estimates themselves or buy them from independent companies."

""I knew that I had to take a fateful decision, and I didn't evade it."" **********""I strongly feel that I had no alternative,"" he said, ""although the deed took a heavy personal price from me and cost me much suffering."" **********In the years leading to Israel's founding in 1948, when Britain exercised a mandate over all of Palestine west of the Jordan River, Mr. Shamir was a leader of a militant organization known as the Stern Gang, the smallest but also the most radical of several guerrilla groups then fighting for a Jewish state. **********Founded by Avraham Stern, who was killed by the British police in 1942, the organization assassinated high-ranking British officials and was also a bitter opponent of Mr. Ben-Gurion, the dominant political figure both then and in the early years of the young state. **********In Mr. Shamir's recollection, Eliahu Giladi was perhaps the only member of the Stern Gang -- better known here by its Hebrew acronym, Lehi -- who ""deserved the titles 'extremist' and 'fanatic.' "" Even in 1942, he wrote, he had promised another Lehi leader ""that if Giladi acted on his own in any way dangerous to us, I would take care of him."" **********More and more, he said, Mr. Giladi was getting out of control in 1943, suggesting, for example, that the group incite British soldiers to fire on Jewish protesters in the hope of increasing anti-British sentiment. **********""Soon Giladi turned to a new craze,"" Mr. Shamir wrote. ""Lehi must eliminate, as he said, the Zionist leadership. He demanded that we kill Ben-Gurion."""

No one really knew. There was the usual doubletalk about ""support levels"" and ""corrections,"" but the only reasonable explanation seemed to be that investors suddenly grasped the idea that with interest rates rising, they could get better yields in bonds. If so, they were a bit slow on the uptake -- it had been a full week since the Federal Reserve gave its latest shove to rates. There was also talk that weakness in ""cyclical"" stocks -- the ones that rely on a strong economy -- yanked the wider market down. But a lot of it is probably just trigger-happy traders: no economy is as bumpy as this market. Sure enough, on Wednesday the market steadied, and on Friday the few traders who showed up sent the Dow to a 33-point rebound. **********Capital Gains, Boil and Bubble  Bob Dole certainly got the capital-gains stew bubbling again. Last week he threatened, briefly, to withhold his support for a world trade pact unless President Clinton came around on this much-debated issue. Cutting the gains tax, now 28 percent, is dear to Republican hearts -- it's part of their ""Contract With America."" But would it be just another tax lollipop for the rich? No, some say: with the rate high, the rich just sit on stale assets, tying up capital that could invigorate new ventures. And after a capital-gains cut, they say, tax revenue would flood into the Treasury. Then again, if politicians just left the tax alone, nobody would wait for the political winds to shift; they'd sell assets when the time seemed right. But of course politicians can't leave things alone -- they'd be out of a job. Tightening Up Medicaid  No one suggests letting the poor go without medical care, but a lot of people are struggling to find a way to cut costs. And preventive care is cheaper than letting someone get really sick and land in a hospital emergency room. On that theory, presumably, New Jersey officials proposed last week to cut Medicaid payments to hospitals by 20 percent. ""We cannot be in the business of subsidizing hospitals,"" a state official said. That makes sense -- but the state has only just begun to arrange preventive-care alternatives. Can hospitals absorb such cutbacks yet? Ending Some Sweet Deals  Who owns mutual savings banks, anyway? More to the point, if they're sold, who should profit? Some insist that depositors own them, and should get any windfall. In reality, bank executives have often cut nice deals for themselves, getting stock and options worth millions during sales -- rewards earned, they say, for their long service. But last week Federal regulators clamped down: no free stock, no options. They did back down on one issue. Outside investors have put money in banks to qualify as depositors when the payoff came, and regulators had considered limiting insider rights to local depositors -- but relented after some investors sued. So, You Finally Came Back  You're probably reading this on Monday or Tuesday, right? The statisticians tell us that if you weren't shopping over the weekend, there's a good chance you were far from home. The travel industry says Americans increasingly use this long weekend (if you worked Friday, you're in a shrinking minority) more for mini-vacations than for family eating derbies nearby. A record 30.4 million Americans were expected to travel at least 100 miles -- a million more than last Thanksgiving. And the airline industry estimated that today (Sunday, that is, for you latecomers), as travelers flood home, planes would be, on average, 80.3 percent full; most of the year, it's around 65 percent.  COMPANIES Nothing, Alas, Is Perfect  There's not much left to believe in. Politicians keep disappointing, rumors persist that Santa Claus doesn't exist, and now even the Pentium chip, that pinnacle of high technology, is less than perfect. Even as computers are vilified for running our lives, they are also seen as islands of precision in an imprecise world. But once in a long while, it seems, the Pentium -- which is made by Intel and is in perhaps 10 percent of all personal computers sold -- makes a slight division error. Intel -- which has fixed it and is offering replacements, though not a recall -- insists that a typical user would have just one chance in nine billion of an error. For some, that's too risky. And anyway, did Intel use a Pentium to calculate that risk? Expectations, as in Great  Hand average workers bonuses equal to 8 percent of their salary, and they'd be ecstatic. But Wall Street is different -- especially Goldman, Sachs, one of the richest firms. Its workers are used to sizable year-end stocking-stuffers, in good times and bad. Even in 1987, when the 80's crash-landed, the bonus was 21 percent; last year it hit 30. So it was quite a shock when Goldman said last week that although the firm is in ""excellent"" condition, earnings are subpar, so the bonus would be just 8 percent. Oh well, if you squint hard, an Escort looks a lot like a Lexus.  Shopping: Can It Be Treated?  Today's subject, philosophy class, is free will. Or, more specifically, when retailers shot off that deafening starting gun early Friday morning, did Americans have to tumble headlong for the malls? Did they have any choice, or is it just written somewhere that the day after Thanksgiving must be the year's wildest shopping day, and only the most Scroogelike American would dare skip it? But free will or not, people did start on their monthlong shopping frenzy. And even if the Gingrich stole the Democrats' Christmas, retailers have no expectation that anyone will steal theirs: they predict solid sales, up 5 or 6 percent from last year.  Derivatives: Whose Risk?  Derivatives: just say the word and watch corporate treasurers dive for cover. These high-risk toys have led to huge losses at companies that never even realized they'd taken up gambling -- and led to big lawsuits, too. Gibson Greetings, for one, accused Bankers Trust of luring it into risky trades. And last week, in a sure sign that ""let the investor beware"" does not apply here, a settlement was reached in which Gibson will pay just $6.2 million, or 30 percent, of what Bankers Trust said it was owed. Gibson was ""delighted,"" while Bankers Trust vowed to ""defend vigorously"" a similar Procter & Gamble suit.  INTERNATIONAL End of an Era in Japan  It's common knowledge that the Japanese business miracle has been fading, slowly but steadily, for some time. Numbers, whether for stock prices or corporate earnings, abound to chart this. A notable example: Sony's stunning $3.2 billion loss on its Hollywood studios, announced just over a week ago. All that was needed to mark a neat, decisive end of this remarkable era in Japanese history was one vivid symbol, and last week the perfect one appeared: Akio Morita, who co-founded Sony and practically turned it into a lower-case noun meaning electronic goodies, resigned for health reasons. It was no surprise, for Mr. Morita, 73, has been ill for some time and not greatly involved in the company. But his official departure after 22 years as chairman remains a milestone. Berlusconi Under Fire  Yes, America's President has problems -- the elections, Whitewater, Bob Dole. But think of Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's Prime Minister. Last week he was told that he faced a corruption inquiry, which is said to involve bribes that his companies may have paid to tax auditors, and another inquiry may focus on antitrust issues linked to his three national television stations. Striking back quickly, Mr. Berlusconi said he was ready to sell part of his business empire if necessary, including control of those television stations. He even threatened to force new elections by resigning. But as a prosecutor said, ""We can't stop investigating just because Berlusconi is Prime Minister."" Economic Birth Control  Add this to the toll of German unification: eastern Germans have practically stopped having babies -- evidently because in their uncertain new world, they're mired in economic gloom. Or, more to the point, they don't know if they'll have a job. In one demographer's words, Germans ""have come as close to a temporary suspension of childbearing as any large population in the human experience."" It's a problem common to other formerly Communist countries, but it's worse in Germany, and especially bad in the state of Brandenburg -- births there plunged more than two-thirds in just the last five years. So, alarmed at the thought of a vanishing population, Brandenburg recently announced that it would pay parents $650 whenever they have a child. That would be a help, certainly, but it wouldn't buy you a good job.  Watch for Costlier Oil  Once again, OPEC is trying to put a cap on oil production so it can get prices up. After OPEC ministers met last week, they said they'd hold production to 24.5 million barrels for another year, and that could send oil prices up $2 or $3 a barrel -- and send gasoline prices higher too. Of course, if Iraq gets back in the game, that could change the math -- but in that unlikely event, OPEC vows to cut back to balance that."

Pat Robertson Group Will Buy Ice Capades"," **********Benefiting from the strong cash flow from its Family Channel cable television network, International Family Entertainment agreed yesterday to buy Dorothy Hamill's Ice Capades for an undisclosed amount. **********The exact purchase price has not been determined because International Family Entertainment is negotiating on just what assets of the ice show the company will buy. ""Everyone has agreed to the deal,"" said Timothy Robertson, president and chief executive of International Family Entertainment. ""It's just that a couple other partners are working it through,"" His father, Pat Robertson, the evangelist, is chairman of the Virginia Beach, Va., company. **********Ms. Hamill, a gold metal skater in the 1976 Winter Olympics, and her husband, Kenneth Forsythe, bought the ice show in June 1993 after its operators had filed for bankruptcy. Their principal investor in the Ice Capades is Ben Tisdale, an Alaskan businessman.New Subsidiary Planned **********Under the deal announced yesterday, International Family Entertainment would create a new subsidiary, Dorothy Hamill International, that would purchase the assets of the ice show. Ms. Hamill and Mr. Forsythe have agreed to serve for a minimum of five years as president and chief executive officer, respectively, of the new subsidiary. Both will continue to produce the Ice Capades. **********""The Hamill acquisition is very much in line with Tim Robertson's policy of building a very stable block of family entertainment,"" said John Reidy, a media analyst for Smith Barney. **********Shares of International Family Entertainment closed yesterday at $16.25, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading. **********The Ice Capades, which expects to draw a crowd of three million people during its 1994-1995 shows, is ""close to breaking even,"" said the younger Mr. Robertson. He said the ice show was expected to become profitable after it is linked with International Family Entertainment's broadcasting operations. The ice show will produce specials which will air on the Family Channel. And International Family Entertainment's distribution arm, MTM Entertainment, will sell the specials to broadcast networks, domestic syndicates, and home video and pay-per-view markets. **********Those efforts would raise the ice show's gross annual revenues of $20 million by at least 30 percent in the first year after the acquisition, said the younger Mr. Robertson. International Family Entertainment has been acquiring companies that provide synergies with its Family Channel network. Previously the company acquired the Great American Entertainment Company, which produces live musical variety shows in three theaters in Myrtle Beach, S.C. The company also owns the Cable Health Club Channel. **********In the first quarter this year, International Family Entertainment had revenues of $53.2 million. **********The Family Channel is one of the country's largest advertiser-supported basic cable television networks, reaching about 95 percent of cable households and 63 percent of all television households."

The letter also says that, contrary to current practice, no advance warning should be given to the party being attacked. **********Moreover, in a departure from the insistence by United Nations military commanders in Bosnia that the size of air strikes be determined exclusively by the degree of provocation, the NATO letter underscores that any such action must be ""robust and effective."" **********NATO officials say they were embarrassed last month when a ""pinprick"" air strike hit only an empty Serbian tank, after the Bosnian Serbs had been given ample warning that planes were on their way to Sarajevo. The selection of the target by United Nations commanders and their warning to the Serbs angered NATO commanders, who follow a doctrine of using overwhelming force against an enemy. **********Under the current ""dual key"" approach in Bosnia, United Nations commanders call in NATO air strikes and choose the targets. **********The request for more latitude has caused deep unease just at a time when the United Nations mission is under pressure from the Bosnian Serbs. Last week Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, was told by Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, that Dr. Karadzic is considering asking peacekeeping forces to leave territory held by the Serbs. This territory amounts to 70 percent of Bosnia, and it would be extremely difficult for the United Nations to function without access to it. **********""The Bosnian Serb view is that their relative position is worsening, so it is better to fight now than later,"" said one United Nations official present at the meeting between Mr. Akashi and Dr. Karadzic. ""They argue, with some military logic, that peace or war is acceptable to them, but the current half-state is detrimental."" **********With their supply links to Serbia now largely cut by the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, the Bosnian Serbs feel time is working against them. Their anger at Mr. Milosevic is enormous. Indeed, Dr. Karadzic refers to the Serbian President as ""that so-called Serb."" **********If the Bosnian Serbs go through with their threat to force United Nations troops from territory they hold -- and they say they will make a decision by Wednesday -- Mr. Akashi would be in an extremely delicate position. **********The three Muslims enclaves in eastern Bosnia -- Srbrenica, Zepa and Gorazde -- depend on United Nations food and military protection that can reach them only through Serbian-held territory. In addition, Sarajevo would become entirely dependent on air shipments. **********""Our argument to the Serbs is if they throw us out, they lose their last contact with the outside world,"" one United Nations official said. ""But they are very angry, and it is not clear they will listen, so we are making active preparation to work in a much more hostile environment."" **********Against this backdrop, the NATO demand for the right to make more punishing air strikes has placed the United Nations mission here in a tight corner. **********If the request is rebuffed, the United Nations strained relations with NATO could reach a breaking point.  But if Mr. Boutros-Ghali grants the request, he risks leading United Nations troops into a confrontation with the Serbs that could make the delivery of aid impossible."

""Darling, you got real pretty hair,"" he says with an exaggerated Western accent. ""What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?"" **********The point of this television commercial is to ask, wouldn't you rather be home Saturday night watching Home Box Office than at some bar trying to fend off the yahoos? **********It is also one of a new breed of TV ads that was created with the help of a personal computer and off-the-shelf software, a technological advance that advertising agencies say could trim thousands of dollars from the cost of making commercials. **********The new method helps advertising agencies reduce their reliance on expensive middlemen -- the production houses where TV ads are usually constructed -- and lowers the costs they pass on to clients. A production house might charge up to $1,000 an hour, but an agency might charge its client only about $175 an hour to do the work itself. **********Although the final versions of commercials are still being produced at production houses, rough preliminary versions can now be done on a computer. Before, an agency would draw out the ad, shot by shot, on a storyboard. Video would be shot and the production house would make the ad. The ad would then be shown to the client. If the client demanded changes, the expensive process would continue until the client was satisfied. **********Just as computers have enabled some car designers to do away with clay models and aerospace engineers to dispense with mechanical drawings, computers have greatly streamlined the art of advertising. **********Storyboards containing sound and motion can now be produced on standard desktop computers. Video images can be put into the computer and manipulated into a rough commercial, which is then transferred to a video tape and shown to the client. The creative team can alter the rough commercial until everyone is happy with its message. Then and only then will the elements be sent to the production house for a final version. The end result: fewer costly visits to the production house. **********""You're not blowing your whole budget up front,"" explained Sally C. Face, manager of computer systems at BBDO New York, which produced the dancing cowboy ad for HBO. The result is fewer cost overruns and, ultimately, happier clients. **********In the past, video playback on a personal computer was often limited to half speed and it could only be displayed on a small part of the computer's screen. Now, improved methods for digitizing, compressing and decompressing video signals, as well as more powerful computers and improved software -- like Adobe Premier, Adobe Photoshop, Elastic Reality and Macromedia Director -- allow full-motion, full-screen playback and fancy special effects like morphing, in which one picture metamorphoses into another. **********Systems for editing digitized video signals can be purchased for less than $20,000, according to Gerald T. Monti, executive vice president of Common Sense Inc., a consulting firm in Seattle, Wash. He predicted that within five years, digital video will have infiltrated nearly every aspect of TV ad production. **********Only a few of the largest agencies and pioneering smaller firms have started using new digital video tools in the creative process. One of the trendsetters is BBDO New York, whose clients include Pepsico, Apple Computer, Home Box Office and Tambrands. The agency is pushing its 130 art directors to use desktop computers to create video rough drafts of TV commercials to show clients and prospects. **********Long-term plans include building a video data base of old commercials so that the video can be used in making rough drafts of new commercials. These versions are called rip-o-matics because they often use video ripped off from the old commercials. The computers can also produce animatics, another rough version that uses animated illustrations and a soundtrack. **********Ms. Face said about a dozen art directors at BBDO have taken the technological leap, and more are being trained in the agency's Video Graphics Room, which opened this month and cost $50,000 to equip. **********Other agencies, like Foote, Cone & Belding in San Francisco, have built similar studios and more agencies are expected to follow. At Foote, Cone, the video room is ""used primarily to develop ideas, to conceptualize TV commercials,"" said Geoffrey A. Katz, director of creative technologies. About a quarter of the time, it is also used to produce examples of commercials to show to consumer focus groups. **********Foote, Cone's studio, called Cybertank, cost $100,000 to build, according to Mr. Katz, who said it has ""more than paid for itself."" Last year, the room was used to develop more than 50 television commercials, including a recent one for Zima, Coor's new malt beverage. **********A similar room at Ogilvy and Mather in Los Angeles is used to create commercial prototypes, according to Kevin McManis, director of creative technology. ""We do those for new business pitches and for consumer focus groups to make sure commercials are effective."" Ogilvy's room, which cost $85,000 to equip in January, 1993, earned the agency $66,000 in its first year, Mr. McManis said. **********And Kevin W. Moehlenkamp, BBDO's creative supervisor, pointed to another possible advantage of producing high-quality rough drafts on the computer. ""Probably our success at selling commercials to clients will go up, too,"" he said. **********But even among those who are already using the new technology, there are skeptics. ""Where does the creative's role end? Traditionally, at dreaming up the spot,"" said Jake Prescott, creative technology director at Ogilvy & Mather in New York. ""It's important not to run away with the technology. Not every art director should be a video editor."" **********And Elizabeth Wood, the president of Egeland Wood & Zuber Inc. of Scotia, N.Y., a technology consultant to advertising agencies, said, ""Clients don't always see the difference between a video rough draft and a finished commercial. I've heard of one agency that went out and shot low quality video"" for a video storyboard. **********But then, contrary to the agency's intent, ""the client liked the grainy look, and the agency had to recreate it using very expensive equipment."" **********""Up front, you let the client know that this isn't the actual commercial,"" admitted Mr. Moehlenkamp, ""or you run the risk of 'demo love.'

In the most publicized case, a mid-ranking minister in the Environment Department, Tim Yeo, who had been among those preaching traditional values, was forced to resign after admitting that he had fathered a child last year in an extra-marital affair. **********In a second case, the wife of another minister, Lord Caithness, was found dead last week on the eve of her 19th wedding anniversary, apparently a suicide. Lady Diana Caithness had been distraught, her parents said in newspaper interviews, because her husband had been having an affair. Lord Caithness resigned his post as minister for shipping after his wife's death. Housing-Voting Scandal **********Mr. Major's problems spread today when an official investigation into the management of the nation's most prominent local government, the Tory-controlled council in London's Westminster district, concluded that officials had manipulated the sale of government-owned housing in 1990 in an attempt to bring more Conservative Party voters into wards where electoral strength hung in the balance. The officials, who include one current Conservative member of Parliament, Barry Legg, denied any wrongdoing. **********The investigation, said Jack Straw, a top Labor Party official, ""shows that the Tory Party is rotten and amoral to the core."" He added, ""They have abandoned basic principles of public morality."" **********Faced with an almost gleeful onslaught of criticism from the opposition parties, Mr. Major has sought to decouple his ""back to basics"" strategy, the centerpiece of his Government's domestic policy, from questions of personal morality, saying his emphasis is on issues like improving schools. But with newspapers, tabloids and the ""quality"" press alike, dominated each day by headlines about what the Government's critics contend is its hypocrisy, Mr. Major has had trouble shaking off troubles he dismissed as ""a little flurry."" **********One of his ministers, Alastair Burt, was heckled and booed when he spoke in London today at a conference on family issues. He was followed by Sara Keays, whose extra-marital affair with Cecil Parkinson, a prominent Tory, led to a child and his resignation from the Government in 1983. **********""What is intolerable is to be lectured by political leaders on how we should live, persuaded to vote for them according to their lofty principles, and then they expect us to put up with them whatever they do when we find out they are living a lie,"" Miss Keays said. Attacked in Own Party **********In political terms, Mr. Major is clearly heading into a critical period.  Even in his party, he is increasingly under attack for failing to articulate a direction for the party and the nation. His only major initiative apart from ""back to basics"" has been a high-risk effort to seek peace in Northern Ireland. So far, little progress has been made in the face of continued violence by the Irish Republican Army. **********Despite slow but steady improvements in the economy -- unemployment figures released on Wednesday showed that joblessness dipped to 9.8 percent in December, the first time it had been below 10 percent in 18 months -- the Government's ratings in the polls have plummeted to ominously low levels. **********The most recent poll, published by The Guardian on Wednesday, showed 50 percent of respondents saying they would vote for the opposition Labor Party in a general election, with the Conservatives at 26 percent and the Liberal Democrats at 20 percent. Mr. Major does not have to call a general election until 1997. **********Advisers to Mr. Major had expressed optimism late last year that 1994 would allow the Prime Minister to regain his authority in the party, which was deeply split last year over whether to back Mr. Major's call to approve the Treaty on European Union. Mr. Major won that fight, but only barely. Now political analysts are again questioning whether Mr. Major would be able to survive a poor showing by the party in June's elections for the European Parliament, and pointing to Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as his most likely successor."

Analysts valued the interest at $150 million, raising the value of the deal to $1.83 billion. **********Bayer A.G., the German pharmaceutical company, has said it is interested in buying the over-the-counter unit, which includes the United States franchise for Bayer aspirin, as well as Panadol, an acetaminophen analgesic, which competes overseas with Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol. Kodak, based in Rochester, had said last month that it planned to sell its drug, diagnostic and household products divisions. **********Some analysts said Kodak, through these sales, had a good chance of eventually making up the $5.1 billion it paid for Sterling in 1988, albeit at lower profits than could have been earned by simply investing in bonds. **********Shares of Eastman Kodak rose 75 cents yesterday, closing at $47.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Samuel D. Isaly, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Drug Research, said the announcement was ""very good for Sanofi and very good for Kodak."" He said Kodak might get $2 billion for the over-the-counter drug business, which had about $1 billion in sales last year. **********As it strips down to its core imaging businesses, Kodak could receive $1 billion to $2 billion more from the sale of its household products and clinical diagnostics units, analysts said. Kodak is also keeping a new $350 million research building in New Jersey, which will be leased to Sanofi. **********""When the divestitures are complete, Kodak will be entirely focused on imaging,"" said George M. C. Fisher, the company's chairman and chief executive. **********Paul McAfee, a spokesman for Kodak, said ""active discussions"" were under way with prospective buyers for several of the company's units. Kodak plans to use part of the proceeds to pay down $7.1 billion in debt, most of which went toward financing the 1988 Sterling purchase. **********In the deal, Sanofi will get Sterling Winthrop products that had $1.2 billion in 1993 sales, as well as a United States sales force for its own drugs. Sanofi and Sterling formed a worldwide marketing alliance three years ago, and Sanofi had first rights to buy the drug units. **********Largely because of that alliance, ""this was the hardest piece for Kodak to sell,"" said Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. **********Eugene G. Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, noted that if Sanofi had not bought the unit, a deal ""would have been complicated for somebody else."" **********Through licensing arrangements, Sanofi has granted United States marketing rights for its drugs to companies including Syntex Inc., Abbott Laboratories and Sandoz Ltd. Last year, Sanofi received about $80 million in royalties on $500 million in American sales of its products, which include Ticlid, a stroke preventive, and Deprenyl for Parkinson's disease. **********""It is important for me to be in the United States,"" said Jean-Francois Dehecq, chairman of Sanofi, in a telephone interview from Paris. ""Sterling is just the right size for us."" **********The French company is preparing to introduce a number of new drugs. It is spending $300 million on research this year, or about 15 percent of its $2 billion in worldwide drug sales, and hopes to get Federal regulatory approval for new treatments for osteoporosis and cancer in 1996 and 1997. **********Mr. Isaly said the price for the Sterling unit was ""broadly in line"" with the $5 billion Roche Holdings agreed last month to pay for Syntex. He said Sterling Winthrop had about $70 million in after-tax profits on the $1.2 billion in 1993 sales. He projected that Syntex would have net income of $325 million on sales of $1.94 billion in the fiscal year ending next month. **********With the Sterling unit, Sanofi will be among the 20 largest drug companies in the world and the 10 largest in Europe. **********Mr. Dehecq said the company planned to concentrate on human health products and would divest units that produce seeds, Entremont cheeses and drugs for animals. **********The company plans to keep its perfume division, which includes the Yves Saint Laurent line.

The Fed is expected to raise short-term interest rates by 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, to keep inflation in check. But some traders say it will take a larger increase in rates to keep the dollar from weakening again. **********""Fifty basis points won't be enough to support the dollar, because that's so widely expected,"" said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a New York consulting firm. **********Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds, and fears that inflation will accelerate have weighed down the bond market and the value of the dollar this year. Many traders say the dollar is unlikely to strengthen until the United States bond market stages a significant recovery. And that is unlikely to happen until the Fed convinces the bond market that it is doing enough to quell inflationary pressures. **********""The Fed has to say it's achieving a tight monetary policy rather than aiming for a neutral one,"" said Marc Chandler, director of research at Ezra Zask Associates, a Norfolk, Conn., hedge fund with $160 million under management. **********Mr. Chandler, however, thinks the dollar's descent may be over. ""The bulk of bad news has been discounted for the dollar,"" he said. **********The dollar has fallen about 13 percent against the yen and the mark so far this year. **********In other currency trading yesterday, the Swedish krona rose against the mark and the dollar ahead of a referendum on whether Sweden should join the European Union. A ""yes"" vote would help the krona by forcing Sweden to cut deficit spending to meet union economic requirements. Opinion polls show almost an even division between voters who favor joining the European Union and those who are opposed. **********In New York, the Swedish krona was last quoted at 7.2437 kronor to the dollar, stronger than 7.2589 kronor on Thursday. **********The British pound slipped to $1.5960, from $1.6000 on Thursday. The dollar was little changed against the Swiss franc, at 1.2830 francs, down from 1.2831 francs on Thursday."

""I tell rookies a good relationship evolves from prospect to client to friend,"" he says. ""I try to recommend investments that won't jeopardize my clients' last years on the planet."" 'I Was Misled' **********That is not how all of the broker's clients have seen him. A Roman Catholic priest has filed complaints against Mr. Daggett, saying the broker inappropriately sold him limited partnerships, offered misleading legal advice and then abandoned the account. The former client, Msgr. Maximos Mardelli, 81, filed the complaints in recent months with the National Association of Securities Dealers and state regulators. Yesterday, his lawyer, Joseph M. Lovretovich, filed a $750,000 lawsuit on the monsignor's behalf against Mr. Daggett and Prudential. **********""I was misled by Mr. Daggett,"" Monsignor Mardelli said in a telephone interview, adding that he must continue to work full time, despite his plans to retire in 1990, because of his losses. When the investments soured, Mr. Daggett ""didn't tell me, and then he just dropped me completely,"" Monsignor Mardelli said. **********In addition to selling partnerships himself, Mr. Daggett was assistant manager for the firm's Los Angeles branch, which sold a large number of partnerships. Government regulators have said the firm misled investors about the safety and returns of the partnerships. 'Spotless' Record **********Mr. Daggett declined to comment. William Ahearn, a Prudential spokesman, said the firm never received any complaints about Mr. Daggett from the N.A.S.D. or California regulators, as they would have if such complaints had been filed. ""This matter has all the trappings of a lawsuit that is simply aimed at generating publicity,"" Mr. Ahearn said in a statement, adding that Mr. Daggett's industry compliance record ""is spotless."" He said that the client made the purchases in question more than six years ago and that the suit ""was never preceded by a formal or informal complaint."" **********But California regulators confirmed yesterday that they recently received the monsignor's complaint. A copy of his Oct. 12 complaint to the N.A.S.D. was provided to The New York Times several months ago, before Mr. Daggett appeared in the ads. **********The suit against one of the brokers chosen for the firm's commercials underscores the depth of Prudential's troubles. Many senior brokers sold the partnerships now staining the firm's image, with the result that when Prudential tries to move beyond the scandal, often some remnant of the past hinders the effort. **********Prudential is not the first scandal-plagued firm to trip on its own ads. In 1987, Drexel Burham Lambert, during the fraud investigation of its junk bond operations, started a campaign to counter its image as deceitful. But the commercial, which spoke of the benefits of junk bonds to Vidalia, La., backfired when an article revealed its statistics were fudged and that the town shown in the ad was not Vidalia but another, more picturesque city. **********Mr. Daggett, a heavyset man, fit the unvarnished image the firm sought for its ads. The ads, by Deutsch/Dworin Inc. in New York, are not glitzy, but are filmed in black and white with employees reading remarks off note paper to describe how the firm is straight with clients. In his ad, Mr. Daggett stresses that theme, saying, as he belittles his own unattractive tie, that he has ""never been a flashy, slick sales guy."" **********But in the lawsuit, Monsignor Mardelli portrays Mr. Daggett as just that. According to the suit, the monsignor told Mr. Daggett and the brokers who handled the account before him that he wanted his money, much of which came from an inheritance, to be conservatively invested. **********Instead, records show, the money was invested largely in Prudential limited partnerships and junk bond funds. After Mr. Daggett took over the account, he sold the monsignor $125,000 worth of a real estate investment, VMS Mortgage Investment fund. The suit says Mr. Daggett assured the monsignor of the safety of VMS, but the investment collapsed. **********In 1991, the complaint says, Mr. Daggett told the monsignor he could only recover money from his VMS losses by joining a class-action settlement. But he could have filed an arbitration, and potentially receive all his money back, rather than the pennies on the dollar in that settlement. **********In August 1992, the broker left the account, making it into a so-called house account without broker representation. After that, the client lost touch with Mr. Daggett. ""He just ignored me,"" the monsignor said."

But some gambling experts say tax revenues will eventually reach the point of diminishing returns as more and more forms of gambling are legalized. Even with casino gambling, New Jersey has seen tax revenues that are derived from gaming shrink as a percentage of the state's budget. In other states, some officials fear that tax receipts from lotteries and parimutuel betting will be hurt if they legalize casino gambling. Parimutuel receipts are already falling across the region.

The Bishop's punishment, his followers say, was death from stab wounds to the back and heart. His body was found two weeks ago along a road near Teheran. **********The Bishop was last seen leaving his house the morning of Jan. 19. **********Family members said they were later told that the Bishop had been buried in a Muslim cemetery. They received permission to exhume the body, and had an independent autopsy conducted. **********The day of his funeral, the official press reported the arrest of an unidentified suspect in the killing and ""a hectic investigation."" **********The Bishop's efforts to publicize the case of Mehdi Dibaj, the man who converted to Christianity, succeeded. The Vatican, the United Nations, France and Britain condemned the sentence, and the State Department issued a statement expressing ""grave concern over the alleged death sentence of Mehdi Dibaj."" **********Within days, the Iranian judicial authorities announced the release of Mr. Dibaj on bail after 10 years in prison and denied that he had ever been condemned to death. The authorities complained of ""false and baseless Western propaganda against Iran,"" the newspaper Hamshahri reported on Jan. 16. **********But church members said the Bishop's criticism of the sentence had caused international embarrassment for the Government, which led to the slaying, a form of reprisal that is becoming increasingly common for exiled dissidents and nonconformists. **********The new religious persecution includes the repression and periodic execution of Bahais, a sect of Shiite Muslims labeled as apostates, and attempts to close Sunni Muslim mosques. **********Three Bahai adherents were condemned to death in December, accused of holding religious feasts and being ""unprivileged infidels at war with the Muslim nation."" According to documents obtained by Bahai groups outside Iran, two of the defendants were sentenced to death for transmitting information about their trials to the United Nations. **********The United Nations and other organizations have repeatedly condemned Iran for human rights violations. **********There are 3.5 million Sunni Muslims, 350,000 Bahais, 80,000 Christians and 30,000 Jews living in Iran, according to official figures. The Council of the Assemblies of God Church has 8,000 members in Iran. **********Although senior Iranian clerics maintain that members of religious minorities are free to practice their faith, with each religious group having an elected representative in the Parliament, tensions remain even among Muslims. **********After reports that Sunni places of worship were to be closed, Sunni Muslims in the eastern cities of Meshed and Zahidan clashed with the authorities last month, Hamshahri reported. In Zahedan, 1,000 miles southeast of Teheran, eight people were injured in such confrontations. **********A Bahai businessman in Teheran who asked not to be identified said members of his faith have lived in fear since the 12-year-old daughter of a Bahai leader was kidnapped and tortured last month in the western city of Hamedan to discourage her father from engaging in religious activities. **********About 100 Armenian Iranians took part in the discreet funeral for Bishop Hovsepian Mehr, all under the watch of the police and Information Ministry agents. **********The Bishop's daughter, Rebecca Hovsepian Mehr, 22, led mourners to the burial at the Armenian cemetery, 30 miles east of Teheran. **********""My father was a priest and he was murdered,"" she whispered.

She finally mewed when attempting to escape from the basement room where technicians were tailing her with microphones. **********Socks has a relatively small role in the overall Web effort, which is formally known as ""Welcome to the White House: An Interactive Citizens' Handbook,"" and which can be reached at the following Web address: http:// www.whitehouse.gov/ **********All of the Cabinet organizations are represented, allowing, for example, teachers and students to get information from the Department of Education and farmers to check up on the latest news at the Department of Agriculture.

Gill, a White House technology adviser, said the Administration hoped to make the system even more interactive, permitting users to fill out Government insurance applications or other forms on the Web. ""It's a wonderful new voyage of exploration in uncharted waters,"" Mr. Gill said. **********Such plans for interactive government notwithstanding, Socks has emerged as the star of the White House Web server. **********The photo and sound clip used in the Web document elevate the First Feline above the normal anonymity and facelessness of the Internet.

A Sabbatical Lasts Too Long"," **********THE joke not so long ago was that if you wanted a new job in Silicon Valley, all you had to do was drive into a different parking lot. High-tech startups were sprouting everywhere, and if things didn't work out in one place, you could always cross the street and maybe even get a raise. **********But the joke has been drawing fewer laughs lately as more valley companies have been posting no-parking signs. **********In the past year, the shrinking of the defense industry, the cautiousness of venture capitalists and a string of layoffs at companies small and large -- including Apple, Amdahl, I.B.M. and Tandem -- have meant that more people are competing for fewer full-time jobs. Although the valley has always been a place of churning, of contraction and expansion in response to the market, more people are taking longer these days to find a place to land once they have been cut loose. Some may never find a place, and may have to settle instead for consulting work and other temporary assignments. **********""These are shocking times for people in Silicon Valley,"" said Jean Rossiter, a headhunter for high-tech businesses whose firm is in Saratoga, Calif. ""People have been out of work before but the fear now is that there won't be a resurgence in certain areas. Jobs are being eliminated and not coming back."" **********What follows are the stories of two men cut adrift in the valley. Accustomed to earning $70,000 or more a year, both are now knocking on doors, their savings dwindling and their personal lives on hold. **********For Robert M. May, a software engineer with more than two decades of experience, the job search has meant grappling with the knowledge that some of his technical skills are outdated and the fear that he is too old to pass muster in a culture that worships those who work at all hours. **********For Neil R. Henry, a young marketer in data communications, looking for work has been an unexpected and perplexing ordeal. Opportunities aren't dropping in his lap as they once did and employers are less willing to take risks on someone not already an expert in their particular businesses. A job offer may be in the wings for Mr. Henry, but the faith he once had in the valley is shaken. **********NEIL R. HENRY often wakes up in the middle of the night, his mind racing with visions of the job hunt: misspellings in thank you letters, a forgotten pitch during an interview, his resume gutted of his proudest accomplishments. **********Mr. Henry, 31, has been slow to develop such late-night panic. Laid off last May from his $80,000-a-year job at the Telebit Corporation in Sunnyvale, where he marketed data communications systems, Mr. Henry was not overly worried and looked forward to a short sabbatical. He assumed getting another job in Silicon Valley would be a breeze, maybe just a bit harder than the one-day effort it had been for him eight months earlier. So he went off with his girlfriend for a five-week bicycle trip in Costa Rica. **********More than half a year later, Mr. Henry is still looking -- and quite anxious. His unemployment benefits ran out in November and his girlfriend, Diane Santoro, is seven months' pregnant. For quick cash, he has a part-time sales job at night in San Jose with The Good Guys!, a big audio-video chain in California, and also works out of his home here, 55 miles south of San Francisco, doing telemarketing surveys in the morning. After sending out 78 resumes and going on 13 interviews, he is combing his memory for obscure contacts and writing cover letters that begin, ""It's been six years since you and I met . . ."" **********Mr. Henry is like a lot of young people with high-tech resumes who worked long hours in their 20's to the exclusion of almost everything else. Like many of the others, he had developed a comforting sense of security culled from a good severance package -- he got four months' pay despite his short tenure at Telebit -- and faith in the eternal marketability of his skills. Getting laid off was a minor shock that would ""take a weekend to get over,"" Mr. Henry recalls thinking. **********He says he enjoyed being unemployed at the beginning. His enthusiasm for 20-hour workdays had waned a bit, and he admits that searching for a job did not at first seem as compelling as a good bike ride, yard work or cooking a vegetarian dinner for Ms. Santoro in their small rented house in the woods. **********For a few months, Mr. Henry says, he was ""either very selective or very snobbish"" about finding a job, being brutally honest in interviews with prospective employers when he thought he wasn't a good fit. He kicked around the idea of writing a book or starting a new business. **********But in August, Mr. Henry, a sandy-haired man with a quick sense of humor, learned he was going to be a father, and realized that the sabbatical eventually would have to end. When the baby arrives, Ms. Santoro, a social worker who is also 31, wants to take some time off from her job. **********With the passing months, the urgency to find work began to escalate, reaching a peak around Christmas when he picked up the Good Guys! job. Now hungry for work, Mr. Henry is finding it easier to sell a large-screen television on the cutthroat floor of Good Guys! than selling himself. His Roaring 20's **********The successes of his 20's, which took place in the Boston area, did not prepare him for a difficult job search in a place where he has few professional relationships, he says. He was part of the network in Boston, first as an analyst at a venture capital fund, the Zero Stage Capital Company in Cambridge, Mass., where he specialized in investing in startup technology companies. In 1987, he jumped to Octocom Systems Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass., a company whose portfolio he had monitored for Zero Stage. Mr. Henry marketed Octocom's data communications lines internationally. **********But Mr. Henry began to dream about California's warm winters and ""the Mecca of high tech,"" Silicon Valley, he says. On a vacation in October 1992, he visited Telebit, one of Octocom's competitors, and was hired by the end of the day. But within months of his arrival, Mr. Henry's old company bought his new company, and he was laid off along with more than 100 others. **********From The Good Guys!, Mr. Henry says he is learning a few sales techniques he can use in interviews, such as pinpointing the reasons behind a customer's reluctance to buy a VCR or an employer's hesitation in hiring him. **********Despite his five years as a marketing product manager, Mr. Henry senses some employers are unsure he can sell their products, which are not the exact ones he has worked with in the past. This frustrates Mr. Henry, who says he expected to find more of a risk-taking culture in Silicon Valley. **********""People are looking for something I've done to the T, which goes against the grain of high tech, where you have to break from what you know,"" he says. **********Tensions have been growing between him and Ms. Santoro the longer he is out of work, says Mr. Henry, and financial worries, among other reasons, have caused them to put their marriage plans on hold. (The two have just $4,000 left in savings.) They discuss whether he is trying hard enough and what jobs he is willing to take. To avoid seeming too costly or too knowledgeable, Mr. Henry has considered taking some of his more high-powered accomplishments off his resume and applying for junior positions in the $40,000 to $60,000 range. Ms. Santoro is ""O.K. with that,"" he says, ""and that hurts a little."" **********Recently, Mr. Henry went for a six-hour interview at a big computer company in the valley for a position as a product marketing manager for communications software. Mr. Henry calls the position ""a dream job,"" one that comes with all the Silicon Valley features he had longed for, namely a place where people ride mountain bikes to work, put in long hours with genuine passion and seem to have fun. **********The hiring director informed Mr. Henry that the opening had to be filled almost immediately, since it was tied to the introduction of a new product in April. ""Read: long hours,"" Mr. Henry said to himself. How did he feel about that, asked the director. **********His own personal product, the baby, will also be released in April, and Ms. Santoro will need plenty of help around that time. ""But I didn't mention it,"" Mr. Henry said. ""I said, 'Great!' and thought to myself, 'I'll figure something out.' "" Now he is waiting to hear if he'll get that chance."

""It was clear to me that the rest of the world is looking to the United States for leadership on this issue. It's also clear to me, I will say again, that it is very much in our interest to pass GATT because it means more high-paying jobs for Americans."" **********In Manila on Sunday and here on Monday, Mr. Clinton said that the impact overseas of the American elections was, if not minimal, at least manageable and that he alone steers foreign policy. **********After the election, the Administration emphasized that harmony pervaded American foreign policy. But that position has since been refined, and Mr. Clinton and his aides have taken to giving their audiences a basic civics lesson, telling them about the extraordinary constitutional powers of the American President to make and execute foreign policy. **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher, speaking on CNN, said that Mr. Clinton's counterparts at the meeting understood that foreign policy is in the President's hands. **********""These are all men in political life themselves,"" he said. ""And they know about elections and about things going up and down. They understand that the President of the United States is our key foreign policy spokesman, that he has tremendous foreign policy powers."" **********President Kim Young Sam of South Korea offered his sympathy about the elections to Mr. Clinton, a senior Administration official said, talking about ""some ups and downs"" in his own political career and giving Mr. Clinton two words of advice: ""Keep going."" **********Much of the focus of the meetings on Monday was on the accord that requires North Korea to freeze and ultimately dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for $4 billion in economic incentives. Japan and South Korea have agreed in principle to pay for most of the program, but a Japanese official said that Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama had told Mr. Clinton that the world's seven leading industrial nations and others ""should cooperate in this North Korean program because weapons have a global dimension."" **********Both Japanese and South Korean officials said on Monday that their respective governments are not ready to make a firm financial commitment. **********Asked at his news conference whether he expected specific commitments, Mr. Clinton sidestepped the issue, saying, ""Well, they all said that they strongly supported the agreement and that they thought it was very important that we continue to work it through."" **********He acknowledged the land mines that could lie ahead, adding, ""They understood that the implementation of the agreement would not be without difficulty and it would require a lot of efforts on several fronts."" **********The United States, South Korea and Japan met on Monday night to discuss the accord and said afterward that carrying it out was ""of the utmost importance."" **********In a meeting on Monday, China's President, Jiang Zemin, told Mr. Clinton that China ""welcomed strongly"" the American agreement with North Korea to halt North Korea's nascent nuclear program. **********The two men also discussed weapons proliferation issues. Mr. Clinton said he welcomed an agreement reached last month in which the United States lifted the 1993 ban on the export of high-technology satellites to China in return for a new Chinese pledge to continue to make more progress toward complying fully with the accord.  The United States has asked China to disclose its past exports of M-11 missile technology to Pakistan. The United States would be willing to waive economic sanctions required by law in exchange for a Chinese admission that it had exported complete M-11 missile systems. **********Despite Mr. Clinton's insistence that human rights are important to his foreign policy agenda with both China and Indonesia, the issue has dramatically receded since the last APEC summit in Seattle. **********Since the Clinton Administration disentangled trade benefits from progress in human rights, it has also discarded a strategy that set specific human rights goals for China. In his meeting with Mr. Jiang, Mr. Clinton restated Administration policy, telling him that the relationship between the countries would not flourish unless they improved their human rights record. **********The Chinese leader told Mr. Clinton that China ""attaches great importance to human rights,"" a spokesman, Chen Jian, told reporters. But he repeated China's position that the country's higher priority was political stability, because otherwise China's economic revolution would stall, people would go hungry and the most basic human right would be lost."

Leftist leaders warned that unless they were granted sufficient influence in the new Government they might use demonstrations or strikes to try to destabilize it. **********Leftist leaders said an important guarantee that they would receive the power they wanted was the politically conservative business class. Those people have found increased profits as the economy revives after the war, and they may fear instability more than the Government. **********""The business sector is our security in ways we never expected two years ago,"" a leader of the former rebels, Jorge Shafik Handal, said. ""Many of them now realize that creating a democracy with justice is the only way they will prosper."" **********Mr. Handal said elections would not by themselves be the end of repression. That position found an echo from an unlikely corner, the National Association of Private Enterprise. The executive director of that group, Juan Hector Vidal, said: ""Peace is not consolidated yet. We could still run the risk of a repressive society."" **********Mr. Vidal, representing an organization of wealthy Salvadorans, called for tax increases on business to help finance social programs. ""We think the governability of this country comes from all sectors of society working together,"" he said. **********But even as many businessmen said they now believed that they have to give up a degree of political control in return for stability, the former guerrillas said they believed that they could make more changes with politics than with war. **********In the legislative elections the leftist coalition won 22 of 84 seats. Mr. Calderon Sol's party, along with a much smaller right-wing party, won control. But what has worried many Salvadorans is that parties in the center lost many seats, possibly setting the stage for confrontation between the extremes. **********Leaders of the former guerrillas, asserting that their poor showing was because the electoral system was stacked against them, threatened to withdraw from the presidential runoff. But after days of debate coalition leaders decided to participate rather than throw the Government into crisis. **********Juan Ramon Medrano, who after 20 years as a guerrilla won a seat, said, ""We feel that the extreme right wing still wants to run this country for themselves, but we now believe we should oppose them with the best legislative programs we can put together."""

It was Mr. Greenspan's first appearance before a Congressional committee since Feb. 22, and three of the four increases have come since then. **********Responding to complaints by Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee that the rate increases so far would put a drag on economic growth, Mr. Greenspan said today that it would take a year or so for the higher rates to have their full effect. While retail sales may have fallen lately, he added, preliminary economic indicators show that growth has not slackened in the second quarter. Concern Over Bank Lending **********The Commerce Department surprised many economists today by revising upward its estimate of first-quarter economic growth, to 3 percent from 2.6 percent, suggesting that the economy remained more robust this winter than expected, despite severe weather and the California earthquake. **********Early in his testimony, Mr. Greenspan signaled particular concern about rising bank lending, which stimulates the economy and which the Federal Reserve can control directly by raising the short-term rates that banks pay to borrow money. Other Federal Reserve officials have expressed similar concerns in recent weeks, and the Fed announced on Monday that its latest surveys showed strong increases in lending. **********One reason that higher interest rates have not slowed the economy may be that banks are lending on easier terms even as they charge higher rates, Mr. Greenspan said. Although he did not specify these terms, they presumably include requiring less collateral or smaller down payments. **********Some Wall Street analysts interpreted Mr. Greenspan's comments -- including a remark that mutual fund and pension fund managers were right to worry about future inflation -- as a possible hint that the Fed would tighten monetary policy again this summer. ""He certainly left plenty of room for additional tightening but he didn't actually make a case for one,"" said Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York. **********Other analysts saw few clues in the testimony. ""I don't think it shed any new light,"" said Robert Giordano, an economist at Goldman, Sachs. **********Seeking to explain the sharp rise in long-term interest rates this year, Mr. Greenspan said that when the economy began showing signs of greater strength this spring, investors sold long-term bonds and chose shorter-maturity securities that would be less affected by inflation. **********""Given the change in economic conditions and the market's perception of them,"" he said, ""longer-term rates eventually would have increased significantly even had the Federal Reserve done nothing this year."" **********While Mr. Greenspan gave lengthy reviews of many other monetary policy issues as well, today's hearing was partly about politics. Three Democratic Senators gave long speeches criticizing the recent increases as unnecessary and urging Mr. Greenspan not to go further. **********The Clinton Administration has not been critical of the Fed's interest rate increases because of concern that Presidential criticism of the Federal Reserve would alarm financial markets and perhaps prompt the central bank to raise interest rates even higher to show its independence. **********In addition, many Administration officials feel that the Fed may be right to raise rates now to restrain inflation. And, in any case, they seem to prefer a modest rise in interest rates now to a possibly steeper increase closer to the 1996 election. Criticism of Rate Rises **********Two of the three Democratic Senators who criticized the Fed's recent interest rate rises, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, are up for re-election this year but have called for a less restrictive monetary policy for many years. The third Senator, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is not running for re-election. **********None of the committee's Republican members showed up for the hearing, which came at the beginning of Memorial Day recess for Congress. **********Mr. Sarbanes emphasized the problems that higher interest rates were creating for many Americans, and urged Mr. Greenspan to consider their needs as well as Wall Street's desire for higher interest rates to protect the value of bonds. ""We're getting calls in my office from people who can't make commitments on new homes because of higher interest rates,"" he said."

""It is now time for both Air Canada and PWA to move forward and focus on the task of rebuilding our industry,"" Air Canada said. **********The PWA Corporation, the parent of Canadian Airlines, had rejected Air Canada's 1992 merger offer in favor of a bid from the AMR Corporation of Dallas, parent of American Airlines. AMR seeks a one-third interest in PWA for $246 million (Canadian), or $187 million (United States). **********But AMR set as a condition that Canadian Airlines shed its commitment to a computerized reservation system operated by Gemini Group Automated Distribution Systems Inc. of Toronto. **********Gemini is jointly owned by PWA, Air Canada and an affiliate of United Airlines. It is the main rival to AMR's Sabre reservations network. Analysts say that AMR's main interest in Canadian Airlines was to sell it Sabre computer services. **********Air Canada had vigorously fought Canadian Airlines' plans to get out of Gemini and link up with American. Late last year, Canada's federal Competition Tribunal approved Canadian Airlines' withdrawal from Gemini. Air Canada appealed the ruling, and a hearing had been set for next month. **********Today's statement suggests that the appeal will be abandoned and Gemini will be dissolved. Canadian Airlines and American Airlines, anticipating that the appeal would fail, have already set up joint offices in their Calgary and Dallas headquarters to begin the transfer of Canadian's reservation system to Sabre. **********Jacques Kavafian, airline analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., a Montreal securities house, said that today's announcement meant that the two airlines have probably reached some kind of arrangement on East Asian routes with Canada's Transport Ministry. **********For months the Canadian Government has been trying to broker peace between the two carriers, which have been engaged in fierce competition. **********Mr. Kavafian said the solution was likely to be new East Asian routes for Air Canada. Canadian Airlines has the rights to Japan, Hong Kong and China. Air Canada has been seeking a Japanese route for at least five years. Mr. Kavafian said that Air Canada was likely to get a second-carrier designation to Japan and Hong Kong. ""Canadian's Far East routes is what they were after all along,"" he said. **********Both airlines have been hemmorhaging red ink. Air Canada, which employs 18,000 persons, lost $236 million (Canadian) in the first nine months of 1993 on revenues of $2.7 billion. Canadian, which employs 17,000, lost $199.2 million on revenues of $2.28 billion over the same period. **********Air Canada used to be owned by the Government. It went fully into private hands in 1989. Canadian Airlines was created by a merger of four regional carriers in 1987. A fifth airline was folded into Canadian in 1990."

It would be the first meeting of the top leaders of the two countries since the Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945. **********The North and the South announced agreement in principle last week for a summit meeting between South Korea's first civilian President in more than three decades, Kim Young Sam, and North Korea's 82-year-old dictator, Kim Il Sung. But the setting of a date today substantially increases the prospect that the meeting will take place. **********At that meeting, South Korean officials said, the date and location of a second summit meeting, likely in the South, is to be negotiated. **********Today's accord came in a meeting that was remarkably free of bitterness, given the continuing accusations over the considerable evidence that North Korea is trying to build nuclear weapons. The meeting was at the border village of Panmunjom, along the Demilitarized Zone where the armistice was declared in the Korean War 41 years ago. **********Only three months ago, at the same table, a North Korean official was threatening to turn Seoul, 30 miles to the south, into a ""sea of fire"" for bringing international pressure and the threat of sanctions against the North for its failure to open its nuclear sites to international inspectors. **********Many in South Korea have been deeply suspicious of whether the North's suddenly cooperative, friendly behavior is sincere, a result of the new openings former President Jimmy Carter appears to have made during his trip to Pyongyang 10 days ago, or whether it is merely another attempt to stall for time. **********The speed with which the two sides settled the details of the meeting, with few of the angry exchanges that usually punctuate such discussions, suggest that both sides were eager to capitalize on Mr. Carter's trip. **********The agenda was not defined, and it is likely to be affected by the outcome of a crucial meeting between the United States and the North on July 8 to discuss the nuclear issue. **********There are a range of long-pending issues between the North and South, including opening the border for visits of families that have been divided for more than 40 years, economic cooperation and possible steps to lower troop levels and tensions. Nuclear Issue in Foreground **********Resolution of most of the issues is likely to depend on steady progress on the nuclear disagreement. **********For Kim Il Sung, now the world's longest-serving leader, it is a political triumph: the leader of the South will be coming to treat him as an equal in his own capital. **********For Kim Young Sam, it is an equally rich moment. Millions of South Koreans have relatives in the North, and seeing Seoul's leader in Pyongyang will clearly give many hope that Asia's Berlin Wall is falling. **********If the summit meeting is successful, it will also redeem Mr. Carter, whose travels to Pyongyang earlier this month were a source of constant controversy. Mr. Carter emerged declaring that the ""nuclear crisis is over"" and that his two days of talks with the Communist leader had been a ""miracle."" **********Many of Mr. Carter's critics suggested that he was naive in seeming to accept everything that Kim Il Sung said so uncritically. But others suggest that he was shrewdly trying to box the North in and make Mr. Kim's aides carry through on whatever the ""Great Leader"" declares. **********Leaders of the two Koreas have never met since the peninsula was divided in 1945, though they have talked about it periodically since 1972. But there is considerable wariness on both sides that the meeting could turn from a celebration of Korean brotherhood to another bitter argument between two countries still technically at war. Criticism of Site **********Already there are charges that Seoul has caved in to the North. Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's leading newspaper, suggested in an editorial that the South's President was being manipulated by the North and should not have agreed to allow the first summit meeting to occur in Pyongyang rather than some neutral location. **********Until now, the highest-level contacts were a series of meetings between the Prime Ministers of North and South Korea in 1990 and 1991, culminating in an agreement to remove all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula and establish greater contacts among the people of the divided country. **********The denuclearization agreement also bans reprocessing of nuclear fuel on either side, yet the North has built an extensive reprocessing plant. **********The July 25 meeting is to follow the high-level meeting of American and North Korean officials, to begin on July 8 in Geneva. That meeting, set up by Mr. Carter, will discuss North Korea's willingness to open up to full nuclear inspection in return for a package deal of economic and diplomatic incentives. **********North Korea has agreed to a temporary freeze on its nuclear development activity while the talks are on, including the transporting of spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor to a reprocessing plant, where bomb-grade plutonium could be extracted. Step Toward Reconciliation **********In contrast, the goals of the North-South meeting are likely to be more symbolic: a step toward national reconciliation after a half-century of conflict. North Korea's chief representative at today's meeting, Kim Young Sun, said to his South Korean counterpart, Lee Hong Koo, that the meeting would bring ""bright hopes of reunification in the 1990's."" **********In fact, reunification is one topic both men are expected to steer gingerly around, because they have widely differing views of how it may take place, and on whose terms. **********As he arrived at the meeting site today, Lee Hong Koo, South Korea's Unification Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, told his Northern counterparts that he hoped that the six-lane highway he had taken to the Demilitarized Zone would soon be extended to Pyongyang. The North Korean delegation smiled, but said nothing about opening up their society not only to the South's vehicles, but to its wealth and its ideas."

""Even so, there may be limited capacity available at these low fares."" **********Continental Airlines began the latest sale on Thursday night. American, United, USAir and Trans World Airlines said they would match the fares on most routes. **********The reduced fares are for domestic travel from Aug. 27 to Dec. 10, and tickets must be purchased by Aug. 26. Fare cuts are available for international flights from Sept. 5 to Dec. 10. **********Some restrictions apply, and the fares are not available on Nov. 23, the day before Thanksgiving, or on Nov. 27 and 28, the Sunday and Monday after Thanksgiving. **********Continental said an example of a new fare was $159 each way from New York to Los Angeles, compared with the previous advance-purchase fare of $321 each way. **********In the last 30 days, big airlines have offered a new sale every week, said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares Discount Travel magazine. On Tuesday, for example, T.W.A. offered a two-for-one sale that ended yesterday. **********The frequency of fare discounts underscores a trend in the airline industry to offer sales with more limitations since the half-off fare war in the summer of 1992. Airlines are using sophisticated computer technology to control the number of seats available at the discounted fares on various flights and routes. **********The predictable rhythm of fare specials has made it easier for vacationers to reserve tickets with some confidence that they are buying at the right time. In recent months, airline industry analysts have suggested that travelers wait until discounts reach at least 30 percent before buying tickets for a planned trip. **********Despite the pattern of fare wars, the number of special offers in recent weeks has surprised some industry analysts. **********""In the past 12 years,"" Mr. Parsons said, ""I cannot remember this many different fare sales in a 30-day period.""                    --------------------       A New Layoff at Delta **********ATLANTA, Aug. 12 (AP) -- Delta Air Lines, in the midst of a cost-cutting program that is trimming thousands of nonunion jobs, said today that it was laying off 101 more pilots. **********The airline, which is based in Atlanta, laid off 447 pilots last year. The new layoffs come as the company is talking with its pilots, the only major employee group at Delta with a union, about relinquishing a scheduled 2 percent pay increase. **********""The reduction in pilot staffing is consistent with that in other areas at Delta where increased efficiencies are making job reductions necessary,"" the airline said in a statement. **********The Air Line Pilots Association, the union that represents Delta's 8,600 pilots, said it would hold a meeting next week on a response. **********As part of the cost-cutting effort, Delta asked the union to give up its pay increase due to take effect this month. The union agreed, but with conditions the airline has not yet responded to. Delta said today that its request to defer the pay increase stood, even with the layoffs. The company also said it could not rule out further pilot layoffs."

It dismissed Ayer Inc. in New York on Friday from the North American portion of the account, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million, and moved it to BBDO's New York office. **********The consolidation was not unexpected. Trade publications have been reporting since mid-December that Ayer was in jeopardy of losing the North American account, which it has held since 1991. It includes products like Bayer aspirin, Bayer Select nonaspirin analgesics and cold and flu medicines, Midol menstrual pain medication and two moribund brands, Vanquish and Panadol. **********BBDO was awarded the North American account after a strategic and creative shootout with Ayer on the Bayer brand, which has suffered slumping sales competing with lower-priced aspirins and nonaspirin products like Tylenol and Advil. With the North American portion of the account, BBDO Worldwide's total Sterling Winthrop billings grow to an estimated $108 million. **********The Sterling Winthrop loss is the second big blow to Ayer since November, when it lost its lead creative position on the A.T.& T. account to FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York. But the loss is not expected to affect the pending merger of Ayer and Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco, which could take place sometime in February."

Today, they dropped gently into Normandy beneath multicolored parasails and heard cheers instead of gunfire. **********Of course, there was one other difference. The 38 World War II veterans who re-enacted the parachute drop that launched the liberation of Europe 50 years ago tonight are older now, some in their 80's. But it took a brave person to suggest that any one of them was past his best. **********Fear? ""No,"" Alfredo Sepulveda, 74, of California, answered sharply, as if offended by the suggestion. ""I'm in good shape. The wind blew me off course, and I landed behind some trees. But I'm fine. It was very good. I'm glad I did it."" **********James Rizzuto, now 69, another veteran of the 82d Airborne, said he accomplished what he had to when he first jumped into Normandy. ""I wanted to do it today for those who did not come back,"" he said softly, as friends crowded around to congratulate him this afternoon. ""I did it as a reminder."" **********Watched by hundreds of other veterans, thousands of French spectators and an impressive turnout of American brass and politicians, the old soldiers stole the spotlight today as towns and villages across Normandy stepped up their commemorations of the 50th anniversary of D-Day in preparation for official ceremonies on Monday. **********But today there was still time for informality. Some of the veterans, reunited for the first time since the war, embraced emotionally. Others, war medals or ribbons displayed across their chests, were eager to recount their experiences landing on the blustery shoreline of Normandy on June 6, 1944. All seemed to enjoy being feted by French people of all ages, who took their photographs and asked for their autographs. **********Along the shoreline, children climbed over tanks, landing craft and half-track vehicles that stand as silent monuments to the fighting. And everywhere, it seemed, veterans and military buffs were cheerfully driving carefully restored World War II army jeeps and trucks festooned with flags and insignia. Even waitresses in one restaurant were wearing a modish version of combat gear. **********Yet, probably no community in France has maintained closer ties with their ""liberators"" than Ste.-Mere-Eglise, which boasts that at 4:30 A.M. on D-Day, even before some 25,000 American troops began landing at nearby Utah Beach, this town was freed by the young men of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. **********Over the last 50 years, the 1,500 inhabitants of the town have grown used to visits by many of the 13,000 American paratroopers who landed in this area. The dummy of a soldier and his parachute still hangs from the steeple of the 13th-century church to record how one paratrooper, John Steele, dropped into town on D-Day. A local ""liberation"" museum has among its treasures a C-47 aircraft of the type that brought the paratroopers to Normandy. The Obvious Place **********When some veterans in San Diego thought up the idea of re-enacting their pre-dawn drop, Ste.-Mere-Eglise was the obvious place to do it. Both the Pentagon and French authorities were at first opposed, worried that the aging veterans had more imagination than parachuting prowess. But the veterans were stubborn and got their way. **********Even so, the drop was almost canceled. Heavy rain covered the region Saturday, and while the weather was clear and sunny today, there were strong gusts of wind. ""We were already up in the air and they were ready to cancel it,"" said Guy Whidden, 70, from Frederick, Md. ""Then they said, 'Let's go for it.' "" **********Carl Beck, 68, from Atlanta, still exhilarated after landing safely, said: ""It was about what I expected.  We came in higher than I liked. On D-Day we jumped from 500 feet. Today, we came out at 3,500 feet and took forever to land."" **********Mr. Beck was one of 16 of today's jumpers who parachuted into this area on D-Day. The others had parachuted into southern France, the Netherlands and western Germany. There was also one British paratrooper who was invited to represent the 7,000 Britons who jumped that morning in the eastern part of Normandy. **********Of the Return to Normandy group, as they call themselves, only one, Earl Draper, a 70-year-old from Inverness, Calif., was unlucky. After his parasail begin to spin, he cut it away and pulled his reserve parachute. His landing was faster than that of the others and, though he narrowly missed parked vehicles, he hurt his back and was taken to a local hospital for examination. **********The oldest veteran, Rene Dussaq, an 83-year-old former stunt man from Encino, Calif., also caused some worries because he was blown far from the landing spot. Only two hours later did his wife, Charlotte, learn that French firemen had picked him and taken him to Ste.-Mere-Eglise. **********But most of the others who jumped from a World War II C-47 and a Twin Otter landed fairly accurately in a large stretch of soggy green pasture in front of the crowd. They then gathered excitedly to receive a commemorative medal from Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, Chief of Staff of the Army. **********Moments later, 13 C-130 transport planes roared by and another 700 paratroopers -- this time Americans as well as 70 Frenchmen in active service -- dropped out of the sky. They, too, assembled and then marched across open fields to Ste.-Mere-Eglise, two miles away, for a military parade. **********Tonight, France's Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, came to pay France's official tribute to the 800 or so veteran paratroopers who gathered here. The town then gave a dinner for all its special guests and the evening ended with music and dancing in the church square which, on this evening 50 years ago, was still in German hands."

The Haitians came first, in 1991, and stayed for about a year. They were back again last June. **********But when the Cubans arrived in August, the couple's placid life on the suburban side of the concertina wire received a jolt. In the chaos of the tent cities, Mr. Thomas found a distant cousin. Soon, some of his friends on the base were also running into cousins, nephews and even siblings. **********The Cuban refugees, more than 30,000 of them, had set out for Florida in boats and rafts over the summer, when American immigration policy changed to deny them entry into the country. And while detained in this military outpost they call prison, they ran into a tiny, aging population of earlier Cuban exiles who call this place home. **********Before the raft refugees there were ""fence jumpers"" like Felix Wilson, 56, who says shortages and Communism prompted him in 1961 to go over the 17.4-mile boundary that separates this American base from Cuba at its southeastern tip. Thousands of Cubans have escaped to the United States by walking or swimming into the naval base. Fewer wanted to stay. **********""I like to work, and I found a job,"" said Mr. Wilson, who first worked as an operator of heavy machinery and now runs Club Cubano, a restaurant that gives American troops a taste of the cuisine next door. **********Osvaldo Aldama, 68, came to visit in 1961 and never left. **********""I didn't have a passport or money to go to Miami,"" he said. **********Civil service government jobs that have the advantages of pensions and inexpensive, government-subsidized living were a main reason to stay put. There was also the safe, virtually drug- and crime-free environment. About 5,000 military personnel and civilians normally live here. **********""The best place to raise a child,"" said Mr. Aldama, an air conditioner repairman whose daughter and twin sons were born on the base. **********But there was also the feeling that the exile would be temporary, that the revolution would not last long. Some found it easier to stay close, although the separation has been as real as if the exiles had crossed the Florida Straits and settled in Miami. **********More than 30 years later, some exiles have died, children moved on to college and adulthood elsewhere, and many others are just awaiting retirement to move to houses purchased in the States near other family members. Only about 65 Cubans remain now of an exile community that once numbered in the hundreds. **********Many have the English surnames of immigrants from other Caribbean islands who were lured by jobs to Cuba in the first quarter of the century. Some, like the Thomases, who lived in the city of Guantanamo on the Cuban side, knew the base from childhood. Their fathers commuted to jobs here -- his as a boiler attendant, hers as a public works carpenter. **********The Americans have been neighbors since 1903, when the new Republic of Cuba agreed to lease this 45-square-mile corner to the United States. Because the lease may be terminated only if Washington so desires, it remained in American hands even after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. **********The Cuban Government has since regarded the leased territory as ""illegally occupied"" and refuses to cash the $4,085 rent check the Americans send each year. Cuban officials say they would like a tourist development in the area instead. **********That possibility seemed more remote than ever as thousands of Cubans moved into refugee camps that spread over a golf course, beaches, military ranges and, more recently, the area just a few yards behind the Thomases' backyard. From their patio of rose bushes and palm trees in a residential neighborhood called Ocean View, the couple look over a former airfield blanketed by beige canvas tents behind the curl of barb wire. **********""We feel bad,"" said Mr. Thomas, 50, who repairs electronic equipment on the base. ""We come and go, and they are behind a fence."" **********The exiles have felt compelled to help, buying food and clothes for the refugees and hand-carrying their mail to relatives in the States. **********Dolores Rosell, 53, who found a sister, a niece and the niece's 5-year-old son in the camps, said she and her husband had postponed their departure from the base after his retirement until they can take their relatives with them. **********But their compassion has landed the exiles in trouble with military officials, who they say want them to stop ""fraternizing"" with the refugees. **********""It creates a potential problem,"" said Chief Petty Officer Doug Coulter, a spokesman for the Navy. ""If one person is going to get special treatment, that's going to make 2,000 people not very happy."" **********The exiles say they cannot help trying to look after compatriots suddenly shunned by the country that once welcomed them with open arms. In November, the Thomases obtained permission to bring Mr. Thomas's cousin and 20 other refugees over for Thanksgiving dinner. **********Four refugees who could not clear bureaucratic hurdles to make it to the Thanksgiving party recently sent a thank-you note anyway. **********""We'll never forget,"" they wrote, ""that when we found ourselves in the most difficult moment of our lives, we had you."""

Reaping the Rewards of Stick-to-itiveness"," **********THEY don't look like the building blocks of a multimillion-dollar industry: small sticker renderings of delicate flowers, shiny aliens, glow-in-the-dark angels, Edwardian Santas, fuzzy bears and the like. Costing less than a penny each to make, they sell for little more than pocket change. **********Yet stickers have become the coin of the realm for a potent consumer force: girls under 14 -- and to a lesser extent, boys under 8 -- who collect, covet and trade them in enormous numbers, affixing them to walls, bed boards and notebooks and slipping them into growing mountains of scrapbooks. **********Enough stickers are selling these days to bring a broad smile to the face of Andrea Grossman, the patron saint and Mrs. Fields of the business. **********Like Debbie Fields, who turned a talent for baking cookies into a corporate adventure, Mrs. Grossman started at home, making greeting cards and Christmas ornaments in the late 70's at her kitchen table in the San Francisco suburb of Woodacre. In 1979, she designed her first sticker, a heart shape, and stumbled on the idea of marketing stickers on rolls, like paper towels, rather than flat sheets. That seemingly modest change helped set off something of a national craze by making it easier for cramped toy and candy stores to sell stickers by the yard. **********Now, at 62, she is the sole owner of Mrs. Grossman's Paper Company, based in another San Francisco suburb, Novato, where more than 100 people turn out stickers for retailers in this country as well as Japan, Europe and other foreign markets. Mrs. Grossman won't be specific about sales other than to say they were in excess of $10 million last year. But, she said, that was 24 percent more than the year before. And this year, she expects to do even better. **********""I feel incredibly blessed that the company has been quite successful,"" she said in a recent interview. It is now thought to be among the three biggest companies of the dozen or so in the business, all privately held, which split a market that some estimates place at more than $300 million a year. **********Yet Mrs. Grossman's success has been neither instant nor easy. Indeed, her story is an up and down and up again adventure that could serve as a paradigm of the special kind of heartbreaks and payoffs that come from running a family business, particularly one based on a product that proved in the past to be a fickle fad. **********That was in 1983, when the bottom fell out of the sticker market because kids suddenly stopped buying. Mrs. Grossman's company barely made it to 1985, when the kids just as suddenly came back, setting off a second sticker craze that has yet to peak. **********Her marriage to John Grossman, the company's art director, did not make it, however, and the couple divorced in 1984. There were other family problems: before the divorce, the Grossmans allowed the office manager to dismiss their only child, Jason, then 19, as head of the shipping crew because he was skipping work. **********Jason Grossman is now back running the production end of the business and has just spent $1.5 million on machinery so that the company can print its own stickers. There are also plans to build a $3 million plant. **********But experts familiar with fads say the bottom could fall out again in the sticker market, and not just because the kids could move on to something else. **********""What if someone comes out with a sticker program for computers where people can custom-make their own stickers with their own designs? You have just obsoleted your own machines,"" said Ken Hakuta, who runs a toy factory outside Washington and had his own experience with a fad in the early 80's when he made Wallwalkers, octopus-like creatures that crawl down walls. ""The product of stickers will be around for a long time but how it gets to the consumer will change."" **********Indeed, stickers have been around for at least a century and have changed their stripes before, with lick-on seals evolving into the self-adhesive gold stars favored by teachers as classroom rewards. **********Now, Mrs. Grossman's biggest competitors -- Sandylion Sticker Designs of Markham, Ontario, and Lisa Frank Inc. of Tucson, Ariz. -- are seeking safety in numbers, making less expensive stickers and trying to be everywhere, from the shelves of the biggest retail chains to vending machines in supermarkets. **********But Mrs. Grossman thinks she can avoid any future shocks by continuing to carefully avoid the mass market and producing high-end stickers that sell well in smaller toy stores and gift shops. **********Lately, she has been busy infiltrating the adult market, recasting stickers as the centerpiece of craft kits sold for up to $15 each as perennial gift products used to make invitations, cards and party favors. Some of the other sticker companies are also pursuing this approach, though not to the same degree. There are some signs that the effort is paying off: a store in West Los Angeles, Sticker Madness, not only attracts kids for sticker birthday parties but also adults eager to try a new artistic medium. **********With sales continuing to rise, Mrs. Grossman remains a true believer in both her company and her product. **********""Short of being made illegal, stickers are here to stay,"" she said. **********Spend some time with Mrs. Grossman and it becomes apparent that her faith in stickers runs deeper than the bottom line. **********Stickers are cheap therapy, she says, and she looks for designs that cheer people up. ""Our lions, for instance, show no negativity,"" she once told an interviewer. **********""Stickers are nonverbal communication,"" she said the other day, adding that they can help people enhance their self-esteem and even recover from physical injuries. **********""The biggest pleasure for me is to watch the delight stickers bring to customers,"" she said. ""I want everyone who touches this company to benefit from it."" **********There was a time when Mrs. Grossman's world did not revolve around stickers, although starting a business had always been in the back of her mind when she was raising her son and helping her husband sell his landscape paintings. In the mid-1970's, the paintings were selling slowly, and the family needed money. Mrs. Grossman, who was trained as a graphic artist, borrowed $1,700 from her sister to buy the materials to make Christmas ornaments and cards. After school, her son helped her with the shipping. **********She was up to about $100,000 a year in sales when one of her clients asked her as a favor to find a manufacturer of heart-shaped stickers for the Valentine season. What was available was uninspiring, so Mrs. Grossman designed her own, which the printer unexpectedly delivered on rolls. **********Working with the client, Mrs. Grossman made 10 sticker designs in time for a gift store trade show, where she was swamped with orders. To handle all the business, she said, ""I hired every neighbor who could walk and talk."" **********IN its first few years, Mrs. Grossman's Paper Company grew 40 percent annually, according to Calvin Goodman, a longtime adviser to the company. That growth came despite competition from the 100 or so companies that were trying to cash in on stickermania. Mrs. Grossman landed a lucrative deal with the Sony Corporation, which began to market her stickers in stores in Japan. It began to look as if the business could do no wrong. Her husband and son joined the company and the Grossmans bought a Jaguar and added on to their house. **********Then, in 1983, the kids stopped buying. And as the sticker business crashed, so did Mrs. Grossman's marriage. She and her husband had differences about where the business was going and what their roles were, differences that widened under the pressure of working long hours, they both now acknowledge. **********All couples risk similar problems when they go into business together, said Mr. Grossman, who now runs another sticker and gift accessory company, the Gifted Line in Point Richmond, Calif., with his present wife, Carolyn, who had been a purchaser at the old company. **********""Roles have to get defined from the beginning,"" he said. ""If there are differences and they are not talked about, people begin to drift."" **********Mrs. Grossman, who never remarried, agrees. ""We didn't spend enough time together,"" she said. ""And then there was always a problem with it being Mrs. Grossman's Paper Company. I named it that to make him feel more included."" But it didn't help matters, she said, when some of the stickers she had designed outsold some of his. **********The timing of their divorce couldn't have been worse because it divided the company's assets and dealt a blow to staff morale at a time when no retailer seemed to want to sell stickers anymore. Mrs. Grossman's controller quit over the intercom. Her new computer system was repossessed. Her bank asked her to find another lender. And some suppliers began to require cash on delivery. **********To cope, Mrs. Grossman cut employees' hours and pay. When her staff traveled to trade shows, they crammed into one hotel room and slept on the floor. Mrs. Grossman dropped money-losing lines that sentiment had allowed her to hold on to before. And to stop her bank from cutting her off, she reported weekly about what she was doing to keep her inventory under control, her accounts receivable current and her costs down. In desperation, she even brought her bank manager long letters from loyal store owners attesting to how much the stickers meant to customers. **********She managed to hang on until stickers started to come back into favor in 1985. Mrs. Grossman says she still borrows for growth but repays the loan every year. And she closely monitors sales, quickly discontinuing lines that lag behind. The difficult years ""left a permanent impression on me,"" she said. ""I'm never going to be in that position again."" **********And that means she has been careful not to follow the pack. Instead, she says, she has tried to gain a following of customers who appreciate her simple and elegant designs and build loyalty with smaller stores that know her stickers are not going to be found in the chains. Mrs. Grossman says she has dabbled in bigger stores, but did not like the experience, preferring to stay with retailers who sometimes set up a virtual boutique of her products. **********Her competitors say she is the leader in the gift market and third in the conventional retail sector. **********Sticker makers like Lisa Frank and Sandylion can still be found in small gift stores but have a larger presence in big chains like Wal-Mart, Toys ""R"" Us, Kmart and Target, said Ken Enos, director of marketing for Lisa Frank. **********""For her to be part of the mass market of stickers, she would have to change her company,"" he said of Mrs. Grossman. ""You're not dealing with the owner of a small store anymore but number crunchers."" **********MRS. GROSSMAN'S new sense of caution has even led her to forgo pursuing big contracts, like the license to produce stickers based on Disney characters. Sandylion, a division of Marnlen Management Ltd., got that deal. **********Mrs. Grossman's distributors and sales representatives say she keeps stickers exciting by adding a little twist every year. Last year, she created a doll house with stickers that peel off and can be played with over and over again. **********""She's tried to make stickers more than something you put on paper,"" said Patti Johnson, a buyer for Imaginarium, a national chain of educational toy stores based in Walnut Creek, Calif. **********Even some competitors offer praise. ""She knows what her market is and she does it well,"" said Michael Eisenstein, vice president of sales at Sandylion. **********But can Mrs. Grossman keep stickers exciting for the long haul? **********Her son, who is now 30 and whom she calls the heir apparent, says he isn't worried. It also helps that he's a pragmatist who doesn't share his mother's view that stickers serve some higher purpose. **********""Hey, if worse comes to worse and the sticker market crashes,"" he said, ""we'll make wine labels.""Andrea Grossman Current position: Owner of Mrs. Grossman's Paper Company.Born: July 26, 1932; Santa Monica, Calif.Education: Associate of arts, U.C.L.A.; B.A., Art Center School, Los Angeles.Family: Divorced.

""It looks as if they'll produce the same pretax figure as they did last year, by a different route, which is better than the market had dared to hope for,"" said Derek Bullman, an analyst at James Capel & Co. **********The bank's shares rose 7 Deutsche marks to 735 DM a share on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange before the company's report was released and continued to rise in after-hours trading on the news of lower-than- expected provision figures and speculation about a dividend increase. **********Despite a number of spectacular scandals involving major clients, the bank said the need for risk provisioning had fallen substantially ""in line with the incipient recovery of the German economy."" **********The bank's first-half operating profit included overall provisioning of 885 million DM ($556 million), including 473 million DM in connection with the collapse of the real estate empire of Jürgen Schneider, who disappeared around Easter with his wife, and 147 million DM on bad bond trades. **********Overall, the bank was sanguine about its performance in a ""difficult year."" **********After risk provisions, the bank's first-half operating profit totaled 2.66 billion DM, a 3.9 percent increase over the first half of 1993. Net interest income was virtually unchanged at 5.82 billion DM, while net commission income rose 5.9 percent to 3.09 billion DM. **********Profit from trading for the bank's own account took a 67 percent plunge, to 332 million DM, as a result of volatile bond markets early this year. **********The bank's net profit for the first half fell 12.9 percent, to 977 million DM, largely as a result of a 27 percent rise in its tax burden. **********Its pretax profit, including about 238 million DM in extraordinary earnings from the sale of large stakes in Daimler- Benz AG and Karstadt AG, rose 7.4 percent to 2.47 billion DM. Mr. Kopper said the bank's total income from the sales - around 1 billion DM - would be spread over the full year and mostly funneled into the bank's reserves to minimize the resulting tax liability."

It would make sense to be next week, because it's been two years since Bob was brought into Capital Cities and at the time everyone assumed it was just a question of letting him get the experience he needed to move up."" Upward Path **********Mr. Iger had been the president of ABC's entertainment division before moving inside Capital Cities management. He had previously worked as a program executive in ABC Sports. He was successful at each level, and ABC is now widely considered the leader among the three networks in terms of the appeal of its programs and the strength of its advertising sales. **********The senior network executive said that Mr. Iger had met most of the goals set for him when he was named president of the network, citing the addition of several women and minority executives, several long-term deals with affiliated stations and the overall success of the network. **********Mr. Westin joined ABC in 1991 as corporate counsel.

""Financially, they are one of the best managed companies in America,"" Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber, said. **********Former employees tell of expense accounts scrutinized for excesses and line-by-line budget reviews by Mr. Stafford. The company did not buy a corporate jet until the mid-1980's, and for many years its transportation fleet was a bus that shuttled executives between its Manhattan headquarters and its New Jersey plant. A few years ago, the company moved its headquarters to New Jersey. **********Mr. Stafford has also maintained the company's reputation for reticence. Unlike other companies its size which hold regular meetings for analysts, American Home has held only two such meetings in the last seven years. Until the late 1980's, the company did without a public relations department. **********While maintaining tight cost controls -- a vital ingredient for wringing profits from over-the-counter products -- Mr. Stafford has not shied away from some bold moves. **********Since the 1980's, when American Home started selling its houseware subsidiaries and the Brach's candy business, he has pushed the company to a stronger position in the drug business. In 1990, when other companies shied away from A. H. Robbins because of its liabilities for the Dalkon Shield contraceptive devices, Mr. Stafford offered a plan to buy the company for $900 million and set up a $2.5 billion fund to cover the product liability claims. **********Apart from his duties at American Home, where he is chairman and chief executive, Mr. Stafford is also a director of the Chemical Banking Corporation, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the Nynex Corporation and the Allied Signal Corporation. He has a law degree from George Washington University.  Rising Through the Ranks **********In contrast to Mr. Stafford's blue-chip corporate pedigree, Mr. Costello of American Cyanamid is a 58-year-old manager who rose through the ranks and reached the top job just 16 months ago. Starting as a chemist in the organic pigments department in 1957, Mr. Costello had management assignments in Mexico and Spain in the 1970's and was head of the agricultural division by 1982. **********In his short term as chief executive, however, Mr. Costello has earned high marks among investors for cost-cutting moves that have led to expectations of higher profits. **********""He is more down-to-earth than most of chief executives -- the sort of guy who will give you a direct answer to a direct question"" Leonard Bogner, a Prudential Securities analyst, said. **********""You get the impression that some part of his heart is still in the soil and test-tubes,"" Mr. Bogner added, referring to Mr. Costello's background as a chemist with degrees from Fordham and New York University. **********As head of that business, Mr. Costello oversaw development in the 1980's of iminadizole, the key ingredient in a weedkiller called Pursuit, which is very popular among growers of soybeans. **********Mr. Costello has proved that he can oversee a significant corporate reorganization. He sold the industrial chemicals business, bought an agricultural chemical unit from Shell and has already cut 1,200 jobs as part of a planned reduction of 3,500 jobs, or more than 10 percent of the work force. And he has been negotiating a deal with SmithKline Beecham to swap some drug product lines.  A Possible Sale **********Many analysts speculate that American Home's emphasis on the drug business will lead to the sale of Cyanamid's agricultural chemicals business. Mr. Bogner said the business could earn $300 million this year on sales of $2.4 billion and could be very attractive to the Dow Chemical Corporation and Monsanto, both of which have drug businesses that they might trade to American Home. **********Whatever Mr. Costello's future -- a subject Mr. Stafford declined to discuss yesterday -- George J. Krug, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company said ""it's pretty clear that he cut a good deal"" as he made the company more attractive to buyers and bargained for a higher price."

How High Is Too High When Taking Expenses Into Account?","MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
How High Is Too High When Taking Expenses Into Account?"," **********IN a year when the returns of many mutual funds have slipped rather than climbed, the expenses that pull those returns down even further come into sharp focus. **********Expressed as a ratio to total fund assets, mutual fund expenses are an important benchmark for many professional investors because they come directly out of fund performance and, unlike performance, which can vary sharply from year to year, they usually do not change much. **********""All you know with any certainty is the future expense ratio,"" said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors, ""and so if it's above normal, you have to figure it's going to affect your return over time. No fund manager stays above his peer group for very long, so expense ratios come back to haunt you in the long run."" **********Indeed, high expenses seem to be a drag on long-term performance. Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor newsletter, examined the five-year performance of funds with an expense ratio of 2 percent or higher. Fully 45 percent of those funds fell into the bottom fifth of all performers, he found. ""If expense ratios had no impact at all, the higher-ratio funds would be distributed evenly in terms of performance,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""Obviously, that's not the case."" **********Expense ratios loom larger when markets are moving sideways or declining, and in categories where performance tends to be less volatile. ""If you're looking at funds that could have compound growth rates in excess of 15 percent, expenses aren't that important,"" said Michael A. Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. ""But that's an unrealistic goal for most funds. And with funds like fixed-income bond funds, which tend to have returns in the mid-single digits, expenses become quite important."" **********Each professional has an independent definition of an unacceptably high expense ratio. Mr. Jacobs uses 2 percent as a cutoff for most stock funds and 1.5 percent for bond funds, ""and I would be much more comfortable with bond funds under 1 percent,"" he said. Jeremy G. Duffield, senior vice president at Vanguard (where no fund last year had an expense ratio higher than 0.9 percent), said anything over 1 percent should raise eyebrows. And Mr. Markese said a ratio that is half a percentage point higher than the norm for a fund's category ""is worth worrying about with stock funds and is deadly in the bond area."" **********Several professionals suggest using differences in expense ratios as an investment criterion when looking at two funds with similar investment objectives and portfolios. The average domestic equity stock fund with assets greater than $30 million has an expense ratio of 1.24 percent; for bond funds, the average is 0.83 percent. **********Certainly, it is not impossible for funds with high expense ratios to turn in healthy profits. Venture Muni Plus, a top performer in its national municipals category so far this yearmanaged its performance despite having an expense ratio of 2.26 percent, one of the highest for bond funds. **********The fund's manager, B. Clark Stamper, said its high expense ratio resulted in part from the commissions the fund paid to brokers who sell its shares. But Patricia Brady, a municipal bond analyst for Morningstar Inc., said that while there were sometimes other explanations, ""when an expense ratio is this much higher than the average, the fund company is probably just making extra money."" **********The largest part of the expense ratio is usually the management fee or advisory fee. Other costs that get lumped into the ratio include office space, toll-free telephone lines, legal fees, registration, shareholder publications and services -- in short, just about everything except brokerage commissions paid by the fund when it buys and sells securities. When a fund charges a ""12b-1"" marketing fee, that is also reflected in the ratio, but front-end loads are not. **********While high expense ratios on small funds bother some analysts, big funds that maintain even average expense ratios also draw the ire of many. In essence, these managers get more money just because more money is coming into their funds. A $100 million fund with an expense ratio of 1.5 percent is collecting $1.5 million a year to run the fund; a $1 billion fund that cuts the ratio to 1 percent is walking away with $10 million. **********""A lot of the equity funds have gotten very big but haven't dropped their expense ratios significantly,"" Mr. Markese said. **********Eric Kobren, editor of the Fidelity Insight newsletter, said large funds like Fidelity Magellan should be able to lower their expense ratios. Magellan, the largest mutual fund in the country at approximately $37 billion in assets, maintains an expense ratio that hovers at 1 percent, or $370 million at the fund's current level. ""It takes the same number of people to run a fund that's getting marginally bigger,"" Mr. Kobren said, ""and there should be tremendous economies of scale."" **********Basing management fees on something other than fund size, however, does not necessarily lead to lower expense ratios. The fund with the highest expense ratio of any mutual fund with more than $30 million in assets, the Advisors Fund, and the domestic equity fund with the highest ratio among no-loads, First Eagle Fund of America, both buck the standard method of calculating expense ratios by basing management fees in part on performance. First Eagle's customary management fee, for example, is 1.6 percent. If the fund beats the S.& P. 500 index by at least 10 percent (returning 11 percent when the S.& P. is up by 10 percent, for example), the management fee rises to 2.5 percent. But if the fund loses money and underperforms by 10 percent or more, the management fee drops to 0.7 percent. (Fixed expenses for the fund average 0.5 percent.) **********Last year First Eagle was one of the best-performing funds in the country, with a total return of 23.85 percent and an expense ratio of about 3 percent; this year the fund is in the top fifth of its category, up 0.07 percent. But that is still better than the S.& P., so even though shareholders have barely broken even, the higher management fee pushes the expense ratio to 2.7 percent. **********""If we continually beat the S.& P. by a substantial amount, our shareholders will probably be happy to pay the higher fee,"" the fund's manager, Harold Levy, said. ""If we don't beat the S.& P., they won't want to pay the fee and they won't have to."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/12/world/conflict-balkans-analysis-nato-s-balkan-gamble-using-force-best-way-achieving.html,Roger Cohen,1994-04-12,,739,,The New York Times,World,News,article,NATO's Balkan Gamble: Using Force Is the Best Way of Achieving Peace,CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS; NATO's Balkan Gamble: Using Force Is the Best Way of Achieving Peace," **********In twice bombing Serbian positions around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, the United States and its Western allies have wagered that force will bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table because force is the one thing Serbian soldiers in Bosnia understand. **********It is a big gamble. Ever since the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, began whipping up Serbian nationalist sentiment in 1987 as a means to consolidate his power, Serbs have been fed an unrelenting diet of myth and history in which their warrior attributes, heroic struggles against the Ottoman Turks and the Nazis, and their capacity for martyrdom have been a constant theme. **********The basic nationalist message is that Serbs never bow to pressure, and there is no more fervent believer than the commander of the Bosnian Serbs' army, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who ordered the recent onslaught on Gorazde. General Mladic, whose father was killed in 1945 fighting Nazi and Croatian fascist forces in Bosnia, is apparently driven by the conviction that only military might will save Bosnia's Serbian minority. **********One American official said: ""When we bomb, we are telling Mladic and the Serbs that their aggression will no longer be tolerated and we want them back at the negotiating table. But we have not even been able to see Mladic yet, and his aims remain hard to gauge.""  Highly Centralized Army **********The nature of those aims are crucial. From a bunch of often undisciplined militias, the Serbian force in Bosnia has evolved in two years into a highly centralized army under General Mladic's command, Western diplomats say. **********Thus, if General Mladic wants to prosecute the war, he has the means to do so. **********""Milosevic surely wants peace because he wants to free Serbia from economic sanctions, but it's questionable that Milosevic can stop Mladic at this stage,"" said John R. Lampe, the director of East European studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. ""General Mladic appears to be worried that the recently formed Muslim-Croat federation will eventually have the effect of freeing the Muslims to attack the Serbs."" **********Western diplomats say they believe that the Serbian military commander may also be worried by the prospect of a large United States troop deployment in Bosnia in the event of the peace settlement, the possibility of war crimes trials and the effect on his army's morale of any territorial concessions made to secure peace with Bosnia's Muslims and Croats. So he acted by blasting Gorazde.  Gorazde Settlement Is Key **********A United States special envoy, Charles Redman, has been talking to Mr. Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs' political leader, Radovan Karadzic. On the basis of these discussions, he reportedly felt until this weekend that an overall peace settlement bringing the Serbs into some loose association with the Muslim-Croatian federation was attainable. **********But in a television interview today, Mr. Redman conceded that no progress would be possible until the situation in Gorazde is resolved through a cease-fire, the deployment there of United Nations troops and the withdrawal of Serbian forces -- a solution similar to the one now sustaining a tenuous peace in Sarajevo. **********""We now have a difficult issue to deal with in Gorazde,"" Mr. Redman said. ""That has to be settled first."" **********A spokesman for Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the region, said Mr. Akashi would travel to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale on Tuesday for talks with Dr. Karadzic aimed at securing a cease-fire in Gorazde. Only after that would broad peace talks resume. **********This new caution clearly reflects the fact that Mr. Redman has been confronted in the Gorazde attack with the reality that undermined and frustrated previous intermediaries in the quest for a Balkan peace: The Serbs are quite capable of saying one thing and then doing another. **********The question now is who is serious: Mr. Milosevic and Dr. Karadzic when they talk of their earnest desire for a just peace, or General Mladic when he speaks at Gorazde with howitzers and mortar shells? **********The Muslim-led Bosnian Government says the Serbs remain fundamentally united in their commitment to the logic of war. Mr. Redman, who spoke today of his hopes of resuming negotiations soon, apparently thinks otherwise. **********NATO has now backed Mr. Redman's efforts with a show of force. That, however, may not be enough to make a lasting impression on General Mladic, who likes to repeat a favorite phrase to reporters, ""The Serbs will not roll over."""

Noting that no arrests were ever made in that case, Jewish leaders lashed out today at the Government, charging that the failure to solve the crime had allowed a terrorist replay. 'Very Furious' at Argentina **********""I am very furious at my Argentine people and my Argentine nation,"" said Rabbi Angel Kreiman-Brill, whose wife died in Monday's explosion. Standing amid the confusion of an information center improvised at the nearby Chagall Cultural Center, he comforted his 19-year-old daughter, Marcella, who sobbed: ""I want my mother. I want my mother."" **********Noting that the same type of explosive was used in both terror blasts, Argentine officials speculated that the attacks had been carried out by South American cells of the Party of God, a radical Lebanese group supported by Iran. **********In 1992, Islamic Holy War, which is believed to have strong ties to the Party of God, took responsibility for the embassy attack here. **********Today, the Party of God issued a statement in Beirut denying ""any link to the Buenos Aires incident."" **********But last month, the Party of God vowed to strike at Israeli interests around the world after Israeli military forces ventured into Lebanon, kidnapping a Party of God leader in May and killing 26 guerrillas in June. **********[ In Jerusalem, the Israel radio said early Thursday that intelligence experts had reported that the kind of explosives used in the attack on the cultural center ""clearly indicates that a pro-Iranian terrorist group,"" apparently the Party of God, was responsible, according to Reuters. ] **********Others speculated that Argentine neo-Nazis were involved in Monday's bombing, suggesting that the target might have been Project Witness, a research group that had documented that successive Argentine governments systematically gave refuge to more than 1,000 Nazis who escaped from Europe after World War II. **********Based in the building that was destroyed Monday morning, this research team, made up of Jewish and non-Jewish Argentines, normally met every Monday morning to pore over 50 years of Argentine Government files on Nazis that were handed over last year at the direction of President Carlos Saul Menem. **********""The bomb was set to blow up just when the project people meet every week,"" said one of the researchers, Carlos Escude. **********Argentina's military and police have been known to harbor neo-Nazis or their sympathizers. The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles has urged Argentina to investigate the possibility that the bombing might have been carried out by Argentine ultra-nationalists. **********By luck, no researchers on the Nazi files were wounded because unknown to the public, they had decided not to work this week because of school holidays. Also not publicly known was the fact that the Nazi files are kept in a rented office in an adjacent building. **********""It is almost miraculous, but the documents are safe,"" Mr. Escude said. But he warned that the project was still in danger, because the adjacent building is near collapse and there are no copies of the files. **********Also spared was the largest library of Jewish rare books in Argentina, maintained by the Yivo Institute on the fifth floor of the building, which housed the headquarters of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Association. But the mutual aid society's archive of community records, dating to 1894, was destroyed. **********""Two years ago, the terrorists put a gun to our head,"" said Mario Ringler, a Jewish group leader. ""Now they have put a gun to our heart. All the records of the Jewish-Argentine community have been destroyed."" **********Only last month, Jews here celebrated 100 years of organized community life in Argentina, and the celebrations took place at the seven-story headquarters of the Mutual Aid Association. The building also housed the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations, an umbrella of Argentine Jewish groups. **********On Monday morning, at least 100 people were inside, including young people registering at a community job bank and elderly people collecting their pensions. **********Today, in the emergency information center, where Chagall prints hung askew on walls and somber relatives numbly sipped cold coffee from plastic cups, Rabbi Kreiman-Brill recalled his last conversation with his wife, Susy, who was director of the job bank. '50 People Waiting in Line' **********""My last call was Monday morning at 9:30,"" he recalled mechanically. ""She said she couldn't talk because more than 50 people were waiting in line for job interviews."" **********Pasted on outside walls of the Chagall center, rain-streaked lists carried the names of employees who survived: Feinstein, Reiseman, Pomerantz, Berenstein and Berenblum. **********Nearby, Luis Goldemberg patiently held up for television cameras a poster fashioned from a high school graduation snapshot of his missing daughter, Cynthia Veronica. **********""She went into the building at 9,"" the distracted father said as an ambulance wailed by. ""The floor fell out from under my feet when I learned that my daughter was in there."" **********Down the block at a corner restaurant, Jews watched a midday television news program air pictures of the missing. Gasps of recognition and mournful slaps on tables greeted familiar names and photos. Israeli Rescuers Arrive **********Three blocks away, the bomb site teemed with the blue, red, yellow, white and green helmets of the various search groups. An Israeli rescue team that arrived here Tuesday night raised hopes when it announced this morning that sensors detected a human movement below the rubble. **********But by nightfall, only bodies had been pulled today from the ruins of the building, known in Spanish as AMIA for the initials of Mutual Aid Association. **********One young woman, who had studied Hebrew at the Mutual Aid Association, wept as rescue workers filed by carrying army stretchers over their shoulders. Red-eyed, she blurted out, ""How can we keep going here, if there is no safety?"" **********In happier days, Argentine Jews used to brush off complaints by saying, ""Go cry to AMIA."" **********Today, Argentine Jews cried outside AMIA."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/world/carter-heading-off-to-bosnia-on-broadened-peace-mission.html,Douglas Jehl,1994-12-18,,1090,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Carter Heading Off to Bosnia On Broadened Peace Mission,Carter Heading Off to Bosnia On Broadened Peace Mission," **********Former President Jimmy Carter prepared to set off tonight on a Balkan peacemaking mission that has been broadened at the urging of the Clinton Administration to give less prominence to the Bosnian Serbs and to include talks with most of the major parties in the Bosnian war. **********Mr. Carter said today that he was not yet prepared to commit himself to a meeting with Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who invited him to make the journey. The former President said he had not been able to determine whether Dr. Karadzic had taken the steps he promised this week to calm tensions in the region. **********But before boarding an overnight flight to Frankfurt, Mr. Carter said he planned to meet at least with the leaders of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia on a journey of several days in which he vowed ""to seek ways to contribute to the cessation of hostilities"" in the 32-month-old Bosnian war. **********Even if he does decide to meet with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr. Carter is now scheduled to fly to Zagreb, Croatia, on Sunday to meet with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of Bosnia. Depending on what Mr. Carter described today as ""the situation in the region,"" he would then fly to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, on Sunday night or Monday to meet with Alija Izetbegovic, the leader of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government. **********Only afterward would Mr. Carter travel to the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale to meet with Dr. Karadzic, whose refusal to accept a proposed international settlement has been described by the Clinton Administration as a principal obstacle to peace. **********Coming after his missions to North Korea and Haiti, the trip will mark the third time this year that Mr. Carter has plunged himself into a zone of crisis for American foreign policy, and the prospect has already been a source of great discomfort for the Administration. **********But Mr. Carter's agreement at least for now to subordinate his meeting with Dr. Karadzic represents a success for a behind-the-scenes effort by the Administration to reshape the former President's mission out of concern that it could complicate the situation in Bosnia. **********Dr. Karadzic, whose forces have captured 70 percent of Bosnia, has resisted a peace plan drawn up by the United States and the European powers that would reduce the Serbs' holdings to 49 percent. The series of meetings that Mr. Carter has already held with the Bosnian Serb leader's representatives had been a source of suspicion for the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government and its President, Mr. Izetbegovic. **********Today Mr. Carter took pains in a written statement to declare that would seek throughout his trip to encourage the Bosnian parties to accept that peace plan as the basis for negotiations. **********Mr. Carter and a team of advisers will travel during much of their stay in Europe aboard a United States military plane, senior Administration officials said. Before beginning their mediation effort, they are to be briefed in Germany by Charles E. Redman, the United States Ambassador there, who has been the Administration's top envoy in Bosnia, and by Gen. George A. Joulwan, the American officer who is NATO's top military commander. **********In public, President Clinton's top advisers sought nevertheless today to distance the White House from the mission. They expressed substantial doubt that Mr. Carter could succeed even in the narrow quest to bring about a cease-fire in the Bosnian war. And they emphasized repeatedly that the former President would not be representing the United States Government. **********""If he can find a way to solve some of those problems, fine,"" said Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff. ""But we're skeptical about his ability to do that."" **********But senior Administration officials also said privately that the slim chance of progress meant that it would have been unwise to try to block the mission. They said they had sought in conversations with Mr. Carter and his aides in recent days to insure that he was fully versed in American policy and that he recognized the importance of meeting with leaders of all sides in the Bosnian war before undertaking the trip. **********In the last 10 days, Mr. Carter and his aides have held extensive meetings with representatives of Dr. Karadzic. The former President spoke to the Bosnian Serb leader by telephone on Wednesday before announcing that he was prepared to accept his invitation. **********But in conversations with Mr. Carter in the days since, Clinton Administration officials, including Alexander R. Vershbow, the top Bosnia specialist on the staff of the National Security Council, have urged him to reshape his mission to limit Dr. Karadzic's opportunities for self-promotion. **********""We thought it was particularly important that he see the leaders of the Bosnian Government first, since they are the legitimate Government,"" a senior Administration official said today. ""So far, President Carter and his people have met only with the Serbian insurgents."" **********In announcing on Wednesday that he had asked Mr. Carter to intervene in the conflict, Dr. Karadzic promised to take a series of immediate steps as a sign of his good faith, such as providing freedom of movement to United Nations peacekeepers who at times have virtually been held hostage by the Bosnian Serbs. **********But senior Administration officials said today that indications were mixed as to whether the Bosnian Serbs were actually taking those steps, and Mr. Carter said it had so far been ""impossible to ascertain"" whether Dr. Karadzic had honored his pledge. He said he would wait until he reached Zagreb sometime Sunday before deciding whether to travel on to Pale, about 20 miles southeast of Sarajevo, for a meeting with the Bosnian Serb leader. **********The former President did not provide a precise itinerary for his journey. But a statement issued by the Carter Center, his headquarters in Atlanta, said it would also probably include a meeting with Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations special representative in Bosnia. In Washington, senior Clinton Administration officials said they expected that it would conclude with a meeting late Tuesday in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and the Yugoslav federation, between Mr. Carter and Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic. **********Mr. Carter's traveling party includes Harry G. Barnes Jr., a retired Foreign Service office and former Ambassador to India and Chile who is the Carter Center's director of conflict resolution and human rights programs."

New Syrian Missiles **********For his part, Mr. Rabin cautioned that the Syrians now had missiles that made the Iraqi Scuds fired at Israel during the Persian Gulf war in 1991 ""look like children's play."" **********If there is no peace treaty with Syria, he said -- adding that inevitably it would mean that Israel would give up territory -- Israelis should ""prepare for war 3, 5 years or 7 years from now, or 10 years from now."" **********It is clear from their remarks that the Israelis want a more active involvement by the United States, which has tried without success to broker an agreement between the countries, which have not negotiated directly with each other since early this year. **********Mr. Rabin says he prefers direct high-level contact with the Syrians. But since that seems unlikely for now, he says he welcomes American help in closing the gap on the main issue: Israel's demand for ""full peace"" and Syria's for a complete return of the Golan Heights, which it lost to the Israelis in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. **********Israeli officials say they expect Secretary of State Warren Christopher to return to the region in two or three weeks to try giving the negotiations a jump start. Role of the United States **********In analyzing Washington's role, Mr. Beilin was far blunter than the Prime Minister. ""Without an American involvement,"" he told a group of American reporters this week, ""we will not have peace with Syria."" **********The Israeli press reported this week that Foreign Ministry policy planners had prepared an internal study criticizing Mr. Christopher for not being a commanding presence in the Middle East like some of his predecessors, notably James A. Baker 3d and Henry A. Kissinger, both of whom shuttled repeatedly from capital to capital in attempts to bang heads together. **********Publicly, no senior official came close to criticizing Israel's chief ally and aid benefactor in this way. **********But Mr. Beilin suggested obliquely that in his view, the Clinton Administration allows its foreign policy agenda to be set by whatever issue happens to dominate the news at a particular moment, like North Korea. ""I'm happy that the Middle East is not burning,"" he said, ""but I think all of us understand that it is very explosive."" **********As ever, the point of contention between Israel and Syria is the Golan Heights. Syria insists on getting the strategic plateau back, but nearly two generations of Israelis have grown up with the conviction that it is vital to their security. **********Now the Rabin Government says it is ready to give up much of the Golan in return for peace, although it stops short of promising the full withdrawal that Syria demands. 'Interesting' Ideas **********Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said this week that Israel had given the Syrians ""interesting"" new ideas. He did not elaborate, but presumably they focus on a phased Israeli withdrawal over several years, demilitarization of the Golan and neighboring areas of Syria and an international force on the heights that would include the United States. **********In recent months, Syria has shown it is ready to talk peace. But President Hafez al-Assad has said he will not deal with substance until the Israelis first commit themselves to abandoning the Golan Heights entirely. That is where matters are now stuck. **********Mr. Rabin's talk of possible war added a startling note to the discussion. He raised it this week in an attack on the right-wing opposition for speaking ""total nonsense"" by insisting that Israel can achieve peace without giving up land. **********If that were possible, he asked, then why did the rightist Likud Party give up every square inch of the Sinai peninsula to obtain the peace treaty with Egypt that its leaders negotiated in 1979? In that context, he asserted that anyone saying that Israel must hold on to the entire Golan Heights must prepare for war. **********Opposition leaders and Israeli settlers on the Golan accused Mr. Rabin of resorting to scare tactics to prod a dubious public into accepting land concessions. If the Syrians are ready to go to war against Israel, they argued, it is all the more reason for Israel to hold on to the territory. **********Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader, said, ""Whoever does not understand that the reason missiles are not fired at us from Damascus is that we are within spitting distance of Damascus and Israeli tanks hold Syria by the throat -- whoever does not understand this simply is unfit to conduct negotiations."" **********Syria, too, was unhappy with Mr. Rabin's remarks, saying today through official newspapers that it ""would not be intimidated."""

But after opening restaurants in 88 countries, Pizza Hut was certainly as well known. **********Now the Wichita-based pizza giant has signed an agreement to open a shop in the land where -- in a misty, earlier age -- some anonymous chef struck on the idea of combining a thin circle of dough with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese to create the pizza. It was a profitable idea. Throughout Italy, so-called ""pizza money"" has been used to finance major developments. **********For its first franchise here, to open later this year, Pizza Hut searched all of Italy's boot. It settled on this small, businesslike town of 170,000, situated perhaps fittingly midway between Milan, the financial capital, and Florence, the center of culture. Pizza Hut, which operates about 10,800 outlets around the world, apparently chose Parma because -- as Romeo Medici of the local Chamber of Commerce says -- the town ""likes to call itself 'Food Valley' -- you know, like California has Silicon Valley."" **********Parma produces hams -- some 20 million of them a year -- and famous Parmesan cheese. With big companies like the pasta-maker Barilla and Parmalat, a dairy specialist, about 20 percent of the local economy comes from food production, with annual business of $9 billion. **********For most Italians, having a Pizza Hut move in would probably seem like carrying coals to Newcastle or owls to Athens, all rolled into one. But in Parma there was curiosity. **********Over on Strada della Repubblica, Ugo Parizzi, a 50-year-old restaurant owner whose son works the kitchen while his wife, Lella, does the deserts, bubbled as he served a customer paper-thin slices of cured Parma ham followed by a plate of anolini, little pasta dumplings, smothered in butter and -- what else? -- Parmesan cheese. **********""It's exciting, something new, and I will certainly go to see what it's like,"" said Mr. Parizzi, a goateed fireplug of a man whose parents before him were restaurateurs. **********Mr. Parizzi was not alone. After all, hadn't Luca Barilla, an heir and vice president of the big local pasta empire, told The Wall Street Journal this year that American pizza was ""the world's best"" and Pizza Hut his ""favorite restaurant?"" **********Still, there were some who recalled how painfully slow Parma was to accept even the Italian variety of pizza. Over at Al Corsaro, a pizzeria just off fashionable Strada Cavour, Luigi Tagliafierro recounted how his father, Mario, emigrated 34 years ago from Salerno, just south of Naples, which lays claim to being the birthplace of pizza. **********""We brought the first wood oven to Parma,"" said Mr. Tagliafierro, whose pie-sized pizzas, which come in 29 varieties, are eaten from porcelain dishes with knife and fork on tables with linen cloths. Most of his guests wash it down with a glass of the white sparkling wine that is the local favorite. For many in Parma, he said, pizza remains an imported Neapolitan dish. And he has seen how they react to fast food. **********Several years back, in the little shop next door that now houses an upscale boutique called Nichols, an Italian chain named Burghy, whose hamburger shops compete with McDonald's in many Italian cities, opened for business. Within six months, he said, Parma's first and -- thus far, only -- attempt at fast food closed. **********""At first, the young kids came for the novelty of it, but then the novelty wore off,"" said Mr. Tagliafierro, whose two brothers also own pizzerias in town. **********""To succeed here,"" he said, sighing, ""you've got to satisfy the palate of Parma."" **********That palate, as Maurizio Rossi, another local chef, tells it, was largely formed when Parma became the capital of a postage-stamp duchy and seat of the Renaissance court of the Farnese dynasty. In the last century, Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma, a much-loved ruler who married Napoleon and whose tomb in Vienna is still a popular place for people from Parma to visit, set the tone, importing pastry chefs from the Austrian capital and cooks from France. **********""We're not a fast-food town,"" confessed Mr. Rossi, whose restaurant, La Grepia, features local pastas, exquisite dishes of poultry and rabbit, and curious deserts like one with green tomatoes. **********Pizza Hut remains undaunted. **********""Our top grossing units are in Paris and Hong Kong, two centers of cuisine,"" said Robert A. Doughty, Pizza Hut's vice president for public relations, by phone from New York. ""Outside the United States we're seen as a bit of Americana, a treat. **********""We're not seen as fast food, but on the cusp between formal dining and fast food. It's an opportunity to taste America, and it works everywhere else, even on the Champs-Elysees."" **********Out in the Oltretorrente neighborhood of Parma, where Pizza Hut is eyeing a site, this all came as little consolation to Soliman Wagdy, a native of Cairo in his 20's who opened the Robin Hood pizzeria two months ago with his wife, who is Italian. **********The first he heard of the American invasion, he said, was when two Pizza Hut executives dropped in for lunch this week. **********""In Parma, you've got two things in abundance,"" Mr. Wagdy said glumly. ""First the banks, then the pizzerias. There are too many in the neighborhood already."" **********Then, stiffening as he picked at a slice of veal, he added: ""We'll be the first to go over and taste it. If it's good, we'll make it like they do."""

""That is why our investment will be focused on those rest-of-world areas."" **********For Unilever and others, ""rest-of-world"" used to stand for markets out somewhere beyond the developed markets. They were not exactly ignored but they never really got to the top of the corporate priority list either. That has changed. **********""Clearly what the new emerging markets offer stands in pretty sharp contrast to the problems these companies face in their developed markets,"" said John Elston, an analyst with James Capel & Co., the London brokerage house. **********In addition to slow-growing economies and even slower-growing populations in Europe, food companies face an escalating threat from so-called private labels. Store brands now account for 35 percent of packaged food sales in Britain and 20 percent on the Continent, and the numbers are growing. **********Emerging markets have, in contrast, long offered faster growth and far less competition. In the past those those attractions were largely offset by the high risk factors, and in many cases by their lack of a critical mass of middle-class consumers. **********In recent years, just as the dwindling of expropriations, nationalizations and even revolutions has lessened the perception of risk, the explosion in consumer purchasing power in much of the developing world has heightened the perception of opportunity. **********""China used to be seen as having a much higher risk factor than it does now,"" said John Warren, group finance director of the British cookie and snack maker United Biscuits PLC. ""The opportunities in the Chinese market are absolutely enormous."" **********United Biscuits opened its first, small, cookie factory in China in 1990. After two expansions it now has a capacity of 20,000 tons of cookies a year. Mr. Warren said he foresaw that expanding to 200,000 tons in as little as five years. **********Nestlé meanwhile has opened three factories in China since 1990 and plans to open one more a year for the rest of the decade. Driven by rapid expansion in China and elsewhere, Nestlé stands on the brink of breaking out of its decades-old pattern of deriving 80 percent of its revenue from the developed economies and 20 percent from the rest of the world. **********""It is quite clear now that this 80-20 balance will change,"" said François Perroud, a Nestlé spokesman in Switzerland. ""The growth in population and in purchasing power in the emerging markets has opened new opportunities for a company like ours."" **********In Europe, many food companies must decide whether or not they should swallow their pride and use their excess manufacturing capacity to make products that will bear not their labels but those of French, German and British retailers who are their cut-price competitors. **********Virtually all of them have gone that route at least part way in an attempt to soak up spare capacity and thus make their plants more efficient. The problem is that at the same time it erodes the distinctiveness of what they sell under their own labels. **********""In the Old World, consumer knowledge seems likely to grow more quickly than purchasing power for the foreseeable future,"" said Les Pugh, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. As a result, he forecasts a steady erosion of brand loyalties on which the big food companies depend. **********In the emerging markets the cycle is still in its infancy. There, branded products still represent a guaranty of quality. ""There people almost aspire to buy brands,"" said Mr. Elston of James Capel. There the job of the food companies is not to defend their labels but to establish them. Kees Van der Graff, spent four years doing just that for Unilever in Asia before he recently returned to head the company's food operations in Switzerland. **********He successfully established Unilever's ice cream brands in China. ""We sell ice cream in very modern pushcarts and we build brand loyalty based on clear product pluses,"" he said, noting such things as the hygienic conditions it is produced under, as well as constant refrigeration. ""If it is not kept at the right temperature and made under the right conditions, ice cream is a health risk,"" he said. **********Simple considerations like those and an absence of modern competitors have enabled Western food companies to command a premium price for their products. At Unilever that has meant that while the company last year had operating margins of 9.8 percent in Europe, they were 12.8 percent in rest of world markets. **********By rushing into emerging markets to take advantage of the superior growth there, the food companies themselves provide a vital link in a virtuous circle. They provide the jobs and the incomes to boost growth. Again the contrasts with their home markets are vivid. **********As he announced more job losses and more restructurings in Unilever's operations in the developed world recently, Sir Michael Perry noted that in some parts of the world his company would actually be hiring. **********""If growth in the future is coming from the Chinas and Indias of the world then that is where the job gains will be,"" he said."

Many traders and dealers contend the Fed should move more aggressively than the quarter of a percentage point increase it made on Feb. 4, when it raised its short-term interest rate target to 3.25 percent, the first increase in five years. Looking at Future Inflation **********In explaining why he has not changed his expectation of a Fed tightening, even after favorable inflation numbers this week, Darwin L. Beck, director of the economics department at CS First Boston, said, ""The Fed is not looking at current inflation, but at what it thinks inflation will be in the future."" **********""The economy,"" he added, ""is still showing signs of strong growth with capacity ticking up. The good inflation numbers have given the Fed some latitude for waiting, but had the numbers been strong, they might have been forced to go sooner."" **********Mr. Beck sees less than a 50 percent chance that the rate increase will come next week, but he expects another rise of 25 basis points between March and May. **********David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said he saw the Fed doing a series of moderate increases one after another. But he said he did not think the Fed would move until it saw the March employment data, which will be released April 1. ""We could see the Federal funds rate at 3.75 percent by mid-June,"" he said. **********In sloppy trading yesterday, prices of long and intermediate-term Treasury securities declined, failing to follow through on a morning rally by the monthly index released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. **********The Philadelphia report showed a moderation of pricing pressures. The March index was 24.1, down from 26.7 in February. Expectations had been for a March reading of 32. **********The Philadelphia index started a selloff in the bond market last month when investors focused on surges in its price components rather than a benign consumer price report for January, which was released the same day. **********According to traders, the survey of regional business conditions is of particular interest because it is more a leading indicator than a lagging one like the Producer Price and Consumer Price Indexes released earlier this week. Some analysts even use the Philadelphia Fed index as a tool for making forecasts for the National Association of Purchasing Management index, whose next report is due April 1. **********By late in the day, the price of the closely followed 30-year Treasury bond was down 11/32 , to 9224/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.82 percent, from 6.80 percent on Wednesday. **********Rates on the shorter maturity bills were mixed, with a three-month bill down 7 basis points, to 3.44 percent, and a one-year bill up two basis points, to 4.08 percent. The three-year note rose three basis points to 5.31 percent, while the 10-year note climbed 4 basis points, to 6.40 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. **********Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities, said that while trading was a little sloppy yesterday, ""My sense is that the market has made a bottom, taking some very good numbers and managing to rally."" **********Mr. Canelo said he was not concerned that the market lost the early rally yesterday because prices were still above the lows for the week. ""Today's inflation number came in pretty much, maybe even slightly better than expected,"" he said. **********""The bottom line is that the Treasury market has already discounted the Fed's next move to hike short-term interest rates and all the other terrible things that had been expected,"" he said, ""which is why the market appears to be settling down."""

Over all, the United States food-service business has $120 billion in annual revenues, according to Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a restaurant-industry research firm. **********""The food-service business is a good industry, growing at about 5 percent a year,"" said Andrall E. Pearson, a general partner of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. He will become chairman of the Foodservice board. ""Despite its lackluster performance, Kraft is well positioned for the future, and it's already the leader in a group of major markets."" **********Not all analysts agreed. The food-service industry ""is a very tough business and the margin for error can be very tight,"" Mr. Paul of Technomic said. ""It has to be viewed as a risky acquisition."" **********Though not directly related to last week's wholesale changes in the Philip Morris executive suite, the sale of its food-service business is a further sign that the company is serious in announcing that it will not spin off its food operations from its tobacco businesses. **********The food-service division was assembled by Philip Morris's former chairman, Michael E. Miles, who was deposed from the company last June, ""and Foodservice never performed the way he wanted it to,"" said S. Leigh Ferst, a securities analyst for S. G. Warburg and Company. **********""Foodservice is a business of relatively low margins and nonbranded items, whereas Kraft sells branded items through supermarkets,"" said Barry M. Ziegler, a securities analyst for A. G. Edwards. ""The sale is a good move since the food service is so different from the Kraft core business."" **********Philip Morris's shares fell $1 yesterday, closing at $57.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The proposed deal was a trade-off that should benefit Kraft General Foods in the long run, said Terry Bivens, a securities analyst with Argus Research. ""Kraft will lose about $4 billion in sales thanks to this sale, but its operating numbers will look much better without this business,"" he said. ""Philip Morris didn't want to keep a business that had one-tenth the profit margins of its tobacco business."" **********Kraft General Foods, based in Northfield, Ill., had annual revenues of $24 billion last year, including the $4 billion from Kraft Foodservice. The food-service division had operating profits estimated at $60 million last year. **********Philip Morris has for years discussed the possibility of selling off its Foodservice division, which was concentrated from a group of disparate businesses under the tenure of Mr. Miles. Serious negotiations did not begin until after his departure on June 19, after the company's board decided against a split-up of food and tobacco operations, which Mr. Miles is believed to have favored. **********Last Wednesday, the company said William Murray, the 59-year-old chairman of Philip Morris, would retire and be succeeded on Feb. 1 by Geoffrey C. Bible. On Friday, Philip Morris announced that James M. Kilts, 46, a Kraft U.S.A. group vice president, would occupy the newly created post of executive vice president of worldwide food for Philip Morris, reporting to Mr. Bible. **********Mr. Pearson of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, who was president of Pepsico for 15 years, said his firm would take Foodservice private in an all-cash deal. His partnership intends to build the business, he said, ""and it might be"" taken public ""some day."" **********James A. Miller said in an interview that he would stay on as president of the Kraft Foodservice. He confirmed that there had been ""several other interested purchasers,"" but declined to say which companies. There will be no immediate executive changes, and the company headquarters will remain in Deerfield, he said."

Funds usually called ""conservative"" -- municipal bond, utility and equity income funds -- suffered some of the worst damage. **********The losses are a sharp reversal from the strong gains all kinds of funds achieved last year. Standing in sharpest contrast were the declines in international funds, the stars of the fourth quarter of 1993. **********General stock funds, which according to industry figures hold more than $650 billion of investors' money, fell 3.4 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Morningstar Inc., the fund-tracking firm in Chicago. That decline is the steepest since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sending American stock markets into free fall. Last quarter, not a single category of diversified stock funds posted a gain, and just a few individual funds managed that. **********Still, individual investors seem to be staying the course -- so far. While net flows of money into domestic stock funds have slowed sharply this year, they remain positive, according to figures supplied by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. Even at the large no-load fund companies, whose investors include the most trigger-happy, stock funds attracted an average $777 million for the last four weeks, down from $1.3 billion for the first four weeks of the year. But spokesmen for some of the funds that are sold directly to investors, like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, reported net redemptions last week in some funds -- a sign that investors' relative calm so far may not last. **********Bond investors have already been bailing out, and the retreat has spread to municipal bonds. Tax-exempt bond funds, which at the end of January attracted average new money of more than $700 million a month, subsequently started experiencing strong outflows. By the end of March, investors were yanking an average $300 million a week, AMG indicates. **********That is not surprising, given that municipal bond funds fell 5.3 percent last quarter, the biggest decline in more than a decade. Indeed, investors would have to go back to 1981 to find such a poor quarter; even in the spring of 1987, often cited as the municipal market's worst moment, funds fell 4.9 percent. **********Most municipal-fund investors have never experienced such results; back in 1981, when these funds plunged more than 9 percent in one quarter, they had less than $3 billion in tax-exempt funds. Today, these funds have more than $250 billion, more than half of which has poured in since the end of 1991, as banks in particular started selling these funds to clients dissatisfied with the returns they could get on bank deposits. **********But redemptions, and fund managers' fears of more of that, are pushing prices down in the tax-exempt market, as some funds put the ""for sale"" sign on hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds. ""The municipal market is dominated by individuals in bond funds, and when they are redeeming, historically the market has reacted badly,"" said Jerome J. Jacobs, who manages tax-exempt funds for the Vanguard Group. ""This is a case in point."" **********Today and tomorrow will be critical days for the municipal market, Mr. Jacobs said, because investors will have had the weekend to digest just how bad their losses have been of late. Yet, tax-exempt bonds now yield almost as much as taxable Treasury issues, a very rare occurrence. Money mangers like Mr. Jacobs are hoping bond fund investors' desire for return will help overcome their fear. **********Americans have also been fleeing taxable bond funds, where the carnage has been concentrated in those that invest in government debt. Funds that specialize in Ginnie Maes, mortgage-backed securities sold by the Government National Mortgage Association, have suffered redemptions so severe that in February, they sold a net $2.8 billion of bonds, according to the Investment Company Institute. The exodus by investors accelerated in March. **********Taxable bond funds lost about 2.5 percent in value last quarter, as steep price declines overwhelmed the interest payments generated by the funds' bond holdings. Those price declines could worsen this week, as the market reacts to a report on Friday that companies created new jobs at a far faster rate than expected in February. Many bond traders were on vacation when the data came out, but those who were on duty sent the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond up to 7.26 percent, the highest since January 1993. **********The job figures may fuel fears that the economy is heating up beyond the Government's control, which would eventually spur inflation. But money managers note that much of the data they use to get a grip on the state of the economy has been disrupted by bad weather and earthquakes, and that on a fundamental basis, inflation still seems far off. **********""What you're seeing now is a very strong divergence between fundamental bond pricing and technical pricing,"" said David Rosenberg, who runs the Oppenheimer Government Securities Fund, the quarter's top government mortgage fund. ""What's unnerved the bond market is a reversal of the technical factors"" that drove up bond prices in the fall. **********Those included demand for Treasury securities from state and local governments, banks and hedge funds, which borrowed heavily to buy bonds. All three groups, in different ways, were taking advantage of the low interest rates available and the huge difference between short-term and long-term rates. When the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates on Feb. 4, that demand dried up. Indeed, hedge funds had to sell bonds to repay their loans, driving down prices. **********Traders will continue ""to hit bids, to sell bonds, until the technicals turn around,"" Mr. Rosenberg said. ""This wave of selling is hard to ignore, but I don't think this will be a bad place to be invested three months from now."" **********Technical factors were also at work in one of the quarter's few bright spots: Japan. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks climbed almost 11 percent last quarter; because of the drop in the dollar's exchange value with the yen, American investors could have made far more. Indeed, the quarter's top fund, DFA Japanese Small Company, a quasi-index fund that is always fully invested, soared 28.4 percent. **********While some of these gains may have been related to hopes for an economic recovery in Japan, a large part of them came from frantic buying by foreigners, especially those fleeing other Pacific Rim markets. As a group, all Pacific region funds suffered the worst bloodletting, falling 8 percent. **********Looking ahead, ""the foreign investors' asset shift, at least the first wave, seems to be over,"" said Seung K. Kwak, portfolio manager of Scudder, Stevens & Clark's Japan Fund. ""They'll need more evidence of a solid earnings recovery, and the yen's strength abating, before another wave comes."" **********Here at home, the happiest investors may be those in the Merrill Lynch Technology Fund, which is managed by James K. Renck. Calling from California last week, Mr. Renck explained that he had 40 percent of his portfolio in cash last quarter, and the rest of the $395 million fund in about 15 stocks, on which he does extensive research. This approach is unconventional -- most technology funds hold dozens of stocks and far less cash -- but it paid off last quarter with a return just shy of 15 percent. **********Despite the recent blood bath in technology stocks, some of which saw double-digit losses last month, Mr. Renck remains moderately upbeat. ""Particularly in the semiconductor industry, which is generally a good indicator for technology, a lot of companies will be saying positive things"" about their sales and earnings, he said. ""I just hope it has a positive impact on the stock market."""

Her previous stints in retailing were at Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and R. H. Macy & Company, which owns I. Magnin, another exclusive specialty store chain with a big designer business that is being closed. **********Outside its four Henri Bendel specialty stores, the Limited has not dealt in designer merchandise. Based in Columbus, Ohio, the Limited is infamous on Seventh Avenue for knocking off designer fashions, making cheap copies in overseas factories and selling them here under its own labels for a fraction of the price. **********That may make designers think twice about having Mrs. Saltzman at their fashion shows. ""Would Claude Montana be thrilled finding copies of his leather jackets at the Limited?"" asked Alan G. Millstein, a fashion industry consultant. ""Does Karl Lagerfeld want to see his designs in Express?"" **********Mrs. Saltzman is well aware that her longtime friends in the fashion industry may be wary. Asked if she would be back in her traditional seat in the front row of the designer shows in Europe next spring, she said, ""I certainly hope to be sitting there, and I will be there if I'm invited."" **********Chances are the invitations will continue to arrive since Mrs. Saltzman will influence merchandising at Henri Bendel, which has worked hard to build a business by cultivating young, up-and-coming designers. **********And a few designers have begun collaborating with the Limited chain, which has suffered sharp sales declines for two years, to develop lines that will appeal to a slightly more fashion-conscious, affluent customer. Those lines will be sold under Limited labels, a Limited spokesman said. **********""Ellin is very well liked, both on Seventh Avenue and across the Atlantic, and she's considered an asset at the shows,"" said Kalman Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's and an old friend of Mrs. Saltzman's. ""After all, Rose Wells Bing is at every show right in the front row."" **********Mrs. Bing is the trend-spotter for the Gap Inc., which is also known for knock-offs. **********""This is a really brilliant move on Ellin's part,"" Mr. Ruttenstein said, describing her move as just another example of her ability to jump on a new trend. Middle-class customers are the current darlings of American retailing, and stores that have ignored Middle America are now scrambling to woo it. **********""I had an impact at Saks and Bergdorf and Macy's, yes, but it reached a very select group of people,"" said Mrs. Saltzman, who will work out of the Limited's New York office but make frequent appearances in Columbus. ""This was a chance to walk through airports and see people wearing what you've helped choose and create."""

And there has been great uncertainty over whether his son and presumed successor, Kim Jong Il, would pursue this more conciliatory line. In fact, it is still not certain that the younger Mr. Kim has assumed full control of the country. **********But today's announcement, in an editorial in the Government-controlled newspaper Rodong Sinmun, confirmed that the same approach would be taken in the negotiations, which are to resume in Geneva on Friday. **********The editorial emphasized North Korea's desire to obtain a modern nuclear reactor for generating electricity, a project that would cost billions of dollars and take as long as a decade to construct. Some experts have questioned whether such a reactor is practical for a country as isolated and economically backward as North Korea, but the editorial characterized the light-water reactor as ""a touchstone"" of American intentions. **********""We have already proposed a package solution to the nuclear issue and are still maintaining this position,"" said the newspaper, which was cited in an official broadcast monitored here. **********Positive as the announcement sounded, promising fruitful talks ""if both sides take sincere positions,"" the negotiations may face a critical impasse very quickly, say Government officials involved. **********Just before Kim Il Sung adopted his apparently more flexible stand, North Korea violated instructions from United Nations inspectors and unloaded 8,000 spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang. The North placed the rods in a cooling pond and said it would have to reprocess them quickly for safety reasons. **********Western experts say the rods will yield as much as 60 pounds of weapons-grade plutonium if they are reprocessed, enough to construct four or five nuclear bombs, tilt the balance of power on the Korean peninsula and push the region into a far more dangerous crisis than it has faced so far. **********The Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North Korea has already produced enough plutonium to make one or two bombs. **********North Korea has said that because the cladding on the rods is deteriorating quickly, it must begin reprocessing by early September. The United States and South Korea have insisted that haste seems uncalled for, and that if reprocessing begins it will be, as one official put it, ""a deal breaker we could not tolerate."" **********The United States has proposed, first of all, to send experts to the site to lengthen the life of the rods by improving conditions in the cooling pond. It is also proposing that the spent rods be moved out of North Korea for reprocessing or storage. **********Reports today in South Korea said the North offered at the last round of discussions, in Geneva on July 8, to permit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor the reprocessing, and then to put the plutonium extracted under the control of the United Nations agency."

Fighting Nearby **********Clashes in the pocket were clearly intense overnight, and fighting was reported again today near Vitkovici, a village controlled by the Bosnian army just upriver from the town of Gorazde, which is believed to hold a weapons production plant. **********""There was not a real cease-fire,"" said a United Nations military spokesman, Maj. Rob Annink. ""They kept on shelling and firing, but on a much lower level."" **********The Serbs have captured about 5 percent of the Gorazde pocket southeast of the town of Gorazde since launching the offensive 11 days ago, Major Annink said, adding that Serbian forces had not reached the eastern bank of the Drina River as a Serbian commander had asserted earlier. **********The Serbs began coveting Gorazde soon after the start of the Bosnian war. The pocket is the last Bosnian Army-controlled territory on the main road linking the Serbian capital, Belgrade, with the major Croatian resort city of Dubrovnik. **********One Western diplomat who took part in the cease-fire talks today expressed confidence that a comprehensive truce might be reached as soon as Saturday. **********He said that Bosnian officials received ""assurances"" today that the present battlefront would not effectively become a future territorial border if a cease-fire took hold. **********The Bosnians have repeatedly refused to accept the Serbian peace overtures, fearing that the Serbs would use peace to legitimize their hold on the 70 percent of this country's territory they have seized.  Serbs Pressing On **********The commander of the Bosnian Serb forces attacking Gorazde warned today that his men would press on against the enclave. **********""Soon we shall occupy the entire Gorazde region and thus gain control of both banks of the Drina,"" said the Serbian commander, Gen. Vlado Spremo, in an interview given to a Yugoslav radio station. **********United Nations military observers reported that they had witnessed shelling on Thursday about three miles north of the town of Gorazde, Major Annink said, characterizing the fire as ""stationary and harassing."" **********In the 24-hour period ending today at 8 A.M. local time, United Nations doctors reported 16 new deaths, said the Sarajevo spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris Janowski. **********""An additional 51 persons were wounded,"" Mr. Janowski said. He added that the death toll on the Bosnian side during the Serbian offensive rose to 83, with 376 wounded.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/28/business/itt-moves-to-shed-more-units.html,Laurence Zuckerman,1994-12-28,,722,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,ITT Moves To Shed More Units,ITT Moves To Shed More Units," **********The ITT Corporation said yesterday that it had sold one of its consumer finance companies to the Norwest Corporation and that it was close to selling three more financial services subsidiaries to an unidentified buyer. **********The two deals are the latest in a blizzard of transactions intended to raise cash for ITT's entrance into the gambling and entertainment businesses. **********Yesterday's announcement came only one day after ITT said it had agreed to sell its commercial finance unit to Deutsche Bank of Germany. ITT estimated yesterday that its net gain from this sale would be about $900 million, with the total price at about $2.3 billion; that price is lower than the $4 billion initially cited by Deutsche Bank. **********By the time all three deals are completed and two other financing businesses are sold, ITT said yesterday, the company should reap $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion. **********But most of that money will very likely be spent financing a spate of recent acquisitions, including two sports teams, a cable network and a casino owner. **********""I wouldn't describe it as a cash hoard,"" said Jay Cohen, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ""I will say that the company does have some financial flexibility and is relatively liquid."" **********Wall Street was pleased with ITT's deals. Shares of ITT jumped $4.375, to $88.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Norwest's shares edged up 12.5 cents, to $23. **********Norwest agreed to buy Island Finance, a consumer finance company serving Puerto Rico, several Caribbean islands and parts of Central America. Jim Gallagher, an ITT spokesman, said Norwest would pay $1.4 billion for Island Finance, which has more than $1 billion in outstanding loans. But after some debt is retired by ITT, Norwest will spend about $600 million, a figure confirmed by Norwest. **********The price was relatively steep, but analysts said Island Finance would immediately add 1 cent a share to Norwest's profits. The deal opens a new market for Norwest Financial, Norwest's highly successful consumer finance subsidiary, which operates in the United States and Canada. **********""This lays the foundation for them to expand further as opportunities arise related to Nafta,"" said Sandra J. Flannigan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. She said Norwest was taking on virtually no currency risk because more than 90 percent of Island Finance's loans were in American dollars. **********ITT also said it was negotiating to sell its equipment finance, small business finance and real estate services units. The company declined to identify the potential buyer, but said it had received a bid of $1.8 billion. **********On Monday, Deutsche Bank said its acquisition of ITT Commercial Finance was in the range of $4 billion. But yesterday, Deutsche Bank officials said that the $4 billion figure was actually the approximate size of ITT Commercial Finance's assets, which are $3.75 billion. **********Mr. Gallagher of ITT said yesterday that the total purchase price was about $2.3 billion but that ITT had agreed to assume about $1.4 billion of the subsidiary's debt payments, lowering the net gain for ITT to about $900 million. A Deutsche bank spokesman declined to confirm or deny the figure. **********One of the most acquisitive conglomerates formed during the 1960's, ITT has substantial assets in insurance, manufacturing and hotels. In the last year the company has said it would like to reduce its dependence on the financial services assets and focus more on entertainment and gambling. **********Last week ITT announced that it would pay $1.7 billion to acquire Caesar's World, which owns and operates casinos in Atlantic City, Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe, Nev. **********Earlier this year, it joined forces with the Cablevision Systems Corporation to acquire Madison Square Garden, the MSG cable television network and the New York Knicks and New York Rangers sports teams for $1.1 billion, a deal that is expected to be completed early next year. **********ITT has also been spoken of as a prime candidate to buy a television network, but Mr. Cohen of Salomon Brothers said he did not believe that such a deal was likely. ""I think that they are going to chew what they've bitten off and grow these core businesses in 1995,"" he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/22/business/credit-markets-rates-jump-as-bond-traders-expect-a-fed-increase-soon.html,Robert Hurtado,1994-03-22,,958,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Rates Jump as Bond Traders Expect a Fed Increase Soon,CREDIT MARKETS; Rates Jump as Bond Traders Expect a Fed Increase Soon," **********Short-term interest rates jumped to their highest level in nearly 21 months yesterday as investors and dealers sold Treasury securities on expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise its interest-rate target this week. **********Traders and investors are focusing on when and how large the next interest-rate increase by the Fed will be. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the central bank, meets today for the first time since short-term interest rates were raised on Feb. 4. **********The longer the Fed waits to raise short-term rates, the more investors grow concerned that the central bank is not being aggressive enough in combating inflation. This fear has already played a major role in pushing short-term interest rates higher and pushing long-term rates near 7 percent. **********At the Treasury's weekly auction yesterday, the average rate of a three-month bill was 3.61 percent, up from 3.57 percent last week. The average rate for a six-month bill was 3.90 percent, up from 3.85 percent. **********The rate on a three-month bill is now more than a percentage point higher than its low of 2.58 percent on Oct. 1, 1992, and the highest since it was 3.62 percent on June 26, 1992. **********Long-term rates also rose yesterday. The yield of the 30-year bond climbed to 6.95 percent, from 6.90 percent on Friday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 21/32 , to 918/32 . The yield on intermediate-term securities also gained, with the yield on the seven-year note rising to 6.17 percent from 6.11 percent. **********Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading specialist at CS First Boston, said the Fed's job now was to raise short-term interest rates and stabilize the market. ""Raising interest rates is easy, bringing stability to the market will be more difficult,"" he said. Some analysts and traders said a half-point increase in the Fed's short-term interest-rate target would lend some stability to the government securities market and show investors and dealers how serious the Fed was about fighting inflation in the future. **********The Fed uses the Federal funds rate, which is now 3.25, as its short-term interest rate benchmark. The Federal funds rate is interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed raised the rate from 3 percent on Feb. 4, its first increase in five years. But many traders have argued that the February increase was too small. **********Mr. Alexy said the market would not be satisfied with another quarter of a percentage point increase in the Federal funds rate. But he said traders and investors might be placated if such an increase was accompanied by a half a percentage point rise in the Fed's discount rate, which is now 3 percent. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges banks for loans. An increase in the discount rate would be seen as another signal of the Fed's toughness, especially because it would lead to an increase in banks' prime rates. **********""The problem the market has with a gradual approach to raising rates is that it will get one tightening and still be expecting more,"" Mr. Alexy said.  ""How can you expect investors to buy securities if they think rates will be going up again soon. Rising interest rates will cause the securities to lose value."" **********Mr. Alexy said the timing of any move by the Fed was another concern for the market because dealers worry about the impact of higher rates ahead of the Treasury's sale of $28 billion in new two- and five-year notes today and tomorrow. A poor auction could leave many dealers holding more Treasury securities than they would like. **********In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.13 percent, up from 5.09 percent on Friday, while the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.05 percent, up from 6 percent last week. **********Analysts said the widespread speculation that the Fed would increase short-term rates had grown more feverish since Friday's meeting between President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed. Although the White House denied that interest rates or today's policy committee meeting were discussed, many analysts believe that the credibility of the Fed is on the line and that it will have to tighten credit just to prove that Mr. Greenspan was not pressured by the Administration. **********Most economists polled by the Reuters news service expect the Fed to tighten with a 25-basis-point increase in the Federal funds rate today. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. **********The Treasury, meanwhile, yesterday reported a budget deficit of $41.6 billion in February, which was smaller than the $44 billion deficit that had been expected. Last month, the Treasury reported a $15.6 billion surplus. **********The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures)              3-Mo.

There is no way to stop it anymore or to reverse it,"" Bassam Abu Sharif, a former senior aide to Yasir Arafat and an early advocate of peace with Israel, said as he watched Jordan's Prime Minister, Abdel Salam Majali, publicly welcome the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, on Jordanian soil for the first time. **********The militant Muslim Brotherhood had inveighed against the historic event as well as against King Hussein's plans to meet Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington on Monday. Hamza Mansour, a senior official of the brotherhood's bloc in Jordan's Parliament, acknowledged that the coalition of opponents to peace with Israel might have to shoulder ""responsibility for its failure to mobilize the people."" **********Assessing the reaction among people in Jordan and elsewhere in the Arab world, Fahd al-Fanek, a Jordanian economist and newspaper columnist, said: **********""Those who reject peace must offer an alternative, which can only be war. Otherwise they seem to advocate further delays and paralysis for a few more decades with no obvious benefit. Paralysis only means that we would be negotiating tomorrow for gains we could have taken for granted decades ago. Wars have proven catastrophic for the Arab world. Call it a new mind-set; call it realism. These are the new facts of life."" **********Indeed, since the Madrid conference in October 1991, the efforts toward peace in the region have moved forward despite incidents like the deadly Israeli-Palestinian clashes in Gaza last weekend, the slaying of an Israeli Army officer by Palestinian militants this week, and even a Jewish settler's killing of at least 29 Palestinians in February in the West Bank town of Hebron. **********In Cairo this week, Palestinians and Israelis held more peace talks. And in Gaza on Thursday, Maj. Gen. Nasr Youssef, the commander of the Palestinian police forces in Gaza and Jericho, declared that ""the peace process will continue and we will deal firmly with whoever tampers with it."" Old Foes Lunch **********General Youssef had just held a luncheon for his Israeli counterpart, Maj. Gen. Yom Tov Samian, who collaborated with Palestinians in the joint security committees that were set up two months ago. **********General Youssef's comments came as other Palestinian officials reported that the Palestinian police had arrested an undisclosed number of Muslim militants in Gaza for taking part in the slaying of the Israeli soldier. This was coupled with a statement by Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian negotiator, that such acts of violence against Israelis in Gaza or elsewhere were no longer justified. **********These statements and actions are part of a mosaic of a solid alliance for peace among several Middle Eastern and North African nations, including Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf nations as well as the Palestinians. **********On Thursday, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who over the last three years has acted as an intermediary between Palestinians and Israelis, was briefed by Mr. Peres in Cairo about the talks in Jordan. In the last few months, Israeli officials have been greeted in Qatar, Oman, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as in Egypt and now Jordan. Israeli journalists are traveling to Arab countries in growing numbers to cover these events, and Arab journalists are showing up every week in Jerusalem. Palestinians Back King **********But it is here in Jordan that the Israelis' arrival is perhaps most significant, because nearly 60 percent of the 4.5 million people are of Palestinian origin, with a significant percentage of those considering themselves refugees from Middle East wars. **********With these people in mind, King Hussein told reporters at his news conference on Wednesday that ""I am proud of the reaction of the overwhelming majority of people in the country, their maturity and their trust."" **********The King, who came to power in Jordan at the age of 16 in 1952, a year after his grandfather, King Abdullah, was assassinated in front of his eyes by a Palestinian at Al Aksa mosque in Jerusalem, seems more popular than Mr. Arafat himself among the broad masses of Palestinians. **********""In essence, the Palestinians of Jordan trust the King,"" Abu Musa, a Palestinian from the Bakaa refugee camp, said this week. ""I know we are not getting a good deal. I know that it may be that we are not all going to have the chance to go back to Palestine. But I also know he has done his best and will continue to do so."" Israel Encourages Change **********There are other reasons for this sea change in Arab attitudes, not the least of which is what appears to be a new language emanating from Israeli leaders toward Arabs. **********When a Jordanian reporter asked Mr. Peres at a Wednesday news conference at the Dead Sea whether Israel had ""abandoned its expansionist schemes for a greater Israel in the region,"" Mr. Peres said he and other Israeli leaders did not feel greatness was measured by the acquisition or the retention of territories but by economic, technological and educational advances. The Israeli Foreign Minister added that ""negotiations with Jordan enjoy the support of the whole country."" **********There is also an evident feeling among Arabs that the chaos in which the Arab world finds itself has eliminated any chance of standing up to Israel. **********""The failure of Arab coordination has its roots not only in the negotiations process but also in the absence of broader Arab consensus, the virtual collapse of the Arab League and its institutions and, above all, in the fact that each Arab side perceived a different agenda for the other,"" an editorial said on Thursday in The Jordan Times, an English-language newspaper formerly known for its militancy. **********The editorial's assessment reflected the Palestine Liberation Organization's choice to go it alone last year in secret negotiations with Israel that turned into the peace accord signed at the White House in September. Damascus Is Left Alone **********Taken as a whole, the diplomatic initiatives by the P.L.O. and now Jordan leave Syria isolated and no longer able to prevent others from pursuing their own course with Israel. **********Seeking to soften Syria's position as a so-called confrontation state, Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's top negotiator with Damascus, said progress on the Jordanian-Israeli negotiating track would ""radiate positively"" on the Syrian-Israeli track. **********But a growing number of Arab analysts are asserting that if it does not, such a failure will be Syria's loss. **********Hazem Saghieh, an analyst of Middle East affairs for Al Hayat, a London-based Arab daily, said in an editorial on Wednesday that with the progress of efforts by other Arabs toward normalizing relations with Israel, Syria's ideological commitment against peace is showing signs of ""confusion and exhaustion."" **********""In that sense,"" Mr. Sagieh wrote, ""it is possible for the shouting to continue for a while, but it will remain just that, shouting."""

Reich advocates a dangerous doctrine when he recommends that pension fund managers intervene in the management of the companies in which they invest (""A Moral Workout for Big Money,"" Viewpoints, Sept. 11). If there is one thing that we know from the management research of the last decade, it is that concerns that diversify into unrelated industries do a lot worse than those that focus on core businesses. **********Pension fund managers are very good at managing money. They should stick to that and allow company managers to get on with managing the businesses. If they don't like what is happening, they should vote with their feet and sell the investment. They should not imagine that they have much to offer in terms of managing the range of businesses in which they invest. Too much power for the pension managers will merely return us to the years of the conglomerate. Those corporate dinosaurs that survived are now divesting rapidly to return to their core businesses.

M. Best & Company, an insurance-rating firm. In the case of a rehabilitation, which could last several years, assets that are hard to sell, like real estate or mortgages, could prove to be worth much more than if the company was in liquidation, its assets available for sale immediately, Mr. Upton noted. **********Kevin Ceurvorst, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, said it was not clear if Confederation was insolvent. After efforts by the insurer to arrange a merger or takeover by other insurance companies fell apart last month, he said, ""regulators were invited in"" to avoid an exodus of customers, which could have pushed the company into a cash shortage. **********Customers of Confederation are now barred from withdrawing the cash value of their policies or from taking loans against those policies, but the company is making other payments, including death benefits and annuity distributions. **********If Confederation lacks the funds to pay its customers, and other insurance companies do not come forward to take over its business, consumers could face partial losses on their life insurance and annuity policies. **********Insurance guarantee funds in Canada and individual states are financed by other insurance companies and set limits on the maximum amounts that can be paid on life insurance or an annuity. **********Most of Confederation's business is individual life insurance and individual annuities. Its Georgia subsidiary collected $190 million in premiums last year, of which $140 million was for annuities. **********Growth in the Georgia company's business was particularly rapid in New York, where it collected $41.7 million in annuity premiums. **********While Confederation's financial condition had weakened in recent years, American regulators and analysts said yesterday that the details of the company's current condition were not available. **********According to its financial statements, it lost $29 million last year, and ended the year with $873 million of capital."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/18/business/company-reports-poison-pill-adopted-by-hills-stores.html,Stephanie Strom,1994-08-18,,1137,,The New York Times,Business Day,Statistics,article,'Poison Pill' Adopted by Hills Stores,COMPANY REPORTS; 'Poison Pill' Adopted by Hills Stores," **********Striking back at a large investor who is seeking to oust four of its directors, the Hills Stores Company said yesterday that it had adopted a plan that would limit the ability of any shareholder to acquire more than 15 percent of its stock. **********Hills installed its ""poison pill"" after the Federal regulators granted the investor, Dickstein & Company L.P., an investment firm that owns 12.6 percent of the company's outstanding common stock, permission to buy up to 50 percent of its shares. **********In addition to seeking approval to buy more shares, Dickstein has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to ask other shareholders to support its proposal to replace four Hills directors. The investment firm is seeking to gain control of the board so that it can push through a stock buyback program that would lift the price of Hills shares. Dickstein contends they are undervalued. The S.E.C. is expected to make its decision on the request in two to three weeks. Investors Challenge Each Other **********Not only is the company now taking on some of Wall Street's most aggressive investors, but the investors are also squaring off against each other. The proposal by Dickstein puts it at odds with another big bankruptcy player, Apollo Advisors L.P., the investment firm headed by the former merger chief at Drexel Burnham Lambert, Leon Black. **********Michael S. Gross, an Apollo partner, sits on the Hills board and was instrumental in installing two other Hills directors, Richard D. Loynd and Norman S. Matthews. The board voted unanimously to adopt the poison pill. **********""The plan adopted by the board yesterday has been designed to protect our shareholders from coercive takeover tactics,"" Michael Bozic, president and chief executive of Hills, said in a statement. ""Neither Dickstein nor any other person should be permitted to accumulate shares without paying a control premium."" **********The Hills poison pill is a complex shareholder rights plan, similar to one adopted by Time Warner, that would be activated only if someone acquired more than 15 percent of the stock. The pill, which is extremely complicated, would dilute the value of a holding. **********The company said its plan did not preclude an all-cash offer to buy all of it 9.9 million outstanding shares. **********On Tuesday, Dickstein filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission that outlined a plan to buy back 5.5 million Hills shares at $27 a share using an issue of new senior notes. **********Yesterday, Mark Dickstein, principal of the firm, said it would continue to pursue its shareholder solicitation. ""We are disappointed that the board's initial response to our attempt to enhance shareholder value is to seek to entrench the existing board by prohibiting us or any other shareholder from purchasing more than 15 percent of the company,"" he said. Shareholders Approached **********Some smaller shareholders said yesterday that Dickstein executives had called them offering to explain the firm's intentions and answer any questions. **********Separately, Hills reported solid gains yesterday in sales and earnings for the second quarter, which could add fuel to Dickstein's argument that the shares are undervalued. Operating profits more than doubled, although comparisons are difficult because the company adopted fresh-start accounting when it emerged from bankruptcy last October. **********Investors who specialize in taking stakes in bankrupt and distressed companies see some humorous role reversals in the tussle over Hills. For all Mr. Dickstein's complaints about the company's adoption of a takeover defense, shortly after he became chairman of Carson, Pirie, Scott & Company, he made sure the Midwestern department store company adopted poison pill protection. **********And Apollo Advisors has gained large equity stakes in several companies through bankruptcy reorganization plans. Moreover, Thomas H. Lee, a well-known buyout wizard who has taken large stakes in companies to gain control, is chairman of the Hills board and now is in the role of protector. **********""It's crazy that they would vote for a poison pill,"" said one large Hills shareholder, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""How many companies do they own 30 or 40 percent of?"" For example, according to S.E.C. filings in March, Apollo owned more than 67 percent of Interco, which makes Florsheim and Converse shoes and furniture, and more than 47 percent of the Astrum International Corporation, maker of Samsonite luggage and Culligan water purification systems. Wall Street Interested **********Dickstein's crusade, coupled with the high profiles of many of the large shareholders, has begun to attract the attention of Wall Street, which has ignored Hills until now. Because the company's shares were issued as part of a bankruptcy reorganization, no investment bank earned fees from underwriting a public offering, so no one has an incentive to analyze the company's numbers. **********""At the very least, this is getting more people focused on the stock, which can't hurt,"" said David Tepper, principal in Apaloosa Partners, another large Hills shareholder. Mr. Tepper, like Mr. Dickstein and other investors, contends that the company's shares are undervalued in comparison to the stock of its competitors. **********The increased scrutiny may help raise the company's stock price, but the spotlight may not be all that comfortable. Seeking ammunition for their fight, Dickstein supporters are combing through the company's public filings. **********They have already stumbled across some interesting omissions in its proxy statement. For example, the statement notes that Mr. Loynd, one of the directors Dickstein is seeking to oust, is chairman, president and chief executive of Interco. But the proxy fails to note that Interco was in bankruptcy protection until 1992. S.E.C. regulations require that proxy statements include any director's affiliation with a company that went bankrupt within the last seven years, if that affiliation is deemed ""useful information,"" according to an S.E.C. spokesman. Loss Narrowed in Quarter **********In its second-quarter financial report, Hills said its net loss narrowed to $3.6 million from $4.3 million a year earlier. The per-share loss rose to 36 cents from 25 cents because of a decline in the number of shares. But operating profits rose to $5.5 million from $2.6 million. **********Since comparisons with previous periods are difficult because of changes in the company's accounting, Hills provided figures for its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of cash flow. During the quarter ended July 30, cash flow was $14.2 million, an 8.4 percent increase from a year earlier, when its cash flow was $13.1 million. **********Sales in Hills stores open at least one year, or comparable store sales, climbed 5.5 percent to $374.6 million from $355.1 million in the second quarter of 1993. Analysts regard comparable store sales figures as a better measure of a retailer's performance than total sales because they factor out aberrational sales patterns in new stores."

It would also mean that First Data would assume New Valley's pension liabilities, which could total $400 million, and obligations to union workers. **********New Valley, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since March 1993, expects to submit its pact with First Data, based in Hackensack, N.J., at a previously scheduled court hearing today. **********Should the deal be accepted, New Valley's creditors, who are owed $400 million, would be paid in full and the owners of the company's preferred and common shares would end up with a small, cash-rich and debt-free messaging service that reported revenue of $50 million last year. **********By contrast, the most recent plan suggested to the court by New Valley, based in Paramus, N.J., would have paid creditors, but some stockholders would have been left with worthless securities. Deal Bests Others **********""It's the best deal on the table,"" said James F. Kissane, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., who expects Western Union would add to First Data's earnings next year should the takeover be approved. **********First Data's rejected offer was 19 percent lower than the current bid.  With the sweetened terms and management's backing, ""the probability of this working now is much higher than two weeks ago,"" Mr. Kissane said. **********Even so, the agreement provides fallback positions for both players. Should a higher offer emerge and be accepted by New Valley, First Data will be owed a $25 million breakup fee, said Warren Bechtel, a New Valley spokesman. **********Should the First Data agreement fall apart, New Valley has a backup reorganization plan. **********New Valley would inject $100 million in new equity and $50 million in new debt into a restructured company. The funds would come from the New York money-management firms Cerberus Partners L.P., Gotham Capital III, L.P. and Apollo Advisers L.P., controlled by Leon Black. Mr. Black is a former merger specialist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which underwrote $500 million in high-yield bonds in 1987 that gave Bennett S. LeBow control of Western Union. **********The money-transfer business sought by First Data generated $397 million in revenue last year for Western Union, which has 24,000 domestic and international agents. **********First Data, which was spun off of the American Express Company in 1992, has 17,000 agents."

In turn, the Palestinian police commander said his forces would ""take all necessary measures,"" but did not spell out what they would be. **********There were no signs of a manhunt today and certainly no mass roundups like those that the Israeli Army often resorted to -- usually to no avail -- during its 27-year occupation of the coastal strip. **********Nabil Shaath, chief peace negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the authorities would investigate suspects if Israel provided the names. But Mr. Shaath, who had come from Cairo on a quick visit to bring money to the hard-pressed police, said anything beyond that would stretch the force's capacity too far. **********""We can't just canvass the whole town for perpetrators,"" he said in an interview. ""We don't have the resources for that yet."" **********Israel took matters into its own hands by announcing that Gazans would be barred from using the two main crossing points into Israel for the next nine days, a move intended, the Israelis said, to give Palestinians time to step up security checks. ""They're still in the process of organizing,"" said an army colonel sympathetic to the Palestinians' problems during this shakedown period. **********Apparently, the territorial closing was coordinated with the Palestinians, for blue-uniformed police officers established roadblocks this afternoon for the first time not far from where the soldiers were killed. Officials here said joint patrols with Israeli forces, planned for designated parts of Gaza, may begin on Saturday. **********Although Mr. Shaath insisted that ""in general things are going smoothly,"" these early days have been bumpy in key respects for the exercise in Palestinian self-rule now under way in Gaza and the small town of Jericho, on the West Bank. **********There is still no effective Palestinian government, and while most civil departments are operating with their usual workers, no Palestinian supervisors have been named to replace the departed Israelis. In Gaza, guns are plentiful, and it is not clear how aggressively the new authorities will move to confiscate them. **********And the strip is still awash both with armed militants demanding that all Israelis leave and with Israeli soldiers and settlers who remain as potential targets. It is a delicate situation, resulting from the lack of tidiness in the self-rule arrangements worked out by Israel and the P.L.O. Some Israeli Forces Remain **********Although Israeli forces this week completed their evacuation from Gaza's towns and refugee camps, they stay on at border crossings like the northern Erez checkpoint and in security buffer zones that were created around the 19 Jewish settlements and that encompass more than one-third of the strip's 140 square miles. **********The soldiers killed today, both on reserve duty, were in one of those situations. **********They were guarding a roadblock in an area that continues to be under Israeli control, half a mile south of Erez, when a car reportedly drove by before dawn and opened fire. Responsibility was later taken by two different groups of Muslim militants, Hamas and Islamic Holy War, both strongly opposed to peace talks with Israel. **********For many Israelis -- arguably most -- the test of their deal with the P.L.O. will be in both the desire and the ability of the new Palestinian authorities to stop such attacks, or at least to give chase if assaults occur. **********Even before today, Palestinian readiness to find genuine accommodation with an old enemy was widely suspect in Israel, especially after the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, was heard calling for a Muslim holy war to liberate Jerusalem. 'Spend His Summer Sweating' **********Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, one of the Government's most dovish members, warned that Mr. Arafat's earnestness in carrying out the agreement and reducing violence would determine whether Palestinian self-government is extended throughout the territories. If he is not sincere, Mr. Sarid said, ""then there will be no continuation -- he will spend his summer sweating and end his career as the Mayor of Jericho."" **********Almost by definition, it is a complicated arrangement. **********At the same time that Israeli officials and army commanders say the killings must stop, they openly acknowledge that the very presence of settlers and soldiers in turbulent Gaza means that more deaths are inevitable. As though to underline that point, Islamic Holy War said in a statement today that it would ""attack the enemy in every part of Palestine they are present in, and we will not be fooled by the masked shape of occupation under the guise of self-rule."" 'Don't Help the Satans' **********The new Palestinian police have their own headaches. They have yet to take full control of the territory, and they are already being cautioned by rejectionist groups against acting against militants. ""Don't help the Satans and aggressors in the land,"" said a poster left outside the main Gaza police station. **********Moreover, even assuming their intentions are good, the police face a daunting task, one that also bedeviled the Israelis, who could not stop lethal raids against them when they were in control of Gaza and who routinely failed to find the assailants. **********Under their agreement with the P.L.O., the Israelis now have a right to ""hot pursuit"" of Palestinian killers. But in the incident today, the Israeli army colonel said, the ""conditions of hot pursuit"" were not met, given the speed with which the attackers fled. **********All this was too much timidity for Rafael Eitan, leader of the rightist Tsomet Party and a former army chief of staff. ""Take large forces in there now,"" Mr. Eitan urged, ""and kill all the Hamas personnel and fight them before they massacre children or women."""

How often do women make religious objections when birth control techniques are discussed? **********""Well, I do remember a case last year,"" finally answered Jose Antonio Aviles, a gynecologist who treats about 80 women a week. ""I think she was a Jehovah's Witness."" **********When a major United Nations conference on population policy opens next week in Cairo, Vatican envoys are expected to lobby hard to keep all mention of abortion and artificial birth control out of official documents. Already the Vatican has accused the United States of trying to use the conference to impose contraception and abortion on poor countries and people of religious faith. **********But Brazil, with the world's largest Roman Catholic population, is a living study in the limits to the reach of Rome. In a country where Catholics account for 75 percent of the nation's 154 million people, every relevant statistic shows that most people ignore the Catholic Church's teachings on family planning methods. **********In a survey of 2,076 Brazilian adults in June, 88 percent of respondents said they ""don't follow"" church teachings on birth control and abortion. Among women from 25 to 44, the ""don't follow"" group expanded to 90 percent. **********""My mother went through 13 pregnancies, but only 6 of us survived,"" Edilza Rodrigues said at the Praia do Pinto clinic here as she rocked her newborn son, Gabriel. ""I decide what I want. And for me, two is enough."" **********Played out on a national scale, such attitudes toward birth control have led to one of the most radical reductions in family size recorded in modern history. In the space of one generation, the average number of children born to a Brazilian woman has plummeted, from 5.75 in 1970 to 2.35 today. **********""The Brazilian population is controlling its birth rate a great deal,"" said Simon Schwartzman, president of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, a government agency that released new census data in August. ""And the trend is toward continued reduction."" **********The census found that Brazil's population increasingly lives in urban areas -- 75 percent -- and is increasingly literate, 80 percent. The share of households headed by women increased over the last 25 years from 13 percent to about 22 percent. Today, about 40 percent of adult Brazilian women work outside the home. **********Census data show that the fertility rates are particularly low in Brazil's developed south, where they have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, which is the rate for the United States. In the impoverished northeast, the rate is 4.0, relatively high in Brazil but well below the 5.8. recorded in the region in 1980. **********About two-thirds of married women practice some form of birth control. Of this group, about 43 percent use oral contraceptives and 42 percent have been sterilized though tubal ligations or other methods. The Solution for Many **********""It has gotten into the heads of lots of women that tying their tubes is the solution,"" said Dr. Aviles, the gynecologist. ""Increasingly, it is younger women who want to be sterilized after their second child."" **********Failing to prevent unwanted pregnancies, about 1.4 million Brazilian women undergo abortions every year. That represents about 30 percent of all pregnancies, studies show. **********Nevertheless, abortion is illegal in Brazil except in cases of rape or a threat to the mother's health. Safety therefore depends on the woman's ability to pay, with clandestine abortion clinics ranging from a midwife's shack in a hillside slum to a modern dispensary in a middle-class neighborhood. The police rarely raid the clinics, well-known links in a multimillion-dollar industry. **********Acting with the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops based in Brasilia, the Catholic Church has successfully lobbied to maintain laws against abortion and sterilization and to block legislative efforts to provide free contraceptives through Brazil's national health service. Clinics Privately Maintained **********""On the level of daily life, the influence of the church is very limited,"" said Jacqueline Pitanguy, a sociologist. ""But it really influences Government."" **********Unlike Colombia and Mexico, which have strong Government-led family planning programs, Brazil's Government follows a laissez-faire policy. With the Government on the sidelines, family planning was first pushed by foreign aid organizations in the 1960's. Even today, virtually all clinics that dispense birth control pills and information, like the one where Dr. Aviles works, are maintained by private groups. **********Although opinion polls show that Brazilian women want universal access to modern family planning techniques, they have very little power in Brazil's political establishment. **********No women serve as state governors or Supreme Court justices, and women hold only 4.7 percent of the seats in the 580-member Congress. Though 52 percent of the members of the Brazilian Bar Association are women, it has no women serving as directors. . **********""Women's health pays the price,"" said Mrs. Pitanguy, who will be an observer in the Brazilian Government's delegation to the Cairo conference.  Brazil's Conference Position **********Although roughly the same number of abortions are performed annually in Brazil and in the United States, Brazil records about 400,000 annual hospitalizations for medical complications resulting from abortions. In the United States, about 10,000 women are admitted annually for abortion complications. **********For the population conference in Cairo, the Government has adopted a policy of supporting language in conference documents that would be consonant with Brazilian law, specifically, allowing contraception but permitting abortion only in the case of rape or a threat to the mother's health. **********Advancing the Vatican's argument in preparation for the population conference, Catholic bishops have spoken out in newspaper essays in favor of ""natural methods"" of family planning like rhythm. The bishops argue that affluent nations are seeking to restrict births in the third world to avoid having to share their riches. **********""Instead of social justice, they seek the reduction of those who should equally enjoy these gifts that God created for all of his children,"" Rio's Archbishop, Eugenio Cardinal Sales, wrote in Globo, the city's biggest-selling newspaper. **********In the last year, the Rio Archdiocese has trained 900 people to work as health workers teaching parishioners what the Archbishop called ""natural methods of recognized efficiency."" **********""We will never accept a state interference to force on poor people attitudes that they reject,"" the Archbishop wrote. **********But the church's efforts are expected to make little headway, undermined by a traditional Brazilian irreverence for authority and increasing pressures on a heavily urban population to have small families. Battle Over a Bill **********""Brazil is also part of the modern world,"" said Roberto da Matta, a Brazilian anthropologist. ""Catholicism in Brazil was always based on a dualism. Brazilian Catholics have no problems about going to Mass and then taking the pill."" **********Mrs. Pitanguy, the sociologist, said the fight in Cairo could turn into a replay of recent struggles in Brasilia, where Congress is often attentive to the concerns of the Catholic Church hierarchy. In the latest fight here, the church is pressing senators to reject a bill that would allow Brazil's national health service to provide free contraceptive devices and counseling as well as vasectomies and sterilizations for women. Sponsored by a Workers Party congressman from Sao Paulo, the bill was approved in June by Brazil's Chamber of Deputies. **********""Women have the right to be considered capable of taking responsible decisions,"" Mrs. Pitanguy wrote in Globo. ""No women can be forced to conceive or blocked from conceiving."""

""A framework has not been decided yet,"" she said. **********Earlier, Hans Eichel, premier of the state of Hesse, in which Frankfurt is located, told journalists that Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank, assured him banks would ""complete projects already under way."" In most cases, the projects provide collateral for the banks' loans. **********On Wednesday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked banks to be mindful of their responsibility to the thousands of people who depended on the company, which is one of Germany's biggest private real estate concerns. **********Mr. Schneider and his wife, who disappeared last Thursday, were the only signatory authorities for the company, which is based north of Frankfurt in Königstein. Their disappearance paralyzed the company's finances. **********Regarding the whereabouts of her boss, Mrs. Eick said: ""Dr. Schneider has not contacted us and we do not know where he is."" **********Also Thursday, Frankfurt prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into the allegations by Deutsche Bank that the Schneiders faked rental contracts to secure a construction loan. **********The loan involved 415 million DM toward the construction of a local shopping mall, Les Facettes. **********Though the sum is a tiny fraction of Mr. Schneider's estimated 10 billion DM in outstanding debt, the bank's allegation is the first formal charge against the couple since their mysterious disappearance threw one of the country's biggest real estate groups into confusion. **********The bank's suit charges that Mr. Schneider exaggerated the size and earnings potential of the shopping mall's rental spaces when he applied to receive the last tranche of the loan. Mr. Schneider stated double the amount of space actually available and forecast a level of rental income that was completely unrealistic, the bank said. **********As all across Germany, contractors removed doors, windows, wiring and pipes from unfinished buildings on fears that the Schneiders' company would go bankrupt, Deutsche Bank said it had begun to scrutinize other Schneider projects. **********These include the Hotel Rose in Wiesbaden, near Frankfur. Mr. Kopper reportedly told Mr. Eichel the hotel and other expensive projects across Germany were ""planned in a way that would never turn a profit."" **********Oliver Kuhrt, managing director of the hotel, which is still under renovation, said its concept was solid. ""It mixes residences and hotel rooms, which is getting more and more common internationally,"" he said. **********The planned five-star hotel would have been an attractive retreat for traveling executives, said Mr. Kuhrt, who until five months ago was manager of one of Germany's finest hotels, the Hotel Rafael in Munich. **********Regulatory officials, meanwhile, questioned why banks kept giving Mr. Schneider new loans when his mounting debt should have been obvious and rumors of impropriety were rampant. **********By law, banks are required to inform the Bundesbank about all loans greater than 3 million DM by the name of the recipient. The Bundesbank then automatically tells each bank the total value of loans that borrower has received **********The Taunus Sparkasse, a savings and loan bank with operations in and around Frankfurt, recently turned down ""a large loan"" request by a middleman working for Mr. Schneider after looking at his record."

A. (Tex) Moncrief Jr. and his four sons won an agreement from prosecutors to copy and return those documents in 30 days. But a Federal judge refused his lawyers' request to unseal the affidavit an I.R.S. agent filed earlier to get a search warrant. **********The Government has argued in court documents that unsealing the affidavit would compromise the grand jury's work and the identity of Government informants. **********The Moncriefs' lawyers said in a court filing that the I.R.S. was probably relying on a ""revenge-seeking ex-employee."" Two people familiar with the Moncriefs' business affairs said that a former employee in their company's accounting operations, who left after disagreements, might be cooperating with prosecutors. I.R.S. agents appeared to be familiar with the office layouts and locations of files, one of these people said. The other raised the possibility that the informant could share in any I.R.S. proceeds. **********The Moncriefs have been charged with no crimes. ""They are not drug dealers, and they do not conduct a Mafia operation,' said Dee J. Kelly, their lawyer, in a court document. ""The family has been engaged in the oil and gas business for over 65 years without a whisper of wrongdoing of any kind."" **********The Moncriefs do not know the accusations against them, Mr. Kelly said. ""They assume them to be serious based upon the Branch Davidian type of attack on their building,"" he added. **********Paul E. Coggins, United States Attorney for the region that includes Dallas and Fort Worth, said the search was done quickly and professionally, by agents who were routinely armed but did not draw their weapons. ""We certainly don't want to close down any companies,' he said, adding, ""We sought no publicity."" **********The inventory of seized records ran to 88 pages, including computer hardware and disks, family ranch records, and documents concerning airplanes and homes. **********Mr. Moncrief, 74, has a fortune estimated at $300 million to $400 million. He learned the oil trade from his father, W. A. (Monty) Moncrief Sr., a legendary wildcatter who let Bob Hope and Bing Crosby invest with him in developing an oilfield in Scurry County, Tex. The older Mr. Moncrief, who died in 1986, did so well for them that other Hollywood celebrities also invested in oil drilling, with far less luck. **********His son has remained a domestic producer and explorer with operations in Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana, including extensive production of natural gas. Under the Moncrief Oil Company banner, his sons often pursue their own ventures, with one of them, Richard Moncrief, active abroad. **********Tex Moncrief faces a suit by a nephew, State Senator Mike Moncrief, over Wyoming natural gas contracts. Senator Moncrief did not return a message left at his office."

The price was considered so excessive that investors bought just 59 percent of the 666,666 shares offered by the Government at auction prior to today's trading. **********As a result, the market was deluged with so many sell orders at the opening today that Japan Tobacco could not trade until the afternoon. In the morning there were 65,000 shares offered for sale and bids for 90. **********The first trade took place at 1:05 P.M., at a price of $12,143. By the close of the issue's first day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japan Tobacco shares traded at $11,224.50, down nearly 24 percent from the offering price. **********This marked the second time in a year that the Finance Ministry, which is eager to sell off state-controlled industries, had unsettled the market with its listing methods. Last October the entire market was swamped by the selloff when East Japan Railway was listed on the Tokyo exchange. **********This time, the market was expecting the worst, and investors kept calm. With corporate profits expected to rise as the economy recovers from a recession, the Nikkei index rose 50.01 points today to 19,796.36. **********""It was not as dramatic today as it might have been, but I think that's because there was a lot of effort to make sure it wasn't dramatic,"" said Patricia Horvath, an analyst here with UBS Securities. ""It could take a couple of weeks to settle down, and I think the only direction it could take until then is south."" **********She added that much of the buying in Japan Tobacco, such as it was, came from domestic brokerage houses. Foreign firms and foreign investors, analysts said, were conspicuously absent. Ms. Horvath said that most institutional buyers she spoke to would be uninterested in Japan Tobacco until it broke below the $10,000-a-share level. **********Despite the string of problems the Finance Ministry has caused with its eagerness to take top dollar for its shares, the Government remains committed to selling more holdings."

He said four comrades had been killed by Croats in a massacre. ""I don't trust them. With normal people, we could live. But not with war criminals."" **********Visoko is big enough to include Catholic and Orthodox churches, and they are intact, unlike mosques in towns held by Serbian and Croatian nationalists, where mosques have been razed. But the population is mostly Muslim, and women commonly wear scarves wrapped closely about their heads, a fashion that is rare in the cities. Pleas for Tolerance **********A few miles back down the road, past a pair of checkpoints that also seemed identical except for their flags, is Kiseljak, where the young men in military garb strolling the streets are members of the Croatian Defense Force, a nationalist militia that has been fighting the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government for nearly a year. **********At St. Elias, an imposing, not quite finished modern church dominating a steep hill overlooking Kiseljak, a Franciscan priest, the Rev. Ivan Pervan, said his order, which survived not only the Ottomans but also the Communists, knows well the brutal history of the region and the difficulty of having its people live together. **********""We want peace,"" he said. ""We have some wounds; the Muslims have the same. We know what is history. We like to be realists. There is only one reality -- to be here, to live with the Muslims like a home."" **********This thought was echoed by Rasima Papovic, a young woman in Visoko who was clutching her baby with one hand and a brown envelope of military rations in the other. ""Why can't we live together, just to have peace?"" she asked. ""I don't want my child killed.""  Fears of Intolerance **********But the hatreds of the past months and years leave doubts. **********""Knowing the Croats, knowing how my neighbors behaved toward me, I doubt this federation plan is going to happen,"" said Dzana Jahc, who was chased from her home in Kiseljak 11 months ago and now works as a waitress in Sarajevo. ""I think the whole peace process is going too fast. There's a lot being camouflaged. I know what Croats are like in places like Kiseljak, how indoctrinated and extreme they are."" **********The main ethnic rivalry in the region has always been between Serbs and Croats, with Muslims caught in the middle, resented by both as the residue of the hated Ottoman Empire. The rivalries grew particularly bloody during World War II in fighting between the Ustashe Nazi puppet government in Croatia, the Serbian nationalist Chetniks and the ethnically mixed Communist partisans led by Tito, who emerged triumphant. **********As post-Tito Yugoslavia broke apart in 1991, the Serb-dominated national army helped its ethnic kin seize large swaths of Croatia where Serbs lived, then did the same in Bosnia. Croats at first fought for the Bosnian Government, then turned against it last spring. **********The Croatian secessionists have been supported by the Croatian Government and remain influential with the President, Franjo Tudjman.  A Croat Turns **********Mr. Tudjman's turnabout in signing the federation agreement with the Bosnians -- he had only recently sought a rapprochement with Serbia -- has been widely attributed to his fear of the kind of crippling sanctions that were imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. **********Parallel to the agreement in Washington, United Nations forces here have negotiated a cease-fire and are moving toward a turnover of heavy weapons and the positioning of peacekeepers between the opposing lines. This tactic is similar to the tentative cease-fire established last month with the Serbs besieging Sarajevo."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/24/business/credit-markets-prices-of-bonds-tumble-amid-investor-concerns.html,Robert Hurtado,1994-03-24,,925,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Prices of Bonds Tumble Amid Investor Concerns,CREDIT MARKETS; Prices of Bonds Tumble Amid Investor Concerns," **********The Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed bond market expectations and officially moved its new short-term interest rate target up a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.50 percent. **********The Fed announced its intention to raise its target for Federal funds, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, on Tuesday after the meeting of its policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. **********But after early gains when the Fed formally confirmed the increase in its target, bond prices slid in the afternoon amid investor uncertainty about the economy and the timing of the next interest rate rise by the Fed. **********The market fell under further pressure near its close when several banks, led by Chemical and Chase raised their prime lending rates a quarter of a percentage point, to 6 1/4 percent. By the close of the New York cash market the long bond had given up nearly half of the gains achieved the previous day. **********The price of the 30-year bond fell 20/32 , to 9130/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.89 percent, up from 6.84 percent Tuesday. Short-Term Securities Rates **********But the rates on short-term securities continued to fall, indicating that the recent selloff may have gone a lot further than it had to. In addition, some investors appeared to be moving out of longer-term securities, whose prices are much more volatile, to the relative calm of shorter-term investments. **********The rate for a three-month bill fell 5 basis points, to 3.45 percent, while the six-month rate fell 2 basis points, to 3.77 percent. **********Traders said now that the Fed had fulfilled market expectations and raised interest rates again, investors were more apt to buy securities and Treasuries would probably stabilize. The Fed raised its interest rates target for the first time in five years on Feb. 4 but a selloff in the bond market followed, in part because traders were worried that the Fed had not raised short-term interest rates enough. **********Fed watchers at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company said there was no doubt that the central bank confirmed the rate increase when it did not add reserves to the banking system. That the Fed has actually announced its intentions in February and again yesterday has set new precedents and also left the market with no uncertainties to fuel speculation. **********William Shea, senior vice president at Nikko Securities International Inc.,said, ""The market is likely to remain tentative until we reach 4 percent on the Federal funds, which the market believes is what the Fed needs in order to achieve a real level of interest rates."" **********Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading specialist for Chase Securities, thinks that after rallying the day before, investors have begun to wonder how much higher can prices go from these levels. ""Have the fundamentals in the market changed?"" he asked. ""Has anything changed about the economy?"" **********""Much of the buying after the Fed made its announcement on Tuesday was not a reaction to the Fed tightening as it was to investors covering short positions,"" Mr. Alexy said.  ""Many investors are still uncertain about the Fed's next move."" **********The rise in the prime lending rate will add to the concerns of investors, giving them little reason to buy and limiting the market's upside potential, traders said. **********Treasury prices got support early in the day from the report on United States durable goods orders for February, which fell 2.5 percent, or 1 percent excluding the military market. The drop was much larger than the consensus forecast of a dip of six-tenths of 1 percent. **********According to economists, there was little in the report that would cause the market to change its view about what the Fed is thinking. **********With the last interest rate rise now a day old, traders suspect what the market now needs to know is whether the economy is stronger or weaker than the Fed is betting on. Municipal Bond Market **********In the municipal bond market, analysts said the City of New York saved $90 million when it sold bonds this week. Underwriters repriced part of the city's $1.06 billion general obligation bond issue late Tuesday after the Fed raised interest rates and the market rallied, cutting yields on the issue by as much as five basis points, to 6.30 percent for a bond due in 2023. **********The bond offering was the first under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and comes at a time when the city is grappling with a fiscal year 1995 budget deficit of $2.3 billion. **********Underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities priced the bonds to yield from 4.45 percent in 1996 to 6.30 percent in 2023. **********At yesterday's Treasury auction of $11 billion in five-year notes, the high yield was 5.91 percent, up from 5.61 percent at the Feb. 24 auction and the highest since 6.03 percent on Dec. 23, 1992. **********Following are the results of the five-year-note auction yesterday: (000 omitted in dollar figures) High Yield . . . 5.91%  Low Yield . . . 5.76%  Median Yield . . . 5.88%  Accepted at low price . . . 62%  Total applied for . . . $28,137,703  Accepted . . . $11,003,233  Noncompetitive . . . $671,000  Interest set at . . . 5 7/8%  The five-year notes mature on March 31, 1999."

Don't Hand the Young the Health Bill . . ."," **********'YOUR angriest people will be the young,"" warned Mandy Grunwald, a White House political consultant, when President Clinton's health reforms were unveiled to Congressional staff members last autumn. ""They're going to have to pay for this plan."" **********The prediction stems from a devastating feature of the Clinton plan and most competing proposals. Labeled ""community rating,"" the approach will not only pick the pockets of today's young Americans, but plunder the youth of the next century, too. **********Community rating, a euphemistic marketing term, means that all adults under retirement age in a geographic area -- whether one region or the whole country -- will pay the same health insurance premium. Under the Clinton proposal, for example, every insured American would pay an annual premium of about $2,100. **********On the surface, community rating is appealing; its single premium, applied to all, seems simple and fair. And its ostensible purpose seems noble: to prevent the sick from being penalized with high premiums for their illnesses. **********But community rating overlooks one vital point: the average 55-year-old consumes $2,345 in health care a year and the average 25-year-old consumes $560 -- a fourfold difference. Under a single-premium system, this disparity creates a huge -- and continuing -- intergenerational transfer from the young to the middle-aged. According to the American Enterprise Institute, the Clinton plan means a $30 billion subsidy each year from Americans under 35 to those between ages 55 and 64. **********And age is not the only issue. Since younger people generally earn less than their elders, under community rating the less well-off will be subsidizing the more affluent. **********Society does not always use a subsidy approach. People under age 25 pay significantly more for auto insurance than their parents because the young have more accidents. Using this standard, the middle-aged should continue to pay higher health premiums because they get sick more. What society deems correct for cars, though, it seems to forget when it comes to health reform. **********But society simply cannot have it both ways, with the young subsidizing the middle-aged when the latter have higher costs, yet being forced to foot their own bills in many other circumstances. **********Moreover, community rating does not work. When undertaken in New York last year, 30-year-old males watched their premiums skyrocket 170 percent, while men aged 60 enjoyed a 45 percent cut. Premiums for 30-year-old women rose 82 percent, but 60-year-old women paid 25 percent less. **********Did community rating, by radically changing the premium structure in this way, help more New Yorkers afford insurance? No. More than 12.4 percent of individual policy holders -- mostly the young -- dropped their insurance in the program's first nine months. One large insurer, Mutual of Omaha, lost 43 percent of its New York customers while its policyholders' average age rose 3.5 years. **********Now, imagine these effects on a national scale. Millions of young people would forgo the costly coverage, dropping out of the system and thereby hiking premiums for those who remain -- including the middle-aged. And young people who stayed insured would see their take-home wages trimmed and their living standards markedly decline. **********Beginning in 1998, Americans born in the 1960's and 1970's will comprise the nation's largest voting bloc. By then, if Congress adopts generationally unjust health care measures, young voters will be well aware of the ravaging effects of community rating on their pocketbooks. And Mandy Grunwald will be right. The young will be angry."

His family in Roanoke, Va., provided Mr. Nash with protection, privacy and refuge when he wanted it. More extraordinary was the devotion of his wife, Alicia, who, despite the break-up of the marriage, permitted Mr. Nash to live in her house in Princeton, N.J., while she supported their son and her ex-husband with some financial help from family, friends and colleagues. **********But the most crucial factor that made Mr. Nash's survival and recovery possible was the place where he spent most of those 20 years. Mr. Nash had done his graduate work at Princeton University, and he and his wife returned to the Princeton community early in his illness. There, Mr. Nash was was revered by young graduate students because of the seminal work he had done and was not overlooked by his former colleagues who repeatedly offered him research work even though he was usually unable to accept their help. Mr. Nash was given unlimited access to libraries and computers and was invited to seminars when old friends turned up on campus. **********It is impossible to overestimate the beneficial effect of the respectful and emotionally supportive atmosphere of the Princeton community on Mr. Nash's self-esteem, or the destructive effect that being discounted, disregarded and rendered all-but-invisible has on the morale of most similarly afflicted persons. **********We do not, as yet, know what makes some patients have a remission of their disease while others do not. There is one thing, though, that the story of Mr. Nash tells us: the support of family, friends and others can help patients preserve their sense of self, faith in people and hope for the future, while waiting for their remission to happen.

The Israeli agreement on self-rule with the Palestine Liberation Organization allows troops to remain at the borders and in buffer zones around the 19 Jewish settlements in Gaza -- areas that combined make up more than one-third of the coastal strip. Long Era Ends **********But for the first time since Israel took control after its victory in the 1967 Middle East war, most of the 800,000 people in Gaza's high-strung cities and hard-bitten camps are free of Israeli soldiers in their daily lives. **********The end to the 27-year occupation ""corrects a tremendous mistake,"" Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said. And the commander of the new Palestinian forces, Maj. Gen. Nasser Yousef, asserted that while Gaza was not yet fully free of the Israelis, ""It is on the way to liberation."" **********""When the Israelis acknowledged that this land belonged to the Palestinian people, it meant they know their presence on this land is illegal,"" General Yousef said at a news conference. He spoke from the steps of an army post newly evacuated by Israel, a swagger stick in his right hand and surrounded by other officers who had fought the Israelis as soldiers and now form the nucleus of what is to be a 9,000-strong police force. **********""This is a transitional period,"" the general said. ""But finally they will leave -- settlers and forces."" A Piecemeal Withdrawal **********Anticipating the imminent end to its occupation, Israel began moving equipment out of Gaza many weeks ago. Last week, it started withdrawing soldiers in piecemeal fashion, abandoning one or two outposts at a time and always at night to avoid rocks and bullets as much as possible. **********For the most part, the bit-at-a-time transfer of authority went smoothly, with the Israelis pulling out of bases and Palestinian forces moving in within minutes by prior arrangement. **********But on the final night, stretching into early today, hundreds of Gazan youths gathered at the few remaining army outposts to make clear that the last Israelis in Gaza city would be leaving on the run, not in a dignified march. These children of the intifada, as their anti-Israel uprising is called in Arabic, did what they have done every day for years. **********They pelted the soldiers with stones. Volleys of Tear Gas **********And the Israelis responded in equally familiar fashion, with volleys of tear gas that sent acrid fumes drifting across the city one more time. **********Well before daybreak, it was over. **********The soldiers were gone, and Palestinians celebrated with cheers, hugs, tears and automatic rifle fire -- long bursts into the air by freshly arrived police officers and by armed young men who form militias that the new authorities must rein in now. So many bullets were fired that one P.L.O. commander said his forces had exhausted most of the ammunition that they brought with them from Egypt and Jordan. **********By late morning, jubilation had subsided, and Gazans were left to wrestle with the pivotal question in the self-government experiment that they have undertaken: can they make it work? It is a question that is different for Gaza and for Jericho because, even though they have the same nationalist yearnings, they are light years apart in temperament and problems. **********Gaza is the key to success or failure, Palestinians and Israelis agree, and security will be a central issue. One test will be what happens to the roughly 5,000 Jewish settlers who stay behind. Start of Joint Patrols **********On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian forces are scheduled to begin joint patrols on several main roads, including those connecting settlements to Israel. The difficulty of their task was underlined today when Palestinian gunmen ambushed and wounded an Israeli who was driving to the Netzarim settlement, a small enclave just south of Gaza city that is isolated from the major bloc of Jewish communities on the Mediterranean coast. **********It was not immediately clear if the victim was riding along a road that is to be jointly patrolled. But whatever the situation, Israeli army commanders caution that they expect more attacks like the one today and another in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron on Tuesday that killed two settlers. **********Another challenge for the new Palestinian authorities will be to control a flood of automatic weapons that raise fears that, if things go badly, the strip could stumble into the chaos that tore apart Lebanon in the 1970's and 1980's. **********Under the Israeli-P.L.O. agreement, only the police are supposed to be armed. But in a response to a question today, General Yousef said his police would ""register weapons and know the owners."" He said nothing about confiscating weapons. Relations With Hamas **********As for the militant Islamic group Hamas, a rival with the P.L.O. for power and a firm opponent of peace talks with Israel, the general said he has met its officials and foresees ""no problems"" with them or with their armed wing that is responsible for many lethal attacks on Israelis. **********""Hamas is a part of our nation,"" he said. ""They are brothers."" **********Security aside, the Palestinians must show that they are capable of daily governance and are as committed to building a democracy in their hoped-for state as their leadership asserts. **********They do not start from scratch. About 7,000 Gazans who had worked under the departed Israeli military administration are still in their jobs, from teachers to health-care workers. But it is too early to tell how things will go. A cadre of new managers for these employees has yet to be installed. And until the P.L.O. appoints a 24-member council that is supposed to oversee the self-rule, Gaza and Jericho in effect have no government. **********On the question of democracy, much may hinge on the performance of the police. **********About 3,000 P.L.O. fighters-turned-officers have arrived in the last week from Arab states, General Yousef said, and their relations with local Palestinians has generally been relaxed. But they have been joined by machine-gun-carrying men in plainclothes, who form a security detail and who some Gazans fear may be the vanguard of a secret police unit. Remainder of West Bank **********With their deal complete for Gaza and Jericho, Israel and the P.L.O. are supposed to move on to negotiate self-rule arrangements for the rest of the West Bank. Even before troop withdrawals are discussed -- a matter that is far more complex across the West Bank than in Gaza or relatively isolated Jericho -- Israel wants to arrange for an early transfer of responsibilities in basic fields like health, education and taxation. **********How fast they will proceed is a question, though. Some Israeli officials say they are in no rush, preferring first to see what happens in Gaza and Jericho. **********In addition, some have graver doubts than ever about the reliability of Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, as a negotiating partner. **********Mr. Arafat caused an uproar when the Israeli radio on Tuesday played a tape of a speech that he had made last week at a mosque in South Africa. Speaking in English, he told worshipers that ""the jihad will continue"" and that ""you have to come and to fight a jihad to liberate Jerusalem."" **********The Arabic word ""jihad"" is commonly translated as ""holy war.""

The agency said the attack was one of the worst it has suffered since United States marines began arriving 13 months ago to protect relief workers fighting Somalia's famine. Two weeks earlier, a World Food Program worker from England was kidnapped by gunmen in Mogadishu and held for three days. **********The relief agency suspended its operation in Belet Uen on Thursday and evacuated its one non-Somali employee. **********Another relief agency, Save the Children, evacuated its two international workers after a crowd of Somalis gathered outside its warehouse on Wednesday and tried to persuade its security guards to help them loot it. **********Although the crowd dispersed after the guards refused, Save the Children radioed nearby Italian troops of the United Nations peacekeeping force to seek help, said the program's manager, Richard Burge. **********""But they categorically refused to offer army support to expatriate or Somali personnel working in humanitarian operations,"" Mr. Burge said in an interview today in Mogadishu. **********He also said that when his agency complained to the United Nations military command in the capital and it told the Italians to radio his staff in Belet Uen, they ignored the order. **********But United Nations officials said today that their soldiers had never ignored a request for help from relief workers under attack. **********United Nations officials and the Italian military denied today that Save the Children had asked their help, but they said so few soldiers remain in Belet Uen that it might be difficult for them to protect relief agencies that are attacked. **********""The U.N. troops are responsible to provide protection for relief agencies, but they don't have the same amount of men as they used to have before all the withdrawals began,"" said Maj. Chris Budge, a United Nations spokesman. **********Only 150 Italian soldiers remain in Belet Uen as Italy withdraws its troops from Somalia. Their primary responsibility is to guard the 1,300 German soldiers who were sent there to transport material and who are allowed to fire their weapons only in self-defense. **********Clan elders reportedly have gone to the area to investigate reports that the looting involved gunmen allied with the city's new governor. **********Attacks on relief agencies appear to be increasing as troops from the United States and many other countries withdraw and militias once again vie for power. **********World Food Program officials were not available in Mogadishu to discuss who may have planned the attack on their warehouse. But Mr. Burge said, ""There is no doubt that the local governor's men or associates were involved in the looting."" **********If true, that could be a blow to the program helping clan elders appoint district and regional councils that could eventually select a transitional government in Somalia. The program has fallen behind schedule, and some political factions and militias have rejected the new local governments."

A senior United Nations official suggested that a further NATO air strike, this time against a Bosnian Serb target rather than a Croatian Serb one, was likely on Wednesday. **********""Something is being prepared and I wouldn't go anywhere tomorrow morning,"" he said. **********Croatian officials said the Atlantic alliance had asked today for renewed permission to fly into Croatian airspace and Croatia had agreed to the request. **********Michael Williams, a spokesman for the top United Nations official here, Yasushi Akashi, denied reports that Mr. Akashi had turned down a NATO request for an air strike today. **********""NATO will take the lead on this, because the violation of the no-fly zone and the direct attack on its planes are direct challenges to the alliance,"" he said. ""Our concurrence is not in question."" **********With the situation around Bihac, a Muslim area in northwestern Bosnia, increasingly critical, Defense Secretary William Perry warned today that further air attacks by the Serbs in Bosnia would be met by a more decisive NATO raid. **********Under the shaky and often paralyzing system in force in Bosnia, both United Nations and NATO commanders must agree on any military action. **********""If they go in tomorrow or the next day with another bombing attack, then we'll go back and blow up their airplanes,"" Mr. Perry said. At the request of the United Nations, the NATO bombing of Udbina airfield 22 miles southwest of Bihac hit runways but avoided aircraft. **********Two people were killed in the NATO raid and were four injured, all of them military personnel manning antiaircraft artillery and missile systems at Udbina, Mr. Williams said today. NATO showed videotapes of United States Air Force F-15's using 10 laser-guided bombs on targets including a surface-to-air missile at the air base. **********The Bosnian Serb offensive on Bihac, supported by rebel Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia and some renegade Muslim forces, came in response to an abrupt advance last month by the Muslim-led Bosnian Army to the east of Bihac. More than 10,000 Serbian civilians lost their homes to the V Corps of the Bosnian Army, and fled west and south into Serbian-held parts of Croatia. **********The overwhelming Serbian response against an isolated pocket of Muslims in northwestern Bosnia has again confronted the United Nations and NATO with the difficulties of peacekeeping in the midst of a fully fledged war. **********In effect, the Muslim-led Government forces have sought and received international help even though they initiated the most recent fighting around Bihac, a town declared a ""safe area"" by the United Nations, which means the allies are obliged to protect it. **********Fierce fighting flared today on the outskirts of this safe area, comprising Bihac and its immediate surroundings, but Mr. Williams said there were no reports that Bihac town had been a target. **********The Serbs overran several villages, including Gata Ilidza, northwest of Bihac, where the helicopter gunship was used, United Nations officials said. To the south of Bihac, they appeared to have taken Zavalje. At least 8,000 Muslim refugees of a total population of 180,000 people in the Bihac pocket have fled the Serbian advance, the officials said. **********United Nations military officials reported the heaviest fighting around Velika Kladusa in the north of the Bihac pocket. They said Bosnian Government forces still held the town and the road out to the south, but were under intense pressure from forces including Muslims from Velika Kladusa fighting in units commanded by Croatian Serbs. **********Until last summer, when it was overrun by the V Corps, Velika Kladusa was held by Muslims opposed to the Bosnian Government of Alija Izetbegovic and loyal to a businessman named Fikret Adbic. **********They have since regrouped in the adjacent Serbian-held parts of Croatia, and have been armed and led by the rebel Croatian Serbs in the current offensive. **********Indeed, the attack on Bihac has clearly been fully coordinated between Croatian and Bosnian Serbs. On a recent visit to Knin, the capital of the Krajina region, Croatian Serb officers could be seen calling Banja Luka in Bosnian Serb territory to receive their instructions. Only through a coordinated campaign has Bihac been entirely surrounded and the Bosnian Army attacked on several fronts at once. **********It was unclear whether the tanks being used today belonged to the Croatian or the Bosnian Serbs, United Nations officials said. The tanks approached from the south and southwest. To the east, Bosnian Serbs advanced further onto the Grabez plateau overlooking Bihac. **********Serbs have held close to one-third of Croatia, known as the Krajina region, since a tenuous cease-fire ended the 1991 Croatian war. They fought to resist being part of an independent Croatia when it seceded from Yugoslavia. The areas under their control have been so-called United Nations protected areas since the Croatian war ended. **********Criticizing the NATO strike as inadequate because it did not hit Serbian aircraft or tanks, the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said it was ""absurd"" that Serbian weapons and soldiers from these United Nations protected areas in Croatia should continue to be allowed to attack one of Bosnia's six United Nations safe areas. **********He did not address the question of whether using a safe area like Bihac to start an offensive, as the Bosnian Army did last month, was acceptable. **********President Izetbegovic wrote to Mr. Akashi today calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Bihac area. ""We are supporting your initiative for an immediate cease-fire in the Bihac region,"" the President wrote. ""I ask you to take urgent steps in that direction."" **********There was no suggestion, however,that the Bosnian or Croatian Serbs would accept Mr. Akashi's cease-fire proposal, which was contained in a statement issued on Monday. The Serbs say they feel their action is a justified response to the Bosnian attack on them. **********The commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, Gen. Ratko Mladic, warned that he could no longer guarantee the safety of United Nations personnel on Bosnian territory. **********There were no significant reprisals by the Serbs against United Nations personnel reported today. **********The plight of the United Nations soldiers within the Bihac pocket, made up of a Bangladeshi battalion of 1,250 newly arrived troops, has become acute. They have only about 300 automatic rifles among them, and are suffering severe shortages of food because no United Nations convoys have been allowed into the pocket for more than a month. **********""The situation of the Bangladeshi battalion is increasingly intolerable,"" Mr. Williams said, suggesting that a supply route would have to be opened by force if the situation did not change soon. **********Mr. Akashi is due to meet with the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, and the leader of the Croatian Serbs, Milan Martic, in Belgrade on Wednesday for talks about the Serbian noose tightening around Bihac."

""It will be years before this land can recover and be used again."" **********Across the vast arid plains of Patagonia in southern Argentina, a rugged outback of legends and romance once populated by gauchos, visited by Charles Darwin and roamed by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the land and the livelihoods of its people are dying out. **********To many in the country's big northern cities, Patagonia is a distant land they do not know. But it has caught the imagination of scientists and writers from around the world, not only for its stark pristine expanses, but also for the remarkable preservation of immigrant cultures not found elsewhere in Latin America. **********Patagonia was settled in the 19th century by people from Wales, Scotland and South Africa who prospered from sheep farming and maintained tightly knit ethnic groups. But now they see their heritage and customs disappearing. Afrikaans and old Welsh, for example, once dominant languages in large sections of Patagonia, are seldom spoken today. **********The region, roughly the size of Texas with one-tenth the population, seems to be reverting back to what Darwin first saw as ""wretched gravel plains."" Years of depressed wool prices and the centralization of Argentina's economy around Buenos Aires, the capital, have driven thousands of ranchers from their lands and forced the next generation to abandon its roots and look for jobs elsewhere. Decades of Overgrazing **********Among the failing enterprises here are sprawling sheep ranches established in the 19th century that helped make Argentina one of the world's wealthiest countries. But decades of overgrazing has turned a fragile ecosystem of shrubs and grasslands into a barren plateau reminiscent of the Badlands of South Dakota. **********But it is not just sheep regions that are suffering. In Puerto Madryn, in the province of Chubut, the Government-run aluminum smelter is cutting back production and seeking to lay off workers. In 1991, the Government shut down a major steel company in the Rio Negro city of Sierra Grande, leaving an entire city that grew up around the factory almost jobless. And in Comodoro Rivadavia, long prosperous from its oil industry, unemployment has soared as the newly privatized oil concern, Y.P.F., has laid off tens of thousands of workers over the last three years. **********""All Patagonia is suffering,"" said James Gough, a sheep farmer in Esquel. ""The only hope we have is to do a little tourism."" A Drought and a Volcano **********During the first half of this century, the wool produced in Patagonia was one of the exports that, along with beef from cattle raised in the Pampas to the north, made Argentina's per capita income the seventh-highest in the world. But eight years of depression in the sheep-farming sector has crippled the region. The world price for Patagonia wool has fallen from $1 a pound to under 30 cents, and such prices are expected for at least three more years. **********The region has had three successive years of drought, with the San Julian area getting half its normal rainfall. **********And in August 1991, the Hudson Volcano in the Chilean Andes some 300 miles to the northwest erupted, spewing vast amounts of volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Winds blew the ash over a triangular area in the Santa Cruz province of Patagonia, covering 25 million acres with fine gray dust and smothering vital pastures. More than one million sheep died over the next two weeks. **********Now, almost three years later, much of the ash remains. Mr. MacLean has drifts on his farm up to a foot deep and he still discovers the carcasses of sheep buried beneath it. **********""The ash gets into vegetation the sheep eat, and that grinds their teeth down,"" he said. ""So after four years you have sheep with no teeth who cannot survive."" 'Sheep Farming Was Done For' **********Mr. MacLean lost 2,600 animals, including 2,000 pregnant ewes, worth more than $100,000. After the Hudson Volcano, he locked the door to his farm house and left. **********""The volcano only made us face the fact that sheep farming was done for,"" said Jorge Knoop, who lives in Comandante Luis Piedrabuena, 75 miles southwest of here. ""It was a coup de grace for the Patagonian sheep farmer."" **********In his region, Mr. Knoop says 80 percent of the farms are not operating or have only a minimal number of sheep, and that 400 farms have been shut. **********Enrique Ducca, president of the San Julian Rural Association, says the cost of raising sheep is now four times the price they get on the market. He calculates that almost half the land in Santa Cruz is without sheep or with fewer than 1,000 animals. **********The troubles are also bringing social changes. Farmers have relatively few other skills, and their children are leaving to look for work in the major cities like Buenos Aires. **********""There was no hope for my daughters here so I encouraged them to leave,"" said Juan Douglas Scott. Selling Off Family Land **********Mr. Scott typifies the social change as well as the loss of large fortunes for those who once were considered among the elite of the country. His Scottish grandparents came to Patagonia from the British Falkland Islands in 1877 and began sheep farming. They became so prosperous that his mother and five aunts were sent to boarding school in Scotland. Mr. Scott attended St. George's, the most prestigious boarding school in Buenos Aires. **********Hard times have forced him to sell most of the family's land. **********Disaster relief from the central Government after the volcano has been paltry, a maximum of $12,000 per farmer. ""What is so unfair is that sheep farmers for decades subsidized Argentina, paying more then 50 percent in taxes,"" said Mr. Scott. ""What they are giving us is an insult."" **********San Julian, with its ornate banks and warehouses, now mostly shut, has all the markings of a once-flourishing town hit by hard times. Residents say life is boring. Cable television is the main source of entertainment. **********Some assert that the natural disaster and the depressed wool industry may enable the land to regenerate after more than a century of sheep grazing. **********Even so, ecologists say that that will not address the region's other environmental problems. Coastal oil spills have killed thousands of penguins and ponds filled with sludge from offshore drilling attract migrating geese that become covered with oil and die. **********""The trouble is that talk about protecting the environment seems totally secondary,"" said Graham Harris, head of the Fundacion Patagonia Natural. **********For its long-term survival, it seems that much of Patagonia will have to undergo major economic adjustment. But the future Patagonia will most likely be a humble shadow of its former self, with industries such as crate-making and ice production that provincial government officials say can complement the fishing industry. **********""I really threw away a large part of my life,"" said Mr. Scott, who agreed at the urging of his brothers and sister to manage his family's ranch here, instead of pursuing a different career. ""It's time I can't get back and now it's difficult to know what to do."""

Borkowski and his wife were embroiled in what he recalls as the worst fight they ever had. **********The subject was the 21 hundred-dollar bills that Mr. Borkowski, an insurance sales agent, was about to deliver to three union officials who controlled the fate of Mr. Borkowski's insurance business with union members. **********""My wife didn't want me to pay them,"" Mr. Borkowski said. ""But I went ahead because I had already invested a year of time and over $100,000 of my own money"" to establish an insurance agency that would be endorsed by the union. With his family's finances precarious and his wife, Tina, pregnant with their fifth child, ""I could not put my wife and kids through all the upheaval that would have meant,"" he said recently. Access to Phone Numbers **********Two months after the party, the union signed a contract allowing Mr. Borkowski to use the Fraternal Order of Police's star-shaped symbol on his business cards and gave him access to the addresses and phone numbers, listed and unlisted, of the union's 13,000 active and retired officers. **********The Christmas payment and smaller amounts given in September 1991, which Mr. Borkowski calls ""extortion, not bribes,"" are cited in a 26-count indictment announced on Wednesday by the United States Attorney in Philadelphia, charging union officials with various offenses including racketeering and mail fraud. Mr. Borkowski, who told a grand jury about his experiences, was not charged with any wrongdoing and is expected to testify for the Government. **********Many insurance agents have faced Mr. Borkowski's quandary about how to woo a potentially large customer. In a business in which agents are paid by sales commissions, some insurance buyers have sought kickbacks in exchange for their business. Rules Bar Payments **********Regulations issued by state insurance departments explicitly prohibit agents from paying any commission money to customers as a rebate or price reduction. But despite the rules, ""there are quite a lot of examples of payments by agents"" said Ronald R. Parry, a lawyer at Arnzen, Parry & Wentz of Covington, Ky., who has represented many insurance agents. **********In recent years, insurance agents have been accused, though not always convicted, of paying bribes to gain multimillion-dollar accounts with the Chicago Transit Authority; the American Motors Corporation, which is defunct; Illinois state employees, and the National Hockey League Players Association. **********In Mr. Borkowski's case, the hoped-for riches never materialized. In October 1992, after he refused requests for more money, leaders of the police union canceled a contract that was supposedly noncancelable. A few weeks later he was dismissed by Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance of Greensboro, N.C., whose policies he sold to union members. Mr. Borkowski's supervisor at Jefferson-Pilot, who Mr. Borkowski says knew about the requests for payoffs, subsequently took over his union business. **********Richard T. Stange, the associate general counsel at Jefferson-Pilot, declined to comment on why Mr. Borkowski was dismissed or about Mr. Borkowski's contention that Jefferson-Pilot executives knew he was being asked to pay police union officials. **********Mr. Stange said the company was aware of the Federal investigation into the police union's affairs and had offered to cooperate.  That investigation became public knowledge on Wednesday with the announcement of the charges against John J. Shaw, the union president; Anthony M. LaSalle, a former treasurer, and Charles Gabrick, a former financial secretary. **********The Federal case asserts that Mr. Borkowski made payments in September and December of 1991, but was dismissed by the union ""after Borkowski refused to continue paying cash kickbacks and things of value."" Most of the Federal case concerns kickbacks from a lawyer and a printer who did business with the union. **********Mr. Borkowski is finding that it is not easy being a whistle-blower. He has spent the last two years building a new insurance practice selling to small businesses, and has not had enough money to pursue claims against the police union and Jefferson-Pilot. **********""I worked hard for all the union members and got them a disability insurance program that nobody else could match,"" Mr. Borkowski said in an interview in his office in Danielsville, Pa. ""And for all that, I got nothing."" **********Exclusive Endorsement **********Mr. Borkowski's involvement with the union started in 1990 when an acquaintance, Irwin Saft, introduced him to the newly elected officers of Lodge 5 of the Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia. After helping a few union directors to get insurance coverage they lost while on leave from the Police Department, Mr. Borkowski proposed that the union give him the exclusive right to use the its endorsement in selling insurance to its members. The union agreed. **********""At that time, half the police force lacked automobile insurance, so that was the thing they wanted most,"" Mr. Borkowski said. Because his expertise was in life insurance, Mr. Borkowski arranged -- without compensation -- for another insurance broker to handle the auto insurance while he concentrated on other types of coverage. **********""They had a lot of stuff going on, and had clearly been taken advantage of by people coming in and selling policies for cancer or AIDS,"" Mr. Borkowski said. Insurance experts say such specialized policies are rarely a good buy for consumers, who are better off buying broad coverage that protects them against all kinds of unforseeable problems. Plan for Disability Coverage **********The niche where Mr. Borkowski saw the greatest opportunity was disability insurance. The police already had good disability benefits from the city for injuries received on the job. But long-term disability insurance for off-the-job injuries was not widely available because police officers are considered a high-risk group. **********The only disability insurance available to police officers before Mr. Borkowski's arrival was a policy from Benefit Trust Life Insurance, now called Trustmark Insurance, which provided benefits for only a few years after a disabling injury. **********After calling more than 200 insurance companies, Mr. Borkowski found one that was interested in the police business he offered: Jefferson-Pilot. The company agreed to issue disability policies for off-the-job accidents that would pay benefits up to age 65. For the company, the risk was acceptable because the benefits it offered were less than what a disabled police officer would collect from an injury suffered on the job. Thus, a police officer with a disability claim would prefer to file a claim with the city, not with Jefferson-Pilot. **********""I thought we hit a home run,"" Mr. Borkowski said.  With the disability insurance as a sales tool, Mr. Borkowski envisioned selling packages of disability and various kinds of life insurance. With total premiums averaging about $1,300 a year, Mr. Borkowski and his sales agents would earn premiums of about $1.3 million for every 1,000 policies, and Mr. Borkowski would receive about 40 percent, or more than $500,000. **********But in the first year after the union signed a contract with Mr. Borkowski, his business languished. The union president, Mr. Shaw, refused to allow Mr. Borkowski to hire salesmen to solicit and sell to the 13,000 union members. ""Shaw had an image of the union members as a field of cotton and insurance agents as a horde of locusts,"" Mr. Borkowski said. **********In early 1992, Mr. Borkowski sold a 50 percent share of his business for $175,000 to Jonathan Felix, a Philadelphia businessman who administers the police union's dental, optical and prescription fund. **********By March, after Mr. Shaw allowed sales agents to be hired, Mr. Borkowski's business soared. With 14 sales agents each contacting 10 police officers a week, the business grew at a rate that made Mr. Borkowski one of Jefferson-Pilot's top 10 agents for six consecutive months, beginning in April, according to JP Life, a magazine published by the company.  But with that growth, union officials demanded more money, which Mr. Borkowski refused to pay, the Federal complaint against the union leaders said. In October 1992, the union's officials ousted Mr. Borkowski and began to operate his business without him, the complaint said. **********Mr. Borkowski acknowledges that he was not totally unprepared for the union leaders' requests for money, since Mr. Saft, the broker who introduced him to the union officials, had warned that they would want to be paid. A Finder's Fee **********According to a lawsuit filed against the union leaders late last year by Mr. Borkowski, Mr. Saft said ""it would be necessary to entertain, assist and do other things of such a nature as to ingratiate"" Mr. Saft with union leaders. Mr. Saft was to finance this activity with a finder's fee from Mr. Borkowski, the lawsuit said. **********Mr. Saft, who still operates a Philadelphia insurance agency, declined to answer questions about his dealings with Mr. Borkowski and the police union. **********Mr. Borkowski's lawsuit was dismissed in Federal District Court in Philadelphia on procedural grounds, though it may be refiled. **********A few weeks after union officials canceled their agreement with Mr. Borkowski, Jefferson-Pilot followed suit, dismissing him without offering any explanation at the time. **********After Mr. Borkowski's departure and a change in union leadership, Michael Lutz, the current president, said the union no longer had any insurance endorsements. Last October, he said, it asked the successor to Mr. Borkowski's agency to move out of the union's office space. **********""We don't want to be in the insurance business,"" Mr. Lutz said. ""Our business is working for our members on wages, hours and benefits."""

Shares of G.M. fell $1.25 today, to $61.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********David Garrity, an automotive analyst for McDonald & Company Securities in New York, said a prolonged strike could cost G.M. $15 million to $20 million in net income a day if most United States and Canadian assembly plants ran out of brake parts. **********""That is a conservative number,"" Mr. Garrity said. ""But G.M. would first have to run off its inventory."" **********As of Feb. 28, G.M. had a 59-day supply of cars and a 72-day supply of trucks, down from 73 days and 76 days, respectively, as of Jan. 31, according to Ward's Automotive Reports. **********A supply of 65 to 70 days is considered normal this time of year as auto makers go into the spring selling season, said a sales analyst with another top car maker in Detroit. Hope for Agreement **********Mike McCurdy, a spokesman for G.M., said the company was still hopeful that an agreement would be reached without a prolonged strike. He acknowledged that the walkout could quickly cripple the nation's largest auto maker. **********""It will be fairly soon because of our just-in-time inventory system, which keeps parts supplies pretty low,"" Mr. McCurdy said. **********Job security is the main concern among the workers at the plants, as G.M. seeks less expensive ways to make parts, said officials of the U.A.W.'s Local 696. One way is to send work to other companies. They said G.M. had proposed that an unidentified Australian company make some parts that could mean 400 to 500 fewer jobs at the plants in Dayton. **********G.M. and union officials had been negotiating for several weeks to avert a strike. Workers walked off the job on Monday morning after negotiators failed to reach an agreement by a deadline imposed by the union. **********G.M. and the U.A.W. had reached an agreement last October on a three-year national contract covering about 254,000 workers in the United States.

The issue of finding and funding the right secondary school is often based on totally different criteria from those prevailing in the host country. **********There are a number of solutions to the problem. The most obvious of these is to look for help from organizations that have an international outlook, but are based in the expatriate's home country. U.S. nationals abroad might, for example, contact International School Services, a long-established nonprofit group based in Princeton, New Jersey. The group has just produced a 500- page directory of leading overseas American and international secondary schools. **********Daniel Wagner, a former headmaster of the American School in Frankfurt and retired staff member of International School Services, said that regional associations and accrediting organizations were listed in the directory, providing a quick contact point for more extensive information from groups well acquainted with a prospective school. **********Mr. Wagner said, in general, that American schools in Europe were ""top notch"" and ""as good as most of the best independent schools in the United States."" The fees are comparable to U.S. schools too, and range from $6,000 to more than $10,000. There may also be a one-time admission fee, as well as extras for transportation. **********Anna K. Hacker, a publishing representative based in Wiesbaden, Germany, who has taught at American and international schools in half a dozen countries, said ""a fair number of people that come overseas look to putting the children into the national school system,"" which is usually free. **********And sometimes the best option is also the least expensive. In many European countries, the local public schools may be ideal, especially for younger children, giving them the benefit of picking up fluency in a foreign language relatively painlessly."

On Sunday, a car-bomb in downtown Johannesburg killed nine people. **********The explosions today, most minor but ominous in their message, led some panicky residents to stockpile household goods but seemed only to harden the resolve of black voters to exercise their first franchise. **********Bolstered by the united condemnation of politicians and by their own lifetimes of being denied, even blacks in the line of fire said they would not be frightened from voting. **********""Someone is trying to scare us away from the election,"" said Zole Msenti, who was sitting in his baby-blue minibus chatting with a friend when the Germiston blast suddenly lofted his vehicle into the air and smashed all the windows. Scores of vehicles gather each morning at suburban taxi parks to bring commuters into the city to work. **********Bandaged but unbowed, he returned from the hospital to retrieve his taxi and accept the condolences of whites who stopped to commiserate. **********""They are wasting their time,"" he said of the spoilers. ""We are going."" **********The first voters will be going on Tuesday, to 500 select polling stations opened for the elderly, the disabled and the imprisoned, followed by two days of universal suffrage. Voting for citizens overseas also opens Tuesday. **********Although no one took responsibility for the explosions, evidence mounted that the authors of the terror campaign were disaffected whites embittered about the loss of control. **********One survivor of Sunday's explosion, in the commercial center of Johannesburg, told reporters he had seen two white men wearing the uniforms of private security guards running away from a beige Audi shortly before it blew up. **********The survivor, Cherry van Heerden, 18, said he and a friend were sitting on the curb five yards away when the men parked the car, according to the South African Press Association. Moments later wisps of smoke arose inside the vehicle. **********""We tell each other, let's move away, maybe it's a bomb,"" Mr. van Heerden said. They were walking away rapidly when the blast knocked them flying. **********This victim, too, said he still planned to vote, at the mobile polling station that will pass his bed. **********The Government has promised the biggest peacetime deployment in South African history to protect voters. Gert Myburgh, the Deputy Minister of Law and Order, said 100,000 police officers and thousands of army reservists would guard the polls. **********Except for the Johannesburg and Germiston car bombs, the explosions showed no clear pattern except for the choice of targets. **********Tonight two young men lobbed a bomb into a restaurant frequented by blacks in Pretoria, killing two diners. This morning someone left a bomb in the women's toilet at a taxi park in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg; it exploded without harming anyone. Small bombs went off Sunday and today at polling stations in conservative suburbs of Johannesburg, in farm towns of the Transvaal and in the great Karroo desert. **********In Germiston, 200 pounds of explosives packed into a car trailer went off at 8:45 A.M., in the morning rush hour. Most of the 10 dead and 36 injured were blacks using the taxi park, but the blast also devastated a Portugese-run convenience store and blew out windows in a home for homeless Afrikaners. Fears of a Merger **********Germiston, which borders two volatile black townships, is to merge with them into one municipality under the new order. The white local government accepts the merger, but many white residents are furious. **********Among those surveying the wreckage, most whites expressed disgust. But a few reveled in the explosion as a show of separatist determination to wrest a white homeland, or volkstaat, from the new majority Government. **********""We will always be in the minority, and we have always said that if we cannot get a volkstaat through negotiations, we will get it through armed struggle,"" said a member of the racist Afrikaner Resistance Movement who refused to give his name. **********He said he was sorry the bomb had not killed more people. **********The terror campaign has been the deadliest and most sustained since the African National Congress took to bombing civilian targets in the early and mid-1980's. As many South Africans pointed out today, that campaign spread considerable alarm but did not jeopardize the state's control. Determined to Vote **********Candidates and officials overseeing the elections dismissed any suggestion that the vote would be delayed, or even diminished. **********""We have come light years in four years and we will not be deterred by minor incidents,"" said Judge Johann Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission. **********Nelson Mandela, the head of the African National Congress and probably the next President, visited victims of Sunday's explosion and told reporters that he and President F. W. de Klerk had agreed on measures to contain the violence. **********""We know who they are,"" he said, without elaborating. **********Unable to resist a final campaign barb, Mr. Mandela added, ""I sincerely hope the Government will act in such a way as to remove the impression we are dealing with a Government of weaklings, unable to rise to the challenge that is posed by madmen now slaughtering innocent people because they fear democracy.""                     --------------------       U.S. to Double Aid **********WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) -- The United States plans to double its financial aid to South Africa, to at least $140 million, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said today.

Will you be able to buy that house in the country you've dreamed about? What about those holidays? **********Much depends on the way pension funds allocate your assets. And in this area of investing, a quiet revolution is taking place. **********Ten years ago, most pensioners were being paid from the profits of domestic investments in bonds and, to some extent, in equities. Today, global pension funds are increasingly looking to international equity investments, especially those in emerging and offshore markets. **********The sums involved are enormous. Since 1991, U.S. pensions funds alone have doubled their exposure to overseas investment to 8 percent. And the trend appears set to continue. Greenwich Associates, a Connecticut-based investment consultancy, forecasts that foreign assets in U.S. pension funds will reach 12 percent within two and a half years. **********""There has been a big drive into international assets,"" said Rodger Smith, a partner at Greenwich Associates. ""U.S. pension funds could eventually finish up with between 20 and 25 percent overseas. And equities, including domestic ones, could make up 70 percent of their assets."" **********What makes these changes so significant? Only twenty years ago, for example, most U.S. pension funds had their assets split fairly evenly between U.S. bonds and equities. Now, say observers, as much as $30 billion annually could flow from U.S. pension funds into foreign stocks. **********In many other countries, the scale of the shift in assets is even more remarkable. In Holland, Switzerland and Germany, for example, pension funds have traditionally focused on domestic bonds. Now, they are joining the rush overseas. Dutch pension funds invested 15 percent of their assets outside Holland last year. **********Gunter Ecklebe, director of international asset consulting at Frank Russell Co., a U.S. actuarial firm, said that the trend is toward a gradual internationalization of assets. ""We already have clients with over 15 percent overseas,"" he said. ""And for some, we expect that to increase to 20 percent by the end of the century. Some clients are even looking at going as high as 30 percent."" **********One key to understanding the drive into overseas equities, say observers, is that, historically, equities have performed better than bonds. According to Chicago- based Ibbotson Associates, long-term U.S. government bonds earned a compound annual return of 5.02 percent between 1925 and 1993, while large-cap equities returned 10.33 percent and small- cap equities returned 12.36 percent. **********The long-term dominance of equities was a trend that U.K. pension funds discovered in the 1960s, when Britain was dealing with an annual inflation rate of over 25 percent. Today, the British pension industry, the third largest in the world with assets of $814 billion, has 80 percent of its assets in equities. Moreover, 28 percent of British pension-fund capital is invested outside Britain. **********Gordon Bagot, research director at the Edinburgh-based pension consultancy WM Company, said: ""Equities have always delivered far better returns. In the 60s and 70s they were the only thing that gave any protection against a British inflation rate of 25 percent. U.S. pension funds didn't have the same inflation worries."" **********Some analysts feel that the reasons for the push into overseas and offshore markets are more complex. ""Greed, or the search for higher returns overseas, is important,"" said David Booher, managing director of global research at InterSec Research Corp., a U.S. pension consultancy. ""But it is not the only reason for the internationalization of the U.S. pension industry. They are also hoping to reduce their risk."" **********Indeed, while emerging- and offshore- market investing might strike some as inherently risky, the Nobel Prize-winning economists Harry Markowitz and Bill Sharpe have argued that by investing in asset classes that behave differently from each other - no matter what or where they are - risk can be reduced. **********A simplistic but graphic example is the behavior of different groups of assets after the post-World War II oil- price shocks. Equities plunged but anyone owning gold or oil assets made out well. In a somewhat similar way, pension funds hope that by investing overseas they can reduce the risks of domestic setbacks. **********Ironically, some pioneers of British pension-fund equity investment are moving out of equities. Andrew Wilson of the London-based actuarial firm Watsons said that in the United Kingdom, ""there will be a gradual switch from equity to fixed-income over the next 10 years. "" **********Mr. Wilson's view is partly due, he said, to a feeling that equities can't repeat their performance of the past 10 years. It is also due, he added, to the mature structure of the British pension fund industry and to regulatory changes that are persuading managers to take fewer risks. **********But Mr. Ecklebe at Frank Russell Co. took a more sanguine view on the idea of diminishing risk with global equities, specifically in regard to U.S. investors. ""There is always the risk that in the short- term you might have got the timing wrong,"" he said. ""But in the long run, we believe that by investing in a basket of securities that move independently from the U.S. market, you have an aggregate reduction in risk."" **********Some analysts say that the rush overseas is likely to become a ""virtuous circle,"" particularly in the emerging markets. In other words, attempts by major U.S. pension fund groups to buy significant holdings in some markets have the potential to drive up prices in general. **********Such possibilities, many add, combined with the high economic growth rates forecast for most developing nations, mean that emerging markets should outperform developed markets over the next decade."

Perry disclosed the plan, which would place American warplanes and a division's worth of tanks and armor in the region even if Iraqi troops were withdrawn from the border with Kuwait. **********He also said that deployment of 30,000 soldiers and marines would continue and that they would not be withdrawn until the crisis passed. **********At a news conference here this morning, Mr. Perry said that more than a division's worth of Republican Guard troops remained well south of their original locations. He said that if the Iraqis remained in a threatening location, the United States would expand its deployment beyond 30,000 troops. But if Iraqi forces that had moved south toward Kuwait pulled back to the locations from which they came, Mr. Perry added, the 30,000 American troops would be withdrawn. **********Under the proposal that the Defense Secretary offered on Thursday to counter future Iraqi threats, American and allied aircraft would attack Republican Guards, the best trained Iraqi forces, if they violated a buffer zone in southern Iraq. **********Mr. Perry presented that plan on Thursday night to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who reportedly voiced support. **********The proposal would require great cooperation from Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations, most of which have been reluctant to allow a long-term American military presence. Not only would they have to permit additional access to their air bases; they would also be expected to pay much of the cost. **********Mr. Perry estimated the cost at $500 million to $1 billion, and indicated that Washington wanted the gulf states to pay much or all of it. **********Whether they will agree is unclear. Having spent billions for the gulf war, Saudi Arabia is financially strapped and not eager to spend much more. The Defense Minister, Prince Sultan al-Saud, told Mr. Perry on Thursday evening that the costs should be widely shared, suggesting that Saudi Arabia should not have to absorb the bulk of the added expense, American officials said. **********Despite reports that Iraqi forces are moving back from the Kuwait border, Mr. Perry received intelligence information Thursday night that one or two brigades of Republican Guards had stopped near Nasiriya, along the Euphrates south of the 32d parallel. The units were reportedly dug in and may be preparing an offensive against Shiite Muslim insurgents in the area. **********Iraqi forces near Qalat Salih, just north of Basra, are also delaying their retreat, the intelligence reports said. A senior Pentagon official here said this could be ""another test of our resolve."" **********The delay in the withdrawal has prompted a good deal of concern among senior Pentagon officials because the Republican Guard could wheel back and return to the Kuwait border within 24 hours. **********A senior military official said American intelligence agencies would not know for at least 24 hours if the Iraqi action was merely an exercise or something more threatening. ""We don't like what we're seeing,"" one officer said. **********The planned deployment of 30,000 American ground troops numbers 6,000 fewer than the force announced at the height of the Iraqi threat. The plan also calls for stationing 400 to 500 aircraft in the region, some of which would remain if the current crisis ends. This is fewer than the more than 700 planes and helicopters projected earlier. **********""Forces that will stay in the area to help prevent future crises from arising will be primarily Air Force,"" Mr. Perry said on Thursday. ""Saddam Hussein is a crafty character. I do see Iraq as a long-term threat to be contained."" **********The plan reflects Washington's concern about a resurgence by Iraq four years after Iraqi forces invaded and occupied Kuwait. Though an American-led coalition routed the occupiers in the gulf war in 1991, most of the Republican Guard escaped intact and now present a continuing security problem. **********Under the plan, Mr. Perry said, Washington will complete the deployment of the First Marine Expeditionary Force and two brigades of the Army's 24th Mechanized Division. The United States will also keep 2,000 marines on ships in the gulf. **********Although a spokesman for the Marine Expeditionary Force said earlier on Thursday that the deployment was on hold, aides to Mr. Perry said the spokesman had not yet gotten word that it was going forward. **********In addition to providing a hedge against an Iraqi attack, the ground and air forces would offer valuable training experience. **********A second element is to store enough American tanks and other heavy armor to support a brigade at King Khalid Military City, a Saudi military base near Hafr al Baten. **********A brigade's worth of armored equipment would also be stored in the United Arab Emirates, and a brigade of Army weapons in Kuwait. Three brigades comprise a division, so the total amount of equipment stored would serve the military needs of about 15,000 troops. **********Less than a brigade's worth of United States Army equipment is currently stored in Kuwait. **********The equipment would also facilitate training. If Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates agree, American troops could periodically return for military exercises. **********During the cold war, the United States conducted annual exercises in which a large number of troops were sent to Europe to practice repelling a Soviet attack. Mr. Perry drew an analogy between these exercises and the training he would like to carry out in the gulf. **********But whether the gulf nations will go along is uncertain. **********After the gulf war, the Bush Administration sought to store a division's worth of armored equipment at King Khalid Military City and suggested a schedule of exercises in the Saudi desert. But King Fahd, under pressure from conservative Islamic groups who resented the American presence, rebuffed the proposals. **********Clinton Administration officials hope the latest Iraqi threat will make the Saudis and other gulf states more cooperative now. **********Another element is to insure that Iraq never again menaces Kuwait. **********Defense officials traveling with Mr. Perry said the Administration was proposing a United Nations Security Council resolution that would require the Iraqi forces south of the 32nd parallel to return to the positions they held on Sept. 20, before Baghdad began mobilizing for a possible attack on Kuwait. **********That would require Iraq to withdraw the Republican Guard, but would allow it to keep 50,000 troops from III Corps near Basra. **********Mr. Perry said such a move, while a first step, needed to be followed up. **********""The first step is getting a U.N. resolution along the lines of the ones that are being debated, which would condemn the actions of Iraq, which would demand that they withdraw their forces, and further demand that they not threaten the region,"" Mr. Perry said. ""Such a resolution will likely have a phrase in it calling on member nations to implement, enforce that agreement. **********""Then, once that resolution is established, a coalition of member nations would then get together to decide what they can do for enforcement. We don't expect the U.N. resolution to spell out enforcement techniques."" **********The Secretary said Washington and its allies were discussing a plan to launch air strikes against any Iraqi forces that approached the Kuwait border. **********""To put it in simple terms, I don't trust the statement that we've gotten from them,"" Mr. Perry said on Thursday, referring to Iraqi announcements that Baghdad is removing its forces, ""and I think we will have to be there to enforce it."" **********The issue of a demilitarized zone has drawn criticism from some allies, and Mr. Perry said the details had to be worked out. **********The French, in particular, have publicly attacked the plan, though privately reaction has been mixed. Pentagon officials said the Defense Minister, Francois Leotard, initially indicated that he could accept such a plan. Then he lashed out at the plan, saying it stemmed from domestic political considerations in the United States. **********Pentagon officials, however, said the French objections would not stop Washington from trying to enforce a ban on Republican Guards near Kuwait, and added that Washington did not need the cooperation of the French military. **********From Saudi Arabia, Mr. Perry will go to Kuwait on today for talks on military planning with Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir. **********He also plans meetings with United States troops."

Your article implies that the only way domestic workers can be enrolled in Social Security is through payments by the households where they work. **********A small portion of domestic workers are live-in employees who work daily for a single household; most work in many households and are better described as contractors. Most legitimate contract workers in other trades are self-employed or employed though an agency. Self-employed individuals submit additional forms with their income taxes to report profit and loss and insure benefits. **********The writers and the I.R.S. seem to believe taxes will not be paid unless each employer-household files an indentical set of forms for the one employee. Is it not more efficient for the worker to file one set of self-employment forms that report income from the many households? Is it that filing self-employment forms is considered beyond the capabilities of most domestic workers, while the ""nanny tax"" forms are within the grasp of the employer-households? **********The burden of filing these forms is not the real obstacle. At minimum wage, these workers do not feel they can afford to buy into the Social Security system, much less pay income tax. Perhaps the problem is in the status we assign this kind of work. We continue to devalue the trades that have traditionally been considered women's work. A first step toward correcting the problem would be to value these workers as what they really are: businesspeople who offer a service many of us need. The alternative is that we continue to nuture an underclass whose hard work and income go unreported, and whose benefits are procured through welfare.

The company gave no details about what action it might take in these areas. Stock Price Pushed Up **********Kmart's announcement came a day after the company reported an unexpectedly sharp decline in second-quarter profits. The announcement of the planned sale, which came as the stock market was closing, pushed Kmart's shares up 50 cents, to $17.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Kmart has reported seven consecutive quarters of declining profits as a result of continuing problems at its basic discount-store business. Analysts said the company's efforts to control expenses by cutting back on inventories backfired in the second quarter by leaving its stores without enough goods on the shelves. As a result, sales were lower than expected, squeezing earnings. **********The decision to spin off the three specialty chains comes in the wake of the rejection by shareholders of a plan to raise $600 million to $900 million by issuing stock whose dividend would have been tied to the performance of the three groups of stores. **********Pension fund managers objected to the planned offering, arguing that the proposed shares were really an investment in the parent company and did not represent an ownership interest in the specialty stores. Kmart officials had billed the offering as a means of unlocking some of the value inherent in the chains, whose performance has been obscured by the problems at the company. **********Since the defeat of the plan in June, many institutional investors have pressed Kmart management to sell the specialty stores so they can use the proceeds to spruce up the discount stores."

They recall that only a year ago Indonesia appeared reluctant to open its market more widely to foreign investment and competition. **********Indonesian economists and businessmen said the shift had been made because Mr. Suharto saw it was the only way Indonesia could reach its full economic potential as the world's fourth- largest nation. **********When Mr. Suharto came to power in the wake of a failed leftist coup attempt in 1965, Indonesia was one of the world's poorest countries, with per-capita gross national product of $70, half that of India. In 1993, Indonesia's per-capita GNP passed $700 and was more than double India's. **********""We see the opportunity of making a lot of progress in our economic development by having having access to a bigger market and more capital, investment and technology,"" said Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of PT Bakrie & Brothers, a large Indonesian company with interests ranging from steel pipe-making and plantations to telecommunications. ""Trade liberalization is now considered a positive- sum game."" **********Mr. Bakrie said that with trade barriers falling around the world and with China, Vietnam and India undertaking major market-opening reforms, Indonesia could no longer protect its industries as it once did. **********""We have no alternative but to compete,"" he said. ""And if countries in the region have to compete, they also have to cooperate together to liberalize trade and investment rules."" **********Mr. Suharto's support for lowering barriers to trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region has added major momentum to a proposal to have the leaders of APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, endorse a plan Tuesday for free or almost free movement of goods, services and capital in the region by 2020. **********""I have spoken to President Suharto several times during the year, and I know how committed he is to achieving this goal,"" Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia said. ""Past pressure for trade liberalization has come from the industrialized countries. Now, for the first time, a developing country has said we should commit ourselves to a free-trade outcome."" **********As a result of a deregulation program started cautiously by the Suharto government in the early 1980s, Indonesia's manufactured exports have grown by an average of 20 percent a year since 1986. **********""Indonesia actually has no other choice but to support free trade,"" the Jakarta Post said in a recent editorial. ""Trading involves two-way traffic. Indonesia cannot continue to expand its exports without opening its market as well."" **********In June, the Suharto government risked nationalist ire when it announced another deregulation package aimed at improving the investment climate. The measures opened up several previously closed sectors to foreign capital and eliminated barriers to 100 percent foreign-owned investment. **********""Foreign capital is no longer seen as a demon"" in Indonesia, said Don B. Westmore, regional director for international public affairs at PT AT&T Indonesia, a unit of AT&T Corp. ""It is regarded as a positive contribution to development."" **********But while many Indonesian companies are benefiting from the free flow of goods and capital, analysts said that companies controlled by relatives and friends of Mr. Suharto had been prominent in recent contract signings. **********""We can't complain too much about the first family business,"" an Indonesian economist said. ""After all, they spearhead the privatization program."" **********Several of Mr. Suharto's six children have become increasingly active in business in recent years, obtaining numerous government contracts. As a result, they have faced growing criticism for allegedly using political influence to build up vast business empires. **********When AT&T was awarded contracts in August valued at $110 million from state-owned PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia for digital switching and transmission equipment, fiber-optic cables and telephone operating systems, its local partner was PT Citra Telekomunikasi, a company controlled by Siti Hardianti Rukmana, Mr. Suharto's eldest daughter."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/24/business/risk-where-least-expected.html,Susan Antilla,1994-06-24,,1346,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Risk Where Least Expected,Risk Where Least Expected," **********Smart investors know to brace themselves for wild rides in certain kinds of mutual funds, because the small-stock fund or overseas fund from which they profit today could cause a migraine tomorrow. **********But in the case of the funds that invest in short-term Government bonds, no such worry seemed warranted. Or so it would seem from advertising by brokerage firms and mutual fund companies that trumpeted their short-term fixed-income funds as safe alternatives to lower-yielding money market funds and certificates of deposits in the early 1990's. The ads promised higher yields without much more risk. **********One source of reassurance was the fact that the funds invested in Government bonds, which did not carry the risk of default or bankruptcy like bonds issued by companies. The other attraction was short maturities, which, though not as short as money market funds, still held out the likelihood that even if interest rates moved up they would not be whipsawed as much as longer-term securities. Now, the Reality **********The reality has been somewhat different. After having gained 3.39 percent in net asset value in the eight months that ended Jan. 31, short-term Government bond funds turned into dogs as rising interest rates devastated the bond market earlier this year. The 104 funds in one short-term category tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. lost an average of 2.08 percent in the five months through May 31. Worst of all was the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income Portfolio Fund, which plummeted 23.91 percent in that period. Next was the Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund, down 16.19 percent. **********The short-term bond funds -- which generally include Government securities like Treasury bonds, and Government agency bonds including those of the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, and the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae -- have been enormously popular in recent years. Nearly $10 billion in new money poured into the short-term bond category in 1991, followed by $11.4 billion in 1992 -- the peak year for the short-term bond funds. **********Many print advertisements for the funds have stressed stability of principal as a big plus: ""An investment that performs . . . whether interest rates go up or down,"" read the headline in a magazine advertisement in early 1992 for the Franklin Adjustable U.S. Government Securities Fund -- down 4.7 percent in net asset value since March 1993. **********A ""high-quality portfolio is managed to help minimize price fluctuation,"" read the copy of an advertisement for the Scudder Short Term Bond Fund, down 6 percent since Dec. 28. **********While fund companies pitched the short-term bond funds at investors looking for ultrasafe products -- ""Why renew your low-yielding C.D.?"" asked an advertisement for Fidelity Short-Term Bond Portfolio -- they rarely explained prominently that investors might suffer a loss of principal. The Fidelity Short-Term Bond Portfolio, for example, has lost 6 percent of its net asset value since Jan. 12. ""It is carefully managed by Fidelity for a high degree of share price stability,"" the ad said. **********At Scudder, James Smith, vice president for marketing, said he would still be comfortable running the same advertisement, because the ads prompt investors to call Scudder's information lines, where details of risk are ""fleshed out."" Greg Johnson, the head of marketing at Franklin/Templeton, said that Franklin's sales brochures and prospectus clearly stated the risks, and that investors in the fund had not lost principal when dividend payments were factored in. **********At Fidelity, Neal Litvak, executive vice president for marketing, also said that while investors in the short-term bond fund might have seen net asset value fall, they were not losers on balance when reinvestment of dividends was factored in. He added that phone representatives at Fidelity questioned callers extensively about their risk tolerance. **********The Fidelity, Franklin and Scudder short-term funds are on the Lipper list of 104 companies because they fall in different short-term fund categories, and are evaluated by Lipper elsewhere. **********Some investors might have been better served had they understood the differences between the safety of principal in their certificates of deposit and the safety of principal in the short-term funds, John Teall, a spokesman for Lipper, said. ""I think there was some perception that the short-term Government funds gave you some extra return without a great deal more risk,"" he said. ""In the case of some funds, that was absolutely true. But in some cases, as we've seen, there was substantially more risk."" 'Look at Returns' **********Mr. Teall said that investors could have used relatively simple techniques to gauge whether the fund they were considering fell into the risky or stable category. ""The easiest way to tell is to look at returns,"" he explained. ""If your returns are substantially different from everyone else in the group, your portfolio manager is probably taking risks that others are not willing to take."" **********Thus, little surprise that Piper Jaffray's fund, the worst of the 104 funds in the January-May period, was the No. 1 short-term bond fund between May 31, 1993, and Jan. 31. Piper Jaffray's fund suffered greatly because an esoteric mortgage security called an inverse floater proved a disaster as interest rates rose -- and unexpectedly illiquid as a result of the selling panic that ensued. **********Inverse floaters are one of several categories of esoteric securities that Wall Street firms create out of pools of home mortgages. These bonds, whose interest payments go up as rates fall and go down as rates rise, are a particularly aggressive way to place a bet on interest rates -- they rise and fall more sharply than more conservative fixed-income securities.  Funds that crashed from their top spots did so for a variety of reasons. The Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund took its 16.19 percent hit in large part as a result of a position in inverse floaters. The fund's portfolio managers had thought that it was adequately hedged against unfavorable movements by the inverse floaters, a spokesman said. But its hedges in the bond futures and options markets did not work as planned during the unexpectedly quick rise in interest rates earlier this year, he said. **********More common is the sort of problem that the Franklin Adjustable fund ran into: its large position in adjustable-rate mortgages stunned the portfolio because of the lag effect of the resetting of adjustable-rate mortgages. ""You have a period of up to six months before an adjustable mortgage resets to the higher rates,"" Mr. Johnson said, explaining that the mortgages in which the funds invested were temporarily paying below-market rates. **********Lipper's Mr. Teall noted that as is frequently the case in mutual fund selection, the plodders among short-term bond funds tended to have been the best selections when all was said and done. ""Average returns may not be exciting on the way up, but on the way down it's nice to get that 2.5 percent instead of losing 20 percent,"" he said. ""Most people are happiest in funds that return average numbers. You pick your risks, you pick your rewards."" **********As for the one-time high-fliers, not even a settling down of the fixed-income market may be enough to prevent future turbulence. When the bond market came apart this spring, many fund managers were forced to unload securities in order to meet the redemption requests of disgusted shareholders, Mr. Teall said. ""But they got rid of the best and easiest-to-sell pieces first,"" he added. ""And what they're left with now is the hardest, almost diabolical pieces. We suspect what's left is the worst."""

The charges include $540 million for previously announced early retirements accepted by 2,600 employees, $370 million to close or scale back factories and reorganize distribution, and $290 million for other expenses that the company did not fully explain. **********Investors welcomed the moves, which many financial analysts had recommended. Lilly shares rose $1.625, to a 12-month high of $61.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********""We are making Lilly more competitive,"" said Randall L. Tobias, a former A.T.& T. vice chairman who became Lilly's chairman in June.  More Open Markets **********The pharamaceutical maker's largest-selling product, Prozac, a $1.2 billion-a-year antidepressant, is meeting increased competition, and Ceclor, its strong-selling antibiotic, will lose patent protection this year. **********Yet despite growing pressures from Government and private buyers for lower drug prices, profit margins in drugs have been much higher than in medical devices and diagnostic products. Lilly's pretax profit margin in prescription drugs was about 40 percent last year, compared with 22 percent in medical devices and diagnostics, according to Neil B. Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. **********Mr. Tobias said six of the nine businesses would be placed in a holding company that could be sold ""in chunks"" or spun off in a stock offering. Some or all of the holding-company shares could be transferred to Lilly stockholders or sold directly to the public, he added. A Focus on Asia **********Mr. Tobias said Lilly would use part of the proceeds to expand its overseas drug business, particularly in Asia. He said Lilly would concentrate its $1 billion-a-year research effort on five treatment classes: central nervous system, anti-infection, diabetes and osteoporosis, cancer and cardiovascular problems. **********The new holding company will include Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc., which makes angioplasty balloon devices for clogged arteries; Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., which makes pacemakers to regulate heartbeat and implantable defibrillators to restart stopped hearts, and Devices for Vascular Intervention Inc., which makes catheters to remove cholesterol deposits. **********Ronald Nordmann of Paine Webber Securities estimated the value of these three units at $2 billion, and the six other divisions at $500 million. **********The holding company will include Origin Medsystems, which makes miniature surgical instruments; Heart Rhythm Technologies Inc., catheter-based surgical systems, and IVAC Corporation, intravenous infusion systems. **********Lilly said it would sell three more subsidiaries separately: Physio-Control Corporation, which makes external defibrillators; Hybritech Inc., in vitro diagnostic tests, and Pacific Biotech Inc., rapid diagnostic tests."

The deal is expected to be completed in July, officials of the companies said. **********Under terms of the deal, Adobe would exchange 1.15 shares of its stock for each share of Aldus stock. The announcement came after the stock market closed yesterday.  Shares of Adobe ended Nasdaq trading at $32.50, down $1.25, while shares of Aldus closed at $26.25, up 75 cents. **********Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., created the Postscript page description language that has become the de facto standard for exchanging electronic documents on a variety of printing and display devices. Adobe also makes a variety of computer-based type fonts and a program called Acrobat for the exchange of formatted documents over computer networks. Quality Printing **********It was the inclusion of the Adobe Postscript language in the original Apple Computer laser printer, coupled with the use of Aldus's Pagemaker desktop publishing program on Apple's Macintosh, that first enabled personal computer owners to produce professional-quality documents at a fraction of the cost of typesetting services. **********While the flagship products of both Aldus and Adobe were designed for the production of paper documents, both companies have moved rapidly to build electronic tools to allow documents to be created and distributed in the digital age. For example, Adobe's Acrobat software enables an Aldus Pagemaker document to retain its formatting and appearance even if the recipient does not have the same type of computer and software used to make the original document. **********Analysts said the proposed merger would create a comprehensive product line in document creation, desktop publishing, prepress production and electronic document delivery, with little overlap. Aldus and Adobe both make illustration and photo manipulation software, and executives of each company said they would continue to market them independently while details of the merger were completed. **********""I'm surprised it didn't happen a long time ago,"" Denise Caruso, editorial director of Technology and Media Group Inc., an information services company in San Francisco, said of the proposed merger. ""I'm sure many of Pagemaker's competitors are now worried whether they'll be asked to pay higher Postscript licensing fees."" Adobe Founders to Run Company **********The two founders of Adobe Systems, John E. Warnock, the chairman and chief executive, and Charles M. Geschke, the president and chief operating officer, would run the combined company from Adobe's headquarters. **********Paul Brainerd, the chairman and president of Aldus, based in Seattle, formed his company after a career in the newspaper business. Mr. Brainerd said he would join the board of the new company but would not have any day-to-day management responsibilities. He announced in August that he planned to step down as president of Aldus but postponed a search for his successor last fall after approaching Adobe about a possible merger. **********Mr. Geschke said the new company would have some overlapping management but declined to speculate on the timing or extent of possible layoffs."

""What matters most is an instinct for people."" **********Public disgust with banks' handling of a string of recent scandals has rekindled smoldering resentments at the power, influence and responsibility that a handful of big banks exert in German society. A recent study found that representatives of the Big Three banks alone (Deutsche, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank AG) controlled more than 8,000 leadership functions in German industry and other institutions. **********Election-year politics has reinforced a popular sentiment that banks wield too much power and demonstrate too little responsibility when checks and balances fail. **********But most German bankers, while admitting some mistakes and pledging to tinker with the system a little, generally insist the system is healthy and the criticism largely unfounded. Mr. Seipp, citing recent setbacks, maintained that banks are actually ""more impotent than all-powerful."" **********Moreover, whatever power German banks used to have has already begun to wane as the German financial system adjusts to international competition, he said. **********Indeed, as the United States and Japan seriously contemplate adapting elements of the German universal banking system, the level of criticism here seems more easily explained by social and cultural factors unique to Germany than by any fundamental financial malaise, many German bankers insist. **********The root causes for German antipathy to risk, seldom scrutinized in an age of financial internationalization, are legion. **********Mr. Seipp said Germany suffered from an ""anti-capitalist spirit"" that ran deep. ""There has never been an intellectual mass in favor of capitalism in this country,"" he said, noting that the German system is known as a protective ""social market economy,"" a far cry from the free-wheeling, risk-taking Anglo-Saxon variety. **********""In Germany we've had such drastic changes in wealth and quality of life that there is an inclination toward collective security,"" he said, citing the German system of social benefits and retirement and nursing care insurance. **********Hilmar Kopper, the Deutsche Bank chairman, is one who has voiced exasperation: ""What would banks have to do and not do in order to find public favor?"" he asked shareholders. ""This is beyond anyone's powers of imagination."" **********There are many critics, however, who quite specifically spell out what it is they want: **********- **********Ekkehard Wenger, a professor of business in Würzburg who has won a reputation as a gadfly at shareholder meetings across Germany, has won grudging sympathy from many bankers with frequent calls for greater disclosure of banks' stakes in industry and of their hidden reserves. Currently, banks do not have to disclose an industrial shareholding unless their stake is greater than 10 percent, and a new law would lower the barrier to 5 percent. **********- **********The opposition Social Democratic Party, which hopes to wrest power from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right Christian Democratic coalition this fall, has proposed 30 specific changes in six German laws to mandate more transparency and greater competition. **********- **********There is growing alarm at the fact that around 80 percent of all German bankruptcies involve corruption and that the culprits are seldom prosecuted. Though those responsible are generally ruined beyond repair, Michael Bretz, a spokesman for Creditreform, a leading German watchdog on insolvency cases, said it was remarkable that the percentage, although it was an estimate, showed no signs of shrinking."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/22/business/headaches-in-a-harvest-of-plenty.html,Barnaby Feder,1994-10-22,,1485,,The New York Times,Business Day,Series,article,Headaches in a Harvest of Plenty,Headaches in a Harvest of Plenty," **********When David Rothermel recently lined up his rumbling combine with his first eight rows of corn in his field at Dwight, Ill., he smiled wistfully at a visitor's suggestion that the season's finish line was in sight. **********""There's still a lot that can happen,"" he cautioned as he lowered the the churning teeth of the cutting head on the bright red Case International combine into the corn. **********It was almost six months since Mr. Rothermel began planting here at the northernmost part of his 2,900-acre farm, spreading more than 26,000 corn seeds an acre into soil that was slightly damper and colder than he would have liked. Since then, insects like the corn borer and weeds like Canadian thistle, foxtail and velvetleaf have taken their toll. The rains have come too fitfully in some months and too often in others. **********Still, nature has been relatively kind and what remains is a huge crop, perhaps a record for Mr. Rothermel, 40. And he is not the only farmer headed toward bin-busting yields. The Agriculture Department recently raised its crop forecast for a fourth consecutive month, to 9.6 billion bushels of corn and 2.5 billion bushels of soybeans -- both records. **********The bumper crop has sent prices plunging, leaving Mr. Rothermel worried about his profits and feeling he needs every bushel just to meet his goal of $750,000 in revenues. ""The problem with this business is that you can end up with a wage cut when you are producing more than ever,"" Mr. Rothermel said. **********Indeed, the crop from a small field of corn Mr. Rothermel harvested about 40 miles away in Elliott, Ill., had to be sold to a local grain dealer at $1.98 a bushel because there was no place to store the corn. ""It's impossible to make money at that price,"" Mr. Rothermel said. **********The challenge now is partly a race to bring home this year's crop before severe weather arrives. But the harvest is more than a flat-out sprint. Farmers also worry about harvesting in ways that minimize waste and damage to the grain, timing the harvest to match efficient storage, marketing and shipping schemes, and -- not least -- preparing fields for next year's crops. **********Large commercial operations like Mr. Rothermel's, which account for most of the nation's output, usually have the advantage of better equipment and more help from consultants or other outside experts. But they also have so many more acres to work that they are forced to harvest in conditions that smaller farmers can often avoid. **********Mr. Rothermel has already harvested about 1,000 acres of soybeans, with yields ranging from a disappointing 42 to 45 bushels -- right about the state average -- to more than 60 bushels from his land in Fairmount, Ill. **********Another 480 acres that Mr. Rothermel planted in seed corn has already been hand-harvested by the companies that will clean, grade and then sell the corn kernels to farmers preparing for next year's planting. The carefully irrigated seed corn yielded more than 80 bushels an acre. That is about half of a respectable yield for the commercial corn varieties that end up in animal feed but a terrific result for a seed crop. Because the seed companies included multipliers in their contracts to compensate Mr. Rothermel for growing a low-yielding crop, he is being credited with topping 300 bushels an acre. **********In a sense, though, Mr. Rothermel's harvest began in earnest at Dwight on Oct. 11. His stretch run will take him across 1,400 acres of commercial and food-grade corn. If he is lucky, he will finish by mid-November. **********So far, there has been no hint of the unusually wet conditions that kept him in the combine until just two days before Christmas two years ago and disrupted preparations for the 1993 crop. But Mr. Rothermel pushes himself as though delays could be around the corner, putting aside church, family events and the paperwork that has piled up on his desk. **********""Tricia started junior high basketball this year,"" he said last week, referring to the eldest of his two daughters. ""I haven't made it to a game yet."" **********Mr. Rothermel's zeal to keep to his timetable harvesting corn in Dwight led him to hire a neighbor to harvest a portion of his soybeans in Elliott when it looked as if rain might keep him from finishing the job himself. **********Mr. Rothermel first tried to harvest his corn here in Dwight last month after rain drove him out of the soybean fields. Unlike corn, beans cannot be harvested wet. But it turned out that the moisture level in the corn kernels was too high, too. The higher the moisture content, the more it costs to dry the crop to the levels buyers want. **********Wet grain is also more easily chipped or split by the combine. That was not a big worry at Dwight, where the harvest of white food-grade corn will be ground into grits, flour and meal at the J. R. Short Milling Company in Kankakee. **********But much of the corn Mr. Rothermel will harvest nearer his home in Broadlands, Ill., is destined for Frito-Lay Inc., the big corn chip and snack food company, which pays premiums of up to 30 cents a bushel, roughly a 15 percent premium at current prices, for corn with less than 3 percent of the kernels damaged. Mr. Rothermel prefers to aim for the Frito standard everywhere. **********The attention to quality was obvious. Halfway down the first row of the harvest at Dwight, Mr. Rothermel stopped his combine, scooped out a cupful of grain and tested it with a portable moisture analyzer. The readings averaged around 19 percent, 2 or 3 percent higher than he prefers but close enough to keep going. Just to be sure, he later turned the combine over to Charles Ray, a 58-year-old employee, and drove a sample to a nearby grain elevator for a more sophisticated reading. It came out at 18.2. **********The combine's on-board moisture analyzer is one of several instruments to increase efficiency. There is a walkie-talkie to communicate with Mr. Ray or whoever else is in the tractor pulling the wagon up alongside the combine every 10 minutes for grain that is off-loaded without stopping the combine's march through the field. A cellular phone permits conversations with other parts of the farm where fields are being fertilized or plowed after harvesting is completed. **********Another device monitors the settings of the various blades, screws and blowers in the combine, which collectively strip the corncobs more closely than a Marine sergeant barbers a new recruit. The kernels are then stored while the waste is spread on the field. Sensors tell Mr. Rothermel if he is spilling any grain as it is shorn from the cob. **********If the loss rate creeps up, Mr. Rothermel adjusts his speed -- generally about four miles an hour -- or stops and adjusts the combine. The goal is to harvest 1,500 to 2,000 bushels an hour while leaving less than three kernels a square foot on the ground. **********Mr. Rothermel spends most of the harvest in the combine, leaving other tasks to his two full-time employees or part-time helpers like his father and father-in-law. **********There is plenty of plowing this year. Mr. Rothermel has planted winter wheat on top of soybean stubble in a field, looking to harvest it next July and immediately plant a quick-growing strain of beans that could be harvested in the fall. But in many others, he has abandoned the increasingly common practice of ""no-till"" or ""reduced-till"" agriculture, in which crops are planted each spring in the previous year's stubble after a strong application of herbicide to kill weeds. **********The new crop methods reduce wind and water erosion. But Mr. Rothermel has calculated that his fields become too compacted and too weed-ridden without deep plowing. **********""From what I hear, a lot of others are reaching the same conclusion,"" he said, noting that good used plows have suddenly become much harder to find. **********The harvest surely will not take Mr. Rothermel's mind off such quandaries. As the combine churns through the field, occasionally flushing a young pheasant or rabbit into the open, it repeatedly hits thin patches where this year's corn fared poorly in competition with weeds. The pods on low-lying milkweeds and the velvetleaf stalks, some higher than the corn, burst open as the combine grabs the weeds. Hundreds of the hard velvetleaf seeds rattle off the combine's window while the milkweed wafts quickly away. **********""You can't harvest this year's corn without planting next year's weeds,"" Mr. Rothermel said with a sigh."

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said that its survey of regional business activity in the Southeast found prices rising, both for raw materials and finished goods. **********The February prices-paid index rose to 24.5, from 19.5 in January, while the February index for prices received for finished products rose to 15.8 from 12.1 in January. The bond- price declines after the Atlanta report only helped underscore the market's nervousness ahead of today's release of the producer price report. **********The price of the 30-year bond in late trading was down 19/32 , to 919/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.95 percent, from 6.90 percent on Friday. Focus of Other Data **********Other data the market will be focusing on this week include tomorrow's Consumer Price Index and Thursday's Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey of regional business activity, which many remember precipitated the ""pre-emptive"" increase in short-term rates last month by the Fed. **********Yesterday the market opened to a Barron's article that suggested the Fed had intervened quietly last week to stem the rising long-bond yields, which had reached 7 percent in intraday trading on Friday. Traders said they were not sure if the bond market really believed the article, but prices were up in early trading. **********Analysts at MMS International said they doubted the Fed would try to manipulate long rates or defend specific levels. The article was denied later in the morning by a New York Fed spokesman. **********With few investors in the market and most on the sidelines, the moves were greatly exaggerated, analysts said. Matthew Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said, ""It was real hard to fall in love with anything in this market ahead of the numbers."" **********Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said the market appeared to him to be worried that higher energy prices may put pressure on the index today. ""But the market is likely to be forgiving if the strength is concentrated in the energy component,"" Mr. Crandall said. **********He said that while the Producer Price Index was a measure of inflationary pressures, many market participants were also aware that the index was more volatile than the Consumer Price Index. ""Therefore, strong numbers are less likely to be a surprise to the market,"" he said. **********One reason the Producer Price Index can have less impact is that it does not include prices in the service sector of the economy. The consensus forecast is for an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in the overall producer index, with a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the so-called core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. **********Elsewhere, the Treasury was busy selling $25.2 billion of three- and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction, with the average discount rate up over the previous week. **********The average rate for the three-month bill was 3.57 percent, up from 3.52 percent last week and the highest since June 29, 1992, when it was 3.59 percent.

The stock closed yesterday at $35.125 a share, down 12.5 cents, on the American Stock Exchange. **********""Most days I think the deal is going to happen,"" Peter Siris, an anlayst with UBS Securities Inc., said.

People familiar with the case said the agency was weighing possible antitrust and restraint-of-trade implications in the deal, which would meld Lilly, a leading drug maker, with PCS. **********The F.T.C. concern raises the possibility that the agency could take another look at two recent acquisitions of drug distributors that it has already passed on. Representatives for Merck & Company and SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., the two drug companies that had bought drug distributors, said yesterday that the commission had asked for information in connection with the Lilly deal. But, the representatives added, the F.T.C. had not raised new questions regarding their own mergers. **********""It now appears that the F.T.C. thinks it was too prompt in approving the two prior acquisitions and is having second and third thoughts about the Lilly deal,"" said Neil B. Sweig, a drug securities analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. **********And, showing Congressional interest, aides for at least three committees that deal with antitrust and health care issues planned to meet next week with F.T.C. staff members to discuss the Lilly-PCS merger. **********Edward A. West, a spokesman for Lilly, said the discussions with the F.T.C. were ""progressing in an orderly fashion."" He said Lilly believes the deal ""complies with antitrust law and is in the best interests of consumers."" A spokeswoman for the commission had no comment. **********Congressional aides said yesterday that the commission staff was concerned that by controlling PCS, Lilly could discriminate against other drug makers by manipulating the drugs chosen by distributors to sell in huge volume to big employee health plans. **********Distributors like PCS, called pharmacy benefits managers, give priority status to certain drugs in return for lower prices from the manufacturers. One concern was that a drug maker could underbid rivals, based on inside information obtained from its pharmacy benefits unit. **********F.T.C. staff aides were discussing a requirement that would open the distributors' preferred lists to all drugs, which industry experts said would eliminate the advantages of being on the lists. **********Congressional committee staff members said the F.T.C. had acquired new insights into the issues since it approved a similar deal last November, when Merck acquired the pharmacy benefits management company Medco Containment Services for $6.6 billion. **********Though it did not object to the Merck-Medco deal or SmithKline's acquisition in May of Diversified Pharmacy Services, another big drug distributor, the F.T.C. has now asked other drug companies, clients, trade groups and academic experts whether competition would be hindered by the Lilly-PCS deal. **********Lilly said the postponement of its deal could last more than two weeks. Analysts said the completion of the PCS purchase could be pushed into 1995. Lilly had originally expected to complete the deal this month. **********On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, investors drove the price of shares in PCS's parent company, the McKesson Corporation, down $3.375 to $101.375. Lilly closed unchanged at $59 a share, up 50 cents. ""The market seems to be telling us that analysts have divided thoughts as to whether they want Lilly to buy PCS,"" Mr. Sweig said. **********Consumer advocacy groups and pharmacy trade associations have written to the commission to express concern about the rising number of mergers between drug makers and distributors. And at least 50 civil lawsuits charging price discrimination have been filed against Merck and Medco, mostly on behalf of pharmacy groups. One has been scheduled for trial next month in a Federal district court in San Francisco."

They were worried as ever about their white overseers, but they were no less determined to take part in Mr. Tukai's mock presidential balloting. They sought a taste of the many unknowns awaiting them later this month on the very first true election day in lives rutted with indentured routine. A Strong Majority Needed **********Mr. Tukai's message was that while a Mandela presidential victory is expected, it needs, most critically, a resounding majority vote from the black throngs in the squatter and labor camps if his national reconstruction program is to be forcefully impelled. **********""Whether my life changes depends on who gets elected,"" Lucas Mlungana, a 50-year-old quarry worker, declared flatly. He yearns for fast improvement in a dray-horse existence in which he must sleep in the dim spartan barracks for 11 months of each year before journeying far to reclaim his waiting wife and children for the precious remaining month. **********""We're not frightened,"" he said huskily, carefully watching a visitor fold a makeshift ballot box from cardboard, as if it were a communion chalice in some new religious rite. **********The sight of Mr. Mlungana's colleagues, dusty in the barracks from their morning's labor, leaning forward as one and soaking up every detail of the mock election -- the sweet X-ing of free choice, the folding and depositing of the ballot as carefully as a bank note -- was a silent tribute to what the long withheld vote means now to black South Africa. 'The Great Unknown' **********""The black vote is the great unknown of the election,"" said Rashida Abdullah, rushing to dispatch canvassers here across the nation's southwestern flank in behalf of the Mandela candidacy. ""We keep finding all these unknown people,"" she said, knowing blacks offer a 90-per-cent Mandela majority if only there are enough workers to find and enroll them. ""Just today, 29 chicken farm camps no one ever knew about were turned up near Cape Town; 29 more groups of black workers we must organize."" **********Across a day of searching and canvassing, Mr. Tukai and his colleague, Uria Malebye, worked the nation's hidden trove of squatter and labor camps that were segregated and sequestered by the white government and desperately invented by displaced blacks, too, during four harsh decades of apartheid. **********Shunned and unwooed until now, these black refugees suffer shelter ranging from the stolid barracks cot of Mr. Mlungana's more privileged status to the pathetic squatter's hovel of Elda Mahlentle, a grandmother who saw her husband and grandson burn to death in one of the many sudden fires that ravage the makeshift squatter warrens of wood and cardboard shacks. Violence and Squalor **********""I always hope, sir,"" said Mrs. Mahlentle, trying to fight back from within the festering Marconi Beam squatter camp here, where she is organizing the vote for Nelson Mandela. Toddlers splash bare-foot across a rivulet of open sewage and the tense threat of gang and warlord violence is ever present. ""I heard a lot about Mandela in jail, struggling for us."" **********His organization is delighted to have the squatter matriarch, for she is a scrappy survivor who actually organized a school for camp children by begging $600, a fortune, to buy four delivery truck bodies and cut classroom doors and windows in them. **********The school stands in its surreal boxes as a rare point of pride in the camp as Mrs. Mahlente tries to make her formidable resolve contagious. ""Change will come,"" she said. **********""We will be patient once he is elected, and so maybe the first improvements won't be seen here for one or two months,"" she said, echoing a optimism heard in repeated visits to the squalid camps lately. This collective hope seems cruel if not impossible in the camps' setting of destitution, a world of castaways in which perimeter police towers guard not the inhabitants but the more valued passers-by outside. Enrollment of Voters **********But the outcome of all hope, dashed or fulfilled, must await the voting. And the enrolling and canvassing of blacks is going on as urgently among the urban homeless in street shelters as among outlying squatter camps. **********Blacks make up 75 percent of the country's potential vote, but apartheid has deliberately placed them in the most inaccessible parts of the country, putting a heavy burden on voting enrollment workers. They conduct a rather unwieldy process of finding and fingerprinting black voters in the countless shacks under a new system of universal citizen identification cards. **********""It's impossible to even tell how big this task is,"" said Rowell Manyi, a voter enrollment supervisor who lugged a computer powered by a gas generator into Mrs. Mahlentle's camp for the job. In two days he enrolled 352 from among the countless thousands of nervous, illiterate residents, translating them into screen glyphs. **********""The people we reach here are grateful, very willing to vote,"" Mr. Manyi said, noting that enrollment workers have been resorting to single-vote temporary identity cards to prime a maximum vote in these final days before the election, on April 26 through 28.  Disapproval From Employers **********But even after the farthest black outposts are discovered, workers encounter such obstacles as white farmers who seek to deny them access to the black laborers' bunkhouses, or who demand to be present for the mock balloting in tense scenes that intimidate typical workers. **********""This is tricky,"" muttered Uria Malebye, a Mandela volunteer, as one strapping white farmer strutted up to find out about his sudden visitors, displaying open suspicion. ""We must be diplomatic,"" cautioned Mr. Malebye, who then proceeded to let the farmer conclude the mission was a nonpartisan one of government election workers, not Mandela partisans. **********The farmer finally agreed to let the visitors return for no more than one hour's presentation in the bunkhouse on the workers' time. But he remained clearly skeptical and annoyed about this election business. **********Once the farmer was out of hearing, the departing Mr. Malebye, smiling placidly, whispered, ""Look across there to the workers' house."" **********Across the barnyard, a few black laborers peered warily from the bunkhouse window, as if at a failed mission in retreat. But Mr. Malebye had spotted encouragement. ""See, drying on the line? A Mandela T-shirt. You can bet we'll be back tomorrow."""

An Associated Press writer had about four hours to find an ethnomusicologist knowledgeable about relationships between black and Jewish jazz musicians. A journalist with Radio Canada wanted an agricultural expert in the United States who could speak about the environmental problems posed by pig manure -- in French. **********A few years ago, a well-stocked Rolodex and hours on the telephone would have been needed to find such authorities in arcana, if they could be found at all. But these reporters succeeded with only one call to Profnet, a computer network of university public information officers. **********It is the global village's matchmaking service for academia and news organizations, and it has reporters and public information officers gushing about a new dialogue between the ivory tower and the news media. No Charge for Requests **********Reporters can relay queries by fax, toll-free telephone calls or electronic-mail messages to Profnet headquarters at the State University of New York campus here. There is no fee for the requests. Within hours, or even minutes, the messages are sent by computer to almost 600 colleges, universities and research centers. **********At those institutions, public information officers -- eager to get their employers' names into print or on the air -- review the request, then look for experts on staff on the topic. **********""It's a quantum leap forward in how you locate a source,"" said Dan Forbush, the system's founder and an associate vice president for university affairs at Stony Brook. ""Imagine being able to send a telegram at no charge to more than 1,000 people around the world, and to convert each of them into research assistants."" **********Profnet is only one way that computers are changing reporting. News organizations now use computer-generated analyses from government data bases, and reporters scan company press releases on electronic bulletin boards. While journalists praise Profnet, they say they are concerned that a public information officer might use it to promote an institution's faculty too aggressively. **********Still, reporters and public information officers agree that Profnet has given reporters a wider range of sources while helping lesser-known institutions draw attention to their faculty members and researchers. **********Dennis Kipp, the Poughkeepsie reporter, had twice tried and failed to write a column on the virtues of crickets. While he was convinced that the little creatures that his daughter fed to her pet lizard were themselves potential pets, he could not find anyone who agreed. **********In September, after learning about Profnet, Mr. Kipp sent a query about the idea. In two days, he had four responses with the phone numbers of some pre-eminent cricket experts. **********Among the replies was a four-page profile of Dr. David Shetlar, an Ohio State University entomologist who advocated cockroaches as Christmas presents for children. Mr. Kipp knew immediately that this man could tell him what to feed a pet cricket. **********Stan Ernst, media coordinator for Ohio State's College of Agriculture, is a devout Profnet user. Through the network, he recently arranged for a faculty member to be interviewed on Iowa public television about ethanol and put an expert on coffee cartels in touch with a San Francisco newspaper. **********""Who in the world would ever think of calling Ohio State for an expert in coffee cartels, let alone crickets?"" he said. ""That's the kind of reach we wouldn't have without Profnet."" A Range of Requests **********Most requests are not as quirky as Mr. Kipp's. Reporters have used Profnet to find an expert on gun-control policy or the effects of crack cocaine addiction. **********Chris Feola, an editor at The Waterbury (Conn.) Republican-American, said his newspaper had more than 100 responses after it sought assistance for a series of articles on the roots of urban poverty and decay. **********""The only problem with Profnet is it's like reading the Encyclopedia Britannica,"" he said. ""You go in to read one thing, and six hours later, you're still reading."" **********Before his job at Stony Brook, Mr. Forbush worked at Gehrung Associates in Keene, N.H., a public relations firm representing about 40 colleges. There, he took calls from reporters and tried to link them to professors. **********At Stony Brook, he noticed that professors and students were increasingly relying on the Internet, a global web of computer networks, for communication. At the same time, he saw that more journalists were using computer networks for research. **********Mr. Forbush set up Profnet in 1992. Since then, he has amassed a directory of E-mail addresses for public information officers in 16 countries. **********Other systems provide a similar service. For instance, the Scientists' Institute for Public Information in Manhattan has a data base of about 30,000 experts, and will provide their names and telephone numbers to reporters seeking assistance. **********Profnet, however, relies less on a data base than on the knowledge of the public information officers who use it. The system gets about 14 to 20 queries a day. For the last fiscal year, the network cost about $2,500 to operate, not counting the time of university officials and volunteers. **********Mr. Forbush said it made sense for Profnet not to charge customers. ""We benefit from getting these phone calls,"" he said. If a fee were imposed, he added, ""it would lose all of its charm."""

But the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, insisted for some time after the deadline that the only Serbian forces left were a handful of ""policemen."" **********Relenting more than a week after the NATO ultimatum expired, General Rose concluded that the ""policemen"" were Serbian militiamen who ought not to be there. But intermittent talks since then have failed to resolve the problem to the satisfaction of the Bosnian Government, which sees in the issue an important test of the credibility of the United Nations. **********It was not immediately clear whether President Izetbegovic's threat was any more than yet another case of Balkan brinkmanship, or whether the Bosnian Government had abruptly reconsidered the usefulness of the Geneva talks. **********What is clear is that if all the parties attend -- as Mr. Akashi expects -- they will be under great pressure to sign an agreement on a temporary cease-fire in Bosnia. Four-Month Lull Sought **********The United States, Russia and the European Union have, for the first time, jointly called on the parties to stop fighting for at least four months, in order to clear the way for intense talks on a political settlement of the 25-month-old Bosnian war. **********""Mr. Akashi has called this meeting because he thinks he can get an accord,"" said a Western diplomat, ""and I believe the chances are better now than for a long time. Neither side wants to be seen as blocking the will of the international community, and perhaps a three-month cease-fire could emerge."" **********The Bosnian Government is reluctant to freeze the Serbian territorial gains in place, and is concerned by the example of Croatia, where a United Nations-brokered truce is now more than two years old but has not altered the Serbian hold on about 25 percent of Croatian territory. Mr. Izetbegovic therefore favors a cease-fire of only two months. **********The Serbs, satisfied with the 72 percent of Bosnia they hold, favor an open-ended cease-fire. They are worried that a temporary truce would only enable the newly forged federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia to strengthen their army and improve their weapons in preparation for a new offensive. Disengagement Is Goal **********Faced by the diplomatic and military maneuvers of the two sides, the United Nations is trying to move fast to change the situation on the ground in order to make further fighting more difficult. **********What Mr. Akashi has in mind, diplomats said, is the real disengagement of forces followed by the immediate placing of United Nations peacekeepers between the Serbs and Muslims. **********""Mr. Akashi wants disengagement that is significant enough to insure that United Nations peacekeepers can know the identity and source of any violations of the cease-fire, and so avoid the provocations we have seen in the past,"" one diplomat said. **********Myriad cease-fires in Bosnia have collapsed, often within hours of being signed. **********To back the United Nations efforts in Geneva, General Rose has made it clear that the commitment of the two largest contingents in the peacekeeping force -- the French and the British -- is not open-ended and diplomatic progress is essential soon if they are to remain. **********But it is by no means clear that this sort of pressure will be enough to convince the Bosnian Government that the time for peace has come. The Government is still deeply committed to insuring that the hundreds of thousands of Muslim civilians forced from their homes in northern and eastern Bosnia can return -- something Mr. Akashi and Western diplomats have not offered in any of their peace formulas."

""We are simply complying with Federal law and giving the employees 60 days' notice."" **********Delta employs 11,000 in its technical operations unit, which is responsible for engineering, maintenance and administrative support.

And for some companies that made heavy investments in the late 1980's, that is horrible news. To pay the debts incurred then, they desperately need to charge high prices. And too often it turns out they can't. **********Investors who ought to be nervous about that phenomenon, but evidently aren't, are those who own stock in the world's most ambitious public works project, Eurotunnel. Its shares now stand at 613 British pence, up 43 percent in two months. **********Valuing Eurotunnel is not easy. ""We don't really have any proper traffic forecasts,"" said Matthew Stainer, an analyst at Schroder Securities in London. ""In the short run, the stock will be driven by sentiment."" With the tunnel about to open, and with the expectation of strong traffic driven by curiosity, sentiment is positive. **********The shares did slip a bit last week, as Eurotunnel announced the fares it will charge for hauling cars and passengers across the channel (about $330-$460 per car, higher on most days than a ferry trip). Still, there was a sigh of relief that it seemed to be avoiding a fare war with the ferries. It looks like investors will be willing to buy more shares this spring, providing a desperately needed capital infusion. The optimistic projection is that in 1998 the tunnel's operating revenues will be enough to begin covering all its obligations. **********Perhaps all will go as planned, and revenues will rise as projected, enabling the tunnel to meet payments on the borrowing that was needed as the cost of building the tunnel soared to almost twice the original estimate. The fares appear to have been set at the maximum possible level. **********But will enough people pay them? Europe is starting to come out of recession, which will increase traffic, but it is doubtful that will be enough to offset the effects of a huge increase in capacity. To stimulate demand, price cuts are probably inevitable, forcing a crisis at Eurotunnel. That won't close the tunnel; it will just force a restructuring that will give stock to creditors and losses to stockholders. **********That is exactly what has happened at the other famous ""Euro"" project, Euro Disneyland. The theme park in France is drawing plenty of customers but they aren't spending enough money to support the debt-heavy capital structure. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner has threatened to close the park, but that is obviously a negotiating ploy. There are no alternative uses for the property -- would you believe Sleeping Beauty Castle condos? -- so you can safely plan a trip there next year. The only questions are who will own the place, and how high the prices will be. There are hopes that the eventual restructuring will give current shareholders a big enough stake to justify current prices, but there is no assurance of that. **********""The inflation rate in France now is around 2 percent, the lowest in Europe,"" moaned Jacques Henri Eyraud, an official at Euro Disney. ""When you build your project on debt, it is a problem."""

To Deal With Bad Boards, A New Shareholder Tool"," **********FOR the last year or two, the biggest theme in corporate governance has been the duty of boards of directors to oversee management. But, despite the attention, few observers have addressed a central issue: How can shareholders, in a convenient, inexpensive and evenhanded way, deal with boards that seem to be failing? **********Currently, dissatisfied shareholders have only two choices beyond mere public embarrassment. Both are expensive and time-consuming. If shareholders think the board has completely breached its duties, they can sue. For lesser derelictions, they can start a full-blown proxy contest, which requires them to prepare and distribute their own proxy materials with no guarantee of corporate reimbursement. (The company pays for the directors' defense.) **********What is greatly needed is an intermediate device -- something short of these all-out alternatives. I suggest a rule, to be put forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would make a management's proxy statement machinery available to certain investors when some objective evidence suggests the board may not be doing its job adequately. **********For example, imagine that a company underperforms for three years in a row. Under one version of this rule, shareholders who have held 5 percent or more of the company's stock for at least two years might be permitted to use the company's proxy statement to promote their nominees for some board seats. **********This approach borrows from other securities rules. The New York Stock Exchange gives preferred stockholders -- who are first in line for corporate dividends -- the right to elect some directors if dividends have been unpaid for six consecutive quarters. And the S.E.C.'s Rule 14a-8 gives certain shareholders access to the corporate proxy machinery for proposals unrelated to board elections, like environmental policies. **********Of course, many details of such a rule must be decided. How many years of underperformance should activate it? How much stock should shareholders need to be eligible, and for how long must they have owned it? And how many board nominees can such shareholders designate? **********These are tough issues, but the most difficult -- though still workable -- task in formulating such a rule is gauging a company's performance. If losses are the measure, for instance, adjustments must be made for those losses resulting solely from changes in accounting rules. Special standards may be needed for start-up companies and for those in cyclical industries. And how should general economic influences be handled? Some of America's best managers and most attentive boards serve corporations that have reported a string of losses due to macroeconomic forces. **********OR maybe stock prices, compared with an industry group or broader market index, are the best measure of underperformance. But if so, the rule makers may have to fine-tune this standard in numerous ways; they may have to protect against improper ""hyping"" to raise a stock's price, for example. **********Of course, whatever the fine points, any such corporate-governance rule proposed by the S.E.C. will stir debate. Just remember the intense lobbying last year over agency proposals on shareholder communications and executive pay. Moreover, in crafting the proposal, the S.E.C. must avoid intruding on those areas of corporate law reserved to the states. **********But there should also be strong support for such a rule. Shareholders, of course, will like it as a low-cost way to have a voice in the company they own and to level the playing field when they disagree with the corporate establishment. **********For several reasons, companies should like the idea, too. Lengthy company underperformance, properly defined, can be strong evidence that a board is ineffectual and that change is needed. Such a rule can avoid a crisis by spurring earlier board attention to problems; it may work as a safety valve, too, allowing shareholders to voice discontent without a full-blown proxy contest or lawsuit. **********The rule also rewards relationship investing, or active shareholder behavior. This, in turn, encourages so-called patient capital -- the long-term investments that companies like. Nor does the availability of a rule mean it will be used; it may simply lead to negotiation between the company and its shareholders."

Who's Advising Financial Advisers?"," **********TWO of the most complex financial matters that Americans must handle are pensions and taxes. When they overlap, confusion can be expected. But instead of guiding people through the fog, some financial advisers are compounding the problem. **********Generally acting out of ignorance, these advisers steer people the wrong way on retirement plan distributions. **********Seymour Goldberg, a lawyer and an expert on plan distributions, said people often complained that they had received bad advice on what to do after inheriting money as beneficiaries of retirement plans. ""Many people want to know what recourse they have,"" he said. In some cases, lawsuits are filed. **********""The area of pension malpractice is so explosive that I am afraid insurance carriers will stop writing coverage for accountants,"" said Mr. Goldberg, a partner at the law firm Goldberg & Ingber in Garden City, L.I. **********Particularly nettlesome is an Internal Revenue Service ruling that allows taxpayers to pass along money in individual retirement accounts to grandchildren, stretching out income tax payments for 50, 60 or even 70 years. This approach can be used by people with substantial financial resources, who do not need their retirement funds for living expenses and want to maximize the estate left to their heirs. **********A column on this practice appeared a year and a half ago and continues to generate letters from readers who have been advised that the technique is not permitted. **********Theodore Rodman, a 66-year-old doctor in Ardmore, Pa., described his situation and his encounter with financial professionals. He has an I.R.A. that names his 6-year-old grandson as the beneficiary, and he has made the appropriate trust arrangements because the child is a minor. Dr. Rodman has other sources of income and does not plan to begin withdrawals from the I.R.A. until required to do so. (He also recognizes that the total amount passed to grandchildren, whether in an I.R.A. or not, should not exceed $1 million, to avoid a tax referred to as a generation-skipping transfer tax.) **********He said his understanding was that when he dies, estate taxes will be due on the retirement money, but income tax will be due only as the grandson receives the distributions over his actual life expectancy. **********Dr. Rodman's lawyer, accountant and investment adviser disagreed. Estate tax and income tax on the full amount would be due immediately on the I.R.A. assets they said. **********""I had a heated discussion with my financial advisers,"" Dr. Rodman wrote. ""I would be grateful if you resolved our dispute."" **********Dr. Rodman's financial team is dead wrong, according to several financial experts and an I.R.S. representative. ""It is so frightening that so many people are out there advising people, and they don't know what they're doing,"" said Joshua Rubenstein, a partner in estates at Rosenman & Colin, a law firm in New York. ""It is clear that once the account holder dies, the beneficiary spreads out the income over his entire life."" **********In private-letter ruling 9330042, issued on May 7, 1993, the I.R.S. said the beneficiary could determine his or her own life expectancy in the year the account holder turned 70 1/2, subtract one year for each year that withdrawals had been made by the account holder and continue taking the money over the beneficiary's life expectancy. ""Say, it was initially 30 years and five years have passed,"" said Don Roberts, an I.R.S. spokesman. ""Then you have 25 years to take it out."" **********A private letter ruling is intended only for the taxpayer who requested it, but this one restates I.R.S. policy. ""It couldn't be more clear,"" Mr. Roberts said. ""Anybody who would take a look at this ruling and then turn around and say that the whole thing is subject to tax immediately is not reading it."" **********But Dr. Rodman's letter was not the only one on this topic. ""I think there are tons of errors being made,"" said Mr. Goldberg, author of ""A Professional's Guide to the I.R.A. Distribution Rules"" (Foundation for Accounting Education, New York). **********For those who are confused, here's how the strategy works: **********A grandfather names a granddaughter the beneficiary of an I.R.A. If he dies before age 70 1/2, has two options: she can take all the money by the end of the year after the fifth anniversary of the death; or she may begin taking annual distributions based on her life expectancy, as published in I.R.S. tables. **********When the grandfather reaches age 70 1/2, he must begin distributions. The minimum distributions for an account holder and a nonspouse beneficiary who is more than 10 years younger are based on a minimum-distribution incidental benefit table. **********This table calculates the withdrawals as if the beneficiary were 10 years younger. When the grandfather dies, his granddaughter may use their joint life expectancy when he was 70 1/2 or her own life expectancy at the time, and then subtract the years the distributions have been taken. In practice, these numbers will be similar. **********Why is there so much bad advice? In many cases, the adviser simply does not understand the rules. ""The rules are very arcane, and the relevant sections of the code are cryptically written,"" Mr. Rubenstein said. **********Some advisers, though, are operating from self-interest. Insurance salesmen, for example, may advise clients to set up a charitable remainder trust that will go to charities at their deaths and to simultaenously establish a separate insurance trust for their heirs. For many people, simpler estate plans might achieve the same results. **********""Unfortunately,"" Mr. Rubenstein said, ""much financial advice is cooked up by people who are trying to get you to purchase a life insurance policy.""ADDING UP AN ESTATE **********ESTATE tax cannot be deferred on an individual retirement account. ""An I.R.A. can survive the death of the account holder, but it is still part of the taxable estate,"" said Seymour Goldberg, a lawyer and expert on retirement plans. **********Whether the estate tax comes out of the I.R.A. or other assets depends on the will.  Like other retirement accounts and insurance policies, an I.R.A. passes directly to beneficiaries rather than going through probate. **********Usually estate taxes are paid from the portion of the estate that goes through probate. ""Most people have clauses in their wills that say, 'Pay all estate taxes out of the residuary estate,' "" said Joshua Rubenstein, an estate planning lawyer. **********If beneficiaries of the I.R.A. are different from those of the probate estate, ""it would be fairer to let each piece of property bear its own share of taxes,"" Mr. Rubenstein said. If money is pulled out of the I.R.A. to pay estate taxes, however, income tax is due on that money, he explained."

""My health is good. I'm looking forward to going back to my own country."" **********Mr. Fay, 19, left Singapore this morning, less than 24 hours after his release, on a Northwest Airlines flight for Tokyo and Chicago. His United States home is near Dayton, Ohio. **********While Mr. Fay offered no details about the severity of the caning and refused to answer questions from reporters when he was released, his father said in an interview on Monday that despite earlier reports from the family's American lawyer that the May 5 flogging had been savage, it may actually have been relatively light by the standards of Singapore, where caning is a routine punishment. **********""I do tend to believe that he certainly did not get whacked as hard as he could have gotten whacked,"" said his father, George Fay, an Ohio businessman. ""Because of the publicity, I tend to think that they didn't want him limping out of jail. He can sit, he can walk."" **********The Fay case created a furor after President Clinton intervened publicly to ask that the Singapore Government spare the rod. The decision by authorities here to go forward with the flogging despite the White House appeal has led to a marked deterioration in relations between the United States and Singapore, a nation that has long been a close American ally. **********Asked on Monday how relations with Singapore had been affected by the caning, the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said in Washington, ""I think there have been repercussions, because the fallout from this incident is something that becomes a factor in our bilateral relations."" **********Last month the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, said the United States had decided to vote against Singapore's effort to be host of a prestigious summit meeting next year -- the first meeting of the World Trade Organization, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which regulates world trade. 'An Insult,' Official Says **********While Mr. Kantor did not explicitly link the American stance to the caning of Mr. Fay, other American officials did. **********""There are people in Washington who took the caning as an insult to the President, and no one in Singapore should be surprised that the Administration would want to express its displeasure in a tangible way,"" an American official said. The American vote may have been enough to block Singapore's effort, and the meeting is now expected to take place in Europe, possibly Geneva. **********The remarks by Mr. Kantor outraged officials in Singapore, who saw the summit meeting as their chance to establish this tiny but influential nation as the hub of Southeast Asian trade. ""We would like to be a symbol of free trade,"" Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said. **********In an editorial last month, The Straits Times, the quasi-official English-language newspaper here, accused the Clinton Administration of ""picking quarrels with Asian countries."" Confession Retracted **********Mr. Fay, who has lived in Singapore since 1992 with his mother and stepfather, was arrested last fall and accused of spray-painting cars and other mischief. He signed a confession but has since insisted that he is innocent, and that his confession was coerced by police officers who beat him during nine days of interrogation. The Singapore Government has denied the charge. **********George Fay said his son had made no decision on whether to accept offers to sell his story to Hollywood or to a book publisher. **********""Mike is 19 and certainly I can advise, but ultimately he's going to answer that question,"" Mr. Fay said. ""As far as I'm concerned -- and contrary to popular belief -- this would not make a classy movie. It would make just trashy Sunday night television garbage."""

Nearly a million would-be immigrants flocked to Germany from 1989 to 1993 until Parliament changed the asylum laws last year to make it harder to get in. Not Government View **********The commissioner said that she was expressing her personal views, not those of the Government. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has told voters repeatedly that Germany is not an immigrant country, and German laws do not recognize most of the foreigners living here as immigrants, though they now constitute more than 7 percent of the population and 10 percent of marriages in Germany are between a German and a foreigner. **********Mrs. Schmalz-Jacobsen also criticized some German officials for sending mixed signals that could have encouraged neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists to commit violence against foreigners, like the firebombing of a Turkish home in Solingen a year ago that killed five people. **********""An under secretary of state from Bavaria said recently that he didn't want to give local voting rights to foreign residents because he didn't want to see a mayor in this country named Mustapha,"" Mrs. Schmalz-Jacobsen told the conference. **********German law recognizes ethnic Germans, including some who have been living for generations in Russia and Eastern Europe, as citizens when they immigrate here. But only about 1 to 2 percent of the Turks, Serbs, Croats, Italians and members of other non-German ethnic groups become naturalized. Call for Dual Citizenship **********Mrs. Schmalz-Jacobsen's party, the Free Democrats, the smallest in the coalition Government, has been calling for dual citizenship for resident Turks and others who now must wait at least 15 years and then formally renounce their original nationality to become German citizens. **********The package of recommendations she made in February included proposals to ease requirements for foreigners to be naturalized. But in March Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats, nervous about doing anything that would lose votes to right-wing parties that oppose immigration on racial grounds, rejected the package. **********Many of the more than 1.8 million Turks in Germany have been here for decades, and their children do not even speak Turkish. Yet families like these have to apply for naturalization to become German citizens. Most do not because renouncing Turkish nationality endangers their right to inherit property in Turkey. **********Mrs. Schmalz-Jacobsen said she had recommended dropping the requirement to forswear original citizenship, and shortening the required residence period to eight years for naturalization. Foreign children born here should not suffer legal discrimination, she said. **********""Up to now, a young non-German born here has to ask for a work permit at the age of 16,"" she said. ""It seems unnatural to them to have to ask for this as a favor from their home country when their classmates have it as a right. **********""Many people in Germany still think that foreigners just cost money, but this is just not true.

The E.E.O.C.'s underlying principle, too, seems simple enough: Employers may not ask questions of job applicants that might lead to disclosure of a disability before an offer is made, on the theory that such disclosures would muddy hiring decisions with prejudices and stereotypes. **********In fact, with a little professional guidance on the guidelines -- available from the commission -- it is not impossible to figure out what is permissible and what is not, presumably a bit of welcome news for the increasing numbers of businesses covered by the measure. In late July, coverage expanded to businesses with 15 or more employees. **********According to the clear, if dauntingly fine, print of the commission directive, employers may ask questions like: Can you perform the functions of this job, with or without reasonable accommodation? Do you illegally use drugs? Do you have the required licenses to perform this job? Do you drink alcohol? **********Employers may not ask: Do you have AIDS? Do you have asthma? Do you have a disability that would interfere with your ability to perform the job? How much alcohol do you drink each week? Have you ever been treated for alcohol problems or mental health problems? **********""The hiring process before the A.D.A. was a muddle,"" said Peggy Mastroianni, director of the commission's A.D.A. policy division in Washington. Employers, she says, did not necessarily have evil intentions, but if applicants indicated they had a disability, they might be automatically disqualified. ""Now, information is keyed to performance, not to information about disability,"" Ms. Mastroianni said. **********A yes-or-no answer to the question of drinking alcohol, for example, merely establishes a fact, while asking how much a candidate drinks could lead to the disclosure of a problem with alcohol or a history of problem drinking, either of which may be a disability. **********But lawyers, especially those who represent employers, tend to hear the word ""simplicity"" and go for their guns. There is virtually never anything simple about employment discrimination law, they say, if only because Congress, like a dowager with a handkerchief, likes to flutter off after making new law, leaving interpretation and enforcement to its bureaucratic minions. Though employers' lawyers typically complain that Federal guidelines are insufficiently detailed, in the case of the new guidelines, they are complaining, in the words of one lawyer, that the guidelines are ""almost Talmudic in the nicety of their distinctions."" **********""You issue guidelines to be just that, to show the boundaries,"" said Stephen Paskoff, a former E.E.O.C. lawyer who now teaches companies how to follow workplace law. ""Guidelines are supposed to simplify and add a degree of clarity. These add a degree of complexity and a degree of risk."" **********At the very least, the guidelines appear to require employers to tread carefully around employment history and to be precise with language. While they may ask if a candidate can perform a job ""with or without reasonable accommodation,"" they may not proceed to the next obvious question, what accommodation is necessary. And the employer may not follow up on information volunteered by the candidate. ""It's O.K. to ask how someone would do something, but if you do it in the wrong words you're in trouble,"" said Christopher G. Bell, also a former E.E.O.C. lawyer, who is now a partner in Washington at Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman. **********""MY fear is that human resource professionals will find the guidelines so confusing and threatening that they'll simply decide it's safer not to interview anyone with disabilities,"" Mr. Bell said. **********If they do that, says the E.E.O.C., they will clearly be violating the law. ""There's no question about that. It's a slam dunk,"" said David K. Fram, an E.E.O.C. policy lawyer in Washington who worked on the guidelines. ""If an employer screens out people with disabilities because they don't want to deal with it, that violates fundamental law."" **********Some disabled-rights groups argue that the history of discrimination against people with disabilities -- especially ""hidden"" disabilities like epilepsy -- is being forgotten in the current controversy about the guidelines. ""It is a very well-documented history that Congress heard about,"" when it debated the legislation, said Arlene Mayerson, directing attorney of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund in Berkeley, Calif. Congress deliberately created a two-tier hiring process, separating the determination of qualifications from the question of accommodation. ""Maybe employers do want to know for good reasons, but you'd basically be nullifying that first stage. The idea is to protect people from discrimination based on their need for reasonable accommodation."" **********Employers are allowed to ask candidates to explain or demonstrate how they would perform a job, the commission points out. And once the job has been offered, employers may require the candidate to take a medical examination, which may reveal an acceptable disability-related reason to withdraw the job offer. The definition of ""reasonable accommodation"" is negotiable and usually requires more common sense than expense. **********Employers will most likely have to train their employees in the nuances of the law, the E.E.O.C. acknowledges, even though it incorporated several examples into the guidelines and tried to write them in plain English. The necessity for training, it says, is not unique to the A.D.A. ""Frankly, that comes with a lot of new laws,"" Mr. Fram said. ""In the 1960's, employers didn't want to comply with race and sex discrimination laws."""

But today there was mostly silence, punctuated occasionally by the murmur of passing police patrols. **********More than 150 restaurants, cafes, antique stores -- even the new Pizza Hut -- in Warsaw's Old Town remained closed in a weekend protest against organized crime and the police force's inability to restrain it.  Business owners in the city's historic quarter have been threatened with violence in recent weeks unless they paid protection money to one of Warsaw's crime organizations. **********In an open letter to President Lech Walesa on Friday, owners of the shops and restaurants demanded that law and order be restored. **********The extortionists, a group of 30 armed men, have demanded monthly payments ranging from $500 to $7,000, business owners said. Gangsters visited some owners at their homes and, in one case, threatened to cut off the hand of one man's daughter if he failed to pay up. **********This week the mobsters stepped up the pressure further, attacking three restaurant operators and a French tourist and vandalizing six establishments. The owners decided to fight back with a shutdown. **********""We knew that our only chance was to stick together and try to mobilize the public,"" said Roman Popowski, the owner of a restaurant specializing in traditional Polish cuisine. **********""There's more at stake here than the well-being of a few businessmen,"" he said, acknowledging that the shops would lose thousands of dollars in weekend business. ""If the authorities allow this to happen only a few hundred meters from the Presidential Palace, what does that say about the rule of law in this country?"" **********Mr. Popowski has not gone to the police. Law enforcement officials have not received a single official complaint from any of the Old Town businessmen. ""Owners are afraid to testify,"" said Andzej Teresczuk, who owns a one-hour photo service near Mr. Popowski's restaurant. **********Businessmen say the police have been unable to protect plaintiffs. ""The mob has its own people in the police,"" an Old Town jeweler told the daily Gazeta Wyborcza. **********Corruption scandals have steadily eroded public confidence in law enforcement officials here. In one case, reported by the daily newspaper Dziennik Baltycki, a businessman from the port city of Gdynia turned to the police after gangsters demanded protection money. His complaint was recorded on at the police station; the next day, the extortionists returned to his home with the cassette, saying the police worked for them. **********Ryszard Rychlik, a prosecutor who leads an organized crime task force recently created by the Justice Ministry, said the Polish criminal groups that surfaced in the late 1980's have become more organized, violent and brazen. **********Gangs that previously limited their trade to activities like smuggling cigarettes now routinely kill their targets and are smuggling drugs into Western Europe, law enforcement officials say. **********Through the drug trade, local gangs are also forging ties with the Russian-speaking organizations that already control Poland's major prostitution rings. Last month the F.B.I. announced plans to open an office in Warsaw to help combat the spread of Russian crime organizations. **********Prosecutors here say they have also enlisted the help of American law enforcement officials in drafting a tough new criminal code that will be submitted to Parliament. Current Polish laws do not permit sting operations or offer immunity to witnesses for the prosecution, so it can be difficult to prove that crimes have been committed. **********Mr. Teresczuk, the operator of the one-hour photo shop, said Warsaw's police chief had promised to deploy permanently in the Old Town 80 officers specially trained to fight organized crime groups."

""Currency traders are quick to sell when they sense weakness like this."" **********In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6872 marks, down from 1.7001 marks on Tuesday. It was little changed at 103.05 Japanese yen, down from 103.20 yen. **********Rising interest rates often buoy the dollar by making dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Instead, slumping stocks and bonds kept the dollar under wraps since February, when the Fed pushed up the Federal funds rate on overnight loans to banks. The Fed raised it to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent on Monday. It was at 3 percent at the start of the year. **********""The dollar is getting hurt because there's so much capital flowing out of the U.S.,"" said Frank Pusateri, a foreign-exchange adviser at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ""People are scared out of their minds about what the Fed is going to do next."" German Rate Cut **********Even interest-rate cuts in Germany failed to lift the dollar from its torpor. The dollar languished after the Bundesbank cut its two-week securities repurchase rate to 5.58 percent from 5.70 percent. ""Repos"" are the most important means of refinancing for German banks, accounting for two-thirds of their short-term borrowing. **********""People are wary of owning dollars,"" in part because the currency failed to rally with so many economic conditions on its side, said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at NBD Bank in Detroit. **********Because German interest rates are still higher than American rates, it costs traders money to hold dollars against marks while they wait for the dollar currency to rally. Each day the dollar fails to rise, more traders sell off their dollar holdings. **********Slumping European stock and bond prices also helped the mark gain against most major currencies today, traders said. Investors often buy the mark, a stable currency that offers high interest rates, when other markets falter."

Live in one state and work in another? Own a second home in a second state? Real life is anything but tidy, and situations like these are pocked with tax pitfalls. **********Take residency conflicts. No matter what you consider your primary residence, a state might call you a resident if you own a home there. **********Herbert M. Paul, a New York tax lawyer, explained how New York handles the matter. ""If you have a residence in New York and in another state as well, and spend more than 183 days in New York,"" he said, ""you are considered a statutory resident and all of your income is subject to New York tax."" This is no small money matter. The top marginal tax rate in New York State is 7.875 percent, with New York City levying an additional 4.46 percent. The top rate in New Jersey is 7 percent, and in Connecticut it's 4.5 percent, though neither has municipal taxes. **********Because the Northeast is generally a high-tax area, many people with two homes prefer to list their domicile -- essentially their true and fixed abode -- in a state with low, or no, income tax. States that have no personal income tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. **********By establishing a domicile elsewhere, these people can have their unearned income taxed elsewhere, and their salary apportioned to two states if business is conducted in both. **********To do this, people are advised to shed their New York bank accounts and other ties to the state. The burden of proof is on the taxpayer, said Robert Wood, a tax partner at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. ""You not only have to embrace a new domicile,"" he said, ""but also demonstrate that you have abandoned your existing domicile."" **********For people who earn income in a state other than where they live, the biggest pitfall is paying tax twice on the same income. Typically, people must pay income tax in the state where they are employed, and that tax is withheld from salary. These people can claim a credit of that amount in the state where they live. **********But most states will not give workers a credit for taxes paid to another state. Income is generally taxed where it is earned. **********""There are a lot of agreements among states, though, saying, 'If you don't tax my residents, I won't tax your residents,' "" said Ronald Alt a senior research associate of the Federation of Tax Administrators. **********New Jersey and Pennsylvania have such an agreement. If you live in Pennsylvania and work in New Jersey, your income is taxed by Pennsylvania and is not subject to tax by New Jersey. If taxes are improperly withheld by an employer in New Jersey, a taxpayer can apply for a refund. **********Retirees have their own set of stumbling blocks. Some states, including New York, tax the pensions of nonresidents when the pensions are based on work performed in the state. ""Other states have repealed or are not enforcing such laws,"" said Sally Adams, editor of State Tax Review, a newsletter published by CCH Inc. in Riverwoods, Ill. **********In New York, the first $20,000 of pension or other retirement income is excluded from state income tax. Also excluded is a pension paid to a non-resident in the form of an annuity, which pays money at regular intervals at a predetermined rate. **********A final note: authorities in New York and elsewhere are aggressively pursuing people whom they suspect shift domiciles to avoid paying taxes. ""If you are planning to change your residence,"" Mr. Paul said, ""you should be able to substantiate where you are every day of the year."" SWITCHING A DOMICILe **********SOMEONE wishing to establish a domicile in Florida for tax purposes has to abandon his domicile in New York. Herbert M. Paul, a New York tax lawyer, suggested the following steps: *********** Register to vote in Florida and remove your name from voting rolls in New York. *********** Open Florida bank accounts and close New York accounts. *********** File Federal income tax returns from Florida. *********** File a declaration of domicile with your Florida county. *********** Be sure the deed and mortgage of your Florida home reflects the Florida address. *********** Drop your New York driver's license for a Florida one. *********** Replace club affiliations in New York with ones in Florida. *********** Use a Florida address for auto registration and insurance. *********** Make sure statements from lawyers, doctors and stockbrokers go to Florida. *********** Minimize time in New York, and keep a diary."

It was the fourth piece of good inflation news this week that the bond market shrugged off. The others were favorable reports on the consumer and producer price indexes and March retail sales. **********Next week, which will have no market-moving statistic of the magnitude of this week's, may be even more listless, analysts say. **********The stock market generally followed the bond market this week, but for the most part many stock traders stayed on the sidelines, as indicated by lower-than-average trading volume earlier in the week. **********Yesterday's volume on the New York Stock Exchange of 309.3 million shares exceeded this year's daily average of 304 million shares. But traders may still be sitting on their hands. **********Analysts noted that yesterday's volume was far less than the ""triple witching hour"" volume of 390 million shares in March, when three kinds of options, instead of two as yesterday, expired. Little 'Witching' Urgency **********There is often a use-it-or-lose-it urgency when these options contracts expire, usually at 4 P.M., that inflates trading volume and contributes to price swings. But little of that urgency was seen yesterday. **********""People are content to sit back and wait,"" said William R. Rothe , a managing director for Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. ""The exception is if a company reports earnings that are below expectations. Then we take it out and shoot it."" **********When the Fed's capacity utilization index came in slightly less than expected, implying low inflation, the Dow Jones industrial average lifted for the first half-hour of trading. But in afternoon trading, the Dow rose as much as 16 points, then plunged 23 points before settling at 3,661.47, down 1.78 points. For the week, the Dow lost about 13 points. **********The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose and fell in a similar way before closing down 0.20 point at 446.18.

Declining stocks barely outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,108 to 1,029. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.97 point, to 438.29. **********Philip H. Smyth, a market analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., detected a large ""sell"" program, which began operating at 3:35 P.M. and involved 300 stocks and some 7 million shares. But by 3:41 P.M., when the computer program stopped, normal market action began to immediately lift shares prices. Nasdaq Stabilizes **********The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, stabilized in Thursday's and yesterday's trading after sharp selloffs. The chart for Nasdaq trading ""looks like the cliffs in Acapulco -- straight down,"" said Mr. Rothe, who is in charge of Nasdaq trading for Alex. Brown. **********As for what will happen next week in Nasdaq trading, no one knows for sure. Mr. Brown said. ""More so than other stock groups,"" he said, ""each O-T-C stock trades in an individual pattern."" **********U.S. Healthcare was the most actively traded stock yesterday at 10.8 million shares. It rose 1, to 47. Much of U.S. Healthcare's activity was probably because of the company's inclusion, starting Monday, in the S.& P. 500 index. Many mutual funds and other large investors buy shares of stocks in major indexes, like the S.& P. 500. U.S. Healthcare replaces Grumman, which is being acquired by Northrop. **********Intel was the second most actively traded stock yesterday at 7.4 million shares, but managed to arrest much of its stock slide. It closed yesterday at 59 3/4, down 1/8. But for the week, it was down nearly $10. **********Three companies -- I.B.M., Cyrix, and SGS-Thomson Microelectronics of France -- announced plans this week to make Intel-compatible computer chips. Analysts interpreted this as the slow but certain death of Intel's near-monopoly on the microprocessors that go into personal computers. **********In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 177.43 points yesterday, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 20,164.63 points.

As these nations' stock markets soared last year, Americans poured more than $9 billion into mutual funds that invest in them. **********And in the mutual fund business, every company wants to run a fund that invests in these often quirky little stock markets. According to Lipper Analytical Services, the number of emerging-markets equity funds has grown to 40, from just 22 a year ago. And more are in the offing. **********The combination of overexcited investors and inexperienced managers is worrying some old-timers in the emerging-markets game. A big concern: fund investors can get out at any time, but the funds themselves can't.  This year, while some emerging markets have soared -- Brazil has jumped more than 60 percent in the last six weeks -- many of last year's success stories have tumbled, including Hong Kong, which is down 3 percent after doubling last year. Turkey, Thailand and Malaysia have suffered double-digit losses.  When such markets plummet (and given their volatility, the experts say, it's only a matter of time), American investors may find it hard to bail out of their emerging-markets funds at an acceptable price -- and maybe at all. **********""There will come a day when everybody's heading for the exits at the same time, and there won't be an exit,"" said Mark J. Mobius, one of the founders of emerging-markets investing and a fund manager for the Franklin/Templeton group. He is barnstorming the country right now, preaching about the minimum time horizon he thinks investors must have: five years. **********Until recently, impatient investors did not find their way into emerging markets. Most such investing occurred through private partnerships or closed-end mutual funds, which don't let shareholders take their money out (just sell their shares to other investors). **********But as some hitherto obscure stock markets heated up in 1993 -- Turkey zoomed over 200 percent, Malaysia, 145 percent and the Philippines, 134 percent -- the mutual-fund business jumped on the bandwagon. **********One year ago, the Boston behemoth Fidelity Investments changed the name of a tiny fund to Fidelity Emerging Markets. By the end of the year, the fund had $1.9 billion in its coffers. Despite a sharp selloff in many emerging markets in January, which has put the fund in the red this year, its assets now top $2 billion -- almost as big as Sri Lanka's entire stock market. **********""There's a danger when you have a lot of demand chasing a relatively limited amount of supply,"" said David Warren, executive vice president of Rowe Price Fleming in London, which runs T. Rowe Price's international funds. ""An investor starts closing his or her eyes and buying anything, and secondly, it does often attract, one might say, not the right kind of money."" **********Emerging-market investment gurus remain enthusiastic about the long-term outlook for countries whose economies are growing far faster than America's or Western Europe's. But they concede that they are investing in stock markets, and that markets are vulnerable to all kinds of problems.  For example, the Hungarian stock market levitated about 80 percent in January as Western investors plunged in. It then lost almost 20 percent of its value in a matter of days, and has now bounced back a bit. According to a report by Bloomberg Business News, the exchange plans to institute some reforms -- such as trading for more than an hour and a half a day -- to cut volatility. **********The biggest victim of its own success right now may be India. Managers report that it takes weeks, if not months, to buy or sell a stock, and requires a mountain of paperwork.  Sometimes it is just impossible; over the last few years, Indian stock markets have closed for days because of strikes, explosions or scandals. **********India may be extreme, but it is not alone. A recent survey of investment managers by the Chicago consulting firm Ennis, Knupp & Associates, found that many managers are so concerned about liquidity that they have held back on investing in South Africa, Indonesia, Taiwan, Chile, India and Turkey. Liquidity -- the ability to buy or sell a stock quickly and easily, without driving prices up or down, and without having to worry about back-office errors or exorbitant fees -- remains a problem in many other markets, too. **********""In almost every emerging market, typically the systems are very slow, and there's a lot of paper that can be lost,"" said Daniel J. Duane, who runs Prudential's global funds. ""Inevitably, there's a lot of foot-dragging on settlement, especially when someone has to pay you money."" **********Even relatively liquid markets, like Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, experience wild swings as government policies change and as foreign money surges in and out. Which explains why the Fidelity Southeast Asia Fund, which opened its doors last April and soared 65 percent by the end of the year, has since dropped almost 10 percent. **********Just as troublesome for short-term investors, some countries, including Chile, India, South Korea and Taiwan, restrict foreign investors' ability to take their money home. **********Old hands in the emerging markets have lived through these problems before. They use several methods to cut their risk, including broad diversification, high levels of cash and big holdings of easily sold securities. **********And most of the big fund groups have arranged to borrow money from banks (or, in Fidelity's case, from its other funds) so that they will not be forced to dump stocks wholesale, sending markets into free fall. Dick Haberman, Fidelity's head of international equities, notes that his company's fund holds more than 500 stocks in 30 countries, and that his company, which employs 50 analysts outside the United States, has been investing in Asia since 1969. **********But a lot of new players have not had that experience, which is why Mr. Duane of Prudential said, ""In a way, you have to worry about your competitors."" He said that if one emerging-markets fund ran into trouble, it might cause a run on all such funds, as happened in Britain in 1987. **********Many companies that do not yet offer an emerging-markets fund plan to add one this year. The chief investment officer of one such firm, Paul Stephens of Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco, said many of the people available to run such funds had only two or three years of experience. **********The mania for emerging markets has grown so strong that Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley strategist responsible for fueling much of it, last month wrote a satirical report on a man he called Jim the Trigger, who was primed to take advantage of all the ""dummies with phony accents and striped shirts with white collars who think Turkey borders Malaysia"" but have ""portfolios that were up 70 percent last year."" **********His plan? To create his own country, make it emerge and reap the profits. When it's time to end the scam, he will stage a revolution; investors will be left holding the bag. **********Several money managers call the research report the funniest they have ever read. But if Mr. Biggs proves prescient, as he has before, mutual fund investors will not be laughing."

That would leave only one of the plant's four reactors closed -- the one destroyed eight years ago in the catastrophe that made Chernobyl synonymous with nuclear disaster. **********Western scientists and government nuclear experts fear that as long as the flawed and unstable reactors at Chernobyl operate, the danger remains that another disaster could spew radioactivity across much of Europe. **********The agreement worked out in April between the United States and Ukraine was significant because it was the first time a former Soviet republic had bowed to Western pressure to shut down such reactors. **********Western leaders are to review the issue next month when they gather in Italy for a Group of Seven meeting, and the White House is scrambling to persuade Ukraine to stay its promised course. But the task has already prompted a battle within the Administration over what price the West should pay to finally close the dangerous plant completely. **********The State Department approach, with cost estimates ranging into the hundreds of millions of dollars, calls for the West to help Ukraine complete at least three Soviet-style nuclear reactors now under construction. But the Energy Department strongly opposes the idea, saying the West should not help start up reactors that critics regard as flawed. **********To compensate for the energy Ukraine would lose if Chernobyl is shut down, Energy Department officials have urged that the West help Ukraine to become more energy-efficient and to build plants that use renewable resources like wind and solar energy. **********Both France and Germany favor completing the three reactors under construction, raising the possibility of a dispute within the Group of Seven, the world's major industrial democracies. Aides to President Clinton say there will be little time at the Group of Seven meeting, from July 8 to 10 in Naples, for any last-minute resolution of differences. **********But with memories still vivid of the failure of past calls for Chernobyl's demise, American officials say they are determined that the Naples meeting make clear not only that the major industrial nations want the plant closed, but that they are willing to make it worthwhile for Ukraine to close it. **********In an interview last week, Deputy Energy Secretary William H. White, who worked out the agreement with Ukraine to shut Chernobyl ""at the earliest possible date,"" expressed some urgency about sealing the deal. **********""I think the Group of Seven will push for a plan that will detail and outline the steps Ukraine should take in closing down Chernobyl, and what would be planned in terms of the role of the West,"" Mr. White said. ""And I believe there are many who will want the communique to discuss specific timetables."" The Unstable Graphite **********All four reactors at Chernobyl, including the two still running, are of a design known as R.B.M.K., notorious since the 1986 disaster for a reliance on graphite instead of water to assist in the nuclear reaction. Graphite is inherently unstable. **********Ukraine had once promised to shut down the plant altogether by 1993. But in October, Russia began to reduce shipments of oil and gas to Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Parliament voted to keep the plant in operation. **********The new pledge in April was made by Vice Prime Minister Valery Shmarov, who signed an agreement saying Chernobyl would be closed once the country ""reached a balance in the energy system and found resources to take the plant out of operation."" **********But American officials now say the ""commitment in principle"" appears far from solid. Many Ukrainian officials are convinced that nuclear power represents the only realistic alternative to dependence on Russian gas, and they have drafted ambitious plans to build their energy capacity. **********Although the two reactors still operating at Chernobyl produce just 1,700 megawatts of power, about 3 percent of Ukraine's needs, officials there are suggesting that they are not prepared to shut them down until five new reactors supplying 5,000 megawatts are in operation. **********Perhaps even more troubling, Administration officials say, are indications that Ukraine is preparing to restart Chernobyl Unit 2, which has been out of service since the 1991 fire. **********A copy of President Kravchuk's directive, made available this week by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has expressed alarm at Chernobyl's continued operation, lists the reactor as one that Ukraine should ""bring on line"" in 1995. **********In seeking to block that plan, Administration officials say they have agreed that the West should at least pledge to upgrade any new reactors to meet Western safety standards. In looking ahead to the Group of Seven meeting, they also say there is consensus within the Administration that a communique being drafted this week by an Italian-led working group is too permissive in declaring that Chernobyl should not be closed until Ukraine's domestic energy demands can be satisfied at economical prices. **********Administration officials say the dispute between the State Department and the Energy Department leaves unclear how far the Administration would go in promising Western aid to complete or build Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in Ukraine. The two departments plan more meetings next week. The Czech Example **********The Administration has already approved $317 million in loan guarantees to allow the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to complete two such reactors at Temelin, in the Czech Republic. At the State Department, advocates of adopting a similar approach in Ukraine contend that the advanced VVER-1000 design of the reactors at Temelin makes them a relatively low safety risk. **********But Energy Department officials opposed to that plan contend that the West should refrain from any connection to the Temelin reactors, in part because the International Atomic Energy Agency has said they too suffer from design problems. The energy officials say the West should instead make an aggressive effort to persuade Ukraine that the power lost by closing Chernobyl could be replaced through non-nuclear means. **********""If the international community is willing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on some form of energy supply for Ukraine,"" a senior Administration official said this week, ""it might as well make sure it explores the energy-efficiency and renewable-energy options before plunging into this new territory of building brand-new reactors or reactors that still have a substantial amount of work toward completion."""

Stocks gained slightly, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 13.80 points, to 3,863.04.  [ Page D8. ]  Long-term interest rates edged up in the bond market, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond at 7.84 percent.  [ Page D15. ] **********The Fed issued only a brief statement after today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which controls the interest rates that banks pay to borrow money overnight. ""The F.O.M.C. meeting ended at 1 P.M.,"" the statement said. ""There will be no further announcements."" **********A virtually identical statement followed the committee's meeting in early July. At that time the committee also chose to leave short-term interest rates unchanged, while giving Mr. Greenspan explicit permission to raise them in the ensuing weeks. **********Mr. Greenspan did not do so, and the committee raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting, on Aug. 16. Today's meeting was the first one since then. **********The Fed's apparent decision not to raise short-term interest rates today makes it likely that the interest rates that Americans pay on their credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity loans will also remain unchanged for the time being. **********The central bank has repeatedly raised rates because of concerns that the pace of inflation, now slightly less than 3 percent a year, may soon accelerate. Some members of the open market committee fear higher inflation may lie in the future because factories are operating closer to full capacity than they have in five years, a situation that could lead people to start bidding up the prices of scarce labor and materials. **********Other members of the committee worry that the Fed may have supplied too much credit to banks last year, increasing the amount of money in circulation and allowing Americans to bid up the price of gold and commodities. Both methods of analysis have produced similar conclusions in Fed officials that interest rates should rise. **********Those officials who look at whether factories are operating at full capacity -- a group that is believed to include Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman, and possibly Mr. Greenspan -- may have looked at figures issued today by the Conference Board, a New York-based research group supported by businesses, as evidence that the economy is not going to overheat soon. The Conference Board announced that its figures showed consumer confidence fell for the third consecutive month, suggesting that consumers may not be bidding up the prices for the limited output of factories any time soon. **********Until this year, the Fed never issued any announcement at the end of such policy meetings, leaving investors to guess its intentions from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's purchases and sales of Treasury bonds every morning. While the open market committee could theoretically have decided on an interest-rate increase this morning but decided not to announce it, this seems unlikely given the strong support that many Fed officials are expressing privately in favor of announcing interest-rate increases. **********The increase in interest rates on Aug. 16 was the fifth this year, following increases on Feb. 4, March 22, April 18 and May 17. Taken together, these increases have pushed up the Federal funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 3 percent. **********The Fed has also raised the discount rate, which banks pay to borrow money overnight from the Fed, by half a percentage point on May 17 and again on Aug. 16. The two changes have increased the discount rate to 4 percent from 3 percent at the beginning of this year. **********John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that he thought Mr. Greenspan was likely to raise interest rates before the Nov. 15 meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, particularly if the Labor Department reports strong growth in employment in September. The department's report will be released on Oct. 7. **********While the White House took no position before today's meeting on whether interest rates should rise, some officials, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, have said repeatedly in recent days that they do not foresee any sharp rise in inflation in the coming months. **********The Fed has come under slowly mounting pressure from businesses to slow the pace of interest rate increases or stop them entirely. **********An informal survey by the National Association of Manufacturers of 81 of the 115 executives who attended a conference here on Saturday found that 40 wanted the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. Another 29 executives wanted the Fed to wait until later this year or early next year before raising rates further, while only 12 executives wanted the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates soon. **********Jerry Jasinowski, who was the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Policy in the Carter Administration and is now the president of the Washington-based trade group, welcomed today's silence from the Fed. ""I think it is fairly obvious that they just decided, wisely, to take a wait-and-see attitude because they don't have enough information about inflation or growth to make a decision at this point,"" he said."

Suit On Towers," **********The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges yesterday against Marvin E. Basson, a certified public accountant in Upper Brookville, L.I., who served as the outside auditor for the Towers Financial Corporation. **********The S.E.C. charges, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, said Mr. Basson knew, or should have known, that large parts of the Towers books were falsified. **********While Mr. Basson was the auditor, from 1987 through 1992, the charges said, ""Towers ballooned into a gigantic Ponzi scheme, issuing ever-larger amounts of debt."" It was able to do so, the S.E.C. said, because Mr. Basson's audits ""were a sham."" **********Towers, a collection agency, has since filed for bankruptcy, with its founder, Steven Hoffenberg, facing criminal and civil charges of fraud. **********Mr. Basson's lawyer, Harold McGuire of New York, declined to comment. **********The S.E.C. charges laid out a string of allegations, all previously made public, regarding fraudulent accounting entries. In one case, it said, Towers purchased from Southwestern Bell the right to collect $29 million in overdue bills for Yellow Pages advertising, which another collection agency had concluded were uncollectible.

A Crucial Aid Route **********But the United Nations military command in Bosnia is adamant that the airport must be opened to bring in both troops and equipment for its own battalions in the area. The airport's opening would also allow the United Nations to avoid the tortuous, sometimes impassable, two-day drive north from the Croatian coast that is now the only way to bring food, medicine and other aid to the 130,000 people of Tuzla. **********The battle of wills is an important one. Having declared the airport open, Mr. Akashi is in a very embarrassing position now that three weeks have passed without a single flight. **********At a time when the Bosnian Government has demanded his resignation for having allowed some Serbian tanks to cross the NATO exclusion zone at Sarajevo, the effective closing of Tuzla airport again raises the issue of whether the Serbs are able to dictate conditions to Mr. Akashi.  'This Airport Is Safe' **********""I understand Mr. Akashi's desire to go softly,"" Col. Tom Johansson of Norway, commander of the United Nations force at the airfield, said today. ""But I say this airport is safe, and I would expect it to open within a week."" **********Colonel Johansson had just returned from a meeting with Mr. Akashi in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, on the subject of the airport, a former Yugoslav army base about eight miles southeast of Tuzla. With a staff of about 400 at the airport -- including firefighters, air traffic controllers, mechanics and a meteorologist -- the colonel is under considerable pressure to insure that flights resume soon. Unless the airport is open, his personnel are wasting both their time and United Nations money. **********Certainly, the airport looks ready for traffic. Driving down the mile-and-a-half-long runway, now in impeccable condition, Lieut. Col. Rolf Noel, a Norwegian flight controller, said that the runway came close to NATO standards and that flights were urgently needed to bring in much needed equipment, including radios, binoculars, navigation instruments and toilets. **********""Otherwise,"" he said, ""I am going home.""  Shelled Four Times in April **********The problem lies in the mountains to the east of the runway, and particularly a peak known by the United Nations forces as Sugar Hill because of its resemblance to Sugar Loaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro. The Serbs control this peak, whose real name is Mount Vis, and from it they are able to shell the airfield at will. **********Angered by pinprick NATO bombing at Gorazde, the Serbs underlined this point by shelling the airport four times in April. More than 20 shells fell in or close to the airfield in the attacks, the last of which occurred on April 30. Nobody was injured, but at one point Colonel Johansson was sent diving into a ditch beside one of the airport roads. **********Colonel Johansson and other senior United Nations military officials in Tuzla are in favor of resolving this problem by imposing a 20-kilometer NATO exclusion zone around Tuzla, similar to those in force at Sarajevo and Gorazde. **********Mount Vis is about 18 kilometers from the town, so such a decision would oblige the Serbs to move their heavy guns."

I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., said last week that the company did not plan to use proceeds from a $3.4 billion bond sale to buy back stock from the Seagram Company. **********Mr. Woolard said a notice by Du Pont to the Securities and Exchange Commission recently that it planned to sell the bonds was a ""routine shelf registration"" that would allow the company to refinance as needed ""over the next couple of years."" **********Wall Street analysts have speculated that the Bronfman family, which controls Seagram and owns a 24.2 percent stake in Du Pont, would sell some of that stake to finance a takeover of Time Warner Inc. **********The Montreal-based Seagram has been gradually increasing its stake in Time Warner and now owns 14.9 percent."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/14/business/economic-scene-smoking-s-economic-cost-isn-t-a-good-argument-for-higher-taxes.html,Peter Passell,1994-07-14,,862,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Economic Scene; Smoking's economic cost isn't a good argument for higher taxes.,Economic Scene; Smoking's economic cost isn't a good argument for higher taxes.," **********LAST week the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta confirmed what few had doubted. Smoking-related diseases have ""an enormous economic impact,"" wrote the editors of the centers' Weekly Report -- the equivalent, they estimated, of $2 a pack in medical costs alone. **********But the agency was careful not to link these remarkable numbers to the case for higher cigarette taxes, and perhaps wisely so: Few economists are convinced that the link is strong enough to bear the weight of the argument. For while the total costs of smoking are undoubtedly humungous, said Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard, most are borne by the smokers themselves. ""You just can't justify higher taxes on cigarettes by the damage done by cigarettes to nonsmokers,"" he said. **********This latest Government report is by all accounts based on careful research. Sufficient data collected from some 35,000 adults allowed statisticians to untangle the effects of smoking from the myriad other influences on health: age, race, income, insurance coverage, education, obesity, even willingness to take risks as evidenced by seat belt use. When refigured at 1993 prices, estimated medical bills for smokers came to $50 billion a year, or $2.06 a pack. The costs borne by the public -- mostly Medicaid and Medicare -- came to 89 cents a pack. **********That latter number is likely to figure in a suit by the State of Florida, which is attempting to recover medical outlays for treating smokers from the cigarette makers. And it is bound to turn heads among those looking for a palatable way to pay for health care reform. For as anyone who suffered through Econ 101 knows, taxes that offset ""externalities"" -- costs that aren't covered in prices -- actually increase the efficiency of markets. **********The catch here is that a full accounting must also include the savings from smoking. Yes, savings: the reduced cost of private pensions, Social Security and nursing home care for smokers who die before their time. And probably the most complete estimate of the ""benefits"" as well as the costs was made in 1989 by a group of scholars under the auspices of the RAND Corporation. **********The study, led by Willard Manning and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, put the costs not borne by smokers themselves at about 15 cents a pack. Medical bills for smokers and nonsmokers alike have since risen sharply. So have estimates of the costs of passive smoking -- a classic case of a cost not borne by the buyer or seller. And even these newer estimates, said Ken Warner, an economist at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, neglect the nuisance cost of coping with other people's smoke. **********But by the same token, the avoided costs on the pensions and nursing home fees of smokers have risen, too. And Mr. Newhouse, one of the authors of the RAND study, argues that the conceivable magnitude of passive smoking is unlikely to exceed a few cents a pack. Hence it should not be surprising that Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman, economists at the Congressional Research Service, concluded that nonsmokers' costs of smoking were ""too small to justify either current cigarette taxes (averaging 50 cents a pack) or the proposed tax increase."" **********That is not the end of the argument, however. ""We are not talking about widgets,"" Mr. Warner said. ""We're talking about an addiction formed in childhood"" -- an addiction most smokers later come to regret. Thus the idea that the only justification for limiting the right to smoke is nonsmokers' costs seems strained. **********Indeed, Mr. Newhouse sees a case for cigarette taxes unrelated to the harm suffered by others. A fat tax increase, he said, might deter young smokers -- a group inclined to puff first and think later. Yet it would have relatively little effect on the habits of older smokers, and would thus not distort free choice. **********This latter point does not sit well with Mr. Zimmerman. Smokers, he notes, are on average poorer than nonsmokers. Hence, while the tax might not change consumption by confirmed addicts very much, it would certainly burden people who already bear more than their share of life's economic woes. **********What, then, would Mr. Zimmerman do to prevent teen-agers from being hooked by Joe Camel? ""If we were really serious about it,"" he says, ""we'd stop sales of cigarettes from vending machines"" where children have access. In general, he argues, ""the biggest payoff at the lowest cost"" would come through tough enforcement of laws against under-age smoking. **********It is easy to understand why economists are not rushing to correct the impression that smokers are a burden to society. Most, after all, would like to combat addiction among teen-agers, and most would like to find a popular way to finance broader health care coverage. **********In the end, though, one still has to wonder whether the ends justify the means. More pointedly, one might wonder whether the majority of Americans' enthusiasm for better health is so shallow that they would buy it only if a minority (smokers) is forced to foot the bill."

Can a Dealmaker Who Never Stops Run a Company Too?"," **********ROBERT F. GREENHILL loves cliffhangers. On vacation, that means skiing his way off an isolated peak where a helicopter dropped him in the Canadian Rockies, or canoeing from above the Arctic Circle after being plunked down by a seaplane. In his work, at Smith Barney Shearson, it means swinging an eleventh-hour deal when all hope seems to be lost. **********Mr. Greenhill has clearly been in his element this month. Two weeks ago, time was running out for Viacom, his client, in its struggle to acquire Paramount Communications. **********As Mr. Greenhill's side saw it, its best chance of outbidding QVC Network was to first help Viacom take over Blockbuster Video, putting Blockbuster's full coffers at Viacom's disposal. Paramount had set a deadline of 5 P.M. on Friday, Jan. 7, for new bids, and in the final 72 hours the 57-year-old dealmaker shuttled between one billionaire and another, between hotels and offices in Manhattan, all on a few hours' sleep. **********The last hurdle was to persuade Blockbuster that accepting Viacom stock was as good as cash. With less than two hours to go, a deal was reached with the aid of an unusual arrangement developed by Mr. Greenhill and his team that guaranteed the stock's value. **********The merger was on, keeping Viacom's hopes alive. **********Late Friday, Mr. Greenhill's forces signed on for another wild ride: The firm will advise Federated Department Stores in its drive to gain control of R.H. Macy & Company. **********The investment banker's schedule Mr. Greenhill is maintaining is enough to overwhelm most people in short order. But for the last seven months he has held another job that has left many on Wall Street wondering how he can manage it all. As the chairman and chief executive of Smith Barney Shearson, he is expected to run an organization whose 11,000 brokers put it in a virtual tie with Merrill Lynch as the nation's largest securities firm. **********What most amazes his contemporaries on Wall Street is that, for all the responsibilities of his job as an executive, Mr. Greenhill is still acting an awful lot like an investment banker on the front lines of a deal. Those across the table from him late at night during the Viacom-Blockbuster negotiations were not chief executives but were people at lower levels. It's hard to imagine Daniel Tully, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, in such a position. **********Which leads to some questions a lot of people have been asking. After three decades of dealmaking at Morgan Stanley, will Mr. Greenhill really concentrate fully on the managerial and ceremonial duties of his new job? Is a rugged individualist like this one really suited to a job that requires a lot of time leading and organizing large groups of people? **********""He's incredibly and unbearably tenacious, and he won't let go of a deal,"" said Viacom's chief executive, Frank Biondi. But, Mr. Biondi added, ""I don't know how he's going to do both jobs unless he's found the 30-hour day."" **********A few months before taking the Smith Barney post, Mr. Greenhill was ousted from the presidency of Morgan Stanley over his handling -- or lack of handling -- of the minutiae of management. Now, in terms of personnel matters and paperwork, he is responsible for far more of it. His mission is to use the brokerage's size to transform Smith Barney Shearson from being largely a broker of stock into the most influential powerhouse on Wall Street and around the world. **********Mr. Greenhill says he is up to both tasks. ""We're going to be the best investment firm,"" the stocky, plain-speaking banker said recently in his office above Central Park. **********THUS far, at least, he seems to be off to a fast start. The Greenhill mystique is bringing over clients, like Viacom, that hope to see him work his magic. And underwriting business that in the past would probably have gone elsewhere is now coming to the company because Mr. Greenhill is there. Smith Barney has stepped up several notches in the underwriting and trading rankings. **********The next company that Thomas H. Lee, the red-hot corporate collector, is offering to the public will be underwritten by Mr. Greenhill. And Jon Rotenstreich, chief executive of TIG Holdings -- whose initial offering, handled by Morgan Stanley, was one of last year's largest -- will take financing needs to Smith Barney because of his admiration for Mr. Greenhill. **********And it's not just the new clients. Smith Barney has hired several dozen investment bankers, a number of them at premium prices. This year calls for hiring twice as many bankers as last year, raising money for a merchant-banking fund starting in two weeks, focusing on underwriting in businesses like real estate investment trusts and telecommunications, and opening or expanding offices in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America and developing a European presence. **********But for all the talk of new beginnings, Smith Barney now has only one company scheduled for the initial public offering market: Plantronics, a headset maker looking for public money to pay off debts taken on in a leveraged buyout. **********And there are gaping holes in the ranks of Smith Barney Shearson's advancing forces -- like the capability of financing Fortune 500 companies. Leaders in the investment banking elite are sniffing, ""Boutique."" **********Nor can internal pressures be dismissed. Mr. Greenhill was hired by Sanford Weill -- his longtime friend, Connecticut neighbor, tennis partner and client. Mr. Weill, who is chairman of The Travelers Inc., Smith Barney's parent, has built a successful financial career in large measure by slashing costs and laying off employees -- as in last year's Shearson-Smith Barney merger -- not by driving costs up in expensive recruiting and market-share gambits. He will want future profits to be big, quick and certain -- something high overhead rarely allows. But Mr. Greenhill is accustomed to running a business where cost cutting is not paramount. **********At Morgan Stanley, where he worked 30 years, Mr. Greenhill ""broke the sound barrier"" of mergers and acquisitions by setting up a line of business devoted to that field, and by helping to make hostile takeover attempts acceptable among blue-chip corporations, said his main rival, Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres. **********The Paramount bid had its roots simply as a pitch to Mr. Biondi in mid-1992 to get more business for Morgan Stanley from Viacom. Mr. Greenhill pursued the Paramount idea at an annual September gathering he puts on for corporate chieftains at John Gardner's tennis camp in Carmel, Calif. Among the regulars: Mr. Weill and Viacom's billionaire owner, Sumner Redstone. **********Mr. Redstone wanted Paramount, and Mr. Greenhill persuaded him that he could get talks started. Several months later he arranged a meeting between Mr. Redstone and Paramount's chief, Martin Davis, whom Mr. Greenhill had advised in the past. When Mr. Redstone followed Mr. Greenhill to Smith Barney, it was a coup for the new chief executive. **********Four months working on the Paramount deal, plus the courtship of Blockbuster's billionaire chief, H. Wayne Huizenga, has put extreme demands on Mr. Greenhill. But there is no sign that he's feeling the strain. He prides himself on pushing straight ahead. **********A native of Minneapolis, Mr. Greenhill squeezed in two years in the Navy between earning a bachelor's degree from Yale and an M.B.A. from Harvard. The mix made him perfect Morgan Stanley material -- several chairmen during his years there were Navy, Harvard or Yale men -- and Mr. Greenhill rose quickly through the ranks. **********He will not talk about his departure from Morgan Stanley, only about what he is doing at Smith Barney -- and his management philosophy. ""You hire the best people,"" he said. ""Create value for clients. The rest takes care of itself."" **********Even his warmest admirers say Mr. Greenhill is not eloquent or complicated. He is private, unpretentious, serious, tough and untroubled by worries, and he has a quick, friendly laugh that serves to loosen up his formidable persona. **********Mr. Greenhill and his wife, Gayle, have been married 36 years, living for 24 of them in the same 1804 farmhouse on 13 acres in Greenwich, Conn. His idea of a good time is fast action away from civilization, from flying by helicopter to ski in the Canadian Rockies, to piloting his Citation jet to Siberia, to dirt biking at his phone-less Maine retreat. **********Mr. Greenhill's wife is almost always with him on these adventures, and they are often joined by their son and two daughters, all Harvard graduates. (Mrs. Greenhill is a graduate of Vassar College.) **********But such togetherness does not prevent lively competition -- his daughter beat him badly at squash -- nor does it keep his family from tweaking him for his intensity. Once, in the Canadian wilderness, his wife planted a phony telegram under a rock; it read: ""Urgent, call your office immediately."" Upon finding the note, he instinctively looked for a phone. **********WHILE Mr. Greenhill waxes enthusiastic about assembling a global network, he insists he doesn't have to do it all. James Dimon, who is strictly a manager, is his acting chief operating officer and works one door away. Never mind that Mr. Dimon is also president and chief operating officer of Travelers, and is thus in a sense Mr. Greenhill's superior as well as his subordinate. At the Weill shop, titles are used in many ways. What is more important is who has the power of the purse, and the Travelers chief, whose reputation for being cheap is the stuff of books, clearly has it, not Mr. Greenhill or Mr. Dimon. **********But, Mr. Greenhill says, he and Mr. Weill ""have a close understanding and friendship, and I am not concerned."" And lest there be any questions, he has a seven-year contract that gives him the right to hire and fire and to run the company. **********In his Travelers office four blocks to the east, Mr. Weill fixes his gaze upon a visitor and says it's ""ridiculous"" to call him cheap. And, while acknowledging that Mr. Greenhill may be different from the average manager, he said: ""Bob can be a dealmaker and a chief executive. He'll just be a chief executive in his own style."" **********It remains to be seen whether Mr. Greenhill can juggle the demanding roles. ""You've noticed I like adventure,"" he said to a visitor.

Buildings have been painted, flowers planted, roads smoothed, beaches cleaned, turf laid, all smooth and green and watered, restoring forgotten glories. **********Beholding the splendor from behind the security barricades that keep them out of it, Neapolitans registered a mix of pride and cynicism. **********""Business is down, but it's worth it to see the place looking so nice,"" said Raffaele Sanchez, slicing tomato and mozzarella at his grocery store and lunch counter on the populated side of the red-zone border. ""You come back on Monday, though, and it will all be back to normal -- chaos as usual."" **********Natasha Cirillo, a 21-year-old chambermaid, said: ""I don't know if we Neapolitans should feel proud or humiliated. Now we see what Naples used to be. We knew it was there but it was never looked after. Now, they've restored it for the G-7, so that means the foreigners count and we don't."" **********""No one,"" said Aldo Masullo, a leftist philosophy professor and member of Parliament, ""can have the illusion that after this moment of euphoria, we can continue in this favorable way unless firm decisions are made to create a more substantial transformation of the city. The problem will be to transform this new psychological attitude into a new reality."" **********Sergio Zavoli, executive editor of Il Mattino, the Naples daily, argued that a new civic pride that has come with the summit meeting ""seems to signal the end of a long night."" **********""What will remain will be not just the decorations for a major event,"" he said. ""The G-7 in Naples has set in motion something from which the city will not be able to turn back."" **********For years Naples has slumped in a decay that Mr. Zavoli called ""the other Naples, held back in mistrust and surrender."" **********Three million people are packed into the city and its environs, and a third of the work force is jobless. No one knows how many children cut class to work in sweatshops. **********In the tangled alleys of the Spanish Quarter, down by the port (and outside the red zone), the Camorra crime syndicate still holds sway through extortion, loan-sharking, narcotics, counterfeiting, illicit lotteries, prostitution, pornography, gambling and smuggling. **********And then there is the traffic, constantly snarled. By tradition, red lights are more a challenge to proceed than an order to halt. **********Over all this, the corruption scandals that have swept Italy since February 1992 reached so deeply here that the city administration was suspended and replaced by a special commissioner from Rome -- a viceroy sent to hold the line in a city that had declared itself bankrupt. **********Indeed, Naples had drifted so far from most civic standards that the authorities appointed an Assessor for Normalcy, Amato Lamberti, whose job is to try to chart a way back out of the chaos. The problem with the job, Mr. Lamberti said, is that Naples ""has never been normal."" **********Since last year, though, something different has been bubbling up through the gloom. **********A new police chief, Umberto Improta, began dissolving corrupt local authorities. In elections last December, the city swung left and voted in Antonio Bassolino, who promptly introduced a new notion into the way Neapolitans relate to their city -- ""livability."" He threw open the galleries and churches for people to see, switched on the traffic lights that had fallen into disuse and sent the traffic cops back onto the streets. **********""Naples is much better than its reputation,"" said Gualberto Ranieri, a former public relations executive at Fiat who moved here a few months ago. For instance, he said, when he stopped recently at a red light, ""8 out of 10 people behind me did not hoot their horns"" -- a modest omen, but an omen nonetheless. **********Then came the preparations for the summit talks. Many diplomats believed the city wouldn't make it. In fact, to listen to Mayor Bassolino, the city's preparations have proven a new viability. **********Compare, for instance, the Group of Seven preparations and those for the World Cup here in 1990. Then, $500 million worth of Government funds sank without a trace, diverted from renovation projects for sports facilities into the pockets of corrupt officials. The price tag for the summit talks has been around $30 million, disbursed through a bidding system that has emboldened city officials to say every lira will be accounted for. **********The question is: will it last? **********""Without the positive will of the Neapolitans, all the efforts will be useless,"" the movie director Francesco Rosi said. ""The flowers in the flower-beds will wither, the fountains will no longer tinkle, the streets will fill with holes again, the garbage will build up in the piazzas and the traffic will paralyze the entire city."" **********But if young Neapolitans made up their minds to confront this destiny, he said, Naples could again become ""a European capital, the greatest after London and Paris, which it has not been for too long."""

Three Japanese makers account for 95 percent of the market -- and one company, Asahi Glass, controls about half of all sales. **********The agreement, reached on Friday, three months after the two countries agreed in principle to resolve the problem, does not call for any specific import targets to be reached. But Tokyo did agree to issue detailed annual reports on the extent to which Japanese glass distributors sell imported flat glass made by companies other than their own American subsidiaries. The three Japanese concerns are also required to notify their distributors -- which are largely owned, in many cases, by the companies themselves -- that they must carry glass products without regard to the corporate heritage of the supplier. **********The Government has also agreed to promote the use of insulated and safety glass, a major concession because almost no double-paned glass is used in Japan, despite the country's insistence on other forms of energy conservation. **********Aides to Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said that the agreement set an important precedent. The Japanese Government, for the first time, has agreed to monitor a ""keiretsu,"" or a grouping of Japanese companies that hold one another's stock and chiefly buy one another's products, to assure that outside concerns are not discriminated against. **********That will benefit foreign suppliers, but it may also help Japanese companies to break through the invisible walls that benefit keiretsu companies and squeeze many of their domestic competitors out of the market. **********American companies welcomed the agreement. ""We think this will finally give us a chance to use our competitive edge,"" said Ralph Gerson, the president of the Guardian International Corporation, a subsidiary of Guardian Industries in Northville, Mich. Guardian opened warehouses in Japan and marketed its glass there for five years, but so far it commands only a quarter of a percentage point of the market. **********""This will open up the process,"" said Mr. Gerson, who is politically well connected in Washington and succeeded in raising the glass issue high on the agenda of American trade negotiators. ""People will know what is going on in that market, and it won't be a pretty picture."" **********Mr. Kantor, who said the ""agreement meets all our goals,"" also insisted that it includes ""solid objective criteria with which to judge the results."" **********But those ""criteria"" do not include the numerical targets for foreign penetration of the Japanese market that have long been an arguing point between Washington and Tokyo.  Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, took credit for preventing the inclusion of specific targets. Mr. Hashimoto, a perennial candidate for Prime Minister, would be hurt by any indication that he was giving in to American demands to ""manage"" the economy. **********About $4.5 billion in flat glass is sold in Japan every year, making it the second-largest such market in the world. The market share held by each of the glass companies in Japan has hardly budged in three decades. Glass prices remain well above world levels: Purchasing the glass to frame a small picture in Tokyo can easily cost $25 or more. . **********More important, there has been little innovation in the industry. Though used in office towers, insulated glass is rarely found in homes. Japanese negotiators often argued that Japan is a temperate country and that Japanese people favor open windows that let in the breeze rather than air-conditioning. But the archipelago stretches from northern Hokkaido, where huge amounts of snow pile up, to Okinawa, which has a year-round tropical climate. **********""It's not an argument,"" Mr. Gerson said, ""as much as an excuse."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/business/markets-opened-by-mexico.html,Tim Golden,1994-10-18,,914,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Markets Opened By Mexico,Markets Opened By Mexico," **********Taking a final step to open Mexico's financial markets to the world, the Government announced tonight that it would allow 46 foreign banks, securities firms and insurance companies to begin operations here. **********The Minister of Finance, Pedro Aspe Armella, said the foreign companies that gained places in the growing Mexican financial-services market were expected to start doing business here by next June. **********Though the Government did not act on 50 pending applications to set up mutual funds and other kinds of financial enterprises, it sanctioned nearly all the banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies that applied. It also approved the creation of five financial groups and a leasing company. **********The welcoming to banks like J. P. Morgan, Citibank and Chemical Banking represents a milestone in the economic restructuring begun in 1985 and expanded under the six-year Administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is to leave office on Dec. 1. **********Only a dozen years ago, having defaulted on its foreign debt, the Government nationalized 18 of the country's 20 banks, helping to plunge the economy into six years of inflationary chaos. The opening of Mexico's financial industry was considered a big victory for the United States in negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********What would have been unthinkable not so long ago, however, is unlikely to have striking effects now. Because foreign bankers and brokers are expected to focus their business somewhat narrowly and will be limited in the market share they can gain, many analysts believe competition will increase only gradually. **********""This is certainly going to have an impact,"" the deputy Finance Secretary in charge of banking, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, said tonight. ""I don't think it is going to have a dramatic impact or one that happens overnight. But it will certainly contribute to greater competition and lower margins."" **********Mr. Aspe said the foreign financial companies would bring Mexico $1.2 billion in direct foreign investment. Despite the trade agreement's implementation in January, new foreign investment in Mexico this year had totaled a somewhat disappointing $8.9 billion as of the end of August, compared with $15.6 billion for all of 1993. **********""It's a vote of confidence for the Government that all these companies are willing to put up the money to come and start an office,"" said Stefano Natella, the director of Latin American research at CS First Boston in New York. **********""But from a business point of view, I'm not so sure,"" he added. ""Is there a lot of business that these companies are going to be able to do now that they were not able to do before? In some sectors, competition is already extremely brisk."" **********Under the terms of the trade accord, American and Canadian banks and brokerages are to receive the same treatment from the Government as their local competitors. To attract more investors, the Salinas Administration extended that protection to other foreign applicants. **********The significant catch is that each foreign bank will be restricted in the amount of risk assets that they may bring to Mexico; none can gain more than a 1.5 percent share of the market. As a whole, foreign brokerages are limited to a 10 percent market share. Foreign banks may have only 8 percent of the market this year, with the figure rising to 15 percent by 2000. Thereafter, the Government can restrain their business if the figure rises above 25 percent. **********The 18 commercial banks that were approved from an initial list of 20 foreign applicants are expected to concentrate on sophisticated, high-return products like corporate lending, advisory services, securitizations and derivatives contracts. **********Their prospective clients are Mexico's biggest industrial and service companies, some of which are already borrowing money in the United States. And they are hardly catching the strongest Mexican banks off-guard: For instance, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, the owner of the country's largest bank, Banco Nacional de Mexico, has already entered into one strategic alliance with Swiss Bank for derivatives products, and another with Bank One of Columbus, Ohio, for credit cards. **********Government officials argue that the advent of so many new participants will help to lower Mexico's high interest rates. But some analysts said they were not so sure. **********""These banks are mainly going to be competing with the handful of Mexican banks that do investment banking and have an international presence,"" said Laura Z. Berdeja, senior banking analyst at the Mexico City branch of Baring Securities. ""There is not much more that rates can come down on the corporate side. There, we are already very close to international standards."" **********Similarly, business is unlikely to undergo radical change at the 16 approved securities firms, which include American companies like Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Goldman, Sachs, as well as Europeans like James Capel and Baring. **********""For the U.S. houses that already have significant trading activity in Mexican stocks in New York, most of what there will be is a moving of that activity to Mexico,"" said Justin Manson, who will open a brokerage for Morgan Stanley. ""You will have a physical presence. You're much closer to what's going on."" Other United States financial companies that received permission to operate in Mexico include American Express, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust, Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Reliance National Insurance, American Bankers Insurance and Windsor Insurance."

In the 1993 quarter, Tiffany took a charge of $32.7 million, or $2.07 a share, for a realignment of its business in Japan. Excluding the charge, the company earned $162,000, or 1 cent a share. **********Revenues for the most recent quarter rose 33 percent, to $152 million from $114 million, with much of the increase stemming from last year's change in the Japanese operation, which accounts for about a quarter of company sales. **********In that realignment, Tiffany stopped selling merchandise through a chain of Tiffany stores operated by Mitsukoshi Ltd. It bought back $115 million of merchandise it had sold to Mitsukoshi. **********It now sells the merchandise directly to the public, and its Japanese sales figures reflect retail prices rather than the lower wholesale prices recorded last year.

Buffett. The airline will also defer dividends this quarter on all its preferred stock, including $400 million of convertible preferred stock owned by British Airways, which holds a 25 percent stake in USAir. **********Over all, about $19 million in dividends will be deferred this quarter. The company did not say when it would make the payments. **********Investors reacted to the decision by USAir -- which it said was intended to conserve cash -- by pushing down its stock 20 percent, closing at $4, off $1, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********British Airways' American depository receipts, which have declined in recent weeks because of concerns over the financial health of USAir, dropped $2, to $55, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. USAir Group's bonds also fell yesterday. **********USAir said that it had about $400 million in cash, and that it expected to have roughly that amount through the end of the year. On June 30, it had $521 million in cash. **********Standard & Poor's, which lowered its ratings on one USAir preferred issue yesterday, said it did not believe the company faced an immediate liquidity problem, despite the loss of some revenue after one of its planes crashed in Pittsburgh recently. **********USAir, which has the highest cost structure of any major airline, and has lost $1.8 billion since 1988, is trying to win concessions from its unions. There have been few signs of progress in the talks, but industry analysts said that by deferring the dividend, the airline had shown its unions that key investors were also willing to sacrifice to reduce USAir's costs. **********Representatives of Berkshire Hathaway and British Airways were among the USAir board members who voted unanimously in favor of deferring the dividend. **********""USAir is sending a signal to the unions that they are sharing the pain equitably among interest groups,"" said Phillip R. Brannon, an analyst at Mabon Securities. While it may help in negotiations between the company and the unions, ""it is obviously not popular with the financial markets"" in the short term, Mr. Brannon added. **********British Airways said the deferred dividends were minor when compared with the financial benefits it received from its partnership with USAir, which it says are worth more than $110 million annually. **********Even so, British Airways has said that it may write off its $400 million investment in USAir, which is based in Arlington, Va., if the airline is unable to sharply lower its costs."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/29/business/hospital-chain-sets-guilty-plea.html,Allen Myerson,1994-06-29,,1147,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Hospital Chain Sets Guilty Plea,Hospital Chain Sets Guilty Plea," **********National Medical Enterprises Inc., one of the nation's largest psychiatric hospital chains, said today that it would plead guilty to paying kickbacks and bribes for referrals, even as a former executive admitted to arranging $20 million to $40 million in illegal payments -- and then scheming to get Medicare reimbursement. **********The company said it had agreed to pay $362.7 million and admit on Wednesday or Thursday to seven charges, in what would be the largest settlement ever between the Government and a health care provider. **********The former company executive, Peter Alexis, pleaded guilty on Monday to charges involving bribery and kickbacks. Justice Department officials said they knew of no larger admission of health care fraud by an individual, although this could not be confirmed. Mr. Alexis said that top company officials took part in arranging the payments and he agreed to aid the Government's prosecution of other individuals. Medicare Expense Reports **********Mr. Alexis's admissions, covering a period from 1985 to 1990, included false statements on Medicare expense reports and a conspiracy to pay kickbacks. He said in court that more than 50 doctors and others had received payments. Some, according to a document he signed, received furniture and expense money for their offices. Mr. Alexis faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, with his sentence presumably depending in part on the extent of his cooperation. **********Prosecutors said his case provided the best window yet on misconduct now endemic to medicine that might ultimately prove as costly as the corruption that ravaged so many savings institutions. **********In the medical world, said Paul E. Coggins, the United States Attorney in Dallas, ""practices that are illegal have been accepted and tolerated -- very much akin to the climate that pervaded the savings and loans.' **********Federal officials have estimated that fraud swallows about 10 percent of the nation's health care expenses, or $80 billion to $100 billion a year. With savings and loan prosecutions winding down, the Clinton Administration has made the policing ofhealth care fraud a priority. **********Investigators have accused National Medical of taking patients who did not need treatment and keeping them against their will until their insurance coverage ran out. Complaints from some of those patients over the last few years touched off Federal and state prosecutions. **********National Medical, based in Santa Monica, Calif., said in April that it had set aside $375 million to settle charges of fraud and patient abuse against the company, though not against individuals. It said today that its payments would include $324.2 million in the Government's civil case, $33 million in the criminal case and a probable $16.3 million to settle other claims by 28 states. **********The Federal charges cover bribes and kickbacks at six hospitals, in California, Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Texas and New Jersey, from 1986 to 1991. At the Fair Oaks Hospital in Summit, N.J., the company has admitted to paying a medical group for referrals on or about Dec. 20, 1990. 'Refocused Its Energies **********Christi Sulzbach, the company's associate general counsel, said that the company had sold, closed or arranged to sell all but 10 of the 81 psychiatric hospitals it had, and planned to leave that business entirely. ""The company has completely refocused its energies,"" she said, referring to its 35 other hospitals in the United States and 12 more it partly owns abroad. **********She said the settlement of charges against the company and Mr. Alexis was merely coincidental, with only one hospital, in Fort Worth, involved in both cases. **********Mr. Alexis's lawyer, Jeff Kearney, stressed how much his client was helping the prosecution. ""I believe his cooperation has been significant and will be significant,' Mr. Kearney said. **********Mr. Alexis, who is 44 and lives in Dallas, was once named the company's administrator of the Year. He oversaw the Texas region as a vice president, then senior vice president, of Psychiatric Institutes of America, a National Medical unit, from early or mid-1989 until December 1990. Prior to that, he ran the company's Psychiatric Institute of Fort Worth, a hospital, from 1985 to 1989. **********Prosecutors said they considered his cooperation invaluable since he met in December 1989 with corporate and regional executives to discuss the kickbacks and ways of disguising them. Mr. Alexis was initially charged on June 14. **********According to prosecutors and the plea agreement with Mr. Alexis that they filed in United States District Court here, company executives and lawyers concocted elaborate methods of making and disguising the payoffs. Titles and Salaries **********Mr. Alexis was among the employees who asked doctors, therapists, social workers and others to send patients to their hospitals. These doctors and therapists received hospital titles and salaries, as well as payments for office furniture, equipment, expenses and staff. **********But the payments were related to the number of patients the doctors referred, not to duties they performed for the hospitals. **********Prosecutors said Mr. Alexis arranged to repay two doctors in particular for their referrals by making them high-level officials of the Psychiatric Institute of Fort Worth and the Cedar Creek Hospital in Amarillo, Tex., both owned by National Medical. He also had the company pay a professional association of psychiatrists an annual amount for sending patients to Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion, a Dallas hospital also owned by the company. **********Mr. Alexis then overstated hospital expenses on Medicare reports to obtain reimbursement to cover some kickbacks and bribes. ""At that point, it was a double whammy,"" with false reports covering the illegal payments, Mr. Coggins, the United States Attorney, said in an interview. No Doctors Named, Yet **********At this stage, prosecutors have not named any doctors or the amounts they received. Federal Judge Joe Kendall asked Mr. Alexis on Monday whether more than 50 people had received payments for referrals. Mr. Alexis said this was a fair estimate, and Judge Kendall said that some doctors in the area might not be sleeping well. **********The Dallas investigation includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, local prosecutors and the Departments of Justice, Defense and Health and Human Services. Defense Department investigators stepped in because the hospitals treated military families. **********Mr. Coggins is not necessarily speaking in the abstract when he compares health care and savings and loan fraud. As a criminal defense lawyer before becoming United States Attorney last year, he arranged a plea bargain for Edwin McBirney, the former chairman of Sunbelt Savings. **********The scandals at National Medical Enterprises led to the resignation in April 1993 of two of the company's founders, including Richard K. Eamer, a former chief executive. Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the new chief executive, has settled suits by two major insurers and many patients. Mr. Alexis is the highest of eight National Medical employees to have been charged with crimes."

The auction will end only when each of the 29 companies doing the bidding has either dropped out or won one or more licenses. The limit for any single bidder is three licenses, and based on today's action, at least half of the licenses will sell for at least $30 million. **********Representatives of the participating companies entered their bids from computer terminals behind drawn curtains like voters at a polling place. It will not be known which companies submitted which bids until winners are eventually named. **********The companies taking part included big players in the paging business, Adelphia Communications, Airtouch Paging, BellSouth Wireless, Mobilemedia Communications, the Nationwide Wireless Network and U S West Communications. **********""Everybody is surprised about the amount of money that's showing up,"" said Mark J. Golden, vice president of the Personal Communications Industry Association, a trade organization for paging companies. ""The sky is the limit."" **********For the Federal Treasury, the bidding represents a windfall -- and a sign of perhaps even richer auctions to come. This week's bidding is seen as something of a dress rehearsal for auctions to begin late this year for a set of potentially even more valuable licenses for the next generation of cellular communications, known as personal communications services, or PCS. **********The Clinton Administration had estimated that the auctions later this year might bring in $10 billion dollars. But if the competition is as intense then as during today's bidding, the figure could go much higher. **********But for small companies, women and minority groups, which were to have been given an edge in the auction by having to pay only 75 percent of the amount of their bid if they won a license, the richness of today's action seemed to make the promise of a discount a potentially moot point. **********Thomas A. Hart Jr., a lawyer with the Washington firm of McManimon & Scotland, who is representing a black-owned company called Essence Television Inc. in the bidding, said that minority bidders had been ""frozen out."" **********Ronald Blaylock, a black entrepreneur who was bidding on behalf of his small company, Romgat Communications L.P., South Orange, N. J., said he was ""shocked"" at the initial bidding round. **********""At some point the absolute dollars are more important than the bid credits"" for companies held by minorities or women, Mr. Blaylock said. **********Until now, the F.C.C. has always simply given away licenses to use the public airwaves, whether for radio and television broadcasting or wireless services like paging or cellular telephones. But last year, Congress passed a law mandating that many types of nonbroadcast licenses be awarded to the highest bidder. **********When Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee, announced the results of the first round of bidding today, many of those assembled in the large bidding room audibly registered their surprise with gasps. One company had bid $20 million each for two different licenses, which was twice the next highest bid. **********""This first round has totally exceeded the most rosy, optimistic projection,"" Mr. Markey said. **********By the sixth and final round for the day, one company had bid $30 million each for five licenses. **********Although bids are made anonymously and linked only to a bidder identification number, speculation was running high that the blockbuster bidders might include BellSouth Wireless and KDM Messaging Inc., which is backed by McCaw Cellular. **********The licenses cover swaths of radio spectrum that are to be used for nationwide networks that will enable subcribers to not only receiving paging signals but also respond to them with either text messages or voice mail. **********In what the F.C.C. billed as the first-ever simultaneous electronic auction, 29 companies registered to bid on the licenses by paying the FCC a $350,000 deposit for each of the 10 licenses they wished to bid on. They can buy only 3, but are permitted to bid on all 10 as a way to increase their odds of winning. **********Technically the auction, which is conducted in rounds that have lasted a couple of hours each, could continue until Wednesday evening. Many speculated, however, that the winning bidders would establish themselves by midday on Tuesday. **********A separate class of new services is to be auctioned off later this week. On Thursday, 600 regional licenses for airwaves that are to be used for interactive broadcast television will be put on the block in a more traditional style of auction with all bidders assembled and making their offers publicly before an auctioneer. More than 450 people have applied to bid on those licenses, whose value per license is expected to be much less than those being auctioned today. **********Since Congress passed legislation a year ago requiring auctions for airwave licenses, larger companies have conducted thousands of computer simulations on possible auction strategies. Complex rules govern the bidding, making gamesmanship key. **********The bigger companies in the current bidding have set up elaborate computer systems in their suites at the Omni Shoreham. Many of the suites are guarded by private security guards."

His abrupt departure then prompted speculation that he had been dismissed because his management style was considered too abrasive. During his tenure at Conde Nast, he was also publisher of Mademoiselle and of Conde Nast Traveler, which he helped to start in 1987. **********What made the situation even more curious yesterday was that Mr. Galotti, when at Vanity Fair, was thought to be in serious competition with Steven T. Florio, president of The New Yorker, for the presidency of Conde Nast. **********Relations between the two were said to be frosty. Mr. Florio won the prize and will replace Mr. Leser as president of the company on April 4. **********There was speculation yesterday, though, that Mr. Florio was engineering Mr. Galotti's move back to Conde Nast. **********Aside from Mr. Leser, though, no one at Advance Publications, Conde Nast's parent company, was talking. **********Maurie Perle, a company representative, declined comment.

The result is that almost every major division of the firm has been touched by significant management changes since Prudential's settlement in October of securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. **********The changes run through the firm, from some of its most senior executives to managers of retail branches. Prudential executives said yesterday that only the changes of branch managers were made out of concern about potential S.E.C. charges. Some High-Level Hirings **********William Ahearn, a Prudential spokesman, confirmed many of the departures, but also pointed to a number of significant hirings made by the firm in recent months, including last week's selection of Lee Spencer, its acting general counsel, to serve in that capacity full-time. **********Mr. Ahearn said the firm in recent weeks hired Donna Redel, the chairwoman of the Commodity Exchange in New York, as director of marketing for its futures division, as well as a new head for its New York office for special accounts and a number of new securities analysts. **********Still, the rapid series of changes has created great anxiety among many of the firm's midlevel managers and brokers, several of whom said in interviews that they were concerned the changes signaled more unrest for Prudential as it struggles out of the fraud scandal. **********The most senior executive leaving the firm is Woody Knight, who in 1991 was named president of investment banking, equity transactions and corporate strategy. Prudential executives said yesterday that Mr. Knight's departure, effective on July 31, was unrelated to the firm's recent troubles and resulted from his desire for a career change. **********In a memo to the firm distributed on May 27 Hardwick Simmons, Prudential Securities' chief executive, said Mr. Knight had told him of his desire to leave ""to seek a new set of challenges as a chief executive in a new corporate environment."" **********In a telephone interview last night, Mr. Knight said that while he had some opportunities under consideration, he had no specific job lined up yet. He said the timing of his departure had no relation to any other changes at the firm and was purely a personal decision. **********""It's a logical time,"" he said. ""A lot of the past is behind at Pru Securities and a lot of the heavy lifting and hard work has been done."" National Sales Shift **********Another senior executive affected by the recent changes is J. Barron Clancy, director of national sales in the firm's retail division. In an internal memo last week, George A. Murray, a senior executive in the division, said Mr. Clancy would be relinquishing that job to work for Mr. Murray directly, assisting in the formulation of strategic initiatives. His former responsibilities will be divided between two other executives, Jim Chapman and Jamie Price. **********Mr. Clancy was also tied through a previous job at the firm to the scandal at Prudential involving its sale of limited partnerships. In the 1980's, Mr. Clancy was senior vice president and marketing director with the partnership division, known as the Direct Investment Group. **********While no accusations of improprieties have been raised against Mr. Clancy, many brokers and middle managers have questioned whether the firm was wise to have an executive in such a senior post who was even loosely tied to the scandal. **********Mr. Ahearn said the new post was a promotion, but Mr. Clancy's job change was widely viewed within the firm as a significant cut of authority and areas of responsibility. Branch Office Changes **********The firm last week also made a number of changes among its branch managers. Michael McClain was removed as manager of the firm's Dallas branch and assigned to work on special projects, which brokers said had not yet been defined. **********Mr. McClain, who did not return a telephone call to his home, is one of several managers whose roles as supervisors were said by people with knowledge of the inquiry to be under investigation by the S.E.C. **********Mr. McClain's regulatory problems arise from his prior job as a manager in the Atlanta region. In 1989 and 1990, according to the S.E.C. complaint, managers in Atlanta did not follow internal compliance rules, a failure that allowed a broker to violate numerous securities laws without detection. As a result, the agency is said to be investigating a number of managers, including Mr. McClain, for failing to supervise adequately. **********The firm last week also dismissed Sandra Logay, manager of Prudential's branch office in Chesterfield, Mo. The dismissal came one week after Daniel L. Zessinger, a broker supervised by Ms. Logay, pleaded guilty in a Federal criminal case involving securities fraud. **********In a telephone interview, Ms. Logay said that she was surprised by the dismissal and that Prudential never gave her an explanation. She declined further comment. **********Ms. Logay is being replaced by Paul A. Walker, the head of Prudential's Birmingham, Ala., office. That move came even as Harry Childers, the popular manager of the Mobile, Ala., office, was resigning, which brokers considered a blow to the firm."

That is because so many analysts are unsure about how the dollar will perform after a rate increase, she said. **********""It used to be that when rates rose, you just bought the dollar,"" Ms. Tierney said. ""Now rates rise, Treasury bonds fall, and you sell the dollar."" **********Some traders attributed the dollar's rebound from its lows yesterday to supportive comments from the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan.

The trans-Pacific war of nerves put what had been one of the hottest markets in the world on the skids. **********With the yen soaring in value, the prospects for corporate profits looking grimmer and the fear of American trade sanctions spreading, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks lost a little more than 5 percent of its value, closing Friday at 18,959.60. More than that, it made the market a hostage to the yen, which appears likely to remain strong for now. **********Is the great bull run of 1994 already over? **********The surprising answer from a number of market analysts is: don't bet on it. Some investors have been discouraged, of course, but many experts believe the news from Japan is likely to get better, not worse. **********""I haven't changed my view,"" said Jeff Bahrenburg, the senior strategist here with Merrill Lynch Japan. ""We still have a slight overweighting on Japan."" **********Added Geoffrey Barker, the head of research here with Baring Securities: ""We haven't broken out of the uptrend in the market that we've seen since December. We had a correction, that's for sure, but we're still in the range."" **********The market has dropped 7.6 percent since hitting its recent peak about 10 days ago. But it has still gained more than 10 percent in the last two months. **********In addition, foreign investors remain strong buyers, analysts said. **********Foreigners made net purchases of a little more than a trillion yen worth of Japanese shares last year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the equivalent of almost $10 billion. Then in January, foreigners snapped up another $9 billion, the second-highest monthly total on record. **********No one denies that there are serious problems in Japan. The economy is in a two-year-old recession, and the Government has offered fairly tepid measures to get it out of its rut. Corporations still have to do some deep cost-cutting to return to profitability. **********And now there is the trade mess. The Administration has threatened to slap sanctions on Japan because of a dispute over the cellular phone market. Japan has suggested that it may retaliate if Washington acts. And the yen has shot up, squeezing exporters and their already strained bottom lines. **********The real fear is that a prolonged rise in the yen could counter the $140 billion Government program to breathe new life into the economy. **********""If the yen stays where it's at, it wipes out any positive impact of the stimulus package,"" said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist here with Morgan Stanley Japan. **********But barring the emergence of worse problems, most analysts seem to think Japan is near an economic turn and the stock market is anticipating the improvement. **********For instance, Ms. Sasaki-Smith said she was expecting a quick reduction in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, perhaps in a week. **********And Mr. Barker said, ""This market wants to go up, and it will if there are more signs of a compromise on trade."" **********He and others argue that American pressure will speed up, if only slightly, Japan's push for greater economic deregulation. And that would help the market a great deal. **********""The point is that the pressure will be good for Japan in the end,"" Mr. Bahrenburg said. ""It will accelerate the changes already under way to opening things up."" **********Mr. Bahrenburg may be one of the more optimistic analysts. He said one cause for hope was the fact that corporate balance sheets had gotten so bad that only a small pickup in business could have a pronounced effect. **********He said he had calculated that a 2 percent increase in sales and a reduction in fixed costs of just half a percent would lift pretax profits about 45 percent for most companies. **********""That's a very big jump,"" he said. ""The reason is that the bottom line is now so depressed. That's why I say that the long-term story is very positive."" **********He is so optimistic, in fact, that he has picked some long-ignored stocks for his model portfolio. He said he liked consumer goods companies like Sony, Toyota, Sharp and Jusco, a big retailer. **********Mr. Bahrenburg said he was also recommending some capital goods stocks, like Canon, Tokyo Electron and Makino Milling. As it happens, corporations have been slashing their capital-spending budgets, so this is a bold move. **********Mr. Barker said that the market as a whole was unlikely to show sharp improvement in the short term. But he said there were plenty of good opportunities for those willing to explore promising niches. **********For instance, Mr. Barker said he was expecting some improvement in consumer spending. Thus, he likes Toyo Wharf and Warehouse and the Kamigumi Company, a port transportation and warehousing company. These are not exactly cutting-edge companies, but Mr. Barker said they appeared likely to enjoy some pickup in growth. **********Even John Baldwin, the strategist here with Jardine Fleming Securities and a bear on the market, said he saw some good buys. **********He said smaller companies in particular may prosper. ""This is a good environment for an active fund manager,"" Mr. Baldwin said. ""There are lots of little niches that will be profitable, even if there is not any growth in the index."" **********He said he liked Nichiei, which offers financing to mostly smaller companies, and Yamakawa, an auto parts producer."

Lower Them"" (Viewpoints, May 22) Senator Phil Gramm, , Republican of Texas, argues that President Clinton's proposed increases in security registration and transaction fees will raise the cost of equity capital and thereby lower investment in new issues, discourage people from playing the stock market and generate $814 million in revenue, allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand its budget and ""inflict great harm on the economy."" **********Apart from Senator Gramm's curious characterization of the S.E.C. as an intrinsically harmful bureaucracy, the article is of interest as a rather obvious attempt to make a mountain out of a mole hill. **********Take the proposed increase in registration fees from $313 to $345 for $1 million of new stock. The fee -- less than four-hundredths of a percent -- shrinks to insignificance compared with investment-banker fees and other very substantial costs of a new issue. Recent history shows that registration fees are not a factor. For 1987-89, the registration fee was $200 for $1 million, and new equity issues averaged $61 billion annually. In 1991, the fee was raised to $313; new issues did not drop but rose 34 percent, averaging $82 billion in 1991-92. Total revenue from new-issue registration fees has been averaging less than $25 million a year. **********Nor does it seem reasonable that the proposed 17 percent increase in transaction fees to $40 for $1 million traded -- four-thousandths of a percent -- could have a measurable effect on stock market activity. Compared with broker fees and the hoped-for capital gain (and resulting capital gains tax) it is also a nonfactor. In view of the size of the Federal deficit, it might be argued that a much larger increase in transaction fees would be desirable. **********After all, the substantially greater increase in the capital gains tax effective January 1987 (from 20 to 28 percent) did not hurt stock prices nor did it dampen the desire to play the market. In fact, we have seen just the reverse. The transaction volume has grown 62 percent, and prices have risen to all-time highs. In 1986, the Wilshire 5000 Index stood at $2.6 trillion; today it is in the neighborhood of $4.5 trillion, up 73 percent. As a result, capital gains tax revenue has also grown significantly. In five years preceding the 1987 increase, 1981-85, revenue averaged $18.4 billion a year. In the five years following the increase, the average was $32 billion, a gain of 74 percent. The deficit could use the money. **********There need be no fear that increasing these minuscule fees will hamper capital formation and economic growth. A slightly bigger mole hill is still a mole hill. In addition, more than 95 percent of Senator Gramm's $814 million estimated revenue will come from trades in old stock. These are transactions in which the issuing companies see none of the proceeds. They are transfers, exchanges of assets between individuals, not investments in the sense economists use the term.

But analysts said that Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, continued to show high returns on equity and tight cost controls. Shares of Merrill rose 87.5 cents yesterday, to $35.25, on the New York Stock Exchange **********Bear Stearns & Company also reported quarterly earnings yesterday, showing a drop of 66 percent as volatility in fixed-income markets cut deeply into trading profit. **********""Merrill's third quarter strongly differentiates itself from the rest"" of Wall Street firms, said William Hartman, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities. **********For the three-month period ending on Sept. 30, Merrill Lynch reported that it earned nearly $232 million, or $1.10 a share, down from $359.7 million, or $1.57 a share, in the similar quarter a year earlier. Revenue fell 12.6 percent, to $2.3 billion, from $2.63 billion in the third quarter of 1993. **********""Merrill had a very good quarter, even though it was in line with expectations,"" said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst of the securities industry for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ""They continue to generate a return on equity that is in the high teens, which in these markets is quite impressive."" **********Mr. Moszkowski and others attributed Merrill's ability to steer through tough times to a revenue base that is broader and more diverse than many of its competitors, and to tight controls on expenses. **********""The third quarter was a very difficult quarter,"" Mr. Hartman of J. P. Morgan said, ""because of seasonally low trading activity, a weak underwriting calendar and continued rising interest rates. These people managed through all of that."" **********Partly as a result of the seasonal slowdown in trading, Merrill said commission revenue fell 3 percent in the quarter, to $674 million. And lower revenue from American and foreign equities and foreign-exchange trading pushed down principal-transactions revenue by 12 percent, to $654 million. **********But Merrill said its fixed-income trading results were virtually unchanged from a year ago, a marked contrast with other Wall Street firms. Last week, for example, Salomon Inc. reported losing about $100 million in the last three months, attributing this to bond transactions. **********Merrill's investment-banking activities, however, sharply declined, due largely to a steep drop in underwriting volume. The firm said investment-banking revenue totaled $245 million for the period, down 46 percent from a year ago. **********Bear Stearns said it earned $35.5 million, or 25 cents a share, in its first quarter, which ended on Sept. 30., down sharply from the $104.3 million, or 77 cents a share, it earned in the quarter a year ago. **********Revenue declined 26 percent, to $433.6 million, from $586.1 million a year ago. **********Analysts said the drop was primarily due to hostile bond-market conditions. **********""For those who are heavily into fixed income -- like Bear Stearns, Kidder, Peabody and others -- the third quarter was still a rough quarter,"" said Thomas Fasciola of Salomon Brothers. **********Sam Molinaro, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns, said, ""We are obviously not happy with these results, but the simple fact is that conditions in the fixed-income market continue to be volatile, both domestically and internationally."" **********Fixed-income activity at Bear Stearns, the nation's sixth-largest securities house, accounts for 50 to 60 percent of total revenue, Mr. Molinaro said. **********Shares of Bear Stearns rose 12.5 cents in trading yesterday, to $15.625."

But he threatened to postpone the hearing unless the Administration decided this week how it wanted to pay for the pact, which was concluded last December. **********""Delay creates risks, it breeds opposition,"" Senator Moynihan said, adding that he still strongly favored the pact. Offsetting a Loss **********Administration officials insisted today that they wanted to put the agreement through Congress this summer but were vague about when they would settle on a way to offset the loss of about $12 billion in import tax revenue that the agreement would eliminate during the next five years. **********Leon Panetta, the outgoing director of the Office of Management and Budget and the new White House chief of staff, said at a White House news conference on the budget, before Senator Moynihan's speech, that Administration officials would hold talks throughout the week with Congressional Democrats and Republicans. **********""I can't give you a firm date as to when all of this is going to be nailed down, other than to say that we're making good progress on it and our hope is that we can get GATT adopted by the Congress before the August break,"" he said. **********Anne R. Luzzatto, the press secretary for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said after Mr. Moynihan's remarks that, ""We appreciate the chairman's support and we're working night and day to get the information to the Hill to meet the chairman's deadlines."""

Now, though, the networks are using reruns of their hits, both because it costs little to recycle them and because they often beat the ratings for new episodes of a marginal show. **********When NBC placed ""The Martin Short Show"" on hiatus in September, for example, it filled the 8:30 P.M. time slot on Tuesdays with reruns of ""Wings,"" ""Mad About You"" and ""Frasier,"" series that had just begun showing new episodes elsewhere on the NBC schedule. **********CBS recently canceled the Dudley Moore sitcom ""Daddy's Girls"" and replaced it with old installments of the successful comedy ""Dave's World."" **********And Fox yanked two new shows from its Sunday night lineup -- the adventure series ""Fortune Hunter"" and the baseball comedy ""Hardball"" -- and scheduled, starting last night, ""The Best of the X-Files,"" its Friday night hit, and an extra half-hour of reruns of ""The Simpsons."" **********Syndicated reruns of ""The Simpsons"" are already seen five days a week. But Fox announced the additional Sunday night reruns with a flourish, asserting that they were ""back by popular demand."" **********Also in hopes of creating precious ratings momentum, ABC earlier this year chose to schedule special previews of its new series ""All American Girl"" and ""Thunder Alley"" between a rerun and a new episode of the hit ""Home Improvement."" **********On Oct. 11, NBC faced down its Tuesday night opposition -- including the movie biography of Roseanne Arnold on Fox and the season premiere of ""N.Y.P.D. Blue"" on ABC -- by bringing forth an old episode of its popular sitcom ""Frasier."" **********Such is the networks' faith in familiar favorites -- and their fear of unproven newcomers -- that although this season's new shows have been no more successful than usual, not a single backup series has shown up, or even been announced, on any of the four broadcast networks. **********""I'm not embarrassed that we don't have new series on the air,"" said Preston Beckman, NBC's senior vice president of program planning and scheduling, meaning really new series. ""My job is to get the highest ratings possible."" **********He added: ""We're very selective with our backup series. I'm very much against rushing them onto the air into inappropriate time slots. We really try to plan out the season more carefully than that. I don't want to sound cheap or anything, but this business is about buying into success and reducing the cost of failure."" **********Steve Warner, senior vice president for program planning at CBS, agreed. ""It's a good way to shore up a time period until the right show to fill it with comes along,"" he said. **********Alan Sternfeld, a top programming executive at ABC, sounded a bit less enthusiastic. ""I suppose it's a short-term solution when you don't have good backup shows available,"" he said. **********Programmers from Fox were unwilling to discuss the subject, though the network has the least successful crop of new shows this year and thus has the most to gain from making its hit shows do double duty. They often do, it seems, as impressively as a low-mileage sedan given a wax job and a prominent place at the front of a used-car lot. **********""A rerun will generally perform better than a new show that hasn't yet gotten an audience,"" Mr. Beckman said. **********As proof, he cited the ""special"" repeat showings of ""Mad About You"" and ""Wings,"" which actually beat the opposing shows in their time slot on Tuesday nights. The final episode of ""The Martin Short Show,"" which these episodes replaced, scored a rating of 11.1, while the reruns had an average rating of 13.4 in their first three weeks. (Each rating point represents 954,000 households.) **********Mr. Sternfeld of ABC cited the success of what he called the ""Home Improvement sandwich"" in leading big opening-night audiences to his network's two new sitcoms. (Still, you can lead an audience to a sitcom, but you can't make it watch. Once it lost its powerful temporary lead-in, ""Thunder Alley"" began to sink, and ABC recently said it was pulling the show off the air temporarily.) **********Mr. Sternfeld also mentioned, almost in passing, that a rerun was much less costly to schedule than a one-shot special or a new series. **********Networks generally license each program episode from its producers for two showings. But in the licensing agreement that covers the full television season, the network may get the producers to allow a little extra leeway -- say, 52 showings of 24 episodes. When that happens, an episode can be broadcast three times at no extra cost. **********When network planners delay backup series until January, they can concentrate their promotional firepower for special events and mini-series during the crucial November ""sweep"" ratings period. May is a sweep month, too, and by resorting to reruns now, the networks will still have a few fresh episodes of their hits to show then. **********Other factors often cited for the proliferation of reruns are cable television and the addiction of younger viewers to channel surfing. With viewer choices multiplying, and clicker fingers itchy, the theory goes, it is more vital than ever to remove deadwood quickly from the schedule. For the same reason, it is also less likely that a given viewer will have already seen an episode being shown again. **********The writers and producers of these shows are usually informed only after the fact that their creations have been chosen to inhabit extra time slots. While some producers welcome the added exposure and the indisputable proof that their series are network favorites, others worry that excessive rerunning will reduce their shows' value on the syndication market and present fewer opportunities for the producers of potential replacement series -- including themselves. **********The first successful use of prime-time reruns, it appears, was in 1990, when Fox filled a gap in its Saturday night schedule by running two back-to-back episodes of ""Cops,"" the second of which was a rerun. **********Mr. Beckman of NBC credits himself with having made the next breakthrough. A couple of years ago, eyeing the probable failure of part of his Friday night lineup, he decided against ordering a backup series and dusted off a bunch of old Perry Mason movies instead. The retreads, called ""The Perry Mason Mysteries,"" were a success, he said. **********The lesson? ""There's a floor to the size of the audience any Perry Mason movie will get,"" Mr. Beckman concluded. ""So why throw good money after bad?"""

Higher interest rates usually make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors. **********""This may not be the beginning of a huge rally, but it should stop the rot in the dollar,"" said Keith Cheveralls, director of foreign-exchange at First National Bank of Boston. ""It was a good move by the Fed. The markets liked it."" Earlier Concern **********In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6725 German marks, little changed from 1.6735 marks on Monday. It had fallen as low as 1.6619 marks before the Fed acted, amid concern that the central bank's rate increases would not meet expectations. **********The dollar also ended at 104.68 Japanese yen, down a fraction from 104.80 yen. **********The dollar failed to rise further after the rate increases because so many traders had already expected the Fed, at its policy meeting yesterday, to push up rates to quell investor concern about inflation and to shore up the American currency. **********The dollar has fallen sharply against the mark and the yen so far this year. **********Strong rallies in the stock and bond markets also helped the dollar yesterday after the Fed's move. **********Stocks and bonds surged in part because the Fed suggested that it was finished raising interest rates for now. Yesterday's rate increases, and the three others before it, ""substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,"" the Fed said in a statement. Confidence Cited **********David Durst, a trader at Bear, Stearns & Company, said: ""The fact that they indicated they're done raising rates for a while gave people the confidence to buy U.S. assets again. That really helped the dollar, too."" **********Currency traders have been waiting for the Fed to raise rates since May 4, when the Clinton Administration called on the Fed and 18 other central banks to buy dollars to stem its slide. **********Still, some traders remained skeptical of the prospects for the dollar because of its failure to rally after this year's previous rate increases. Unless the Fed's actions succeeded in restoring confidence in American stocks and bonds, the dollar would suffer anew, they said. **********""All the Fed did today was stabilize the dollar,"" said Earl Johnson, foreign-exchange adviser at the Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.

The action spares the President a major embarrassment as he prepares to meet next week with European allies who strongly support the embargo. **********The closeness of the vote -- the principal measure was defeated on a tie of 50 to 50 -- prevented the White House from declaring a full-fledged victory. But the Administration can take credit for its intense lobbying campaign, which included bringing European foreign ministers to Capitol Hill. **********The effort succeeded in turning back rising sentiment in the Senate to let the Bosnians defend themselves and avoided the kind of huge defeat the President suffered last month in the House on the same issue. **********Postponed for a Day **********The vote, which has been on and off the calendar for more than a week, was deemed so close Thursday night that it was postponed until today so that a Senator favoring the Administration's position could return from a funeral in Nevada. Vice President Al Gore presided in case his vote was needed. **********The vote does not end the possibility of Congressional directives on Bosnian  policy. Because the House approved a measure to end American participation in the embargo, the two measures now go to a conference of House and Senate negotiators to reconcile the differences. **********Recognizing that the closeness of the vote limited the Administration's hand, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Sam Nunn, who sponsored the Administration-backed measure, was restrained in his assessment. **********""The Bosnian thing in conference will be very difficult,"" he said. ""I also believe that what happens on the ground in Bosnia while we're in conference will make a difference."" **********Asked if the Administration could take comfort from the vote, Senator Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, said, ""Compared to what could have happened, yes, but I think  the Administration should understand that the overwhelming sentiment in the Senate is that the arms embargo is counterproductive."" **********'More Assertive' **********He said he hoped the Administration ""will be more assertive with our allies  about trying to find some collective way to enable the Bosnians to be able better to defend themselves, at least make clear when they are going to be able  to get arms."" **********The Senate considered two measures today. The first, offered by Mr. Nunn and  Senator John Warner, a Virginia Republican, was a nonbinding resolution that merely encouraged the Administration to stay the course and work with its allies to end the embargo. That passed 52 to 48, with 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans supporting it and 13 Democrats and 35 Republicans opposing it. **********The more threatening measure, offered by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, would have demanded that the President unilaterally end American participation in the United Nations arms embargo, regardless of pleas to the contrary from the allies. **********Lobbying by Europeans **********The votes followed a week of personal phone calls to various Senators from President Clinton and Vice President Gore as well as an extraordinary lobbying campaign by defense ministers from four European allies and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain. **********They warned that a United States violation of the embargo would undermine NATO, force the allies to withdraw from Bosnia, widen the war and leave moral responsibility for the war squarely with America. **********The Dole measure lost because tie votes are automatically defeated. Thirteen  Democrats and 37 Republicans supported it while 43 Democrats and seven Republicans opposed it. **********In pushing for the United States to abandon the embargo, Senator Dole said he had little faith in the current peace process, on which the Administration seemed to be relying to end the conflict. The plan calls for the Serbs, who have taken 70 percent of the territory in Bosnia, to settle for 49 percent, a sacrifice that Mr. Dole said the Serbs seemed unlikely to make. **********He also warned that the current plan, which enforces a partition settlement,  eventually seeks up to 25,000 American troops to carry out the plan. **********In a Capitol corridor after the vote, Senator Dole told Ejup Ganic, the Vice  President of Bosnia, ""It's not over yet, just like it's not over over there."" **********Mr. Ganic told reporters that with the debate, at least ""the American people  understand more about aggression, about genocide, and we'll be back."" He added,  ""It's obvious we have to spend more time in the Senate."" **********Despite the closeness of the votes, the Senate today at least avoided the contradictory message it sent in May when it voted both to lift the embargo unilaterally, as Senator Dole proposed, and not to lift it unilaterally, in an Administration-backed measure offered by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine. Both measures passed, 50-49. **********Today, a handful of Democratic Senators changed their May votes, and that gave the Administration the votes it needed to spurn the Dole amendment. **********The Senators who voted in May for the Dole amendment and voted for the Administration today were Richard H. Bryan and Harry M. Reid, both Democrats from Nevada, and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Democrat of Colorado. The vote was delayed until today so that Mr. Bryan could return from a funeral in Nevada. **********At the same time, there were two Democrats who had voted in May with the Administration and voted against it today, Barbara Boxer of California and Joseph Biden of Delaware. **********And there were four Senators who voted for both measures, contradictory as it seemed. They were Thad Cochrane of Mississippi, William Cohen of Maine and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, all Republicans, and Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat."

Seeks New Penalties For Improper Broker Sales,S.E.C. Seeks New Penalties For Improper Broker Sales," **********Securities and Exchange Commission officials said today that during a two-year investigation of nine big brokerage firms, they found an unexpectedly large number of cases of improper sales practices and had referred them to the agency's enforcement division for further investigation and possible punitive action. **********In releasing a report on the inquiry, Arthur Levitt Jr., the S.E.C.'s chairman, also outlined plans for a crackdown on stock and bond brokers who generate extra commissions by pushing clients into inappropriate investments. He said in an interview that the agency would be quicker to bar brokers from the industry and impose stiff fines for violations that previously would have drawn lesser penalties. **********According to the report, the S.E.C. examined 161 branch offices that had received numerous customer complaints in preceding years or that employed at least one broker who had received many complaints or been the subject of arbitration or litigation. The agency found sales practice problems at about 40 branch offices that required referral to the agency's enforcement division. **********""There were indications of excessive trading, unsuitable recommendations, unauthorized trading, improper mutual fund switching and failure to supervise in some of the branch office examinations,"" the study said. The S.E.C. also reviewed sales practices at the head offices of the nine brokerage firms and said that it did not find systemic problems. **********The nine firms, which all have extensive retail broker networks, are Paine Webber, Prudential Securities, Merrill Lynch, A. G. Edwards, Dean Witter Reynolds, Kemper Securities, Kidder, Peabody, and two firms that have merged since the study began two years ago, Shearson Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney. Three firms accounted for 88 percent of the referrals, the S.E.C. said, but officials refused to identify which three. **********Mark Fitterman, the associate director of the S.E.C.'s market regulation division and the author of today's report, said that most of the improper sales practices would not have caught the attention of market regulators without the special study, which was the first of its kind. **********""We don't think one out of four branches of those nine firms is a bad branch,"" he said. ""We do think the number of referrals was significant."" **********Mr. Fitterman said that regulators did not know what proportion of branches would show problems if all were examined, but he believed it would be less than 25 percent. Agency officials were still surprised that 40 out of the 161 branches had problems, having expected the figure would be lower, he added. **********To address the sales practice problems uncovered by the investigation, Mr. Levitt called for a series of regulatory and legislative changes in a speech today to the annual conference of the National Association of Securities Dealers. The changes are aimed at barring dishonest brokers from the industry, and at forcing brokerage supervisors to pay more attention to brokers' sales practices than their levels of commissions. **********""We'll be putting pressure not just on bad brokers, but on see-no-evil supervisors as well,"" Mr. Levitt said. **********Mr. Levitt said he supported legislation to provide limited immunity from lawsuits to firms that are frank in specifying the reasons for dismissing brokers on forms required by stock exchanges when a broker leaves a firm for any reason. Industry executives have said that they do not put the real reasons for dismissals on these publicly available forms for fear of suits by former employees. **********Mr. Levitt also endorsed the publication of disciplinary results by the brokerage industry's self-regulatory agencies. And he announced the creation of a panel to review compensation in the industry. He said that bonuses for joining firms had become so large that a temptation had emerged for brokers to take advantage of customers at one firm and then move on to another before a bad personal reputation took hold. **********Dan Tully, the chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch, will head the panel. The other members will be: Warren E. Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway who recently served as chairman of Salomon Brothers; John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company; Raymond A. Mason, the chairman and chief executive of Legg Mason Inc., a regional brokerage firm in Baltimore;,and Sam Hayes, a Harvard Business School professor. **********Brokerage industry executives sought to play down the report's findings. Marc E. Lackritz, the president of the Securities Industry Association, said the S.E.C. had only found 40 individuals with sales practice problems, while the nine companies employ 50,762 registered representatives. ""That's less than 1 percent of all the people they looked at,"" he said. **********But Mr. Fitterman called this an inaccurate description. The agency, in cooperation with N.A.S.D. and the New York Stock Exchange, looked at only 161 branch offices, not at the entire companies. And referrals to the enforcement division involved activities at 40 branches that sometimes involved more than one individual, he said. ""That doesn't mean 40 brokers,"" Mr. Fitterman said."

The uncertainty has created a new constitutional crisis for King Birendra, who was forced by mass protests into ceding his ruling powers to Parliament in 1990. **********Early in the vote count, the Communist Party of Nepal, the main force in the splintered Communist movement, built up a strong lead over the Congress Party, which won power in 1991 in the first election after the King relinquished power. But a late surge by the Congress Party narrowed the gap. **********The Communist coalition won 88 seats and Congress took 83. Another 20 seats went to the New Democrats, a rightist party with close ties to the king; the remaining 14 seats were spread among minor parties and independents. **********The contest for power has been sharpened by an election commission tally this week that showed that the Congress Party's late surge in returns from rural seats pushed it past the Communists in the popular vote, 33 percent to 30 percent. **********The New Democrats have been courted by the Communists and by the Congress Party, but have balked at joining a coalition. The party's leaders are said to feel that their hopes of sustaining the momentum they built up in the election, after winning only four seats in 1991, could be dashed if they accepted a junior partnership in a Government led by the Congress Party. Congress remains deeply unpopular for the factionalism and corruption that have marked its rule. **********The Communists, growing impatient, have warned that they will call mass demonstrations if the Congress Party seeks to remain in power. This has caused widespread anxiety, particularly in Katmandu, the capital. Many people have painful memories of the violence that broke out in April 1990, when protests against the land-owning oligarchy that exercised power under the King climaxed in a police fusillade against a crowd marching on the royal palace. At least 50 people were killed. **********On that occasion, the protests were organized by the Communists and the Congress Party. But old enmities between the two parties re- surfaced after the 1991 election, and have been sharpened by Communist accusations that the Congress Party's late surge in the current election was made possible by what the Communist leader, Man Mohan Adhikary, has called ""flagrant"" abuses. **********Mr. Adhikary has said that results for nearly 30 Parliamentary seats were rigged in favor of Congress candidates by stuffing ballot boxes, intimidating voters and other irregularities. But he has offered to join in a coalition with the Congress Party that would govern until new elections could be called. Although popular with many Nepalis, the idea has won little support among Congress leaders. **********While warning of possible trouble in the streets if they are blocked, the Communists have pledged to stick to moderate policies, including upholding the monarchy, maintaining good relations with the Western nations that are Nepal's main aid donors, and favoring a mix of state-owned and private businesses. **********Mr. Adhikary has sought assurances from the envoys of donor nations that they will not attempt to block the Communists coming to power."

The Socialists were furious after the conservative parties in the coalition, including Mr. Hata's, hastily joined together to resist any leftward turn in the Government's economic or security policies. **********Thus, Japan appeared to be moving toward what many here have long dreaded, growing ideological strife and a minority government unable to deal firmly with the country's deep economic problems. Mr. Hata is Japan's sixth Prime Minister in a rocky five years of corruption scandals and a far-reaching political realignment. **********Mr. Hata met this morning with Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the Socialists, but they were not able to achieve a reconciliation. **********Later in the day Mr. Hata named his cabinet, putting a close ally, Hiroshi Kumagai, the outgoing Minister for International Trade and Industry, into the important job of cabinet secretary, which will make him the Government's spokesman. **********Another critical post, Foreign Minister, was given to Koji Kakizawa, a conservative like Mr. Hata who recently defected from the Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Kakizawa supports an idea the Socialists fiercely resist, Japan's participation in collective security arrangments, including use of its military in overseas peacekeeping operations. **********In practical terms, the new Government, which controls just 181 seats in the 511-seat lower house of Parliament, is unlikely to be able to push through any bold legislation on the critical issues, like ending the recession, responding to American demands that Japan open its markets and reduce its trade surplus, and trying to halt North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. **********Japan begins a week of holidays Friday, after which the Parliament is expected to pass the overdue budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1. The Socialists helped draw it up and so are expected to support it. **********After that, many experts have said, the prospect is for growing ideological strife and a quick election -- just before an important meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in July and a self-imposed deadline for producing a market-opening package for the Clinton Administration. **********The parties underwent a day of bizarre maneuverings today, underscoring the state of flux after 38 years of one-party, conservative rule ended last summer. **********The Socialists were wooed ardently by Mr. Hata, who reportedly told his allies: ""It is indispensable for us to maintain unity with the Socialists. I will do my utmost to bring the party back into the fold."" **********The Socialists, however, insisted that the right-wing policies and authoritarian methods of Mr. Hata's key strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, made such a reunion impossible. **********No sooner had the Socialists set out their stand than they met and agreed to work closely with the conservative party that was ousted last summer, the Liberal Democrats. It was an unconvincing alliance, but it underscored the bitterness of the rift. **********""This is a case of, 'My enemy's enemy is my friend,' "" said Asahiko Mihara, whose conservative faction is estranged from Mr. Ozawa. **********Even if Mr. Hata, who is known as a conciliator, manages to lure the Socialists back with plum Cabinet assignments, few expect the marriage of convenience to last. If anything, the ideological divide in the Parliament is growing more pronounced. Both those on the far left and the far right are finding themselves increasingly isolated from the realignment of the parties toward the political center."

They're hard. They can be lonely. Some diet companies are not always straight with consumers. And who wouldn't rather eat chocolate ice cream and potato chips? **********Further, specific diets are a difficult sell no matter how desperate people may be to slim down, and that's essentially why Ms. Sullivan was so attractive to Weight Watchers International Inc. as a spokeswoman for a new program called Superstart! **********First, she fitted the demographic profile as ""our prototypical member,"" Jeff Myers, a marketing vice president at Weight Watchers, said. ""She's 40 years old, pleasing in her physical appearance, but in her own words, someone who has let herself go a little bit and the weight has crept up."" **********Yet resonating in that description were four years of emotional baggage, as Ms. Sullivan has revisited in scores of interviews since the print and television campaign began in January. The painful points: loss of her job as a host of ""CBS This Morning"" in 1990, the subsequent death of her father and a divorce. **********If all that drove her into hiding from public view, it also seemed to humanize her by the time she re-emerged as a corporate pitchwoman in a campaign in which she provides periodic updates on her weight loss.  Not even she realized it right away, long accustomed to the arbitrary distance generally kept between the well known and the anonymous. But through the early weeks of the campaign, a trip to the grocery store or a walk down the street invariably resulted in casual encounters with people emboldened as never before to make contact. **********""Like a woman who followed me off a plane just to thank me,"" Ms. Sullivan recalled in an interview last week. ""She had lost four pounds and said she couldn't have done it if she had not seen the ad campaign."" **********If the campaign has been a fairly stunning experience for Ms. Sullivan, it has dazzled the management of Weight Watchers, a subsidiary of the H. J. Heinz Company. By all available measures, business has increased significantly for 1994, improving the company's estimated 50 percent share of the weight-control market, and the only apparent variable has been Ms. Sullivan. **********Mr. Myers said that despite cold weather and heavy snows in the East, an earthquake in California and the plodding pace of economic recovery, Weight Watchers had seen regional membership gains of 5 percent to more than 20 percent. And those increases came during a time, industry officials say, when fewer Americans are participating in organized diet programs. **********""A spectacular success in a bad year,"" Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, the chairman, president and chief executive of Heinz, said of the campaign results. **********But why? For years, weight-loss companies have used endorsers as a hook, Weight Watchers among them, with the actress Lynn Redgrave. Brooke Shields recently signed with Slim-Fast. Jenny Craig has become a persona in her own right, starring in her own commercials. **********Yet Ms. Sullivan provides more than celebrity endorsement. Her return to prominence as a soldier in the battle of the bulge has turned a mirror on most Americans. Like them, she succeeds, fails and tries again. That her star once shined so brightly only made her thud that much louder. Yet, here she is again, standing, dusted off, the amazing shrinking woman. **********Dennis Branoff, the owner of 90 Weight Watchers operations in Michigan and Indiana, said he heard it from staff members almost daily. He recalled one woman's reaction to seeing Ms. Sullivan in a commercial: ""I remembered her story, her fall from grace. I empathize with that."" **********Even in ascent, it has not been easy for the former newscaster. She crossed that line from journalist to paid informer, and has been criticized. It happens a lot with journalists who do that, but they're not always worse for the wear. Linda Ellerbee told wonderful stories as a television reporter, then sold Maxwell House coffee and made enough money to open an independent production company, and now tells wonderful stories again as a television reporter, this time to children and teen-agers. Mary Alice Williams, a former newscaster for CNN and reporter for NBC News, now speaks the virtues of Nynex. **********Ms. Sullivan has endured her share of verbal darts and arrows since the campaign began. Doesn't bother her, she said. Besides, she's a smaller target now."

Sold directly to investors without a commission paid to a broker, no-loads now number about 2,000 out of the 5,000-plus funds in the United States, accounting for a hefty 31 percent chunk of the $2.2 trillion in industry assets. **********The downside to no-loads is that investors must do their own homework when selecting a fund, since advice-giving brokers typically don't deal in the no-load realm. Moreover, choosing a fund in the rapidly expanding and increasingly diverse no-load universe is becoming more complicated every year. **********Enter a new breed of intermediary to bridge the information gap: the independent, no- load fund adviser. **********Such individuals range from money managers to ""fee-only"" financial planners (who work directly with investors for a fee based on a percentage of assets) to newsletters that offer information and advice on when to buy and sell. **********""We narrow the universe down to about 20 funds, then look at their portfolios and talk with the managers about how they make 'buy' decisions, and then we'll test-drive the fund for awhile,"" says Steve Janachowski of Brouwer and Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser. Once a fund is chosen, ""we watch it like a hawk,"" he continued, noting that his conservative clientele favors ""middle of the road"" portfolios. **********""They don't want to swing for the fences,"" he said. ""They just want solid returns."" **********Strategies among no-load advisers can differ widely. Robert Markman, a Minneapolis money manager who oversees $300 million in no-load funds for his clients, says he tries to create a hybrid portfolio that blends three approaches: a ""buy and hold"" portion that includes vehicles such as The Yachtman Fund, which owns large U.S. companies; a segment that targets sub-markets (currently real estate); and a small portion in cash devoted to market timing, where he can quickly seize opportunities. **********Mary Malgoire of Malgoire and Drucker Inc., a Bethesda, Maryland financial planning group, uses a no-load fund portfolio as part of an overall financial strategy. Her preference is to allocate her clients' cash among 10 to 15 funds, with a core holding in a solid, low- cost index fund such as the Vanguard S&P 500, which buys and holds big-name companies. **********Miss Malgoire places a strong emphasis on asset allocation. ""You can say, 'Gee, our international fund went up 35 percent,' but if you only had 5 percent of your cash there you won't get the rate of return you hoped for,""she points out. **********But a minimum account for these advisers runs from $200,000 to $500,000, with annual fees that typically start at about 1.5 percent of assets annually. **********For investors who don't happen to have such sums to plunk down for personalized advice, a less costly avenue for information is the no-load newsletter. Roughly half of the 160 investment letters followed by the Hulbert Financial Digest, a Virginia-based publication that rates financial newsletters, are devoted to selecting no-load funds. **********The No-Load Fund Investor newsletter, for example, suggests three ""lifestyle"" portfolios of nine funds each, targeted at building net worth, pre-retirement and post-retirement respectively. For a subscription price of $119 a year, its editor, Sheldon Jacobs, tells his readers how to allocate their cash among funds, when to buy and sell. **********By contrast, No-Load Fund X, a San Francisco newsletter, classifies funds into four categories by risk, from ""most speculative"" to a conservative ""total return."" It then uses a quantitative system to target top performers in each group. It suggests that investors continuously upgrade by selling losers and buying winners. The publication, which also costs $119 a year, also comments on individual funds and answers questions from readers. **********A recent arrival on the newsletter scene is FundsNet Insight, a Wellesley, Massachusetts publication that offers advice and model portfolios based on ""no-transaction fee"" funds sold through the Schwab and Fidelity discount brokerages. Under this concept, funds from an array of families, both no-loads and some which normally carry a commission, are sold without a fee. **********""We think that no-transaction funds are a revolution in the mutual fund business, with the caveat that it's making the number of choices overwhelming,"" said Eric Kobren, editor of FundsNet Insight. ""Investors' heads are spinning, so I act as the strainer."" **********Mr. Kobren launched the newsletter after market research revealed that 70 percent of the subscribers to Fidelity Insight, his newsletter devoted exclusively to Fidelity funds, owned funds from other families. A one-year subscription to FundsNet costs $177."

Surprise turned to amused outrage when everyone realized that he was targeting the share listings page of a financial newspaper. It was his way of picking five shares for the firm's annual investment competition. **********For a broker, who makes his living advising clients which stocks to buy, it was an act of heresy. Unabashed, Mr. Cartoux, who is the firm's chartist, said that he is confident of beating the majority of his colleagues. **********'Picking shares has got nothing to do with analysis,"" he said. ""It is like tossing a coin - luck."" **********Behind the joke is a serious point. Are highly paid financial advisers and fund managers who cost mutual fund investors up to 1.5 percent annually really worth the money? Or would the investor be better off leaving investment decisions to a dart or, more scientifically, to a computer that runs a fund that simply mirrors the performance of a market index? **********The answer is an open secret in the world of financial advisers. Between the dart thrower and the stock-picking fund manager there is not much to choose. Investment games in financial magazines that pit a blindfolded monkey against top fund managers show that the monkey wins almost as many times as it loses. **********However, the outcome between the index and the fund manager is much clearer. The fund managers, sitting in mahogany panelled rooms in well-cut suits, are consistently beaten by the computer which passively tracks the S&P 500 in the United States, the FTSE in the United Kingdom, the Nikkei in Japan, or any other index. **********""The figures show that the indexes relentlessly perform better than three-quarters of all fund managers,"" said Nigel Legge, the London head of unit trust management at James Capel, which leads the market in British retail index funds. He said that over a 30- year period, investors would have got an 13 percent average real return by tracking the index in their chosen market. This is far better than if they had invested in the average mutual fund. **********So why do investors pay for expensive managers who can't even beat the index? **********The answer is partly that index funds are seen as boring. They are not going to do anything spectacular. For many investors the lure of a managed mutual fund is the upside. With a lot of luck and some good judgment investors in ""actively"" managed mutual funds can see spectacular gains. **********Anyone in the United States who put money this year into Lexington Growth & Income would have thumped the S&P index by a massive 259.71 percent. Nothing can take away from Lexington's performance but the figures tell a different story over the preceding three years. **********Investors who bought into Lexington late 1989 and then sold three years later in 1992 would have been in for a surprise. A large chunk of their capital would have vanished as Lexington was consistently one of the worst performing funds over those years. **********Tony Fraher, a pioneer of index funds in the United Kingdom and now chief executive of Singer & Friedlander investment management, said: ""There is always going to be a manager who will beat the index. The real question is: Can you - as the small investor - pick the manager every time? The chances are that you can't. So, if you want to be able to sleep at night you may be better off picking the index."" **********In the early '80s in the United States and a little later in Europe there was a move by small investors into index funds. It was fueled by advertisements in the international financial press showing that more than 90 percent of ""active"" fund managers did not beat the index. But it didn't catch on as much as many experts had predicted. Nevertheless, Wells Fargo, the San Francisco bank, now manages $150 billion in passive funds. Retail investors in the United States, with 17 percent of their stock investments in these kinds of funds, are becoming increasingly sophisticated with ""tilts"" and other performance enhancers. Outside the United States, the same trend has taken place, but on a much smaller scale. **********The logic of indexation seems overwhelming. Apart the performance reliability the investor pays between 0.3 to 0.5 percent in fees for a passive fund compared with 1.5 percent for an ""actively"" managed fund. By buying a ""passive"" fund the investor already has a head start. **********But over the past few years - just as indexation has taken hold as a mainstream investment tool - the figures that mocked fund managers for failing to beat the index have started to move in their favor. **********In 1989 in the United States only 22 percent of active fund managers beat the index, fairly typical for the preceding 10 years. Then in 1990 the swing started, with a steady improvement taking place right up until last year when 755 U.S. fund managers out of 1207 (63 percent) beat the index. A similar pattern can be seen in almost all other developing markets. **********Does this mean that the fund managers are doing their job better? Not necessarily, said Bill McBride at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. in New York. According to him, many funds have broadened their investment strategy beyond the standard S&P 500. In the current bull market this, more than an improvement in stock picking, explains how they are beating the index. **********""There has been an increase in small- company investments. These have out-performed the rest of the market over recent years. At the same time blue chip brand names and health care stocks - which make up a large component of the S&P - have taken big hits,"" said Mr. McBride. **********This outperformance by the small-company sector is common to most developed markets and is largely due to the kind of economic recovery that is taking place fueled by falling interest rates. Often smaller companies are more interest rate-sensitive than blue chip companies, which means that a cut in interest rates has a proportionately beneficial effect on them. **********Todd Doersch, marketing director of Barra, a California company that supplied computer models to the fund management industry, calls it the ""size effect."" **********""There is a tendency amongst active managers to equal weight their holdings. For example they might take 20 stocks and buy 5 percent in each. This builds in a bias towards smaller capitalized stocks which goes a long way to explain their improved showing."" **********But the most telling argument, which suggest that fund managers aren't doing their job any better, is the figures put together by Mr. Fraher at Singer & Friedlander in London comparing the performance of 117 mutual funds to the FT All Share index in the United Kingdom. The statistics show that in 1988 and 1989 the index came in its habitual place in the top performance quartile. In the next four years the index slipped into the second quartile and came 38th, 37th, 61th and 62d. **********A poor performance? No. When the figures are averaged out over the six-year period the index came a remarkable 14th. This is due to the erratic performance of the fund managers. Most private investors would be very happy with the return offered by the index. After all, how many investors could have hoped to pick the 13 funds that outperformed the index? **********The logic of ""indexation"" is increasingly accepted by the big pension funds and institutions. Hardly a week goes past without news that yet another pension fund has sacked its ""active"" fund managers and turned to index tracking. **********Can it be long before the private individual tires of paying heavy fees to a manager who can't beat the index consistently?"

And though Mr. Deng has tried, as Mao did, to control the shape of the succession, almost no one in China believes the succession arrangements will hold. **********For 1994, the business outlook in China cannot be separated from the political outlook. If 1993 was the year of ""maximum bullish"" on China, as one investment banker said last fall, 1994 will be the year of ""maximum uncertain."" **********Although, China's economy is expected to continue its boom, driven by social forces and foreign investment that were unleashed more than a decade ago, great seismic shocks could be lurking just over the horizon. **********Government economists say gross domestic product, after inflation, will slow to 10 percent from 13 percent last year, dragged down by bottlenecks in transportation and a shortage of credit. By any measure, that is a booming economy, and many economists are worried that another round of spiraling inflation -- exceeding 20 percent in urban areas -- is ahead, proving that the only truism about China's economy is its frightening fluctuations. **********Also consider: ***********The expected death of Mr. Deng would be likely to have wholly unpredictable consequences for 1.18 billion Chinese. Would students flood the streets to resume the quest for democratic reform they mounted unsuccessfully in 1989? Would the Government invoke martial law? Or would the conflicts that still exist in the Chinese leadership over style and substance simmer for months, even years, before they are resolved by palace intrigue, purges or a coup d'etat? ***********Will the Clinton Administration and China collide in a spectacular ""train wreck"" in 1994? Winston Lord, an Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs,warned this month that if Washington could not convince Beijing that ""significant, overall progress"" must be made in human rights before June, Mr. Clinton would revoke China's most-favored-nation trade status. That would have a big impact on the economies of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. ***********Will the crisis over North Korea's nuclear program develop toward the least desired outcome: the Clinton Administration, acting with its allies, uses military force. Whether China could sit out a new Korean conflict is a question that even China's leaders may not be able to answer, but the pressure from China's military would be enormous. **********The nature of risk analysis is that all things do not come to pass. **********Thus, the only thing certain about China fever is that 1994 will witness even greater numbers of investors stampeding toward the Middle Kingdom, despite the uncertainty.

Various films grapple with the issue -- from ""The Santa Clause"" to ""Miracle on 34th Street."" It's clearly time to put this raging controversy to rest. **********Yes, there is in fact a Santa Claus, though -- don't breathe a word! -- he sometimes goes by the name Brady White. (For simplicity's sake, and to avoid offending non-believers, we'll just call him Mr. White.) **********Even without his Santa costume, Mr. White often has trouble passing for a civilian. Carolyn H. Cobb recalls seeing a boy spotting Mr. White at a Texas mall and saying, ""Look, Mommy -- Santa's on vacation."" Even in red shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, he was instantly recognizable. **********""I don't think he's an impersonator,"" said Ms. Cobb, publicity manager for Neiman-Marcus, one of many stores that prize Mr. White's services. ""I think he's Santa Claus. I send him my list every year."" **********He has, in his chosen field, all the right stuff -- the ruddy complexion, the 50-inch waistline, the chest-length ivory beard. On top of that, Mr. White has the sweet-tempered, comic disposition to somehow remain in character virtually every waking hour. Even in street clothes, he can hardly eat at a restaurant or walk through a hotel lobby without being interrupted, typically by an adult with a gift request. **********All this has made him one of the nation's most sought-after Santas. Two weeks ago, the famed Beverly Hills Hotel made a last-minute request for a Christmas Eve appearance, but of course he was long since booked up. But he's busy the rest of the year, too: celebrity parties, gift shows in February, shooting catalogues in August, filming commercials any time. **********So precious is his image that his beard is insured by Lloyd's of London -- for an amount in the six figures, which is as specific as he would get. ""It's enough to take care of the reindeer,"" he said. Why insure it? Simple: ""Going up and down all those chimneys, it could get singed."" **********Mr. White, once an unemployed actor from Rhode Island, now mixes with all manner of celebrities, from Pope John Paul II to Madonna. He has been photographed in the Swiss Alps and other North Pole-like locations in the company of beautiful models swathed in furs. **********""I never, ever dreamed this would be my career,"" Mr. White said in an interview at the Bowers Museum here in Orange County, which is badly in need of Santa these days. His appearance here was one of the 18 he has made since Thanksgiving at charity events and client parties for his No. 1 client, the jeweler Cartier. **********THIS Santa with a flair for promotion and a quick wit has a client list as long as a Christmas stocking. **********His blue eyes twinkle in television ads for Cool Whip and the Postal Service. He gave life to ""Santa Calls,"" a Christmas Eve adventure story by William Joyce put on at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York and broadcast to other stores. Clad in diving fins and red swimming trunks, he poised pool side at a Dallas hotel to introduce Neiman-Marcus's famed his-and-her Christmas gift. **********But while glitz and glamour frame most of Mr. White's life, he says he is most gratified by bringing good cheer to the elderly, whom he finds to be particularly neglected during the holidays. He has first-hand experience. For three years, he spent a lot of time caring for his 82-year-old mother, who had Alzheimer's disease and died in September. He fits free visits to old-age homes and hospitals into his itinerary throughout the year, he said. **********Clearly, Mr. White has found his calling. But ""if this didn't happen to me,"" he said, ""I don't know where I'd be."" **********Mr. White fits a classic entrepreneurial mold, said Jon P. Goodman, director of the University of Southern California's Entrepreneur Program -- the ""wannabes who discover they can take a talent and turn it into money."" **********While there is little chance Santa will fall from popularity, Mr. White does face competitive risks and some unusual business pressures, Ms. Goodman said. But she did note that ""he's got to spend a lot of effort maintaining his image and his connections."" **********With trappings like a red Mercedes with ""SANTA"" plates and a thick gold Cartier watch, Mr. White does generate some resentment, Ms. Goodman said. ""Many of us are ambivalent about an economic system that rewards weirdos."" **********Like many entrepreneurs, Mr. White cashed in on serendipity. Twelve years ago, Mr. White was an out-of-work Los Angeles actor nine months behind on his rent. In desperation, he donned a red suit and phony beard for a Beverly Hills mall. He was discovered by The Herald Examiner, which polled children to find the best Santa in Los Angeles. The children chose him because, they said, he was unlike any other Santa because he was hip. He knew, for instance, the hot rock group of the day, Duran Duran. **********A talent agent who came to the mall to see the top Santa in action suggested to Mr. White that he quit shaving. He did. By the next season, he was on his way to being the ultimate Santa, even starting to fill out his 34-inch waistline. **********And taking home bigger paychecks. At the mall he got $4.50 an hour; it went to $5 after The Herald's page-1 story. Soon it took off into the heavens. **********For his first big commercial job, for Neiman-Marcus's fur catalogue, he earned $4,000. It was shot in Munich's town square, where Mr. White, who is 6 foot 2, was mobbed by Japanese tourists and had to be rescued by a police car. It was Mr. White's first brush with celebrity, and he quickly got another when he was put up at the Hotel Kempinski and overheard Luciano Pavarotti practicing in a neighboring room. **********He's showered with the perks of fame. ""They make a deal, like I'm somebody,"" Mr. White said. ""It's not Brady White. It's Santa who has all the free upgrades."" **********He can command $4,000 for an evening these days, but that once soared as high as $80,000 for six hours' work in a New York studio shooting a television commercial (he will not name the client). What kind of yearly pay does this add up to? He declined to say, except to remark, ""It feeds the reindeer and the elves and keeps Santa in Cartier jewelry."" **********Mr. White is much in demand on the celebrity circuit, where he has earned the nickname ""Santa to the Stars."" During Pope John Paul's 1987 visit to Los Angeles, Mr. White was granted the security clearance to greet the Pontiff at a helicopter landing pad. ""Santee, I like what you do for the children,"" the Pope told Mr. White. ""He didn't sit on my lap."" But then he added: ""Madonna did. She asked to be a virgin. I told her Santa can't work miracles.""  Santa stays au courant. Mr. White does a holiday rap tune. He sings a ""Jingle Bells"" parody adored by children: ""Jingle bells. Batman smells. Robin laid an egg. Batmobile lost a wheel, and Joker got away."" He knows all about Power Rangers, Polly Pocket and American Girl dolls. **********Not that he has to do research: he picks up news of the latest toy sensation from his lap. (City girls ask for Cartier diamonds; city boys ask for small-scale Ferraris.) **********He has learned a few tricks of the trade.  Mr. White, who declined to give his age but appears to be in his mid-40's, regularly gets a B-12 shot and flu vaccinations before Thanksgiving to head off the sneezing lot soon to be gazing up into his whiskered face. Also for health reasons, he wears white gloves on the job. **********With children, as with Madonna, he is careful never to raise expectations. At the Bowers Museum, a pig-tailed girl in a red sweater asked him for a pet. Mr. White furrowed his white eyebrows and inclined his head while looking intently into her face. ""A puppy might be kind of cold in the sleigh,"" he said. Crestfallen, her shoulders drooped. He leaned down and gave her a reassuring kiss on the cheek. **********HE has 27 Santa suits -- made by Adele's of Hollywood and San Francisco's Bay Area Display -- acquired over the years to fit his clients' varied needs. There is motorcycle Santa, who wears custom-made Harley-Davidson boots. There is patriotic Santa, who looks a lot like Uncle Sam. There is Aloha Santa, in red flip-flops and a grass skirt. **********During his visit here, Mr. White wore a traditional red velvet Santa suit embellished with a fancy Nordic twist. Besides rabbit fur trim, a braid of seed pearls and silver beads ran down the sleeves. **********Mr. White, who is not married, grew up in Pawtucket, R.I. and briefly attended a seminary, Our Lady of Providence. After enrolling in a local junior college and a New York theater school, he headed West. He began making connections with celebrities while working at the Roxy, a Los Angeles night club. He did celebrity gossip on ""AM Los Angeles,"" a local morning talk show. **********Now, he said, about 25 percent of his time is spent pitching new clients or auditioning. Other clients have included gift shows, specialty Christmas boutiques and a mall developer that needed a Santa school for its malls. **********It is easy to see why Mr. White is in demand. ""If you book him at 9 he's ready to shoot at 9:10,"" said Guilio Ghiro, art director for the retailer Lord & Taylor, which featured Mr. White in its holiday ""Tops"" catalogue. ""You don't even need makeup. He doesn't have to act. He personifies Santa."" **********""Other guys look the part but don't know what they are doing,"" said Elaine Rafferty, senior art director for the department store Macy's, which last year hired Mr. White for a print ad in which he held a camcorder.  ""He's like a professional model,"" she said, anticipating the pose and holding equipment so the brand name is revealed. **********""There's no one I've ever seen that quite fits the part as he does,"" said Michael L.  Campbell, promotions director for the mall owner New England Development Inc. of Boston. The company hired Mr. White to train St. Nicks for its malls in 1989. **********In the classes, Mr. White revealed his own strategies for preserving Santa's image ""that put children at ease and create magic for them,"" he said. For example, Santas never excuse themselves to go the restroom; breaks are needed to feed the reindeer. Santa always appears omniscient by learning a child's name beforehand through an assistant. **********Mr. White plays favorites with early clients. His only mall appearance these days is in the Olde Mistick Village in Mystic, Conn., where he annually makes a two-day stop the day after Thanksgiving. **********Nearly 300 children line up each day to see him. The wait can be 90 minutes. ""He carries on a little conversation with each one,"" said Christine Robertson, the mall's office manager. ""He winks at the moms,"" she said, and the children stroke his coat and beard. **********After the last child has gone, Mr. White relaxes a bit, lighting a cigarette or name-dropping about his latest gig. ""It's almost a letdown,"" Ms. Robertson said, chuckling at her own childlike impulse to believe in the holiday myth. ""He's a very good actor."" **********But of course he isn't acting. SANTA (A.K.A. BRADY WHITE) Favorite on-duty dessert: Chocolate chip cookies without nuts.  Favorite off-duty dessert: Chocolate souffle.  Favorite on-duty drink: Milk.  Favorite off-duty drink: Martinis, two olives and two onions.  Favorite on-duty vehicle: Sleigh or black limousine.  Favorite off-duty vehicle: Red Mercedes, license plate ""SANTA.""  Favorite color: Red."

That was clear yesterday, when the dollar slipped, even after the Federal Reserve and 15 other central banks bought billions of dollars on the world's foreign exchange markets to prop up the American currency. **********The process of intervention itself is not complex. Unlike interest rates, which are set independently by the Federal Reserve, currency intervention policy is set by the Treasury, in consultation with the Fed. Once the Treasury approves an action, traders at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York call up the major banks that deal in currencies and place orders to buy or sell dollars in return for foreign currencies. Process Akin to Judo **********But while the actions are straightforward, the impact is anything but. The process is more akin to judo than boxing, because the central banker uses intervention to divert the force of the market against itself. And if a country is not firm in its footing and confident in its strategy, intervention can well backfire. **********""It hasn't been the Treasury's finest hour,"" said Roger M. Kubarych, a former Federal Reserve official who is now general manager of Henry Kaufman & Company, a money management firm. ""It looked very tactical without an obvious strategy."" **********Academic economists have long argued that currency intervention is a weak tool at best, no substitute for policies that affect fundamental economic factors like trade flows and countries' interest rates. **********Intervention may be useful in a crisis to restart markets that may have been temporarily frozen by panic. In March, for example, after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the leading party's presidential candidate, the Bank of Mexico intervened to support the peso. Hope: To Scare Speculators **********Central bankers generally also hope that intervention can scare off speculative traders who follow market trends but have little fundamental conviction. If an intervention surprises the market, traders will retreat from their losing bets. **********This is where the martial arts of intervention come in: the central banks look to hit a market when it appears weak. That may explain why the Treasury chose to intervene on a summer Friday when many traders would be on vacation. But amid sharp drops of the dollar in Asia, the market was quite active. **********As the currency markets have grown, intervention of this sort has become more difficult. These days, interventions involve buying or selling several billion dollars at a time. While that sounds like a lot, it is dwarfed by daily foreign exchange trading well above $1 trillion. **********In the United States, the Treasury and the Fed generally split the costs of intervention. Before today's move the Federal Reserve owned $23 billion in yen and marks, and the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund owned $21 billion in the Japanese and German currencies. The Fed also has agreements to borrow an additional $32 billion from other central banks. Big Money Needed **********Many economists argue that for an intervention to have more than a psychological effect, it must be by the tens or hundreds of billions. **********""Now the central banks are only spitting in the ocean,"" said William Poole, a Brown University monetary economist. ""If they decided to spend $200 billion or $400 billion or some other big number, and they announced they had assembled a fund of $1 trillion, or some great big number, then they could raise the level of the ocean and make a difference."" **********Such a large intervention, of course, would put taxpayers at substantial risk if it were not successful and the dollars the central banks bought fell in value. But economists have long argued that if a country uses intervention properly, it should profit, buying its currency when it is cheap and selling when it is dear. Indeed, currency intervention is the ultimate in insider trading, because a central bank could buy a currency with the knowledge that it will soon take action to raise its value, raising interest rates for example. **********In 1992, European governments lost billions of dollars when they propped up the value of the British pound to keep it within Europe's semi-fixed exchange rate system, defying economic fundamentals. The onslaught by speculators and more conservative investors like mutual funds, which sold pounds, overwhelmed the central banks' action. Credibility at Risk? **********While the dollar is not so shaky as the pound was two years ago, many specialists still wonder whether the Treasury is risking the same sort of credibility crisis that bedeviled Europe. In particular, if the Clinton Administration wants the dollar to rise it will have to signal that it is comfortable with raising interest rates further, or risk that yesterday's action be taken as a sign of weakness. **********""As a substitute for a genuine change in policy, intervention may be counterproductive."" Mr. Poole said. ""If you don't follow through, people will say you aren't facing up to the situation."" **********As a result, some see intervention as a no-win game for governments where the benefits are transitory and the costs are high. Indeed, the Reagan Administration avoided it for most of its first term. That changed, however, in 1985 when Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d initiated coordinated international action to push down the surging dollar and set in motion the decade-long slide that has continued until now."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/04/business/the-media-business-for-cbs-a-qvc-merger-unlocks-door-to-cable.html,Bill Carter,1994-07-04,,995,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"For CBS, a QVC Merger Unlocks Door to Cable","THE MEDIA BUSINESS; For CBS, a QVC Merger Unlocks Door to Cable"," **********Wall Street gushed last week over the announcement that CBS and QVC were engaged to be merged, but it was not because anyone was convinced the two intendeds were necessarily a perfect match. **********As John Reidy, a media analyst at Smith Barney, put it: ""Forget all the QVC stuff. Barry Diller is the reason this is an awesome deal."" **********That theme was echoed throughout the television industry in the wake of the news that Mr. Diller, the chairman of the home-shopping channel QVC, would become the chief executive of CBS after completion of the merger. The prospect that CBS might finally gain some stake in the cable end of the television business seemed almost an afterthought. The focus was on Mr. Diller and the dynamic leadership he was expected to bring to the broadcasting company. **********""It makes perfect strategic sense for CBS to add a top-notch manager like Diller,"" said Jessica Reif, who analyzes media companies for Oppenheimer & Company. A Chance for Synergy **********But where exactly does QVC fit into that strategy? Mr. Diller said in an interview last week that there were ""absolutely natural advantages"" for the two companies to interact. He said QVC might follow up certain CBS programs with sales pitches for products related to those programs, but he indicated that he could not be specific. **********""Just the stance in both worlds gives advantages to develop various opportunities,"" Mr. Diller said. **********Those advantages apparently will be allowed to emerge naturally -- to use Mr. Diller's term. They were not the motivation behind the deal. **********Indeed, before the deal was announced last week, CBS never seemed to be in the market for a cable partner. On the contrary, as the bastion of ""pure broadcasting,"" CBS sent its executives out in public to poke holes in what they called the myth of cable's strength. **********When CBS did make an approach to the cable industry last fall, during negotiations over retransmission rights, it tried to start its own channel, based on CBS news programming. CBS never showed interest in home shopping as a program concept. **********Mr. Diller argued last week that QVC was really much more than a shopping channel, and that it offered ""some very primitive steps into interactivity"" among various media. He promised to explore those possibilities in the combined entity. **********Laurence A. Tisch, who would relinquish day-to-day control of the company to Mr. Diller under the proposed merger, said he had never disdained owning cable interests, but had only failed to find the ""right niche"" at the right cost. A Network in Need of a Partner **********Some industry analysts have argued that CBS had to diversify, even if diversification had to be thrust upon it. They suggested that any cable partner would be a good one for CBS, which has never explored the possibilities of the cable industry. **********But others see QVC as the ideal partner. ""I think QVC brings tremendous upside for CBS,"" Ms. Reif said. ""Beyond how they can complement each other in things like cross-promotion, QVC is already international, with outlets in Mexico and Europe."" **********Mr. Reidy, the Smith Barney analyst, said QVC would generate more cash flow than any other cable channel this year. He said a combined CBS-QVC might rival Capital Cities, the corporate parent of ABC, in attaining a more favorable revenue-to-earnings ratio. **********""On top of that, they may be able to create new services,"" he said. Strength in Bargaining **********But QVC's most immediate gift to CBS may be leverage in retransmission negotiations with cable systems. **********More than any other network, CBS pursued the right to seek compensation from cable operators for the retransmission of its stations' signals. After cable operators refused to pay that compensation in cash, the other networks created new cable channels and persuaded the operators to carry them. CBS had no such cable channel and was forced to defer a deal on retransmission rights for one year. **********Ms. Reif said CBS could use its link with QVC to win concessions from cable operators, either for increased distribution of that company's second channel, Q2, or perhaps a brand-new channel. **********""And it certainly helps to have some of the biggest cable owners inside the company now,"" Ms. Reif said. She was referring to the Comcast Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., two of the largest cable operators, who are the most significant shareholders in QVC. They would become significant shareholders in the new, combined company, but would not exert any direct power because Federal regulations bar cross-ownership of a cable system and a television station in the same market. **********Ms. Reif said she did not believe the cable industry giants planned to use QVC's link with CBS as a means to stage a creeping takeover of the network. ""Their role in CBS is minor,"" she said. New Praise for Malone **********But for the first time, CBS is moving into the same business as John C. Malone, the chairman of Tele-Communications and the man widely regarded as the most influential figure in cable. **********Just a month ago, Mr. Tisch was suggesting that Mr. Malone, who controls so many cable systems around the country, might abuse his power in his dealings with cable channels. Last week, Mr. Tisch praised him as one of the brightest minds in the business. **********So far, only one CBS employee has figured out a way to capitalize directly on the link to QVC. David Letterman, during his show on Thursday night, offered for sale commemorative plates depicting his face and that of his band leader, Paul Shaffer. **********Around the margin of the screen, Mr. Letterman placed a frame, like those used on QVC, featuring the price, $49.95, and the phone number to call. **********The number actually belonged to the program's head writer, Rob Burnett. Within an hour, he had 64 calls."

Then her financial adviser told her about a program that would allow her to provide home financing for her daughter while leaving the money invested. Mrs. Vincent decided the program made sense for her, since she could use the additional income. **********""Living off my income and being able to help one of my children who is going through a rough time still be able to live a decent life is a wonderful feeling,"" Mrs. Vincent said. **********How the program works: **********The Merrill Lynch Parent Power program, available in many states, allows a loan sponsor to pledge a portion of a securities portfolio to a borrower as financing for a house. The loan sponsor -- most often a parent or grandparent -- generally secures 30 percent of the loan amount. The sponsor does not co-sign for the loan, and is responsible only for the guaranteed amount, not the entire loan. In addition, the sponsor must keep a cushion in the securities portfolio to allow for declines in market prices."

Those licenses, for wireless ""personal communication services,"" are expected to draw billions of dollars in bids. **********Instead, Time Warner executives said, the company has decided to buy wireless capacity from existing cellular carriers on a wholesale basis and then resell service through its own sales organization under the name of Time Warner Cellular. **********And the BellSouth Corporation, the Atlanta-based regional Bell telephone company, has decided it will bid on only two licenses. Company executives said today that they might still strike deals with other bidders, and perhaps invest in companies that get carried away with auction fever and then find themselves squeezed for money. **********""There's going to be a lot of carnage out there,"" one BellSouth executive said. ""We may be able to pay much less than we would be paying on Dec. 5."" **********John L. Clendenin, BellSouth's chairman and chief executive, said his company would bid only for licenses covering the Carolinas and eastern Tennessee, two areas within the BellSouth region where it does not already own cellular telephone franchises. In addition, he said, the company may well negotiate minority positions with other bidders before the auctions. **********Though the two companies have adopted different strategies, both moves throw more cold water on the auction fever that has been building. The MCI Communications Corporation, the country's second-largest long-distance carrier, has signaled that it too may be only a minor bidder. Last week, MCI executives said they saw more appeal in re-selling capacity from other companies, much like Time Warner. **********On Friday, any company planning to bid in the first round of auctions, which cover 99 big regional wireless licenses will have to disclose which licenses it seeks. **********Over all, analysts still believe that bidding will be ferocious. The AT&T Corporation, which recently acquired McCaw Cellular Communications, will seek licenses in areas it does not currently reach. So will an alliance formed by the Bell Atlantic Corporation, the Nynex Corporation, U S West and Airtouch Communications, a spinoff of the Pacific Telesis Group. Another big bidder will be a venture of the Sprint Corporation and three cable TV companies. **********But Time Warner executives said they have alternatives. ""We think there is a less capital-intensive way of meeting our objectives,"" said Dennis Patrick, the president of Time Warner Telecommunications, who will run the new cellular unit. **********Mr. Patrick said Time Warner would offer its first cellular service in two weeks in Rochester, where it will use the re-selling strategy."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/business/fcc-issues-video-network-rules.html,Edmund Andrews,1994-10-21,,574,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,F.C.C. Issues Video-Network Rules,F.C.C. Issues Video-Network Rules," **********The Federal Communications Commission took steps today to let telephone companies move into the cable television business without forcing phone customers to foot the bill. **********But the rules left unresolved precisely how the telephone companies are supposed to allocate the costs associated with the construction of video networks. **********Virtually all regional Bell companies, along with big independent phone companies like the GTE Corporation, plan to invest several billion dollars each in the next few years to build video networks that compete against cable television companies. But a debate has erupted over who should pay the bulk of that investment -- current telephone customers or future video customers. **********The F.C.C. ruled today that video customers and shareholders should bear the direct costs of video services as well as some of the phone companies' overhead costs from both video and telephone service. But the agency declined to adopt any broad cost-allocation formulas, saying instead it would review the phone companies' video plans on a case-by-case basis. **********That left some consumer groups, and cable television executives, fearing that telephone customers still might end up subsidizing the phone companies' video services. **********""This is an incredibly bad decision that flies in the face of all logic,"" said Decker Anstrom, president of the National Cable Television Association. The trade association said it would immediately appeal the ruling in Federal court. **********Telephone executives generally said they were pleased with the F.C.C.'s action. But the plan to study individual proposals left some industry officials wondering how quickly the agency could clear a logjam of applications to begin building ""video dial-tone"" systems, as the proposed networks are called. **********Twenty-eight applications are now pending, and some have been sitting at the F.C.C. for more than a year. **********Jeff Ward, vice president for public policy at the Nynex Corporation, the regional Bell company based in New York, called the action a ""solid first step"" but expressed dismay that the agency had not set more specific rules. **********The telephone companies argued that phone rates should pay for much of the costs of the new technology required for the video networks, because the new equipment will also help provide advanced telephone services. **********The cable television industry, along with the Consumer Federation of America, asserted that the new investment should be borne primarily by video customers. Otherwise, they warned, ordinary telephone customers would finance the new construction whether or not they used the new video services. That would be unfair to telephone customers, the groups argued, and unfair to the cable companies trying to compete with the phone companies' subsidized video services. **********The issue is important to consumers, because local telephone rates are still set by regulation. Consumer advocates have long feared that telephone companies will try to pay for the new video networks by getting regulators to approve higher prices for basic phone service. **********The F.C.C. will require telephone companies to open their video networks to a variety of programmers. If the phone companies want to provide their own programming, and many do, they will have to set up separate programming divisions. **********To insure that none of these divisions, or no outside programmers, dominate a network, the F.C.C. ruled today that a single programmer could not control ""all or substantially all"" of the channels on the new systems. The video networks are expected eventually to offer hundreds of channels."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/world/france-s-james-bond-gets-the-scoop-on-the-hunt-for-carlos.html,Alan Riding,1994-09-18,,631,,The New York Times,World,News,article,France's James Bond Gets the Scoop on the Hunt for Carlos,France's James Bond Gets the Scoop on the Hunt for Carlos," **********While French newspapers have been competing for scoops on how the terrorist known as Carlos was arrested in the Sudan and extradited to France, many readers have been patiently awaiting the inside story on what really happened. **********For that, they will be looking not in the daily press but in fiction, specifically in ""S.A.S.: Hunting Carlos,"" the latest spy novel by Gerard de Villiers, whose mastery of political intrigue has made him France's most widely read author. The book will be published on Wednesday. **********Mr. de Villiers has published 115 books recounting the breathless exploits of Malko Linge, a polyglot Austrian prince who freelances for the Central Intelligence Agency to pay for the upkeep of his rambling family chateau. Total sales of Mr. de Villiers's books run into the millions. **********While laden with sex and violence, the apparent appeal of the S.A.S. series, named for Prince Malko's title of Son Altesse Serenissime or His Most Serene Highness, is their political authenticity. They have a record to prove it. Whether through prescience or good luck, several S.A.S. books have anticipated tumultuous events, including the assassinations of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India. With Carlos, Mr. de Villiers was again ahead of the game. Tipped off by friendly spies that the long-dormant case was beginning to stir, he spent May and June in Berlin researching the book. And he had almost finished writing it when Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was delivered to French agents in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, on Aug. 14. **********For the novelist, the arrest of Carlos was just a postscript. His story is about how East German intelligence files confirmed Carlos's ties to Syria and how they were used to blackmail President Hafez al-Assad into expelling the terrorist. **********""I knew the affair would be resolved one way or another by the end of this year,"" Mr. de Villiers said. ""I finished my book with Carlos chased from Syria. After that, I just added one page. But I still don't understand why Syria let him go without killing him because he knows so much."" **********In ""Hunting Carlos,"" of course, the facts are bent to give Prince Malko his customary heroic role, but the author insisted that his basic story line is true. ""I get no pleasure out of inventing,"" he said in an interview. ""I work with reality. It's what Americans call 'faction.' "" **********Mr. de Villiers's career as a novelist was born of his life as a journalist, including a stint as the correspondent for France-Soir in the United States and assignments covering the Vietnam War. But it with was the death in 1964 of Ian Fleming -- and, it was thought, of James Bond -- that he turned to writing spy novels. **********""A publisher friend of mine suggested I try to take Fleming's place,"" the 64-year-old author recalled. ""So I crossed three friends -- an Austrian aristocrat, an Austrian arms dealer and a French intelligence agent -- to create Malko."" Since 1965, four S.A.S. books a year have been published. **********But why, he was asked, does Malko work for the C.I.A.? ""There have only been two great intelligence services -- the C.I.A. and the K.G.B. -- in terms of resources and global reach,"" he explained. ""France has good services, but they're limited. Then there's the aura of the C.I.A."" **********So when ""S.A.S.: Hunting Carlos"" is published, Mr. de Villiers will nonetheless be in the news once again, interviewed less as the author of a new book and more for what he knows about Carlos. In the meantime, he can count on most of the 400,000 copies in the first printing selling within weeks."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/business/credit-markets-treasury-issues-prices-are-mixed.html,Robert Hurtado,1994-09-27,,683,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Treasury Issues' Prices Are Mixed,CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Issues' Prices Are Mixed," **********Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in a quiet session as the market awaited the outcome of a meeting that will determine the Federal Reserve's monetary strategy for the next few months. **********For weeks, dealers and investors have been split over the timing of another increase in interest rates by the Fed, which has already raised rates five times this year. Some expect a move to increase short-term rates to take place during a meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee that starts today, while others lean toward an action after the November meeting, which would allow the Fed time to assess the most recent economic data to see if the last few increases have worked their way through the economy. **********The price of the 30-year bond slipped 1/32 , to 9620/32 , for a yield of 7.79 percent, unchanged from Friday's close. Shorter-maturity bill rates were mixed. At yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month bills, rates surged to their highest level in three years. **********James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International, a market research and analysis firm, said the Fed would move to raise rates soon despite the past track record. ""Time and time again in the past they have shown that they err on the side of caution,"" he said. **********The market sees the need for another tightening to prevent an acceleration in inflation, he said. **********""The data we've seen over the last two months has provided two reasons for a rate hike,"" Mr. Hale said. ""First there are the signs of inflation pressures building, not just in commodities but also at the producer price levels. And they are certainly moving in the direction of the consumer level. It's only a matter of time."" **********The second reason, he said, is that economic growth is nearing a point were wage pressures will develop. **********But there are those like Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who called the market's fear of inflation unwarranted. Before a meeting of the National Association of Business Economists yesterday, she said ""today the economy is doing very well."" **********""In the next two to three years, the economy will continued to have a moderate expansion with modest inflation,"" she said. ""Fears of a large uptick in inflation are unwarranted."" **********The five rate increases by the Fed have raised short-term rates 125 basis points. A basis is one-hundredth of 1 percent. By historical standards, an increase of 125 basis points is not all that much, so another tightening would not endanger the economy. ""First they took the foot off the gas now, and now we see the need for them to start tapping the brake,"" Mr. Hale said. **********Some traders note that if the Fed does not change policy this week then the short end of the market will likely benefit as a safe haven. **********Yesterday's report on existing- home sales in August had a negligible impact on the bond market.

So far this year, inflation as measured by the C.P.I. is running at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, compared with 2.8 percent for the first six months of 1993 and 2.7 percent for all of last year. **********That level of inflation is not enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the fifth time this year, some investors said. **********The Fed ""must be pretty happy with what they've got going here,"" said Warren Schmalenberger, who manages $2.3 billion in bonds at Transamerica Fund Management in Houston. ""I don't think we're going to have another rate increase very soon. It will be in the fall of the year, if we have one."" **********A stronger dollar also helped lift bond prices, traders and investors said, because it makes short-term dollar-denominated investments more attractive to international investors. **********Some of the dollar's gains came amid unconfirmed rumors in the currency market that the Fed was planning to raise short-term rates by half to a full percentage point. But several traders said the dollar was overdue for a technical bounce after its recent sharp slide and that the rumors were an excuse for the rebound. **********Indeed, there were indications that many bond investors do not expect the Fed to raise soon, since yields on short-term Treasury securities fell. **********Even so, some investors argued that the Fed was still planning to raise rates. **********""We're steadily showing a modest upward drift in prices,"" said Harvey Hirschorn, director of fixed-income research at Stein, Roe & Farnham in Chicago, which has about $7 billion in government bond investments. ""That will persist,"" he said. ""The sooner it moves, the better for the market."" **********John Ryding, an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said the June consumer prices report should not reassure bond investors because ""it's a rear-view mirror."" **********""The issue for the bond is what the C.P.I. is going to do next,"" he said. **********Rising inflation means the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to keep raising interest rates this year, Mr. Ryding said. ""The process of disinflation is over, and the Fed has a lot more work to do.,"" **********The Consumer Price Index was the second of four reports this week on the economy's performance in June. Bonds rose on Tuesday in a week after the Government said producer prices were unchanged in June, surprising analysts who had expected a three-tenths of 1 percent increase. **********Today, the Commerce Department is to report on June retail sales. In a survey, economists forecast that sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********And tomorrow, the Federal Reserve will issue its report on the productivity of the nation's industry in June.

(BT,N)","COMPANY REPORTS; BANKERS TRUST NEW YORK CORP. (BT,N)"," **********The Bankers Trust New York Corporation said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell 45 percent, as trading profits dropped sharply. **********Bankers Trust, the nation's seventh-largest banking company, said net income fell to $169 million, or $1.98 a share, from $310 million, or $3.60, in the comparable period a year ago. The results fell short of Wall Street's estimates of $2.09 a share, from a survey of 15 analysts by Zacks Investment Research. **********While revenue fell in double-digits, the bank made up some of the decline by cutting expenses, including lopping off 40 percent of bonuses and other incentives. **********The chairman of Bankers Trust, Charles S. Sanford Jr., said the earnings ""demonstrated again the firm's ability to achieve a competitive return on equity in a difficult environment."" The company delivered return on equity of 15 percent. **********Trading revenue fell 35 percent, to $278 million, from $431 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Despite the fall, the bank's business of trading with its own money and selling derivative investments to clients ""performed well,"" Mr. Sanford said. Currencies and Latin American securities also contributed to revenue. **********Bankers Trust, more than many other banking companies, is vulnerable to swings on Wall Street because it has shifted away from making loans in the last decade in favor of trading and underwriting stocks, bonds and other securities and betting its own money on worldwide financial markets."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/25/business/company-reports-nynex-to-cut-22-of-work-force.html,Anthony Ramirez,1994-01-25,,1109,,The New York Times,Business Day,Statistics,article,Nynex to Cut 22% of Work Force,COMPANY REPORTS; Nynex to Cut 22% of Work Force," **********In the third big job reduction announced this month in the telephone industry, the Nynex Corporation said yesterday that it planned to cut 16,800 employees, or 22 percent of its payroll, in New York and New England by the end of 1996, but that it hoped to avoid sweeping layoffs. **********The announcement continues a trend among phone companies to seek new efficiency in an increasingly competitive communications business by paring their payrolls. On Jan. 13 the GTE Corporation said it planned to eliminate 17,000 jobs over the next three years, many of them through layoffs. And on Jan. 7 the Pacific Telesis Corporation said it would cut 10,000 positions by the end of 1997. **********Mainly to help cover the costs of its job cuts, Nynex said yesterday that it had taken $1.6 billion in charges against its fourth-quarter earnings, which even before the charges were below analysts' expectations. With the charges, Nynex reported a loss of $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter.  BellSouth Confirms Plan **********Meanwhile, the BellSouth Corporation yesterday reconfirmed its previously announced plans for a voluntary reduction of 10,200 positions, or 12 percent of its work force, and said it took a $1.14 billion charge against profits. BellSouth said the charge led to a fourth-quarter loss of $276 million. But without the charge, BellSouth said it would have earned $1 a share, its strongest quarter since the breakup of the old Bell System 10 years ago this month.  [ Page D18. ] **********On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Nynex shares closed unchanged at $39.25, while BellSouth's stock closed up 37.5 cents to end the day at $56.625. **********William C. Ferguson, Nynex's chairman, said in an interview that after the job cuts, which are to be completed by late 1996: ""We will be a leaner company that focuses on the fundamentals that we are all about. Lean and agile is where we are heading."" **********The Nynex cuts had been discussed for more than six months within the company, according to union officials. There were newspaper reports in December that Nynex could cut as many as 22,000 positions, although the company had declined to comment. To Work With Unions **********In contrast to the GTE move, which angered unions that said they were not fully informed before the announcement, Nynex's two main unions said yesterday that they expected to work closely with Nynex. Both the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said that Nynex had told them that the company wanted to avoid layoffs. **********""If Nynex has the compassion,"" said Jan D. Pierce, vice president for the Communications Workers, ""we have the creativity"" to devise incentives for early retirement and other voluntary reductions. **********Myles J. Calvey, business manager for the Electrical Workers, said that his union, too, would seek to achieve the job cuts through voluntary means, but he said of Nynex's management, ""It's not easy working with these people."" **********The unions said they planned to negotiate sweetened incentives for workers to leave voluntarily with full pensions and most, if not all, of their health care benefits. **********Under a hypothetical bargaining position suggested by the Communications Workers yesterday, a 45-year-old switch technician with 25 years service would be credited with an extra five years to become immediately eligible for a pension. Now earning $40,000 annually, he may thus be able to ""retire"" with a $20,000 pension and $15,000 in benefits but still be free to seek another job. Switch technicians, who maintain the switching equipment that phone companies use to route calls over the network, are among of the many positions being reduced in number because of the use of advanced digital technology in modern telephone systems. To Consider Proposals **********A spokesman for Nynex, which does not currently offer such retirement incentives, did not rule out the union suggestion, saying the company planned to consider any proposals that raised ""the comfort level"" of employees considering early retirement. **********The where, when, and who of the Nynex job cuts have not yet been determined, but most of the cuts will come in the slow-growing and high-cost traditional telephone business, and up to 12,000 cuts will be concentrated in New York State, with the balance in Massachusetts and the rest of New England. **********Nynex is reorganizing more than 400 offices into 30 or 40 regional work centers, whose location will help determine where and when jobs will be cut. Specific work units have not been identified for closing or consolidation into other units. There are more than 69,200 telephone workers among Nynex's 76,200 employees worldwide, who also include cellular telephone employees and those at international operations. **********Most of the planned cuts, as many as 12,000, will involve hourly union workers, in contrast to previous reductions that focused on high-wage managers. Over the last four years Nynex has reduced its work force by 13,000, with nearly all of the cuts coming through voluntary departures. **********Nynex's fourth-quarter loss of $1.24 billion, or $3 a share, compares with a year-earlier profit of $324.2 million, or 79 cents a share. Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $3.39 billion, up a scant 2 percent from $3.32 billion in the comparable period of 1992. Breakdown of Charge **********Nearly $1.4 billion of the $1.6 billion in after-tax charges are related to the cutbacks and business restructuring.  Of that amount, about $700 million will go toward severance payments for management and union employees, some $400 million for consolidation costs and $270 million for the cost of closing offices as part of Nynex's previously reported withdrawal in 1993 from the information products business. **********But even without the charges, Nynex's operating performance would have been weak and below analysts' expectations. The company said its quarterly operating earnings would have totaled $265.5 million, or 64 cents a share. **********Daniel Reingold, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, kept his 1994 full-year estimate of $3.25 a share and 1995 earnings of $3.45 compared with 1993 actual earnings of $3.20 a share. **********Even more than other regional Bells, Nynex is hampered by high costs and a work force that is being quickly outmoded by advanced digital technology. Because of a boom in demand for telephone services in the early 1970's, especially by Wall Street, Nynex hired many workers who are now too young to retire but too expensive to keep. **********Nynex pays the most of any regional Bell in wages and benefits, an average per employee of about $44,500 annually, compared with a Bell average of $40,700, according to Coyle Research of Lake Bluff, Ill."

Yesterday, the Nasdaq rose 3.98 points, to 739.50. **********There was little reaction by stock traders to yesterday's economic data, which showed no clear trend. The leading economic indicators remained unchanged in April, while factory orders were unexpectedly low, perhaps indicating less inflationary pressure. But initial jobless claims fell for the third week in a row. No Reaction to Bond Market **********Stock traders did not even react to a rising bond market, which has almost always lifted stock prices recently. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32 , to 8629/32 and the yield fell to 7.35 percent from 7.39 percent. **********Meanwhile, after a sharp decline Wednesday over inflation concerns, the British and French stock markets recovered. The Financial Times 100 index rose 1.67 percent and the French CAC-40 index rose 1.4 percent. The German markets were closed for a holiday. Japanese markets, which rose Wednesday, fell 0.21 percent yesterday. **********Today, the Labor Department reports May unemployment, which Wall Street economists expect to remain at 6.4 percent, unchanged from April. Private-sector analysts have often been wrong about unemployment data, which are volatile. When they are wrong, the stock and bond markets invariably react with sharp swings. **********Blue chips like Sears, Roebuck and I.B.M. fell. Sears dropped 1 7/8, to 50, in active trading despite an 8.8 percent rise in same-store sales for May. I.B.M. fell 1 1/2, to 62, after a Dean Witter analyst cut his recommendation from ""accumulate"" to ""neutral."" **********Food companies like CPC International, computer software companies like Oracle and media companies like Tele-Communications Inc. rose. CPC rose 1 1/4, to 50 1/8, in part because an S. G. Warburg analyst raised her recommendation to ""buy"" from ""hold"" after its introduction of new brands in Europe. Oracle rose 2 1/4, to 37 1/8, and Tele-Communications rose 1 1/8, to 2115/16 , on no immediate news. **********Synoptics Communications, a maker of equipment and software for computer networks, saw its shares fall 2 5/8, to 17, in part because a Kidder, Peabody analyst cut his recommendation to ""hold"" from ""outperform."" **********Paul Weinstein, the analyst, also cut his 1994 earnings estimate for Synoptics to as low as $1 from $1.25 a share and 1995 earnings estimate to $1.30 from as high as $1.80 a share. He cited sluggish industry sales of computers and network software products. **********The most active stock yesterday was again IDB Communications whose dispute with its auditors, who resigned, led to a trading volume of nearly 33 million shares Wednesday and 11 million shares yesterday. **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was below normal, with 271.6 million shares changing hands, about 10 percent below this year's average of 300 million shares."

Although the United States has committed itself in principle to an eventual expansion, it has not given potential new members a road map for how they might get there, and the ""partnership"" arrangement has essentially deferred the issue of accepting new members. **********""Much of the rhetoric that was used in the past was empty of substance,"" a senior Administration official said. ""Partnership for Peace is like getting guest privileges at the club -- you can play golf once in while. Now we want to send the bylaws and ask, 'Do you want to pay the dues?' "" **********The official added that the Administration wanted to begin talks with potential new NATO members about what he called ""the how and the why of getting into NATO."" **********But apparently not the when. The new plan still falls short of what many Central European countries want: a date certain for when they can enjoy the security umbrella that comes with full NATO membership. **********Under the emerging two-track plan, the Administration hopes to quiet the complaints of those countries that are unhappy with the slow pace of NATO expansion by defining exactly what they must do to join the alliance, and therefore, shifting the burden of membership to them. They would be told in stark terms what it will cost to join, what their troop commitment will be and what NATO regulations they must meet. **********To allay the fears of the Russians, who oppose any expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that excludes them, the Administration is also proposing ways to strengthen the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the 53-nation organization that includes the members of NATO and the former Soviet bloc. **********As a start, the Administration wants to change the name of the unwieldy organization to the ""Community on Security and Cooperation in Europe."" **********The Administration will also try to boost the organization's security role, particularly as a forum for peacekeeping and conflict resolution. But the new plan is also designed to neutralize proposals by the Russians to turn it into the pre-eminent security organization for Europe, more important than NATO. **********Already the American proposal has met with resistance among allies that are not eager to expand their defense commitments eastward. ""There is no need to rush the security agenda,"" said a senior French official who is part of a delegation visiting Washington to dicuss the matter. **********And it is unlikely that the American efforts to strengthen the Conference on Security and Cooperation will be enough to meet Moscow's concerns. **********But in one indication that the Administration may not have made the matter one of its highest priorities, a senior Administration official said today that Mr. Clinton would probably not attend the C.S.C.E. summit in Budapest in December."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/business/in-japan-girls-lead-the-digital-pack.html,Andrew Pollack,1994-12-22,,1098,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"In Japan, Girls Lead the Digital Pack","In Japan, Girls Lead the Digital Pack"," **********Apple Computer Inc.'s personal digital assistant, the Newton, didn't exactly catch on with American businessmen. Maybe the company should have focused on Japanese girls instead. **********Hand-held electronic organizers designed for children are beginning to catch on in the United States. But here in Japan, they are all the rage among pre-teen-age girls, and they are being snapped up as Christmas presents this year. Prices range from $30 to more than $200 for the devices, which are made by Casio, Sharp, Sega Enterprises and toy makers such as Takara and Bandai. **********The petite digital assistants include many of the same utilitarian functions of the adult versions, such as appointment calendars and phone directories. But they also have simple kids' games like fortune-telling and computer-animated virtual pets for the many children here who live in apartments that prohibit animals. And in the digital version of whispering, some of the devices can transmit short messages to another device across the room via infrared light beams. **********Analysts say the products represent a revealing example of how to make electronics appeal to children, something that is becoming more important as the personal computer becomes a family appliance. **********""By turning the organizer into a popular toy, Japanese companies are providing a case study on how to sell technology to the home,"" the Computer Letter, an industry newsletter published in New York, said in a recent issue. **********It is a lesson some American companies are eager to learn. Last week, for instance, Apple turned to Bandai, the Japanese toy company known for its popular Mighty Morphin Power Ranger characters, to make and sell a multimedia game machine that would be a simplified version of the Apple Macintosh personal computers. **********The children's organizers, along with the related children's word processors and new machines that print adhesive stickers, are also rare examples of electronics products that appeal primarily to girls, who, both here and in America, have generally shown less interest than boys in personal computers and video games. **********The gender preferences were evident at the Sogo Department Store in Yokohama, which was filled with Christmas shoppers on Sunday. A crowd of boys waited in line to try out the newest video game machines from Sega and the Sony Corporation. But a few feet away, an equally big crowd, almost all girls, grouped around a counter displaying a wide variety of electronic organizers. **********Whether such products become must-haves for American children remains to be seen. So far, few models have been offered for sale in the United States because the Japanese companies that pioneered the concept have been concentrating on their own market and because it takes time to make English versions of the original Japanese product. **********The Casio Computer Company, probably the leader in the children's organizer market, began selling one such product in the United States last year and is offering three models this year. They range from the relatively simple My Magic Diary, with a list price of $40, to the $80 Secret Sender 6000, which allows for infrared transmission of messages as far away as 25 feet and can double as a remote control for the television or the VCR. **********Casio expects to sell 600,000 children's organizers in the United States this year. Sega and Tiger Electronics Inc., based in Chicago, also have similar devices in the American market this year. **********The relatively high prices for such gadgets, to which people in Japan are accustomed, could be a barrier to American sales. **********American children are also more conversant with personal computers, which might make the organizers seem too simple -- and, possibly, unnecessary. About 33 percent of American homes had PC's at the end of 1993, compared with 7 percent in Japan, according to International Data Corporation, a market research firm. **********Casio's new organizer in Japan this year features ""pet telepathy,"" in which the child can make a computer-animated dog or cat run, lift a paw and so on, by waving a hand in various patterns in front of the same infrared emitter that is used to transmit messages. **********Eisei Nakagaki, Casio's senior general manager of North American marketing, said he was worried that this feature could be ridiculed in the United States as being for preschoolers. But American elementary school girls took to the virtual pets in focus groups, so Casio is now considering offering the product in the United States. **********In Japan, the main audience for the digital assistants is girls around 9 to 11, or in the fourth and fifth grades. A key to attracting such such young customers, Japanese executives say, is to make the products fun and cute, with soft colors such as pink, purple and blue, curvy shapes, and characters from cartoons like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Japan's popular Sailor Moon. Advertisements for the organizers stress how much fun they are. **********Industry executives here say that while boys this age spend their time on video games and sports, girls have outgrown dolls and are looking for new amusements. Before such products were developed, magazine polls found that electronic organizers were among the products most desired by such girls, perhaps because they saw their parents using them. **********""Girls admire something being used by adults,""' said Keiko Okada, manager of life style software for the Sharp Corporation, which makes electronic organizers for both children and adults. Hence, while the machines must be simpler than the adult versions so that kids can use them, they must have the basic functions of adult organizers to avoid losing appeal. **********For Umi Ishikawa, 11, of Tokyo, the reason for buying a digital assistant was simpler. ""Many of my friends have one,"" she said. **********Umi said she uses her machine mainly to store addresses and phone numbers. ""You can also do fortune-telling, including testing your luck with your favorite guy,"" she said. (In some products, one enters the birthdays of the boy and girl and the machine will assess their compatibility.) **********Casio expects to sell 500,000 children's organizers and 500,000 adult organizers in Japan this fiscal year. The company predicts total industry sales of children's organizers in Japan will reach 1.2 million this year, compared with 800,000 last year and 400,000 in 1992. The Takara Company introduced the first children's organizer in 1991. **********Beyond the basic functions, companies are competing by developing new games, gimmicks and features. **********Sharp's An, priced at 23,000 yen, or $230, can be used to record short diary entries. And in a digital flourish that any adolescent diarist would appreciate, the entries can be encrypted to protect them from the prying eyes of Mom or anyone else who doesn't have the key to the code."

Recovery in German share prices seems unlikely before autumn."," **********SHARE prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange have been in retreat since higher American interest rates created turmoil in global bond markets in mid-May. That turbulence has prompted most experts on German stocks to shift to a very defensive strategy, and few expect any recovery to begin until the autumn. **********Until then, they see a highly volatile market with interest rates remaining the driving force. Some analysts are cautiously recommending the banking, insurance, chemical and steel sectors. **********""I'm not as pessimistic as some analysts,"" said Hans-Joachim Pilz, head of research at M. M. Warburg & Company, a private bank based in Hamburg. ""I think we will see prices turning higher in the autumn. But the German stock market always reacts to the German bond market, which has been a blood bath of late."" **********The currently glum mood contrasts with the optimism that reigned while stocks pushed higher during the first three months of this year. That optimism was grounded on expectations of strong earnings growth stemming from aggressive cost-cutting and rising exports, as well as on a growing belief that Germany's recession-racked economy was finally on the road to recovery. **********Recent statistics, like the 2.1 percent year-on-year rise in gross domestic product in the first quarter, would seem to confirm that view. But investors, rather than being reassured, fear that growth could heat up inflation, which the Bundesbank now puts at a stable 2.5 percent. **********The other positive fundamentals have been overshadowed by developments in the bond markets, which touched off the downturn. A week after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the fourth time this year on May 17, stocks throughout Europe began sliding. Frankfurt's 30-issue DAX index fell 7.2 percent in the following nine trading sessions. It finished at 1,994.42 yesterday, well down from the 2,266.68 at which it began this year. **********A slew of financial scandals involving some of Germany's most widely known banks and companies have led to a capital outflow. **********""These scandals a la Schneider have undermined confidence in German stocks, particularly among foreign investors,"" said Albert Morillo, the head of European equities trading at Scottish Widows, one of the leading British pension fund companies. ""It is the sort of thing one didn't think happened in Germany."" **********Dr. Jurgen Schneider A.G. was Germany's largest property developer until it filed for bankruptcy on April 15. Its founder and namesake vanished, leaving debts of more than $2.98 billion. About $715 million of that was owed to Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's largest commercial bank. **********The latest scandal arrived earlier this month, when Balsam A.G., which makes surfaces for tennis courts and running tracks, filed for bankruptcy after its board was arrested on suspicion of committing massive fraud. The company owes 50 German and foreign banks about $900 million. **********The prospect of further increases in American interest rates has also been pulling international capital out of the German stock market, with much of it moving toward dollar- or yen-denominated instruments, experts said.

In Japan and the United States it's more than 50 percent, and in the United Kingdom it's 143 percent,"" he said. ""That shows where we are, namely, back in the woods. **********""We can't measure up internationally as long as only 6 percent of Germans own shares, a level that hasn't changed over the last 10 years despite the improvements we've made."" **********Mr. Breuer cited arcane tax laws, a lack of listed companies, inefficient floor trading, decentralization and low market liquidity as among the several prominent problems with Germany's financial image. **********But the main problem, he said, was not the market dominance of the country's bank and insurance companies or lack of adequate supervision but the almost total lack of a ""serious equity culture."" **********Fewer shareholders are attending meetings, he said. To reverse the slide, he said, Germany needs to replace the law that requires big banks to vote on behalf of small shareholders who ""deposit"" their shares at the banks with a system involving proxies, which now aren't allowed. **********Germany also needs to end its tax discrimination against foreigners investors, who are not entitled to the same tax rebate on dividend income as German investors are, Mr. Breuer said, and the role of German supervisory boards needs to be reconsidered."

The critical question is, of course, to what degree? **********Since the announcement in September that Mr. Pearlstine, 51, would succeed Jason McManus, who is retiring at the end of the year, the question of how much Mr. Pearlstine would involve himself in the individual magazines has been an overriding concern. Managing editors feared they would lose the editorial autonomy and independence that they had under Mr. McManus. **********Before Mr. McManus took over in 1987, there was a tradition of strong editors in chief who, following in the footsteps of Henry Luce, actively involved themselves in the individual magazines, some of them to the extent of editing articles line by line. **********Mr. McManus, on the other hand, believed that the best way to develop strong managing editors was to let them run their magazines without interference. **********The Time Inc. magazines are Time, Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, People, Money, Entertainment Weekly, Sports Illustrated for Kids and In Style. An editorial group that develops new-media projects also reports to the editor in chief. **********So far, editors say, Mr. Pearlstine has been exceedingly careful not to interfere, instead asking good questions, listening rather than talking, expressing interest and revealing little. The general impression is that he is genuinely interested in the magazines, not because he wants to control them but because he really enjoys ideas and journalism. **********He is also gaining a reputation for being a quick study, having a good command of the issues and, in the words of one editor, being ""a vacuum cleaner for information."" **********A managing editor at one magazine said: ""I don't see him compromising the autonomy of the magazines. He has suggested stories that we might be interested in pursuing and that's been very helpful. You like some guidance."" **********Whether all this good will continues after Mr. Pearlstine begins to grapple with real-life issues remains to be seen. **********In the meantime, Mr. Pearlstine says he enjoys dealing with journalistic issues. **********""As I analyze myself,"" he said, ""I think I am at my best when I am intimately involved in thinking about coverage and the story: What are we focusing our energies on? Do we want more multimedia coverage in Entertainment Weekly? Is it time to do a story on X? I think it will be very, very interesting to see if the job encourages that or not."" **********He has already found the job to be a relentlessly demanding one, where long days could easily be filled by reading memos and going to meetings and conferences. **********Mr. Pearlstine said he was surprised at how much multimedia activity was taking place at Time Inc., including on-line versions of magazines, production of CD-ROM's and a presence on the Internet. **********The development of multimedia publishing is one of his interests, he said, though he declined to say how much of a priority it would be. He said magazines would be a mainstay of multimedia development, however, since editorial content is so vital to the success of interactive media. **********""If there is a future in multimedia, it is not just putting full text on line, but creating new products that are going to require a sophisticated level of technology,"" he said. **********Although the company's parent, Time Warner, has been plagued for years by rumors that it might eventually sell its magazines, Mr. Pearlstine said that such a notion had never come up in his meetings with Time Warner officials. **********""It's sort of a presumption that magazines in their own right are integral to the future of Time Inc.,"" he said. **********People at the company say this has been a year of record earnings for the magazines. All are profitable, except for Entertainment Weekly, a four-year-old publication that is still on its start-up schedule. This year it is up in circulation, advertising and newsstand sales. **********""There is a lot of pressure to measure yourself by the financial success of the publication,"" he said, referring to the group of magazines. ""I understand and accept that, but I also want us to be measured by the quality of the coverage."" **********Mr. Pearlstine has told editors, for instance, that he would like to respond to People's desire for more staff and see that the magazine continues to get the talent it needs. **********Time Inc.'s annual cash flow is about $400 million. In 1995, however, paper, printing and distribution costs are expected to rise about 10 to 15 percent. **********The question of hiring staff for the magazines, all of which were pruned extensively in recent years, must be considered in light of such increased costs, Mr. Pearlstine said. **********Mr. Pearlstine is still getting high marks from editors, not only for his energy and his sensitivity to nuance but because of his way with people.  ""The world is full of dynamos who are rude, but he is affable,"" one person said. ""I mean, he's got manners. He actually listens to you."""

But the accord does not offer the kind of economic jump-start many people expected from the winner of last month's presidential election. **********The agreement also does not change the exchange-rate policy for the peso. There was speculation the peso would be allowed to depreciate more quickly in order to make Mexican exports more competitive. **********The new pact gives the first evidence that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who won the election, will side with stability over economic stimulus and follow the current President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in fighting inflation even at the cost of workers' salaries. When the first pact was signed in 1987, inflation was 159.2 percent. Now it is under 7 percent. **********The reaction of the more independent parts of unionized labor in Mexico was that workers had again been asked to bear the brunt of the stabilization program. **********""It's an arrangement put together for the purpose of guaranteeing tranquillity during the process of political transformation,"" said Francisco Hernandez Juarez, president of the powerful telephone workers' union. ""But from the point of view of salaries, we've insisted that the workers need much, much more."" **********But it has been the cooperation of Mexico's largest labor organization, the pro-Government Confederation of Mexican Workers, that has made the Government-business-labor pact succeed as the centerpiece of Mexico's anti-inflation policy. **********Although Mr. Zedillo does not take office until Dec. 1, a senior Finance Ministry official said all the terms had to be approved by Mr. Zedillo's advisers. **********The influence of Mr. Zedillo even extended to a change in the name of the agreement, which used to be the Pact for Stability, Competitiveness and Employment. The new agreement is the Pact for Well-Being, Stability and Growth, which most Mexicans would immediately associate with his campaign theme, ""Well-being for your family."" **********The terms of the new pact tie several important indexes to a projected rate of inflation for 1995 of 4 percent. Thus prices for Government-controlled goods like gasoline, fuel and electricity will be allowed to increase by no more than 4 percent. **********Increases for Mexico's low manufacturing salaries are also set at 4 percent. (The minimum wage is less than $5 a day.) **********But since last year, when wages in Mexico became an issue in the debate over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican officials have been pressed by the United States to raise salaries. In addition to the 4 percent increase, productivity bonuses can be added to union contracts. **********The exchange rate policy will remain as it has been since 1992."

It also is clear that French taxpayers and the bank's big competitors, such as Banque Nationale de Paris and Société Générale, will be forced to bear much of the pain of a large government bail-out. **********Analysts are bracing for a 1993 loss of anywhere between 2 billion and 26 billion francs, depending on how far the government thinks it can go to financially restructure the state- owned bank without sparking a revolt by private-sector institutions or triggering a refusal by the European Commission for violations of its restrictions on state aid. **********On Tuesday, Edmond Alphandéry, the finance minister of France, confirmed that the government plans to inject a significant amount of cash into the bank, while also permitting it to clean its 54 billion-franc real estate loan portfolio of doubtful loans. **********""The state will do its duty - there will be a recapitalization of Crédit Lyonnais,"" Mr. Alphandéry said, although he did not hint of the amount to be awarded. **********The troubled property loans - which are reported to total 40 billion francs - will be transferred to a separate company that will be guaranteed by the state. Mr. Peyrelevade also is expected to detail his plan to reduce the bank's industrial holdings, which include 20 percent stakes in Aerospatiale and Usinor-Sacilor, both of which are losing money. **********Even if the balance sheet is cleared, ominous clouds will still be hovering over the bank for months because of the legal war over Crédit Lyonnais' involvement in the takeover of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. by the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti. The bank took control of the Hollywood studio when when Mr. Parretti defaulted on his loans. **********In February, Mr. Haberer, now chairman of Crédit National, and François Gille, the managing director of Crédit Lyonnais, were charged by a Swiss judge with complicity in the 1992 bankruptcy of Sasea SA, a company involved in the MGM deal and headed by Mr. Parretti's associate, Florio Fiorini. **********On another front, Crédit Lyonnais and MGM are set to go to trial in June in Los Angeles against Kirk Kerkorian and other former executives of MGM. Crédit Lyonnais claims it was deceived about the studio's financial status when it funded Mr. Parretti's acquisition in 1990. Mr. Kerkorian's $500 million countersuit against the bank is set to be heard at the same time. **********""They're getting hit on all sides,"" said Sheila Garrard, analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. She was predicting a loss of 2 billion to 4 billion francs, although she said her prediction could be well off the mark. ""It's impossible to know the quality of the bank's assets,"" she said. **********Cash injections of 4 billion to 5 billion francs have been postulated over the past few months, but analysts now say even that sum might prove woefully inadequate. **********""4 billion plugs a hole, but not much more than that,"" said Sasha Serafimovski, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in London. **********In September, the bank reported a loss of 1.05 billion francs for the first half of 1993."

If the agency, which insures pension benefits, succeeds in its bid to take over Western Union's pension obligations, it would become New Valley's largest creditor, and its opposition could ruin the company's plan. **********The pension agency's action means that the sale of Western Union's money-transfer business to the First Financial Management Corporation, which is the cornerstone of New Valley's reorganization plan, will almost certainly have to change. **********In fact, New Valley quickly sought to counter the agency's action. The company, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., announced late yesterday afternoon that it had cobbled together a tentative agreement with First Financial, a financial services company in Atlanta, to assume the pension liabilities. **********First Financial agreed last month to buy the bulk of Western Union for $1.2 billion, which New Valley intended to use to pay creditors. Under that plan, First Financial would not have assumed the pension liabilities. The pension agency contended that the shell company to be left with those obligations after the sale would be unable to meet them. The shell company would have $383 million in cash and a dying messaging business. **********The agency said the original agreement would leave the Western Union pension plan underfunded by $178 million. The pension plan, currently almost $400 million in the red, covers about 16,000 employees, including 10,000 retirees. **********New Valley's creditors are now voting on the company's reorganization plan, which is contingent on the original agreement with First Financial. It was unclear what impact yesterday's developments might have on the process. A court hearing on the vote is scheduled for Nov. 1. **********The new arrangements with First Financial would require the approval of Judge Novalyn L. Winfield, who is presiding over the New Valley bankruptcy in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Newark. **********During the auction of Western Union last summer, First Financial proposed an alternative bid in which it would have paid $830 million for the money-transfer business and assumed the pension liabilities. Judge Winfield ruled that the bid that excluded the pension fund provided the best value to creditors. **********Warren R. Bechtel, a New Valley spokesman, said the deal that New Valley and First Financial began hammering out yesterday was different. **********Judith Welles, a spokeswoman for the pension agency, said yesterday evening that the agency would proceed with its attempt to take over the pension fund until it received notification in writing of New Valley's deal with First Financial. **********Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of United States District Court in Newark has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the agency's request to take over the pension fund. **********The agency expressed concern about what would happen to $383 million in cash, which would be New Valley's only significant holding after the bankruptcy. In particular, the agency said it was concerned that the cash would find its way to the Brooke Group L.P., a beleaguered conglomerate that is New Valley's largest shareholder. **********Brooke is controlled by Bennett S. LeBow, who is New Valley's chairman. Brooke has roughly $215 million in debt that is costing it about $32 million a year in interest, and it is hard pressed to come up with cash to take care of its obligations, according to court documents. **********The pension agency ""concluded that New Valley is Brooke's most likely source of cash and that there was an unreasonable risk that New Valley would upstream cash to Brooke,"" the agency said."

Petrie would then dispose of its 1,700 retail stores, liquidate its operations and distribute the Toys ""R"" Us stock to its shareholders. Because the distribution would be in stock rather than cash, the transaction is expected to be tax-free. **********The transaction is contingent upon a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that the transaction would be tax-free to Petrie, its shareholders and Toys ""R"" Us. ""Our experts and Petrie's experts have told us this fits the rules,"" said Michael Goldstein, vice chairman and chief executive of Toys ""R"" Us. **********Robert Willens, a tax specialist and managing director for Lehman Brothers, said: ""Just last month a similar transaction went through -- the Equity Strategies Fund owned a large block of Neighbors Industries, and they used the same technique that Petrie is using, and they received I.R.S. approval. I don't anticipate any problems."" Stores to Be Sold **********The plan is also contingent upon the sale of the retail stores, which operate in all 50 states under the names Marianee, G& G, Rave, Jean Nicole, Winkleman's, Stuarts and M. J. Carroll. Petrie, which is based in Secaucus, N.J., said it was examining several options to dispose of the stores, while allowing them to continue operating under current management. **********One option, the company said, was to sell the stores to a third party. It added that several parties, which it declined to name, were discussing the matter, with a proposed price of $200 million to $250 million. Petrie said one potential buyer was discussing an all-equity proposal. **********Mr. Petrie, 91, is by far the largest shareholder in the company, with about 60 percent of the Petrie Stores common shares. **********Allan Laufgraben, Petrie's chief executive and president, and Peter A. Left, the chief operating officer, expressed optimism that the disposition of the stores would go smoothly. **********""We've realigned the division and moved beyonds malls, where we're still very active, to strip centers,"" Mr. Laufgraben said. ""This lowered our occupancy costs."" Rights Offering Considered **********Other possibilities for the retail stores include a rights offering in which Petrie shareholders could buy shares in a holding company that would own the stores, or a public offering of shares in a new holding company. **********The stores have 11,000 full-time employees, he said, and 6,000 to 9,000 part-time workers. **********Mr. Goldstein of Toys ""R"" Us said the transaction would help his company in two ways. By absorbing the 14 percent stake of Petrie, Toys ""R"" Us would still have a better distribution of stock, with no single party holding more than an 8 percent stake, he said. Also, the deal would increase shareholders' value by lowering the number of shares outstanding by 3.3 million."

No Reports Confirmed **********Copley reiterated in a statement yesterday that ""although it has received reports of deaths and illnesses"" involving albuterol, ""none of these reports have been confirmed."" **********On Jan. 5, the company recalled albuterol one-half of 1 percent solution, an inhalant that was its best-selling product, after it found bacterial contamination that could cause pneumonia in vulnerable patients. **********Contrary to earlier reports, the company said it had not received final approval from the F.D.A. to ship generic versions of two other drugs: Lopressor for heart and blood pressure problems and naproxen sodium tablets for arthritis pain. **********Anthony Bonelli, Copley's president, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that the F.D.A. had given a general go-ahead for the two products, which some analysts had said meant the company's problems with the Food and Drug Administration did not go beyond albuterol. **********But Mr. Bonelli said Copley, which is based in Canton, Mass., would not proceed with naproxen and Lopressor for business and marketing reasons. ""The decision is in no way related to the albuterol recall,"" he said. The next step for any new product would be for the company to make three batches and seek final F.D.A. approval to ship the product. **********Susan Cruzan, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said yesterday that the agency was still investigating. In a preliminary report, F.D.A. inspectors described problems with the quality controls of albuterol, including the lack of a written procedure ""for routine microbiological monitoring,"" and problems with purity testing records for the water used to make the solution. **********Mr. Bonelli has said the company is working with the F.D.A. to resolve the problems. The company said yesterday that it believed the contamination ""may have been primarily the result of a rinsing procedure"" in a factory packaging line, which it said was used exclusively for equipment involving albuterol. **********Jack Lamberton, an analyst at NatWest Securities, said it was too soon to assess potential liability. ""We really don't know how many people who were taking the product can show some sort of damage,"" he said, ""or whether the lawyers can prove a connection to albuterol."" **********Lawyers in Chicago and Arizona have filed lawsuits against Copley on behalf of at least nine people who are claiming damages involving abuterol. Jacoby & Meyers, a law firm based in Tucson, Ariz., is running television commercials in five cities urging albuterol users to get in touch with physicians and the law firm.  Copley has deep pockets. Hoescht Celanese, a unit of Hoescht A.G., the big German chemical company, paid $55 a share for 51 percent of Copley's stock last November.

Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.44 percent, from 6.40 percent on Friday, when many markets closed early as a result of the snowstorm that hit the Northeast. **********The intermediate maturities were unchanged to slightly higher, and short-term maturities were mixed. **********Matthew Alexy, a goverment trading strategist at CS First Boston, believes the market's task on the economic reports this week will would be to sort through weather-related distortions while waiting for data on inflation. **********With the last increase in short-term interest rates still fresh on investors' minds, traders are waiting to see if this week's reports will give the Fed grounds to tighten credit again. The central bank has already made it very clear that it will take a tough stand against inflation and economists believe that the Fed would rather have a weak economy than to have rising inflation from a strong one. **********This week's economic reports begin with January industrial production today, followed by January housing data tomorrow and the January Consumer Price Index on Thursday. The index, considered the most important report of the week, is expected to be up three-tenths of a percent, according to economists surveyed by the Reuters news service , compared with two-tenths of apercent in in December. **********Some traders say the data should cause the 30-year bond to trade in a range between 6.25 and 6.50 percent, with the range holding at least until the February economic data starts to come in, they said. **********The market is also concerned that the Fed's last interest rate increase may have been one sign in a series, traders said. ' **********'I think we have reached some turning point with the psychology of professional traders turning negative,"" said Mark J. Grant, managing director for fixed income at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. ""Any statement by the Fed on the short will be felt by the long end as well."" **********Bad inflation numbers could force another move by the Fed in February or early March, he said. But he does not see an exodus from the fixed-income market. ""About 70 percent of fixed-income money remains some place in the debt market without any great dislocation,"" he said. **********Mr. Grant said the market lacked any follow-through trading on concerns that a trade war might develop between the United States . and Japan after trade talks collapsed on Friday. **********The Japanese stock market, which closes hours before the United States market opens, was down sharply in what was seen as disappointment over the failure of the talks. ""This may have set the tone for our own market at the opening bell,"" Mr. Grant said. **********Analysts at C. J. Lawrence said some people in the market believed that the dollar's drop against the yen could cause Japanese investors to sell dollar-denominated holdings, much of which are in Treasury securities. Release of Economic Report **********The only economic report released yesterday was the December business inventories report, which had little impact on bond prices. Besides being old data, the number was unchanged from the six-tenths of 1 percent rise in November, and pretty much what the bond market expected. **********Elsewhere, yesterday's weekly auction of new Treasury three- and six-month bills was regarded by some as another solid auction, while others viewed it a little sloppy that left dealers holding a sizable chunk of the auction issue. **********The average rates at auction rose a few basis points from the previous week, with the three-month bill up to 3.28 percent from 3.24 percent.

Lustman, 46, the chief operating officer, would be among those leaving. It said most of the cuts would be in Connecticut. **********Leon C. Hirsch, the chairman, said the company, which had cut 700 jobs last October, would reduce operating losses to under $15 million in the current quarter and be profitable for the rest of 1994. ""Frankly, we were too fat,"" he said. Stock Gains $2.25 **********United States Surgical stock rose $2.25, to $18.375, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had traded at $118 a share in April 1992. **********""The cost-cutting moves are encouraging,"" Lorraine Schwartz, a health care analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York, said. **********The company had reported losses in each quarter since the second quarter of last year, as hospitals reduced spending and prices fell in a pricing battle with Johnson & Johnson. Both companies make sutures and miniature surgical instruments. **********Mr. Hirsch will assume Mr. Lustman's duties. Mr. Lustman, who received $22.5 million in salary, bonuses and stock options in 1992 and has sold United States Surgical shares for $58.8 million since 1985, said he planned to spend his time doing ""charity work,"" golfing and racing vintage sports cars. He will stay on the company's board. **********Mr. Hirsch, who had been one of the the country's highest-paid executives, reduced his own salary by 20 percent and those of other executives by 10 percent last year. Pay packages for 1993 have not yet been reported. **********Mr. Hirsch said most of those departing were going voluntarily. The other departing vice presidents include Henry Bolanos, 60; Louis Gagliano, 49; Roy Gravener, 66; David T. Green, 68; David Fisher, 83; Louis Petti, 51; Frederick Preiss, 43, and Lynnea Prunkl, 51. **********Turi Josefsen, who is married to Mr. Hirsch, remains executive vice president, the company said. Price Pressure **********Mr. Hirsch said all of the company's recent moves would reduce costs by $150 million a year, or 20 percent. But it was not clear if the savings would result in increased profits because of the pressure on prices.  Columbia-HCA Hospital Corporation, for example, said its 197 hospitals would buy miniature surgical instruments from either United States Surgical or Johnson & Johnson, forcing them to compete in lowering Columbia-HCA's costs. **********Ms. Schwartz, the health care analyst, said purchases by the big hospital chains would determine if United States Surgical would again be a big profit maker. **********Sam Greco, a senior vice president of Columbia, said the competition would mean reduced dollar volume for suppliers. But Mr. Hirsch said the Columbia setup was ""very positive"" because Johnson & Johnson had been the sole supplier for nearly half the 197 hospitals before they joined the Columbia chain last year."

After all, filers do not use the document to report income or expenses. They use it to report tax cheats -- and claim a share of any taxes recovered as a result of their efforts. **********During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Americans filed 11,393 of these simple, one-page claims. About 7 percent of them led to financial rewards. Rewards are paid only when the information is not previously known or available in public records. **********""You just can't say that so-and-so didn't file their taxes, because we know that,"" said Donald Roberts, an Internal Revenue Service spokesman. ""But if you tell us that someone keeps a second set of books for their business, and they are located in a safe in a wall, and where it's located, then . . . ."" **********The average reward paid last year was $6,340; the minimum is $25. According to a 1985 General Accounting Office report, which called for enhancing the little-known program, 38 percent of the rewards were for less than $100, and claimants had to wait five or more years to be paid. **********The size of a reward depends on the importance of the information provided and the amount of taxes collected. Rewards range from 0.05 to 10 percent of the first $75,000 recovered (not including interest), up to 5 percent of the next $25,000 and 1 percent of any additional recovery, with the total not exceeding $100,000. **********Though the number of claims rose only somewhat in 1993, the amount of taxes recovered more than doubled, to $172 million from $84 million in 1992. And the amount of money paid as rewards quadrupled to a record $5.2 million. **********The I.R.S. said it was at a loss to explain the increase. The agency, however, is unusually reticent about the 25-year-old program, in part because it fears being likened to the K.G.B. ""We are not looking to set up a network of people looking over each other's shoulders,"" Mr. Roberts said. **********Another concern is that promotion of the program would lead to a deluge of groundless claims -- and expensive and time-consuming audits -- filed by disgruntled employees, ex-spouses and jealous neighbors. ""Already, a good amount of the time, the information is not specific enough for us,"" Mr. Roberts said. **********Anyone with an itch to snitch on tax evaders can contact the criminal investigation division of any I.R.S. office. They should be able to provide information like the suspect's name, aliases, Social Security number, addresses, birth date and specific financial information, like account numbers. In return, they will be kept informed of the investigation and provided with form 211, called the ""Application for Reward for Original Information."" The form can also be obtained by calling (800) TAX FORM. **********Rewards are not available to current employees of the Treasury Department or Federal workers who discover the information during official duties. **********Informants should note that form 211 will remind the I.R.S. that the reward they receive is ordinary income and, of course, taxable."

David Waters, cuts in Social Security benefits reduce the deficit in exactly the same manner other spending cuts do. The economically relevant deficit is the Government's net borrowing from the public because it competes with (and crowds out) private investment. This borrowing equals the general-treasury deficit minus the Social Security surplus; benefit cuts increase that surplus and thereby reduce net borrowing. **********The letter writers Charles Wertheim and John Bruno, meanwhile, complain that Social Security's failure to match the returns on annuities and long-term bonds is because of Government wrongdoing, when it actually reflects the need to use the bulk of each year's F.I.C.A. taxes to pay benefits to current retirees, precluding investment of those funds. **********Mr. Bruno and Mr. Waters further argue that Social Security is well-financed, though the system's trustees forecast that the surpluses will end in 2018 and that insolvency will occur in 2029. **********In his letter, Paul Rehmet is concerned that Social Security benefits may be completely denied to retirees with $50,000 income, but the leading need-test proposal (by the Concord Coalition) phases out only 10 percent of Social Security (and other entitlement) benefits for each $10,000 of income over $40,000, with a maximum 85 percent reduction applying above $120,000. Whether or not this specific proposal, which would save $68 billion in fiscal 2000, is adopted, Mr. Norris was right to note that deficit-reduction efforts must include Social Security. ALAN D.

But dozens of people are gathered at midday at a highway intersection here, their bicycles, motorcycles, cars and pickup trucks festooned with red banners. **********An hour of waiting is rewarded when a tour bus appears through the shimmering heat on the asphalt horizon. A sound truck leads the way into town, blaring between riffs of Brazilian rap music: ""Every worker to Portugal Square. Meet the first worker president in the history of Brazil."" **********Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and his Citizenship Caravan have just rolled into Montes Claros. **********Mechanics at a bicycle repair shop put down their tools to gawk. A farm supply salesman hitches up his pants and ambles to the front of his store. A small girl stands frozen, clutching a soccer ball in her arms. Despite the general stir, a saleswoman at a clothing store points to the heavens and says, ""The only leader I believe in is up there."" **********But far from little ranching towns like Montes Claros, pollsters and politicians are not so skeptical about the whistle-stop caravans of a presidential candidate known to every Brazilian simply as Lula. **********""The caravans help explain the depth of support for Lula,"" said Marcos Antonio Coimbra, an independent pollster. ""They've helped to bridge feelings of distance and abandonment felt by a large part of the electorate."" **********In April 1993, with opinion polls showing only 18 percent of the voters saying they prefer him for President, the candidate of the left-wing Brazil Workers' Party embarked on his first caravan -- a 23-day, 43-stop tour that retraced his childhood journey in an open truck as his family fled Brazil's drought-parched northeast and moved to its industrial south. **********After 11 caravans, 600 towns and 25,000 miles, Mr. da Silva doubled his standing in the polls to be the preferred candidate of 36 percent of the voters. **********Now, centrist and conservative candidates are crisscrossing Brazil, trying to play catch-up before the first round of the nation's presidential elections on Oct. 3. **********""Lula travels by bus and by boat,"" said Paulo Delgado, a Workers' Party congressman, as the candidate was leaving on a three-day trip down the Sao Francisco River, the major artery through Brazil's northeast. ""The other candidates go by airplane."" **********Traveling at 30 miles an hour through each of Brazil's 26 states has changed Mr. da Silva's strategy. **********""Lula is less ideological now,"" said Ricardo Kotscho, Mr. da Silva's press adviser, the same job he held in the 1989 elections when Mr. da Silva ran second to Fernando Collor de Mello, who was forced out as Brazilian President in a corruption scandal in 1992. **********""On any theme, he knows the problem close up, not from position papers,"" Mr. Kotscho said. ""The party and the program are less sectarian, less closed. Lula has met with gold miners, Indians, blacks, union people and students. In 15 months, he has had 115 meetings with businessmen."" **********Cornered briefly, away from fans waving ballpoint pens for autographs, the cigar-chomping candidate said: ""You can't govern the country without knowing the country. The caravans have deepened my knowledge of Brazil."" **********This campaign style so unnerved traditional politicians that they passed a restrictive television advertising law last year that is a throwback to the military dictatorship of the 1970's. In contrast to the free-wheeling election advertising of 1989, this year's television advertisements are limited to candidates speaking in studios. The law bans jingles, graphs, endorsements by outsiders and video footage from outside a studio. **********""The law was passed precisely so that Lula couldn't use caravan images,"" Mr. Kotscho said, noting that the law was backed by center-right parties that later united behind the candidacy of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Finance Minister who was running second in polls with about 21 percent. None of the other half dozen candidates have more than 5 percent in the opinion polls. **********In response, the Workers' Party has prepared a video, ""Voyage to the Heart of Brazil."" With the campaign now turning to Brazil's big cities, organizers plan to show the video on large screens at urban rallies. **********""The right underestimated the deep roots of Lula's support and over-estimated the possibility of pulling rabbits out of hats,"" said Mr. Coimbra, the pollster. **********Here in Montes Claros, a 14-hour bus ride from Rio de Janeiro, casual interviews supported his thesis. **********""Lula is the only candidate who's come out here,"" said Juckson Brand, a police detective who moonlights as a taxi driver. ""He's a guy who came up from the bottom."" **********He said that most drivers at his taxi stand plan to vote for the Workers' Party candidate. **********Zezinho Barro de Mello, a 30-year-old bar owner, proudly showed a scrap of paper autographed ""Lula,"" and said, ""Most of the guys at my bar are going to vote for Lula."" **********Sebastiao Alves de Souza, a high school mathematics teacher pedaled his blue bicycle in the caravan to the rally at Portugal Square. Wearing a T-Shirt emblazoned with ""Lula 1994,"" he offered an insight into the Workers' Party's organizational edge: ""The difference is this: We buy our party T-shirts.

More surprising perhaps is how little conversation on the topic flows back and forth between business and business schools. **********The constituencies nevertheless managed to mingle fabulously earlier this month during a day-long meeting at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A dozen and a half work-family experts, from corporations, universities and consulting firms across the nation, gathered in a campus seminar room and traded ideas on how to teach new generations of corporate leadership to have a career and a life. **********If it was the beginning of a conversation, the gathering was also an indication that work-family issues are beginning to coalesce, along practical and theoretical lines, into a formal area of knowledge. ""The academic approach is just beginning to gather momentum,"" said Dr. Stewart Friedman, the Wharton professor who organized the meeting. The meeting's proximate inspiration, Dr. Friedman said, was his students at Wharton, one of the first business schools to write work-family issues into its required curriculum, and faculty members, from Wharton and elsewhere, who are gradually including the topic in their courses. ""The corporate people,"" Dr. Friedman figured, would offer practical experience and ""give us a reality check."" **********In fact, there seemed to be less to the gap between business and academia than met the eye. The interest of business schools, especially top-ranked schools like Wharton, gives credibility to what in the corporation is still not a core priority. ""I'm glad to see that they're so interested,"" said Susan B. Thomas, director of employment policies and programs at the Cigna Corporation in Philadelphia. ""If they are educating the future leadership, it's important that these issues be brought up while they are still in school."" **********Nor, apparently, do corporations look with alarm at a curriculum that encourages students to balance their work and their private lives, setting limits on what a boss may demand, in effect undermining their devotion to the corporation. ""They are aware of certain basic realities,"" Ms. Thomas said. ""It's not a matter of balance in the sense that I don't give my all at a job. We know we are not talking about people chintzing on what they give a job. We are talking about how to work things out."" **********Working things out, as any corporate work-family executive knows, involves violating all kinds of practices and boundaries that once were sacrosanct. Managers may need, for example, to be flexible and allow employees to start work at different times. Similarly, work-family issues may nudge professors to rethink their assumptions, both about teaching and their fields of study. Among the questions raised at the meeting for further pondering: *********** Are work-family studies things unto themselves that should be taught in isolated modules, or should they be ""infused"" more broadly into the curriculum? Should courses be required or elective? *********** At what point does talking about students' private lives become intrusive? Talking about work-family issues may involve more disclosure than some students feel comfortable with. *********** In an area so fraught with values, and potential value judgments, how do the values of the teaching staff influence the course? *********** Are egalitarian male-female relationships possible? Should we give up on the ideal and admit that men have certain roles and women have certain roles? *********** How can schools be sensitive to differences of class and cultural background, especially with respect to the large contingent of international students now attending American schools of business? *********** What managerial skills are needed to become a successful manager of a family-friendly organization? **********AS discontent with the prospect of a one-dimensional life seeps down to the youngest corporate recruits, business schools may be keeping up with social transformation by assimilating work-family issues into their curricula. But as the last question indicates, they are ultimately in the business of training managers. **********Are they roving too far afield from their mission? Dr. Friedman says the issues raised by work-family proponents dovetail with broader corporate strategies. Wharton, and other schools represented at the meeting, are preparing students for a globalized corporate future in which personal relationships, flexibility and negotiating skills will be more important than the number-crunching skills many companies look for now. **********In the new world, Dr. Friedman said, ""there are ambiguous authority relationships, alliances across companies and national boundaries. Managers will have to be more people-oriented."" LEAVING SPACE FOR STUDENTS' PRIVACY **********ONE of the most difficult issues teachers of work-family issues face is also a troubling pedagogical problem: how to reach into students' minds, engage them, perhaps change them, and yet not violate their privacy. Almost by definition, work-family issues are life issues. Do they belong in a classroom? ""That is the thorny part,"" said Dr. Stewart Friedman, a Wharton professor who includes work-family topics in a course on management of the self in organizations. ""How far into the personal lives of students -- and employees -- can we go?"" **********To start with, not all students, many of whom are in their mid to late 20's, are interested in worrying about juggling career and family before their careers are off the ground. That often changes as students are drawn in, partly by Dr. Friedman's accounts of the profound effect the birth of his first child had on him six-and-a-half years ago, and partly by logic. ""We tell them: 'You have to do some planning if you want to achieve. You may not be thinking about this now, but look what happens over time and think about what you want for yourself,' "" Dr. Friedman said.

Moore, president of People. **********But the magazine, published by Time Inc., is not stopping there. Ms. Moore said the magazine would eliminate many of the usual perks offered to its best advertisers -- from golf outings and expensive dinners to tickets to Broadway shows. Instead of having dinner at ""21,"" for example, chief executives may find themselves invited to spend the evening cooking and delivering meals to homebound people with AIDS. **********""This is good business in the long run,"" Ms. Moore said. ""It's amazing what a morale booster this kind of thing is to my readers and my advertisers -- better than golf or the theater."" Baby Boomers' Concerns **********Cause marketing is not new, of course. In People's case, however, it has come about because of its readers' new priorities, Ms. Moore said. **********The majority of People readers are baby boomers, now in their 30's and 40's and with children of their own. The magazine says these readers, most of whom are women, have become more attuned to a troubled world. **********""We have 10 million male readers and 20 million female readers, but People feels more like a female magazine,"" Ms. Moore said. ""We should be promoting and selling causes that women care about. Every time we dabble in women's causes, we have been stunned at the response."" **********After the comedian Gilda Radner died of ovarian cancer in 1989, a half-dozen magazines, including People, ran ads for Gilda's Club, a foundation established by Gene Wilder, her husband. The ads raised $300,000, with individual contributions averaging more than $100, ""four times what I would have expected and another indication that we are all in our 40's and want to do more,"" Ms. Moore said. **********Last year, an article about orphans in Bosnia drew 160 reader requests about how to adopt a child, even though the article did not say the children were available for adoption.  More Than Free Ads **********Ms. Moore said the magazine's new effort would include marketing assistance, printing, creative help and office space for the special causes, if needed. People already plans to advertise silk scarves and ties designed for three of the charities -- Gilda's Club, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation and the Children's Health Fund -- and to look for ways to sell the products in retail stores or on a home shopping channel. **********The cost of all this will come from the magazine's expense budget and will be 100 percent tax deductible, Ms. Moore said. **********Although People's effort may be more comprehensive than those of many other magazines, it is nonetheless part of an industry trend to choose causes and then promote them heavily through pro bono advertising, special events, products and articles in the publications. **********""I think that more and more, Corporate America is getting a social conscience,"" said Leo Greenland, chief executive and chairman of Smith/Greenland Inc., an advertising agency. **********As the country's leading magazine in revenues for the last three years, People seems to be in a good position to be generous. Its advertising pages, however, declined 8 percent last year. And while the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, for the first half of 1993, show circulation at 3.4 million -- virtually the same as a year earlier -- newsstand sales are down 10 percent. **********In 1992, it started its first foreign editions, in Taiwan and in Australia, where the magazine is titled Who because there is already a magazine called People. In the United States, People is also testing its third issue of a spinoff celebrity life style magazine called In Style. **********Although People was started as a celebrity magazine, more than two-thirds of the publication is now devoted to the challenges of ordinary people trapped in tragic or extraordinary circumstances. Its highly successful start-up in 1974 -- it had a paid circulation of a million that year and achieved profitability within 18 months -- was followed by a flock of imitators, including television shows. **********Landon Y. Jones Jr., the managing editor of People, said the magazine had maintained firm rules, including a policy prohibiting deals with celebrities. It will not guarantee a cover story, for instance, to get an interview. **********""We may say that there is a very strong presumption that it will be a cover, and a lot of people refuse to cooperate if we won't guarantee them the cover,"" he said. ""But I can't guarantee a cover because events may interfere. I have covers of Billy Crystal and Arsenio Hall that never ran because of events."" **********The magazine, Mr. Jones said, will not agree to avoid certain questions during an interview -- a policy that has cost People many articles. ""Our rule has been we have the right to ask any questions,"" he said. **********Jodie Foster will not give an interview to the magazine, he said, because People rejects her terms that there will be no questions about John W. Hinckley Jr., who said he was trying to impress her when he shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981. **********And the magazine does not pay for interviews. ""We are not playing in that, even though we could afford to pay,"" Mr. Jones said. ""It's a journalistic ethics issue."""

Courts have tried to settle the dispute and failed. And their wrangling has occasionally disrupted the business, including embarrassing the big Canadian food processor in dealings with one of its biggest customers, McDonald's, the fast-food giant. **********The McCain feud is Canada's answer to the recent dynastic spats in American business, like the fight within the Haft family, which owns Dart Drugs and Crown Books. **********Lately the Canadian corporate soap opera has been heating up. Earlier this month, Harrison McCain succeeded in getting Wallace pushed out of his post as co-chief executive -- a title and a joint command that the brothers had shared. **********Harrison was able to persuade a majority of the family shareholders to support the move against his younger brother. Harrison and Wallace each own one-third of the stock, and the families of two deceased brothers own the other third. Wallace was given a new position of vice chairman. **********WALLACE denounced his demotion as ""vindictive,"" and he is proceeding with a court action that could lead to the family company being dismantled or sold. But a buyout of Wallace is also an option. **********His brother, Harrison, is now the sole chief executive. But he has agreed to step down once a successor is found. **********The brothers feuded over who within the family should become top dog. Wallace wanted his son Michael, 35, the head of McCain's operations in the United States. Harrison backed his nephew, Allison, 46, who heads the company's British business. **********Now it's likely to be neither. The board has a short-list of about six candidates, all outside professional managers. Harrison insists that the name of the successor will be announced ""within weeks."" But in a move sure to rile his brother, Harrison last week appointed his son Peter as the president of a new subsidiary, McCain Foods International Inc. **********The long-running sibling conflict has shaken McCain Foods, a food processor founded 40 years ago by Harrison and Wallace McCain in a former cow pasture in Florenceville, New Brunswick. Today, the company employs 12,500 workers on three continents to process foods like frozen french fries, pizzas and juices. **********Harrison McCain admitted last spring that the family feud may be ""harming"" the company ""both with its customers and suppliers. The harm will become worse if nothing is done about the problem immediately."" **********The incident involving McDonald's occurred two years ago. But it became public only this year, after the contents of a confidential report by a New Brunswick judge, Ronald Stevenson, who had tried unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute, were reported by The Financial Post. **********HARRISON McCAIN was not pleased with the performance of Michael McCain, Wallace's son, in the big United States market. In America, McCain Foods ranks fifth in highly competitive frozen potato market, and it is barely profitable. **********Lynal Root, senior vice president of purchasing of McDonald's International in Chicago, had drawn up a document discussing the fast-food chain's french-fry purchasing program and sent it off to Michael McCain, the head of American operations. **********But the Stevenson report shows that Harrison did an end-run around his nephew by drawing up a McCain's plan for supplying all McDonald's restaurants worldwide and dispatching it to Mr. Root. **********When he found out, Wallace furiously fired off a memo telling Harrison to keep his hands out of North American operations. **********In an interview, Mr. Root said the McCain family feud was ""unfortunate."" But, the McDonald's executive insisted, the family dispute ""is not affecting us any place in the world."" **********""I'm the one who started doing business with them many years ago,"" Mr. Root added. ""They're our biggest supplier throughout the world, not in pounds, but in the number of countries they serve. They've done a whale of a job."""

This is in marked contrast, many say, to the traditional Western markets of Europe and North America, where most serious collectors are interested only in top-quality material. **********Mr. Feldman cited the price histories of two specific stamps as evidence of the increasingly high-end habits of Western collectors. He estimated that a 1929 ""British Postal Union Congress"" stamp - an item often found in general, mid-level collections - that was worth about $1,800 in 1980 might be worth only $300 today. But he said that an 1843 ""Double Geneva"" stamp - generally regarded as of higher quality - valued at $12,000 in 1980 might bring as much as $37,500 today. **********The Asian market has come to prominence in the last few years in line with the growth in the region's economies, analysts say. Stamps, moreover, have apparently become more of an elite game in Western markets over the past 20 years. Dealers say that the days when U.S. stamp shows were attended by hordes of schoolboys are over - instead, they're full of serious collectors with money to spend. **********Another nail in the coffin of mainstream stamp collecting in the West, some say, was a boom in the stamp market during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The boom encouraged many people to buy on the back of the speculative bubble, and when prices fell back to earth many collectors were hurt so badly that they have yet to return to the hobby. **********Nevertheless, many dealers say that the stamp trade is healthy due to large Asian demand and to the substantial sums spent by Western collectors - which together add up to more than was spent in the years when the hobby was generally more popular. **********Tony Banwell, a stamp specialist at Sotheby's in London, said that there may be as many as 30 million collectors in mainland China alone. In addition, he said there are more than 20 people in Hong Kong and Singapore who are prepared to spend as much as $150,000 on a single stamp and $750,000 on a collection. **********Buoyant demand, moreover, has been reflected at recent stamp sales. Christie Manson & Woods, the international auction house, far exceeded its expectations last month at a Hong Kong sale, taking in $2.55 million. The pre-sale estimate had been $1.8 million. One 1870 cover addressed to a party in Shanghai and bearing three Chinese stamps fetched the highest price: 1.45 million Hong Kong dollars ($187,800). **********Thai stamp prices have also been strong. ""The Thai market is a wonder to most people in the way it has gone through the roof, price-wise,"" said Mark Stephenson, a stamp expert at Christie's. The last sale of Thai stamaps held by Christie's, which took place in Singapore in May 1993, saw an 1886 letter from Bangkok to Switzerland bearing the rare ""Tical Surcharge"" stamp fetch 179,000 Singapore dollars ($122,600). The estimate had been 60,000 to 80,000 dollars. The Tical is an old unit of Thai currency. **********European stamps are also attracting new interest. Pascal Behr, a third generation stamp dealer at Behr Philately in Paris, is currently showing a collection of French stamps and covers from the time of the Franco-Prussian War of the 1870's. Some of the itemsare dated from the time of the siege of Paris, which lasted from September 1870 to January 1871. Mr. Behr said he had three covers which left the city by hot-air balloon and were variously delivered to India, Turkey, and Egypt. **********The highest price ever paid for a philatelic item was for an acknowledged treasure, the 1847 ""Mauritius Post-Office Issue Bordeaux cover,"" that was sold to an anonymous buyer about a year ago at a Feldman auction for a reported 5.75 million Swiss francs ($4.56 million). **********As for the Far East, Mr. Banwell said that prices will continue to rise because they have started from such a low base. He also said he dreamed of the day when Asian buyers would take an active interest in philately from countries other than their own."

Those who survived were seen traveling to nearby towns in search of food and clothing, according to radio reports. In Toez, residents managed to escape by running to a nearby hilltop. **********Although the damage appeared less severe than that caused by a 1985 volcano eruption, local disaster officials said this afternoon that the floods and avalanches were continuing to cause havoc, preventing the authorities from assessing the damage. Two major bridges and long stretches of roadway were destroyed, leaving most of the towns affected accessible only by helicopter. **********The avalanche devastated large tracts of a national park surrounding the Huila glacier.

Population Dispute," **********Seeking to head off approval of abortion rights or sexual freedom at a coming world population conference, the Vatican has been reaching out for support to some radical and fundamentalist governments and groups in Islamic countries, including Iran and Libya. **********Less than a month before representatives of 180 nations meet in Cairo to discuss a draft document that lays down guidelines for avoiding a population explosion, the Vatican has acknowledged that its envoys have met recently with officials in the Iranian and Libyan capitals. **********They said the meetings were part of a widespread effort around the world to gain support for its opposition at the population meeting to language on women's rights, including reproductive rights, in a preliminary draft that is supported by the United States and many United Nations population experts. **********The Vatican denies that it is seeking any kind of pact with Islamic leaders on the population issue, insisting instead that it has appealed to leaders of all religions for backing in the struggle against what it sees as an assault on traditional sexual morality. **********But the diplomatic campaign has begun to draw criticism in some quarters, mainly Western governments fearing that the Vatican is allying itself with radical Islamic forces backing the overthrow of governments in the Muslim world. **********Vatican officials say the papal envoy in Teheran, Msgr. Romeo Panciroli, met recently with Iranian officials, but they denied that there was any pact with Iran's radical Islamic leaders to oppose passage of the population document. **********The denial came after news reports from Teheran quoting a senior Iranian Government official as saying the Vatican had Iran's ""full endorsement"" on the issue. **********The British newspaper The Guardian said the Pope's envoy met on Aug. 1 with Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani, the brother of President Hashemi Rafsanjani. It said the Iranian newspaper Abrar reported that the deputy minister had ""announced Iran's full endorsement of this collaboration and said there were many avenues for co-operation between religious states which were not confined to the prohibition of abortion."" **********The Teheran newspaper quoted him as adding: ""The future war is between the religious and the materialists. Collaboration between religious governments in support of outlawing abortion is a fine beginning for the conception of collaboration in other fields."" **********The Guardian quoted the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro Valls, as saying on Aug. 8, ""The positions of some of the delegations going to Cairo, coming from different countries, different backgrounds, and certainly not from a Catholic and even Christian background, are now closer to the position of the Holy See."" **********Perhaps a more striking report was one this week by the Libyan news agency, Jana, that Vatican diplomats were supporting Libya in efforts to resolve differences with Western governments over the bombing of the Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The Libyan agency linked this supposed Vatican assistance to what it said was an identity of views with the Vatican condemning the Cairo document. **********The Vatican acknowledged that there had been discussions with Libyan officials but denied that there was any deal over the Cairo document. **********Pope John Paul II has in the past called on the leaders of the world's religions, including Islam, and leading secular states to oppose the wording of the United Nations document. But Vatican officials strenuously deny that they are seeking an alliance with Islamic governments. Cairo University Critical **********In another sign of success in the Vatican's campaign, leaders of Al Azhar Islamic University in Cairo, a foremost center of Islamic learning, last week denounced the proposed United Nations document as offensive to Islam. **********Though the statement did not explicitly mention the Vatican, some of its language closely paralleled papal condemnations of the United Nations document's wording. **********The cooperation between the Vatican and Islamic radicals is unusual in another way, since many of the radicals regularly vilify the Vatican in their propaganda as an agent of Western cultural imperialism and a determinedly anti-Islamic force. **********Indeed, in recent years the papacy has conducted an diplomatic campaign in Islamic countries, largely to protect the interests of Christian minorities in predominantly Muslim regions like Africa or the Middle East. **********The United Nations document and the Cairo conference, which is scheduled for Sept. 5 to 13, are intended to urge countries to view population questions with renewed urgency. Seeking to Slow Growth **********The draft examines strategies for stabilizing the world's population, which is expected to reach 8.5 billion by the year 2025, a increase from 5.6 billion now, according to the 1994 report of the United Nations Populations Fund that was released in London today. **********On Tuesday, Egypt's Population Minister, Maher Mahran, sought to calm Islamic fears by stressing that the draft document did not violate Islamic morality. But in its statement, Al Azhar said the document condoned extramarital sex and easy abortion and sought to propagate the ""opposite of the basic precepts that Islam has laid down."" **********The same day, Islamic opposition papers in Egypt joined the assault on the conference. **********The newspaper As Shaab said it had repeatedly warned about ""suspicious campaigns which America, Western countries and Israel carry out to promote birth control in Muslim countries."" Pope to Visit Sarajevo **********The climate created by the controversy over the population conference has led even some of the Vatican's unrelated actions to be viewed in a more critical light. **********In a statement issued today, for instead, the Vatican announced that preparations were under way for Pope John Paul to visit Sarajevo, the embattled Bosnian capital, on Sept. 8 in a gesture of solidarity with the Muslim population there. The visit precedes by two days a papal trip to Zagreb, the capital of predominantly Roman Catholic Croatia, also in the former Yugoslavia. **********Originally, the 74-year-old Pope had sought to include Belgrade, the capital of largely Orthodox Serbia. But Orthodox Church leaders there have refused to receive the Pope, whom they accuse of favoring Roman Catholics and Muslims of the former Yugoslavia in the fighting there."

But companies and analysts in Europe say the decision carries little more than symbolic importance. **********""It is wishful thinking to say that in and of itself this decision will open the floodgates of American exports to these countries,"" said Even Miller, a telecommunications analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. **********Russia does not have the funds to pay for state-of-the-art telephone and computer systems and U.S. companies have for years been skirting the regulations and exporting to other markets, analysts said. **********""It is already a pretty competitive market in Eastern Europe and Russia,"" said John Cheetham, a spokesman for ICL PLC, a British computer maker. ""I am not sure this will make much difference."" **********He noted there was fast- growing demand for the likes of personal computers and networks, but comparatively little for the hyper-sophisticated and pricey state-of-the-art systems that had been the subject of the ban. **********In eastern Europe, American companies not only sell computers, they dominate the market. Jim Tully, an analyst at Dataquest Europe, said the two largest foreign computer vendors in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Other U.S. companies, such as Unysis Corp., also are enjoying some success in the region, he said. **********Similarly, in China, the world's fastest-growing telecommunications market, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has been active for years. James Golob, an analyst with S.G. Warburg & Co. in London estimates that AT&T's business in China already runs to several hundred million dollars a year, largely in transmission systems. Motorola Inc., meanwhile, ranks as one of the strongest competitors in China's cellular phone market. **********With a telecommunications market that is expected to see as much growth as the rest of the world combined - from 35 million lines now to 100 million by the end of the century - every telephone company in the world is already competing in China. The prize the likes of Alcatel Alsthom, AT&T, LM Ericsson AB, Seimens AG and others are fiercely fighting for is a share of the spending that is estimated to total $40 billion by the year 2000. **********Mr. Clinton's decision will broaden the range of product offerings from America's top entrants in that market. As such it has won kudos from them. But the already- crowded market and the fact that the Americans, in spite of the restrictions and needs for cumbersome export licenses have been there for years anyway, will greatly moderate that impact. **********The incremental effect of the lifting of the ban can be seen in in some of the figures bandied about in the last day or two. For instance, Christopher Padilla, a Washington-based government affairs specialist for AT&T, predicted that the lifting of restrictions would mean $100 million a year in new sales for his company. But observers were quick to point out that for the world's largest telephone company, such gains, while certainly welcome, rank as decidedly small. **********Mr. Miller said that of far greater significance than the ban's end is the question over- hanging the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status with the United States. If concerns over human rights violations causes Washington not to renew China's preferential status, U.S. suppliers would ""be completely shut out of that market overnight,"" Mr. Miller said **********On the other hand, trade rules - be they imposed by Washington, Bonn or Beijing - can always be skirted. One analyst pointed to the example of Alcatel, which enjoys a 40- to 50-percent share of China's telephone-switching market. Two years ago, France's sale of Mirage fighters to Taiwan resulted in an enraged Beijing slapping a temporary ban on French imports, which was overcome by sourcing the switches from Alcatel subsidiaries. **********When it comes to Russia, the problem is not politics as much as money. ""In Russia the problem is not demand but a lack of money and a situation of complete chaos,"" Mr. Golob said."

This week, a dozen multimillionaires opened Veja magazine to find their portraits illustrating an article on income tax evasion. **********Studying files leaked by the tax authorities, the newsweekly calculated that Brazil's 460 wealthiest millionaires paid $32.5 million in income tax in 1992 -- barely one percent of their $26.7 billion in assets. Totaled, their assets were equal to the combined gross national products of two of Brazil's largest neighbors, Peru and Bolivia. **********In a society where the wealthy enjoyed aristocratic titles until a century ago, questioning Brazil's rich about their taxes has long been unthinkable. But, after a decade of democratic rule, Brazil's long list of untouchable subjects is dwindling. **********Last July, in the euphoria over Brazil's victory in World Cup soccer, the national team swept through Rio's international airport without paying customs duty on 17 tons in excess luggage -- computers, television sets, refrigerators, fax machines, dishwashers and microwave ovens. Overnight, the nation's heroes became villains in the press. In one poll, 79 percent of respondents said the players should have paid duties. **********This week, it was the turn of Brazil's wealthiest to squirm as the newsweekly published the first reports of a six-month study by the nation's tax service, known here as Federal Revenue. The report was called ""Big Fortunes."" **********Camilo Cola, owner of the nation's largest bus company, was reported to have a personal fortune of $154 million. In 1992, he paid $26,000 in income tax. Cecilio do Rego Almeida, owner of a construction company worth half a billion dollars, reportedly paid $15,500 in income tax in 1992. Abilio Diniz, owner of Brazil's second largest supermarket chain, reportedly paid $126,000 in tax on a 1992 income of $660,000. **********""It's an enormous scandal that the wealthy of this country don't pay taxes, but it's an even greater scandal that the tax system allows this,"" said Ronan Tito, a centrist Senator who presides over the congressional Tax Evasion Investigating Committee. ""There are a lot of loopholes."" **********Wealthy Brazilians traditionally cut their income taxes by having their companies pay their personal expenses -- travel, cars and entertaining. Stock market investments are subject to 25 percent capital gains taxes, automatically withheld at the source. **********With a limited number of tax inspectors, Brazil, like many developing countries, collects two-thirds of national tax revenues from companies, largely through sales taxes and company income taxes. In practice, this means that millionaires pay virtually no income taxes. But taxes account for 70 percent of the price of a box of detergent that shoppers buy in supermarkets. **********""The Brazilian tax system is very perverse, very regressive,"" said Antoninho Marmo Trevisan, the president of Trevisan Auditores, an auditing company in Sao Paulo. Mr. Trevisan is working on a tax bill that would widen the income tax base by lowering rates and by forcing the wealthy to pay. A major backer of the plan is Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a member of the congressional tax evasion committee, who is to be inaugurated President of Brazil on Jan. 1. **********If public interest in tax reform wanes, Federal Revenue agents will undoubtedly leak results of new tax evasion studies. Coming titles include: ""Bankers,"" ""Yacht Owners,"" ""Soccer Players"" and ""Congressional Representatives."""

For more than half a century, it has fought decently against a far more powerful governing-party machine, succumbed to disadvantage and fraud, and sworn each time to do better the next. **********But as Diego Fernandez de Cevallos buried his hopes of becoming the first opposition President in Mexico's modern history, even other leaders of his right-of-center party thought he might have outdone himself in his quick, gracious acceptance of defeat. **********""There is a future in Mexico,"" Mr. Fernandez said, consoling his supporters at a news conference hours after the polls closed on Sunday -- but hours before even the first preliminary official results were made public. ""The change has begun."" **********Though National Action seized back from the left its traditional status as the country's leading opposition force, more than doubling the votes it received in the last presidential election in 1988 and winning as many as 110 of the 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, its performance in the election left some shadows over the party's future. An Unusual Campaign **********Mr. Fernandez, the 53-year-old lawyer and congressman who shot ahead in some opinion polls after pummelling his rivals in the first-ever televised debate among major presidential candidates on May 12, has never explained very clearly why he all but quit public campaigning for several weeks in June and July. Nor has he shed much light on why he failed to press hard for the second debate that many analysts thought would have been crucial to his success. **********New questions were also raised about the strategy that the National Action Party has pursued for decades against the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. **********With 92 percent of the votes counted today, the PRI presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, led with 50 percent of the vote, to 26.8 percent for Mr. Fernandez and 17 percent for for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party. **********The PAN, as the opposition party is known by its Spanish initials, has long bet its future on steadily building support in different regions of the country, particularly along the border with the United States. The idea has been to prove its promises of more honest and efficient government at the regional level, slowly amassing some of the resources of incumbency that the PRI has always used to enormous advantage. **********While final results are still being held up by an assortment of inconsistencies in the results and problems in transmitting them, it is clear that the PAN was trounced in three of the states it considers strongholds. **********In western Baja California, where in 1989 the PAN won the opposition's first governorship since the formation of the governing party 60 years earlier, the PRI swept all but one of six congressional districts. The PAN has been hurt there by rising crime, violence tied to drug traffickers and criticism of its public-works programs in big cities like Tijuana. **********The PRI also won all 10 of the congressional races in Chihuahua state. The PAN won the governor's race there only two years ago, but its popularity has waned as the governor, Francisco Barrio Terrazas, has sought independence from federal monies by raising taxes of his own. **********Finally, the PAN won only 1 of 13 congressional races in Guanajuato, where President Carlos Salinas de Gortari negotiated to put a moderate PAN governor in office after a PRI victory in 1991 state elections was swamped by accusations of fraud at the polls. **********If that were not enough, it took only two days before the PAN leader who was defeated in the 1991 gubernatorial vote in Guanajuato, Vicente Fox Quesada, came out of a self-imposed political retirement to challenge Mr. Fernandez's somewhat conciliatory line and demand that the election be annulled because of irregularities. **********""I have trouble believing that Diego Fernandez de Cevallos is accepting this election as clean, and I have trouble even that he remains silent, since to remain silent would be to endorse this,"" Mr. Fox said on Wednesday. **********In an interview, Mr. Fernandez suggested that he was doing nothing of the sort. **********""I think a careful analysis of what Mexico has lived through has to distinguish between the day of the vote and the process, that is, the months before the election,"" he said. 'Lights and Shadows' **********On election day, he added, a surprisingly high turnout, orderly and peaceful voting and what he described as minimal problems ""can show us proudly before the world."" **********But he said the campaign was one of ""lights and shadows,"" arguing that improvements tied to democratic reform laws enacted before the vote were diluted by the continued use of Government funds on the PRI's behalf, television coverage strongly biased for the governing party and PRI campaign spending far beyond that of all other parties. **********He also contended that the PRI had done everything in its power to discredit him, spreading false stories about his family, his legal career and his strong Catholicism. **********What critics of Mr. Fernandez assert about him most insistently -- though without any proof -- is that he cut a deal with the PRI in return for an assurance of Cabinet posts or other concessions to the PAN. **********Mr. Fernandez has vehemently denied having entered into any such discussions with the PRI."

They thought he had crippled the proposal and that the Downing Street Declaration of Dec. 15 was dying or dead. **********The declaration offered Mr. Adams a place at a negotiating table in exchange for a convincing I.R.A. cease-fire and formal reununciation of the campaign of killing. **********But Mr. Adams has shown once again that he is a major catalyst in the Northern Ireland strife and its politics, and that he can deliver a cease-fire. It now seems that Mr. Adams knew what he was doing when he refused to have his party renounce violence, and that he needed to take a hard line for two reasons: ***********To show the gunners of the I.R.A. that Sinn Fein could still stand up to the British and could, with honor and some defiance, decline to jump for crumbs from the master's table. ***********To win concessions from London. **********The concessions appeared to come in the form of the transfer of a few I.R.A. prisoners from jails in mainland Britain to Northern Ireland, and in a statement by the head of British security in Ulster that a prolonged cease-fire would lead Britain to reduce its military patrols. London also indicated a new flexibiity on the partition of the island. The incorporation of the north into a new united Ireland is the ultimate goal of the I.R.A. **********While this was happening, Mr. Adams received tacit support from two of the most influential Irish figures, Prime Minister Reynolds and John Hume, the mainstream Northern Ireland Catholic leader. Sixteen months ago Mr. Hume began secret talks with Mr. Adams, normally his political enemy; those talks led to the Downing Street Declaration and to today's cease-fire. **********Mr. Adams also wants a referendum on whether Northern Ireland should become one with the Irish republic. He and other Republicans want an islandwide vote, in which they would expect a united Ireland to be approved. But Irish and British policy now states that no change in Ulster's status will come without the approval of the majority there. This majority, which is Protestant, is committed to remaining part of Britain. **********Mr. Adams says that, having grown up with Protestants in Belfast, he understands their fears of being incorporated into a predominantly Roman Catholic united Ireland. He insists that the I.R.A. seek agreement with the Protestants. **********Mr. Adams says Washington should play the same nudging role that it did in South Africa and the Middle East. Officials here say the United States could strengthen its influence by appointing Bruce Morrison, a Democrat and former Congressman who knows Mr. Adams and is a friend of Mr. Clinton, as an observer or special envoy."

Gen. Danny Yatom, also acknowledged that the army's entire focus had been on potential terrorist acts by Arabs against Jews in the occupied territories, and that the possibility of a reverse situation had never been considered. **********""I must say that I don't remember discussions about Jewish terror,"" said General Yatom, who commands army forces throughout central Israel as well as Hebron and other parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. No Warning From Intelligence **********As for army intelligence assessments about the likelihood of an attack by Jews, he added: ""I had no formal or informal warnings about Jewish terror aimed at Arabs in Judea and Samaria,"" names of biblical origin used by many Israelis for the West Bank. **********The general insisted that even without intelligence warnings, an Israeli security plan for guarding the mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs, venerated by Muslims and Jews, was stringent enough to have stopped the Hebron killer on the morning of Feb. 25. But the plan was not followed. **********He said that five of six soldiers and policemen assigned to strategic posts -- including three who had overslept -- had been somewhere else when the settler, Baruch Goldstein, entered before dawn with an automatic rifle and opened fire on 400 to 500 Muslims at prayer. **********Dr. Goldstein killed 29 Palestinians, the general said. In addition, he said, 3 people were trampled to death as worshipers stampeded, and 5 Palestinians were later killed by soldiers in street battles in other parts of Hebron, a town of perennial Jewish-Arab conflict. **********Today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reportedly called the Jewish presence there ""an unnecessary time bomb"" but said he did not want to move settlers out at this point. Killings Called Preventable **********In a reference to the security provisions at the cave, General Yatom told the five-member commission: ""I believe that if this plan had in fact been fully carried out, it could have prevented the way Goldstein acted -- that is, the massacre. **********""And at least if it did not prevent it, it would have made it very difficult for this murderer to carry out his plot."" **********The general and other officers testified on the first day of hearings that are expected to continue for weeks and possibly months. For now, the panel, led by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Meir Shamgar, is focusing on the military's account. **********Palestinians are expected to be called as witnesses after a holiday next weekend marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, but it is not clear how many will testify. **********Challenging the credibility of the Israeli investigation, which is based on a preliminary army finding that Dr. Goldstein acted alone, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the group of Islamic militants known as Hamas have both ordered their own inquiries. They have yet to get under way in earnest, though. Judges Emphasize Mindset **********Repeatedly today, the five men on the Israeli commission -- three judges, a former army chief of staff and a university president -- zeroed in less on the details of Dr. Goldstein's murderous path 11 days ago than on the Israeli authorities' basic policies in sensitive parts of the territories. It seemed that the army's mindset on Jewish-Arab relations was under as much scrutiny as the behavior of its soldiers on Feb. 25. **********Witnesses were asked, for example, why Jews were permitted as a matter of routine to bring weapons into the cave. Palestinians do not enjoy the same privilege. **********The sole Israeli Arab on the panel, Judge Abdel Rahman Zuabi of Nazareth, was particularly insistent on this point, but he was not alone. **********""I do not understand why people who are coming to pray to God have to take weapons with them,"" he said to Maj. Dov Stalman, the army commander at the cave. **********""I don't have an answer to that,"" Major Stalman replied. ""Those were the decisions."" **********General Yatom testified that after an Arab attack that killed six Jews in Hebron in 1980, the Government began to permit Israelis to carry guns with them into the cave, a policy made formal in 1986. **********In practice, they may not enter with ammunition magazines locked in their rifles. But they may carry the ammunition separately, and if soldiers are not watchful, someone can load and reload once he is inside. 110 Bullets in 1 1/2 Minutes **********In this case, the general said, Dr. Goldstein managed to empty three and a half magazines, or about 110 bullets, in a minute and a half. **********Still, despite incessant tensions between Jews and Muslims, no shots had ever been fired there until 11 days ago -- and, he said, Jews in Hebron are at risk and need their weapons. **********""The thing that was hard for me to imagine was that in a place where there are armed soldiers, a Jew, an Israeli, would do such a thing,"" General Yatom said. He continued: ""Had I known what was going to happen, I'd have taken measures."" **********Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said some lessons had been learned, and he told a group of American reporters that tougher Government measures were likely, including a ban on weapons in the cave and separate prayer schedules there for Muslims and Jews. **********But there are no plans for now to move the more than 400 Jewish settlers out of Hebron, even though a near-majority of Cabinet ministers openly supports the idea and Prime Minister Rabin was quoted today as having called the Israeli presence there ""an unnecessary time bomb."" **********He was reported to have told a parliamentary committee that ""at this point there is no formal proposal"" on the Hebron settlers, reflecting his view that to put the issue on the table now would cause an uproar among Israelis and complicate the already troubled peace negotiations with the P.L.O. Casualty Figures Questioned **********In Hebron, there have been questions from the start about how many people were killed and wounded on Feb. 25. **********Some Palestinians have said that nearly 50 were killed and perhaps 250 wounded. Other estimates of the death toll are in the mid-40's. Over the weekend, The Associated Press reported that it had conducted its own investigation and counted 30 killed inside the mosque and 4 elsewhere in Hebron. **********Today, General Yatom testified that a family-by-family check by the army showed that 29 worshipers had been killed in the mosque, all by Dr. Goldstein, and 90 had been wounded or injured in ensuing panic. In addition, the general said, 3 Palestinians were trampled to death in a stampede to escape the spray of automatic rifle fire and 5 were killed by soldiers in clashes elsewhere in Hebron later. **********Explaining why the figures were substantially lower than early estimates, he said some victims had been double-counted and some people initially listed as dead turned out to be alive. **********It is not clear if the army's count is definitive, because some bodies were said by Palestinians to have been whisked away and buried without first being tallied by local hospitals. Killer Wore Army Uniform **********According to General Yatom's account today, at 5:20 A.M. on Feb. 25, Dr. Goldstein entered the mosque in his army uniform, telling an officer who knew him that he was on reserve duty. In a section of the complex known as the Isaac Hall, 400 to 500 Muslims were beginning their Ramadan Friday prayers, the general said, while in the adjacent Abraham Hall, 13 Jews were reciting prayers for the Purim holiday. **********Dr. Goldstein, who lived in the neighboring settlement of Qiryat Arba, probably entered the Isaac Hall through the first of three doors, General Yatom testified, and then fired into kneeling, tightly packed worshipers from different locations at the back of the hall. **********In the immediate area, six Israeli soldiers and policemen were supposed to be on duty, he said. **********But three border policemen arrived only after it was all over -- apparently, he said, because someone forgot their wake-up call. A regular policeman also was not there, and a soldier had been sent by a superior officer to switch places with another soldier outside -- an error in judgment, General Yatom said. **********Thus, according to his account, when Dr. Goldstein entered Isaac Hall, only one of six Israelis assigned to the security detail was in place. And when that lone officer heard the shots, he was pushed back by the crowd surging to escape, the general said. **********Finally, the officer made his way into Isaac Hall, General Yatom testified, but it was too late. He found Dr. Goldstein dead in a corner, beaten apparently by Palestinians who had overcome their initial panic."

The Administration announced that 15 countries had signaled a willingness to join a multinational force that would maintain order and retrain Haiti's security forces after the current military government leaves. **********The exiled Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, also issued a statement today calling for ""swift and definitive"" action by the international community to oust Haiti's leaders. **********In making known recent military exercises but insisting no invasion is imminent, the Administration seemed to be pressing the Haitian military leaders to leave and also trying to silence critics in Congress who say that the White House is moving precipitately to use force. **********A day after the Administration's senior foreign policy advisers briefed Congressional leaders on Haiti policy, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is an influential voice on military matters, warned the White House to consider any invasion plans ""very carefully,"" and said Haiti is not a ""vital"" American interest. **********At the same time, the Senate today rejected, by a vote of 57 to 42, a proposal by the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, to head off military action by creating a bipartisan commission to study the Haitian crisis, which opponents said would tie President Clinton's hands for months. **********The Administration's actions were seen by many in Washington as a final effort to persuade Haiti's military leaders to leave voluntarily so the United States would not have to send troops, a step President Clinton has said he wants to avoid but will not rule out. **********The White House continued to insist that it would still rely on strict economic sanctions to drive out Haiti's military leaders. But even as it maintained that position, some 2,000 paratroopers from the elite 82d Airborne Division, which would be in the vanguard of an American military action, held one of the largest rehearsals of an air assault that the unit has had in two years, Army officials said. **********The paratroopers are practicing jumping from C-141 and C-130 transport planes, and securing landing zones for troops and equipment that would be flown in later -- the same task the troops would undertake in an invasion of Haiti. **********Military officials in Washington and at Fort Bragg, where the 82d Airborne is based, described the two-night exercise as routine training that had been scheduled for two months. **********""Honest to goodness, this isn't related to Haiti or any specific scenario,"" said Maj. Jim Hinnant, a spokesman for the 82d Airborne. **********But one Pentagon-based general said that field commanders are now using long-scheduled exercises ""to focus on things we need to get down if we invade Haiti."" Marines Stage Evacuation **********In addition, more than 4,000 marines staged a mock evacuation for the second day on Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas, about 80 miles northwest of Haiti. They are part of a force of some 2,860 marines posted on Navy ships near Haiti. **********""We don't want to comment on the direct purpose of any training that would be going on,"" the Pentagon spokeswoman, Kathleen deLaski, said. ""Some of the things you see going on are related to training that could be used to execute a military option."" **********Tensions in Haiti and in Washington have risen following the departure from Haiti on Wednesday of 89 international human rights observers who were declared unwelcome by Haiti's military rulers and given 48 hours to leave the country. **********In light of these tensions and reports of the military preparations, Father Aristide's statement, while similar to others he has made in the past, seemed to add to expectations of an invasion. The latest comments seemed to contradict those made in an interview with National Public Radio in June, when he had said, ""Never, never, never would I agree to be restored to power by an invasion."" 15 Nations to Help **********The White House said that as many as 15 nations have signaled that they would participate in a multinational force to maintain security in Haiti after the military leaders leave. But the United Nations must still negotiate with those countries to work out specific details of their involvement. **********The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said at a luncheon speech here that countries indicating a willingness to join a post-restoration force include Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Surinam, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. Ms. Albright said the countries have tentatively committed 2,000 to 4,000 police and trainers. **********""They would be there to help with the training of the military and police force, to watch the situation on the ground and to be on hand to make sure that there isn't some upsurge in violence,"" said the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers. **********Administration officials also said today that Surinam has agreed to join Dominica, Grenada and Antigua in offering safe haven to Haitians fleeing their homeland. Surinam said it could accommodate between 2,000 and 2,500 Haitians. Broadcasts to Haiti **********The State Department announced today that broadcasts, called Radio Democracy, will begin on Friday and will be scheduled for two hours a day -- from 6:30 P.M. to 7:30 P.M., then again from 8 P.M. to 9 P.M. -- on AM 1035 and FM 91.9. **********Broadcasts will include messages of reconciliation from Father Aristide and other Haitians, but they will not include appeals for Haitians to halt their attempts to flee in rickety boats, a condition Father Aristide refused to accept. **********Administration officials cited what they called encouraging signs that the number of Haitians trying to flee by boat may be dropping. **********The State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said that about 2,300, or 30 percent, of the 7,600 Haitians being processed at Guantanamo Bay have chosen to return home. The remainder will be sent to third countries until the Haitian military government is replaced.  Warnings From Nunn **********Administration officials said the apparent reduction in the number of Haitians fleeing by boat has given the White House some ""breathing space"" to decide its next steps. But Congressional officials cautioned Mr. Clinton and his advisers not to act rashly. **********""When we're thinking of Haiti, we also have to think of other spots in the world where we have potential problems,"" Senator Nunn said on NBC's ""Today"" Show. ""Korea is a place where we have a vital interest, and that has to be our first top priority. Bosnia is also important and Haiti is important, but neither Bosnia nor Haiti are vital."" **********Senator Nunn said that calculation would change quickly if Americans come under attack in Haiti. ""Right now, they're not under threat,"" Mr. Nunn said. ""If they come under threat, we have to be prepared to move very rapidly."" **********Ms. Myers said there were no known threats against the more than 4,000 Americans in Haiti, but she added, ""The situation is deteriorating, and I think that makes things more difficult for everyone there."""

Just look at the popularity of frequent-flier programs and the airline-linked credit cards, which accumulate free miles. **********But, all too often, there is a catch: the programs can change at any time or be discontinued. **********Disappearing soon is the Citidollars credit card program, introduced by Citibank with great fanfare in 1979 and intended to encourage people to use their cards more frequently. People enrolled in the program earn one Citidollar for each $20 they charge on their Citibank Mastercard or Visa card. These Citidollars can then be used toward purchases of merchandise in the company's catalogues. **********In the early years, the catalogues contained such deals as a $330 General Electric television for $240 and 90 Citidollars or a $100 Casio calculator for $58 and 42 Citidollars. The bank contended that it made no money on the merchandise and that its prices were the lowest anywhere. **********On Aug. 31, Citidollars will become just another marketing memory. Ronald F. Williamson, president of Citibank (South Dakota), wrote card holders this summer that the program would end. **********""Citidollars outlived their usefulness,"" said Susan Weeks, a bank spokeswoman. She declined to say how many card holders would be affected, how many Citidollars were outstanding or what the average amount was in an account. **********Anyone with Citidollars can order items from the catalogue until Sept. 30 by calling (800) 788-7790. To get the most recent catalogue, call (800) 950-5114. But the bank is urging card holders to contribute their Citidollars toward a pledged $500,000 donation to 16 national charities. **********What about using Citidollars to pay the annual fee on some of the bank's credit cards, like those giving frequent-flier miles? **********""It seems to me that the minimum fair thing Citibank might do is to work out a formula,"" said Marvin H. Scilken, a card holder in Manhattan. ""It would be a chance to reward their loyal customers. I have about 31,000 Citidollars because I couldn't find anything to spend them on."" The bank, however, says no. **********The moral of the story: nothing is forever. If you are holding a bonus, use it as soon as possible -- or you may lose it. Even those popular airline bonus programs are not immune. Many airlines are raising the number of frequent-flier miles needed for a free round-trip coach flight within the United States by 5,000 in 1995 to 25,000. The next year, who knows?"

H. Macy & Company have agreed to listen to Federated Department Stores' pitch to combine the two department store operators, according to people familiar with details of the board's meeting yesterday. **********Those people said Allen I. Questrom, the chairman and chief executive of Federated, and other Federated executives were scheduled to meet with the board on July 1, a day after Macy has promised to file a plan of reorganization to leave bankruptcy as a stand-alone entity. The meeting is subject to Macy and its directors receiving additional information from Federated. **********""Questrom is going to lay out Federated's proposal and ask them, 'What can we do to work together?' "" one person familiar with the board meeting said. Delaying Macy's Plan **********The board's decision to meet with Federated executives will push back Macy's schedule to file a reorganization plan by June 30, people close to the company said. **********But they cautioned that the board's willingness to hear Federated out should not be construed as a shift in the rival retailer's favor. ""This is nothing more than a courtesy,"" one person said. **********Whatever plan the board endorses, Macy's creditors have the final say over what plan will steer the company out of bankruptcy. **********At the meeting, Macy discussed its business and its work on the reorganization plan. It also gave directors an update on the discussions with Federated, which has been answering Macy's questions about its proposal to merge the two companies since June 10. **********Macy has said it still considers its own plan the best, but it continues to hold what it calls ""listening sessions"" with Federated. It agreed to hear Federated out in an effort to at least postpone a movement by its senior creditors to cut short its exclusive right under the Federal Bankruptcy Code to present a plan of reorganization. **********Macy has won the support of its bondholders and other junior creditors. But senior creditors, whose claims must be satisfied before a plan can be approved, have endorsed Federated's proposal and show little sign of changing their minds. **********Last week, Daniel Harmetz, who manages Fidelity Investments' $490 million investment in Macy debt, told Macy executives that there was little they could do to change the mutual fund company's alliance with Federated, according to people familiar with the discussion. Mr. Harmetz declined to comment yesterday."

Kazarian, a friendly suitor for Borden Inc., presented a letter to the company's management last night, suggesting that his investment firm, Japonica Partners, was willing to purchase from 20 to 90 percent of the struggling consumer-products giant for $16 a share or more. **********But participants in the meeting, which ran nearly three hours, disagreed about the letter's provisions, and whether it represented a proposal or was simply a list of hypothetical options for the Borden board. **********Mr. Kazarian, a former chief executive of Sunbeam-Oster with experience in turning around consumer- products companies, declined to comment on the meeting. So did a Borden spokesman. **********Borden's representatives at the meeting will take the letter to the company's board, meeting attendees said. ""The ball is in Kazarian's court,"" said one participant in the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********Last night's meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between Borden executives and Mr. Kazarian, who has sought to be a friendly suitor for nearly four months, an executive familiar with the operations of Japonica said. Mr. Kazarian has pressed his interest since Borden took Wall Street by surprise last week by agreeing to be acquired for $2 billion by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. **********Borden, however, has never considered Mr. Kazarian a serious contender because he has never disclosed financing commitments. He offered no specifics of financing to the Borden management last night. **********Mr. Kazarian was consulting with advisers about making further proposals to the company or escalating to a hostile bid, meeting attendees said. **********Kohlberg, Kravis has proposed to swap nearly half its stock in RJR Nabisco Holdings to pay for all of Borden's shares at $14.25. Many big shareholders have become angered by the provisions of the deal, and questions have mounted about the board's actions. **********Borden's chairman, Ervin R. Shames, said last week that Kohlberg, Kravis's capital could turn the company around. He said that ""last year nobody was interested in buying the business at the price we wanted to sell it,"" adding, ""we think this is a fair price."" **********The meeting began shortly before 6 P.M. yesterday in the Manhattan offices of Borden's law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Some participants described the atmosphere as ""cordial and constructive,"" while others called it ""very tense without yelling or screaming."" **********According to several participants, the 20 or so attendees included Mr. Kazarian and his lawyers and associates as well as Borden's general counsel, Allan Miller, and its chief financial officer, James Van Meter. **********An executive with knowledge of Japonica's letter said Mr. Kazarian had formed an entity, Buckeye Partners, to act as friendly suitor. **********Japonica was said to be ready to offer a broad range of options to Borden, offering to take over anywhere from 20 to 90 percent of the company and leaving shareholders with continued ownership in Borden. **********Japonica, which is based in Providence, R.I., is also said to be prepared to propose an infusion of cash into Borden ranging from $200 million to $500 million from Japonica and its partners. Larger sums would come from investment or commercial banks, with which Mr. Kazarian was said to be talking for most of the day before yesterday's meeting."

""But Assad has always been known to be a very shrewd reader of the geopolitical environment, and as such he must realize that the environment has changed."" **********After tonight's meeting between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Assad, a senior Administration official said the indirect Syria-Israel talks had entered a new phase in which the two countries were explaining the security and political needs behind their proposals and then fashioning counterproposals that searched for common ground. **********Mr. Christopher said the atmosphere had grown more upbeat. He noted that Syrian television had broadcast live the speeches of King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel when they signed their declaration in Washington. He also noted that in a speech last week Mr. Assad had talked about the importance of peace. **********""We're seeing some positive things in the area of public diplomacy,"" Mr. Christopher said. His aides say President Assad's has been psychologically preparing the Syrian people for peace with their longtime enemy. **********On Saturday night, Mr. Christopher met with Prime Minister Rabin in Jerusalem, and today he presented some of the Israeli's peace ideas to Mr. Assad. **********On Monday, Mr. Christopher will meet with Mr. Rabin to report the results of tonight's meeting. He will join the Israeli Prime Minister in the Jordanian port city of Aqaba, where Mr. Rabin will meet with King Hussein and become the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Jordan publicly after decades of secret contacts. **********After a week in which Israel attacked southern Lebanon and Iranian-backed Party of God guerrillas fired rockets into Israel, Mr. Christopher said he had conveyed, not just on his own part but also on Israel's, a request that Syria press the Party of God to stop attacking Israel and end all terrorist activities. **********In Washington's view, Iran has more sway over the Party of God than does Syria, but American officials say Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon, could suppress the militant Shiite Muslim group. **********American officials accompanying Mr. Christopher indicated today that Martin Indyk, the National Security Council's chief specialist on the Middle East, had emerged as the leading candidate to be the new Ambassador to Israel. **********To help entice Syria and other Arab countries to make peace with Israel, American officials announced in Jerusalem today that a conference would be held in Casablanca from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1 to promote economic development throughout the Middle East. **********President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia will co-sponsor the conference, which will bring together officials and business leaders from more than a dozen countries. King Hassan of Morocco will be the host."

""Mark your stamp on life. Give us your final gift: Vote."" **********The room of old people, poised as if at a bonus rite of passage, responded with a burst of applause and cheers, some putting aside cane and crutch. **********""I'm voting for the return of my country,"" declared 77-year-old Jerry Buthelezi, lean-faced and content under a big brown fedora. ""That's important. That's a beautiful thing."" **********The exchange, in which Mr. Nkosi returned as a successful businessman to preach free choice on his boyhood streets in the state-segregated ghetto, was one of the least slick moments in what has become the costliest, most integrated civic endeavor ever attempted in South Africa -- a get-out-the vote drive that is flooding the public with the message that historic duty and fortune await in the first fully free post-apartheid elections on April 26-28. **********The campaign has vans cruising back roads to coax rural villagers to come forth and practice their ""X."" **********""Some had never held a pencil before,"" said Nicholas Wolpe, a roving elections trainer. **********A colleague, Sharon Balsys, a visiting elections worker from Canada, feels at home. ""No worse than Rainy River,"" she said, referring to the electoral rigors of a multilingual Canadian town where ballot boxes sometimes have to be parachuted down through winter snows. **********In South African cities, the message is carried in thumping rap lyrics, in a special voters' soap opera and ""Make Your Mark"" election quiz shows on TV, and in euphoric liberation ads worthy of the glossy yearnings in Ronald Reagan's ""morning again in America"" commercials. One shows a bright huge voting-X pattern of a throng of multi-hued humans moving lushly across a green and promising national landscape. **********It is a ubiquitous message, from programmed cassettes on black workers' jitney vans to the fading primacy of the white Afrikaner-run television channel where a Wagner ian singer booms clunky two-step jingles about a future that will somehow prove grand for all. ""We're gonna have a ball!"" she croons and sways and grins to the tune of ""After the Ball Is Over."" **********The message is not monolithic, for the voter education drive is directed at all sorts of problems. One pitch, emphasizing the secrecy of the ballot, is intended to undercut husbands' attempts in traditional tribal areas to dictate their wives' choice. Other messages warn against scheming tribal chiefs who are demanding patronage tithes as the price of franchise, and against white overseers who are confiscating their black farm workers' identity cards to hinder voting. **********Cautions toward fairness rain down endlessly in the media. There are the sitcom family morality tales of the popular comic actor, Joe Mafela, spokesman for the Chicken Licken restaurants. There are the theater tableaux of Black Sash, the highly respected women's protest group. All the hurried innovations of democracy's mechanics -- from ultra-violet hand dye at the ballot box to an 18-party potpourri of options on the first of two paper ballots -- are being explained to the 22 million eligible voters, especially the black majority long denied a fair and thoughtful franchise. A Rite of Transformation **********But the overall point of the voter education drive, costing somewhere beyond $30 million, is that the vote is not merely about a leadership choice, but about a people's passage to a higher phase of democracy and national definition. ""Heal Our Land"" is the slogan under an X of crossed Band-Aids. It is an imprimatur on liberation. The likely result, the choice of Nelson Mandela as national leader, is well known, but not the volume of turnout in ratifying a transformed nation. **********""It is a grand, purificatory moment in which the nation is to pass through a membrane of history from darkness to a sunlit upland,"" wrote Simon Barber in Business Day, relishing with sarcasm the TV commercial blitz, including one showing a patriarchal old man walking miles to vote, clutching the hand of his grandchild. A Long Walk to Freedom **********In fact, Mr. Wolpe saw just such a tough old man climb three hours down from his mountain home to join a hamlet crowd of 250 for a practice vote at the elections van. South Africa is in just such a state, trembling somewhere between the wondrous reality of the first-time voter facing the fullest choice, and the Utopian dreams of the modern media's motivation arts. **********""This was real heart-and-soul stuff,"" said Linda Radford, account director on some of the most lyrical ads for the local J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. ""The task was daunting,"" she said, noting professional crews were more integrated as they filmed idealized ethnic portrayals that would have been treasonous in the recent past. **********Barry Gilder, one of the chief creative executives of the drive as communications chief of the Matla Trust, can talk in detail of fine tuning the message in such critical areas as radio, the most effective medium for reaching the black poor majority in rural and small-town areas. But he feels that foremost is the campaign's overall spiritual dimension. **********""It's like a kind of catharsis,"" he said, ""even for white people, who want an end to the uncertainties and the fear, the guilt and the anxieties."" **********Matla Trust, a nonprofit organization, was one of a score of groups in the Independent Forum for Electoral Education that began preparing for the day of a free vote well before the Government's moves to dismantle apartheid put that on the horizon four years ago. **********The campaign now includes hundreds of organizations operating through the forum, and through the Democracy Education Broadcast Initiative of media professionals, the Business Election Fund of private entrepreneurs, and the Independent Electoral Commission, the interim Government body which has taken an ever firmer hand to avoid postponement of the elections in the face of violence and resistance in KwaZulu, the homeland created under apartheid for the Zulu people. **********Even with all the problems and confusion and protest violence in some areas, campaign directors hope for a turnout of up to 85 percent. Blacks are the most enthusiastic, while the racially frayed nation's mixed-race and Asian minorities are most ambivalent, reflecting a fear that they will remain in a political limbo, second to black majority power as they have been a secondary buffer for the white regime. **********Countless foreigners are arriving to help get out the vote and monitor the election. Craig Charney, a Yale political scientist, has been here for several years, working lately as a broadcast news polling expert. **********""It's an extraordinary thing to see millions of people around the country put slips into a box and see their government change as a result, without tanks in the streets,"" he said, looking beyond the demographics. ""South Africa is going to become not a Western style democracy but a wobbly, imperfect third-world democracy. But it is a vast improvement over what came before."" Some Find Fault **********In democratic fashion, there are numerous complaints. Some white political leaders charge the education drive favors the black majority. Other people feel too much faith has been placed on entertaining TV ads and not enough on the face-to-face approach favored by Mr. Nkosi in visiting the Soweto old folks. **********""What's a political party?"" he asked, and ""Mandela!"" was shouted in reply by one old man, grinning gap-toothed. **********Jabu Mohlouwa, a social worker, smiled at the scene. ""People think this election will put honey on their plates, but they're wrong,"" she said. ""They think Mandela is a magician. He's not."" **********But her elderly charges plunged ahead into the future, intoning his name and asking more questions about how to vote free."

For owners moving across international borders, it is also a question of currency and tax. **********For example, U.S. citizens planning to sell their homes in the United States before beginning a foreign assignment might want to think twice before executing the sale. If they do go ahead and sell, they should take careful note of the following. **********The Internal Revenue Code provides that any gain on the sale of a home must be deferred and rolled over into the basis of the new home, if the new home is purchased and occupied within two years of the sale. For U.S. citizens or residents living abroad, the reinvestment period is extended by up to an additional two years. **********If, for some reason, the foreign assignment is extended, or reinvestment is rendered impossible for personal reasons, the rollover gain becomes taxable on an amended U.S. income tax return which must be filed for the year of sale. And the tax on the gain is subject to four years worth of late payment interest. A simple example illustrates the point. **********Say that expatriate X sells his principal residence in North Carolina on December 21, 1994, just before leaving on foreign assignment to France. He realizes a gain of $50,000 on the sale, which he reports on his U.S. income tax return for 1994. **********Four years later, on December 21, 1998, Mr. X is still on foreign assignment in France and has not reinvested the sales proceeds in a new principal residence. He should thus file an amended U.S. income tax return for 1994, reporting the gain which is taxable at 28 percent, resulting in a total federal tax of $14,000 plus late- payment interest. The State of North Carolina will also want its slice of the cake, with tax rates of up to 7.75 percent on the gain, making total state tax and interest of $4,960. **********The Internal Revenue Code contains no restrictions as to the status of the property in which the expatriate reinvests. As long as occupancy and level-of-reinvestment criteria are fulfilled, he can buy a principal residence outside the U.S. **********If the U.S. expatriate does decide to buy real estate in a foreign country while outside the United States, however, he risks exposure to foreign-exchange fluctuations between the date he invests in the foreign country and the date he finally sells the property. The unexpected effect of foreign exchange movements can be compounded by a foreign mortgage taken out to buy the property. **********For example, say that expatriate Y buys a principal residence in France in 1995 at a time when the dollar-to-franc exchange rate is 5.5. He finances the purchase partly from his own pocket and partly with a mortgage from a French bank. One year later, the exchange rate has dropped to 5.2, and Mr. Y sells his French home in order to repatriate to the United States. **********When he sells, he may roll over the gain he realizes into a new home, thereby deferring U.S. taxation. He pays off his mortgage with the proceeds from the sale, but realizes a dollar loss on the mortgage transaction due to the difference in the exchange rate between the date he took out the mortgage and the date he pays it off. **********In the case where the dollar value increases between the date of purchase and the date of sale, taking the same facts as above but assuming that the dollar has risen to 5.9 francs by the time Mr. Y sells, the consequences are as illustrated in the dollar appreciation table accompanying this article. **********Mr. Y's gain on the home sale may receive deferred taxation treatment, but the dollar gain he realizes on the repayment of the mortgage is taxable immediately - at rates up to 39.6 percent! **********- **********HEATHER TIMMS is a principal at Arthur Andersen International in Paris."

He said the commercial, which begins running on Sunday, was produced by Leap as part of a special Super Bowl assignment. Burnett, which is producing additional commercials for Miller Lite, has created four Miller Lite campaigns in the three and a half years since it landed the estimated $100 million account. **********Several principals of Leap worked on the successful Bud Light campaign at their previous agency, DDB Needham Chicago; this summer Bud Light passed Miller Lite as the top-selling light beer. **********The commercial is Leap's second for Miller.

Teachers who tested them on controlled courses veered out of lanes, overshot stop signs and reacted sluggishly when steering and braking. **********The glasses were invented by Dr. Sidney Slavin, an optometrist in Richmond who spent years researching eye exercises to control motion sickness. Thinking that glasses that deliberately make people dizzy might be useful, he designed lenses with prisms that directed light away from the macula, the center of the retina that is the point of sharpest vision. The prisms can be positioned in four settings -- up, down, right or left -- to direct light from the center of the eye. **********""With these special lenses,"" Dr. Slavin said, ""I shift light to a new part of the eye, causing the brain to scramble to recalibrate. But there's not enough time, so the brain is confused."" The results, he said, include dizziness, double or blurred vision and a warped perception of space and distance. **********""It affects your sense of balance, of gravitational knowledge, your sense of 'where is my body in space,' "" he added. ""That's sort of what it's like to be drunk. At least the kids think so."" **********Hundreds of students have tried the glasses in pilot programs, Dr. Slavin said. He asked them to walk a straight line, reach for a doorknob and run down a hallway or past a large stuffed bear without the glasses. Then they repeated the tasks with the special lenses. **********""Their foot will be off to one side of the line,"" Dr. Slavin said. ""They'll reach for the doorknob and miss it. They're paralyzed in the hallway, because the walls look like they're moving. And they run right into the teddy bear, trample it and drag it all the way down the hall."" **********Last week, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta announced that deaths caused by drunken driving had decreased 31 percent since 1982, in part because of education campaigns. Yet 17,000 people were killed in alcohol-related accidents last year. **********Dr. Slavin, a consultant to the police in Virginia when they developed a roadside sobriety-vision test, tested his glasses on teachers at a conference in 1992. Janet Ragland, who was president of the Virginia Association of Drivers Education and Traffic Safety, said she could not operate her test car because of blurred and doubled vision. **********""You still have the judgment you don't have when you've been drinking,"" Ms. Ragland said. ""But the glasses could be an important tool for showing kids the visual effects of drunk driving without having them do any actual drinking."" **********Dr. Slavin said he had received a grant from the Virginia Education Department to devise a program using the glasses in the schools in Richmond. He received patent 5,362,238. Elevator Inventor Is Out of Touch **********Charles Laurutis may inspire makers of action movies about people trapped in skyscrapers to develop a new plot device. He has been granted a patent for an elevator that rescues people from burning buildings. But his lawyers said that Mr. Laurutis did not know that, because they have not been able to find him. **********Mr. Laurutis patented an emergency elevator that rises on a track outside high-rise buildings. First a foundation would be laid next to the building. The elevator, a platform with a cage, would be stored in an underground shelter. In case of a fire or emergency the elevator would emerge and rise on the track, stopping at each floor so that people could escape through windows. The elevator would run on an energy source, like propane, independent of the building. **********Mr. Laurutis is in his 50's and began developing his invention after a crane accident led him to stop working years ago, his personal lawyer, Larry Levy, said. Mr. Laurutis was given a monetary settlement for the accident, and he spent time perfecting the elevator. **********When the elevator reaches a floor with trapped people, an operator or firefighter would unlock the windows from the outside. The cage would be made of fireproof material and have a flame barrier. ""The windows would open inward, so people could exit the building,"" Mr. Levy said. ""They'd be stepping into a cage, more or less, and if they were handicapped or in a wheelchair, they could be rolled right on."" **********Mr. Levy said he did not know where Mr. Laurutis was. ""He may or may not be in Mexico at the present time,"" Mr. Levy said. Mr. Laurutis's patent lawyer, Jim Paul of Los Angeles, said he was worried about ""the significant maintenance fees due for foreign patents."" **********""If we can't find him,"" Mr. Paul said, ""there could be serious questions about ownership."" **********Because it takes an average of 18 months to process patents, inventors often move from addresses on their applications or change telephone numbers. Mr. Laurutis apparently did both. When he checks in, he will learn that his elevator has been given patent 5,355,975."

Each market is separate, and each has its own particularities of liquidity, its own notions of what is fashionable, desirable, and, ultimately, sellable. **********The exception that proves that rule is taxation. Whether you collect candy bar wrappers, or Tang-dynasty vases, if you buy at one price and sell at a greater one, the taxman is going to be interested. **********In fiscal terms, making that profit is known as realizing a capital gain. And the sensible course of conduct is to find out what you can do to ameliorate your tax position before you realize that gain. **********Simply giving a valuable artwork away to a spouse or child might seem like a good idea. But such generosity can generate unpleasant consequences. In the United States, for example, there might be gift tax to pay, and the possibility of a tax on later capital gains cannot be ruled out. **********The simple rule is: If you have been wise or lucky enough to own a collectible worth significantly more than you paid for it, go see an accountant before you sell."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/business/media-business-advertising-marketers-revive-old-formula-for-cachet-secret.html,Stuart Elliott,1994-04-28,,798,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Marketers revive an old formula for cachet: the secret ingredient.,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Marketers revive an old formula for cachet: the secret ingredient.," **********THE secret is out: secret ingredients are making a comeback. **********From the 1930's through the early 1970's, secret ingredients were as much a mainstay of hard-sell consumer marketing as snappy slogans and bombastic commercial jingles. About 20 years ago, they began falling out of favor, victims of changing tastes in advertising strategies and consumer attitudes. **********But in the last year or two, there has been a noticeable turnabout, a trend to re-emphasize secret ingredients. The reason is that advertisers and agencies perceive secret ingredients as a secret weapon in the battle of brand names against cheaper competitors and perceptions among shoppers that store shelves are flooded with lookalike products. **********Once, it seemed, nearly every brand had a proprietary component, compound or formula intended to justify the hyperbolic claims of performance superiority made in its advertising campaigns. To underscore the impression that science, not selling, was behind secret ingredients, most bore names -- coined words or combinations of letters and numbers -- that suggested laboratories rather than Madison Avenue. **********Dial soap boasted about AT-7. Rinso detergent puffed solium. Comet cleanser touted chlorinol. Bufferin pain reliever pitched di-alminate. **********In some instances, there were dueling secret ingredients. In toothpastes, Colgate had Gardol, Gleem had GL-70, Crest had fluoristan and Ipana had hexachlorophene and Durenamel, ""Bristol-Myers's brand of sodium fluoride and soluble orthophosphate."" **********But secret ingredients started wearing out their welcome. They were deemed old-fashioned, corny -- even campy. Natural ingredients like baking soda came into vogue. And consumers wanted detailed information about exactly what was in the products they bought. **********Research conducted for the Warner-Lambert Company, for instance, found that ""consumers didn't understand what Retsyn was,"" said Kathleen Ramsdell, a product manager at the company's American Chicle Group in Morris Plains, N.J., referring to the secret breath-freshening ingredient in its Certs brand of mints. **********So, ""we moved away from talking about Retsyn,"" she added, ""because if they didn't understand what it was, why talk about it?"" **********The revival of secret ingredients coincides with the pressure brand-name products face from lower-priced rivals, as well as from other name brands. **********""It's a branding strategy, a link between that key ingredient and your brand name,"" said Craig Patrick, an assistant product manager at American Chicle for the Clorets line of breath-freshening gum and mints. **********""Consumers want to know something in there is working for them,"" he added. ""Actizol is an integral part of our strategy."" Actizol, a blend of chlorophyll and oils in Clorets, is prominently featured in the brand's first commercials in five years. **********""As brands become more and more similar, you're constantly looking for something to distinguish you,"" said Richard DiLallo, a senior vice president and group creative director at J. Walter Thompson New York, the Clorets agency. ""And secret ingredients can do that."" **********Other brands focusing on secret ingredients include Cheer detergent, with an enzyme called Color Guard; Shade UVA Guard sunscreen lotion, with Parasol 1789 and oxybenzone, sunblock agents, and Pond's Dramatic Results Skin Smoothing Capsules, with Nutrium, ""a miraculous oil-free complex."" **********As they return, secret ingredients are getting a contemporary spin. The Clorets spots are distinctly tongue in cheek; when the comedian Bronson Pinchot utters ""Actizol,"" a gleaming point of light shines off his tooth. **********""It's the best of both worlds,"" Mr. DiLallo said. ""We're making a little bit of fun of it, but we're also saying Clorets does have this little special ingredient that makes your breath smell like a mint bush was put there when you're finished."" **********And posters by Foote, Cone & Belding of San Francisco for Zima, a new clear malt beverage with a hard-to-describe taste, depict a bottle and the words ""zecret ingredienz,"" which mean ""secret ingredients"" in the brand's silly ""Z language."" **********""It wasn't because we have any overly secret ingredients,"" said Mark Lee, Zima's brand manager at the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colo. **********Rather, he said, the reference was a way to ""talk about the product without describing exactly what it is,"" part of a campaign to ""create some intrigue."" **********The result, Mr. Lee said, was that consumers tried Zima during the first eight weeks it was available in various markets ""at a rate three to four times the norm in our industry."" **********Even Certs, which has taken Retsyn so seriously since it was introduced as a secret ingredient in 1960 -- remember ""Two, two, two mints in one""? -- gently mocks it in two commercials by Young & Rubicam. **********A voice-over announcer in the spots, the actor Grant Shaud, declares Certs to be ""the only breath mints with that -- Retsyn stuff!"""

The building at 25 Cromwell Street, called the House of Horror in the press, continued to exert its ghoulish spell. **********The owner, a 52-year-old builder named Frederick West, is under arrest, charged with three killings so far, including that of his 16-year-old-daughter, Heather, who vanished seven years ago. **********The body recovered today was unearthed with the aid of a new ground-penetrating radar that can detect pockets where the earth has been disturbed. The radar has ""indicated other spots where we should be looking,"" said Chief Inspector Colin Handy of the Gloucestershire police. Children of Liverpool **********Britain has seen other serial killers; there have been eight since 1950. And of course the most notorious of all is Jack the Ripper, who killed East End prostitutes in the gaslit streets of London in 1888. **********Then, too, Britain has been rocked by a series of horrific crimes recently. Earlier this year two 11-year-old boys in Liverpool were convicted of killing James Bulger, a toddler they grabbed from a shopping center. The attack was so brutal and depraved it seemed to defy explanation despite reams of essays by sociologists and psychologists. **********But the Gloucester case is particularly horrifying because the murders took place over such a long period -- beginning as early as 1968 -- and the victims were young women who just dropped out of society with barely a ripple. **********Polls suggest that, as in the United States, crime is a rising concern in Britain. More than any one single issue, it inspires a general malaise, born of the sense that the social fabric is ripping, that the cities are becoming unsafe and that Britain is no longer so civilized a refuge. A Symbol of Decline? **********""It's so shocking, you just don't expect something like this right on your doorstep,"" said Jackie Allen, pushing her year-old son down Cromwell Street. ""Who wants to raise children in a world like this? Years ago this wouldn't happen."" **********In fact, while crime has risen steeply in England, the homicide rate has gone up slowly. In 1992 there were 622 homicides, which includes murder and manslaughter, in England and Wales. That compares with 652 in 1991, 565 in 1990, 549 in 1980 and 354 in 1967. **********A professor interviewed on the radio today called the latest killings ""a symbol of the general decline of our society."" But, as if to offer reassurance, he said he had worked out the odds of being murdered by a serial killer in Britain: one in 2.5 million. **********The area where the murders took place is only a short walk from the cathedral that brings hundreds of thousands of tourists each year, and not far from a building that inspired a Beatrix Potter story, ""The Tailor of Gloucester."" Once a quiet residential street of neat Victorian houses, it is now run down, and many of the three-story brick and stucco structures have been converted into rooming houses. **********Mr. West ran one such place in the 1970's and at least one of the victims identified so far was a lodger, an 18-year-old named Shirley Ann Robinson, who was pregnant when she died. Mr. West and his wife, Rosemary, who was released on bail, have eight children. His first wife, Catherine, and a daughter from his first marriage have not been seen by relatives for 25 years although he apparently told neighbors she was in her native Scotland. **********One surprising aspect that has emerged in all the publicity is the fact that there is no national registrar of missing persons, who are roughly estimated at about 250,000. The Association of Chief Police Officers has been backing the idea for six years. **********Up to now the only office that concerns itself is the Missing Persons Bureau, a charity organization in southwest London staffed by volunteers. But the Home Office announced on Tuesday that Scotland Yard would open a bureau dedicated to missing persons by the end of the month. In Court Again Friday **********In keeping with strict court procedures, the police refused to make public any details of Mr. West's arrest or initial grounds for suspicion. But rumors of disappearances connected to his house are reported to have circulated for some time, and at least one family member is said to have cooperated in an investigation. **********A short stocky man with sideburns and curly hair, Mr. West slumped against the sides of the dock when he was charged in court last week, but he did not speak. He is due to make another court appearance on Friday. **********Brian Masters, an authority on serial killers, said the West case reminded him of John Christie, a quiet ex-policemen who killed eight women between 1949 and 1953. ""They were also buried in the garden and behind the walls,"" he said. ""They were women and he kept them on the premises in a domestic situation. Why should a murderer do that? It's a way of extending your control over them."" **********The police are now looking for more bodies at two other sites. If they turn up, the killer could become the most deadly in British history, surpassing Dennis Nilsen from North London, who strangled 15 men between 1978 and 1983, and Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who killed 13 women between 1975 and 1980."

This means that the S.E.C. is anxious to make it easier for foreign companies to list and trade on American exchanges and sell stock here. **********""Clearly, the competitive pressure from international markets has increased,"" Mr. Levitt said in a recent interview. ""This is an initiative to bring more foreign companies to the foremost marketplace in the world."" **********But it is still unclear how encouraging this more welcoming attitude will be to foreign companies, many of which have been put off by America's different -- and often much more demanding -- disclosure requirements. So it could be some time before there is a flood of new foreign stocks that are easy for American investors to buy. **********Last month the S.E.C. backed up its warm and fuzzy words, approving steps to ease foreign company access to United States markets by simplifying registration and reporting requirements. **********Several accounting rules were relaxed, and the S.E.C. voted to accept international accounting standards for foreign companies' cash-flow statements, making meeting its standards a little easier than in the past. **********Foreign companies will also be permitted to use the shelf-registration process, which allows a company to use one registration statement to offer stock, debt and other securities well in advance of the time it expects to issue the securities. **********Mr. Levitt went to Beijing at the end of April to sign an agreement with Chinese authorities to cooperate on market supervision and exchange of information in possible fraud cases. Five Chinese companies are planning to list on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. **********""The signals they are sending out are different,"" said Richard Ketchum, Nasdaq's executive vice president and chief operating officer and a former director of market regulation at the S.E.C. ""And I think it has had a profound effect."" **********The impact of the recent changes has not yet been felt, but the allure of United States markets has attracted more foreign companies. In the last two years, more than 200 foreign issuers from 27 countries entered American financial markets for the first time. **********Despite the inflow, there are many more that have not yet been successfully wooed, in part because they do not like the still stiffer requirements for financial disclosure in the United States. **********""If we could list stocks of the top 800 companies that now trade on other exchanges, we could double the market capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange,"" said Robert G. Britz, senior vice president for new listings at the Big Board. **********It is not clear how, if at all, the new changes will influence the listing decisions of big German and Swiss companies. For accounting reasons, most of these companies have been reluctant to list their shares here. **********""The Germans are still on the fence, but they will list,"" said Kurt Ramine, a partner at Coopers & Lybrand whose practice is primarily with German-speaking clients. **********""The Swiss, who are the leaders in international accounting, don't need the capital right now,"" he added. When they do need it, they go to London. But the S.E.C. is opening up."" **********Francois Perroud, a corporate spokesman for Nestle, said that despite the recent changes there were still ""divergences"" between international accounting standards and the General Accepted Accounting Practice standard in the United States. **********In the longer term, ""our hope is that there should be some kind of recognition by the major exchanges that the accounting standards practiced in different countries are equivalent,"" he said. ""That would then solve the problem of a corporation like ours,"" he added. Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, has operations in over 70 countries. **********That appears to be the way Mr. Levitt wants the S.E.C. to move. ""My strategy,"" he said, ""is to see if we can use the tools available to us to embrace standards that are close enough to U.S. standards to be acceptable."""

Brown arrived this weekend to seek more constructive relations, the Chinese authorities ordered another clampdown on dissidents, placing many under effective house arrest. **********On the commercial level, Mr. Brown's six-day visit may pay some dividends, especially for American corporations competing for contracts here, but the political agenda remains soured by conflicts over trade, human rights and arms sales. **********Western diplomats here say the Chinese leadership has shown little good will in return for the political risks Mr. Clinton took in separating rights from China's trade status. **********""They just pocketed it,"" one Western diplomat said, adding that the Chinese have moved on to express other grievances, like Mr. Clinton's proposal to beam Radio Free Asia into China and to step up Voice of America's shortwave programming. **********""It's not quite table-thumping, but they are still very grumpy about human rights,"" the diplomat said. **********Since Mr. Clinton's decision on trade, the Chinese leadership has taken a number of actions that contradict previous diplomatic efforts: ***********It indefinitely postponed discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross to open prisons as a means of checking reports of torture, political detention and other abuses. ***********It broke off discussions with the Voice of America on ending the jamming of some broadcasts. ***********It continued or increased the arrests of religious, labor and democracy advocates. **********""Since March 1994, at least 17 organizers or leading affiliates of dissident groups such as the League for Protection of the Rights of Working People of the P.R.C. and the Shanghai Association for Human rights have been rounded up by police and either held without trial or simply made to disappear -- their detentions unacknowledged or denied,"" a joint report by two New York-based rights organizations said at the end of July. **********Qin Yongmin, 44, a democracy advocate who opposed China's bid to serve as host to the 2000 Olympics, was brutally beaten at a labor camp in central China where he is serving a two-year sentence, his wife asserted last week in an open letter to the National People's Congress, China's parliament. **********Among the dissidents caught up in this weekend's clampdown was Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen uprising, whom the authorities detained on Saturday and released 12 hours later. Mr. Wang, 24, issued a letter last Thursday complaining that for the last three months, his home had been besieged by police officers who follow his every movement. **********Other dissidents woke up this morning to find the police on their doorsteps.  Under Police Watch **********Chen Ziming, one of two pro-democracy intellectuals released from prison on medical parole before President Clinton's decision on China's trade status, still lives as a prisoner in his tiny Beijing apartment, unable to go out or to receive friends. Public security officers camp in the hallway outside his eighth-floor apartment, ringing the bell every morning to verify his presence. **********Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a report today that executed prisoners have become ""a principal source for organ transplants"" in China in a system where there is no prior consent from the condemned or judicial safeguards against abuse. **********The Chinese authorities have also increased pressure on news organizations to curtail coverage of rights issues. United Press International withdrew a correspondent after the Foreign Ministry implied it would be difficult for the agency to receive credentials for other correspondents. Nicholas Driver, the journalist who was withdrawn, frequently tested the patience of security officers assigned to prevent him from meeting with dissidents. A Nobel Candidate **********In continuing disputes, like that over China's sales of ballistic-missile technology to Pakistan, China has attached new conditions to the resumption of talks on the spread of weapons. Beijing has said it will not discuss its sales unless Washington is willing to discuss the ""proliferation"" of its F-16 fighters to Taiwan. **********China's most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, released last September after serving most of a 15-year sentence, has not been heard from since he was re-arrested in April. Mr. Clinton personally protested a brief detention of Mr. Wei in March but has made no reference to Mr. Wei's plight in subsequent months. **********Now, with the support of rights organizations, a California philanthropist has started a drive to have Mr. Wei nominated for the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize. Whether Mr. Wei wins the prize, a broad international campaign would afford him an added measure of stature and, perhaps, greater protection from persecution for his support of democratic reform. **********Western diplomats seem at a loss to explain China's hard line. Washington and Beijing ""certainly don't have the momentum going that was going before May,"" one political specialist here said. **********Many American officials expected some Chinese magnanimity after the trade decision, and these officials are clearly disappointed. **********Some Western experts on China suggest that the Communist Party leadership, concerned that the country's 90-year-old paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, will not live out the year, has fallen into a paralysis, unwilling or unable to make decisions to liberalize the political environment. **********""It may just be that no one is willing to risk saying, 'All right, let's move ahead' "" on human rights, one diplomat said. A kind of diplomatic churlishness may be the only course for the leaders jostling for power and position. **********The Clinton Administration's high-level discussions on rights with the Chinese have been suspended since March, after the State Department's top human rights official, John Shattuck, met with Mr. Wei and carried back a message asking President Clinton to keep the pressure on China to begin releasing its thousands of religious and political detainees. No Agreement to Meet **********Mr. Shattuck is hoping to restart the talks and has suggested a meeting in New York during the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly in September, Chinese and American officials say. But the Chinese have yet to agree, and are apparently seeking other concessions from Washington before they do. **********Secretary Brown, who is being accompanied by corporate executives, is the first Cabinet member to come to Beijing since the shift in the Administration's rights strategy. He is expected to raise concerns over rights only in a perfunctory manner, Western diplomats say, and then move on to his commercial agenda. **********The sense of drift has only been reinforced by Mr. Clinton's delay in naming a new Ambassador. The current Ambassador, J. Stapleton Roy, was sent here three years ago by President Bush. Several months ago Mr. Roy was nominated Ambassador to Thailand, but he has been told that he cannot leave until his replacement arrives, and his replacement is nowhere in sight. **********In the meantime, China policy has been handled by middle-level officials struggling with disputes on copyright piracy and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Heightened Anxieties **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher has not met with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, since a stormy confrontation in mid-March. Last month Mr. Christopher, saying he was too busy in the Middle East, passed up an opportunity to meet Mr. Qian in Bangkok at a meeting of foreign ministers on Asian security. His decision visibly displeased the Chinese, diplomats said. **********These deferrals and the overall deterioration have heightened anxieties that Mr. Clinton's scheduled meeting with President Jiang Zemin at a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders in November could be another foreign-policy train wreck. **********The effort to nominate Mr. Wei for the Nobel Peace Prize is being organized by Alan Gleitsman, 64, a retired film distributor whose Gleitsman Foundation last year presented a $100,000 shared award to Mr. Wei and to President Nelson Mandela of South Africa for their achievements in fighting for democracy. **********Robin Munro, the Hong Kong director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Wei served a special role in China's democracy movement. **********""The Chinese Government needed Wei to be in jail for all those years,"" Mr. Munro said, because he was ""a symbol of the line Chinese citizens would not be allowed to cross, and he is playing the same role now that he is back in jail. **********""If there is anyone in China who fills the slot of a Mandela, it is Wei, because he is a peaceful dissident who has spent 15 years in jail for what he believes in."""

""September is usually a horrible month because of profit taking and window-dressing,"" Mr. Navellier said, alluding to the kind of trading that takes place as the third quarter closes. ""But it won't be as bad as usual because there aren't any profits to take, and there are too many dogs to throw out the window."" **********Three stocks -- General Motors, American Express and Eastman Kodak -- accounted for nearly all the rise in the Dow yesterday.

Chrysler also reported strong growth, but Ford reported weaker than expected sales. **********American Express, the most active stock, with 3.9 million shares changing hands, rose 1 3/8, to 30 3/8, after the company introduced a new version of its Optima credit card.

Mr. Clinton approved the package of military and diplomatic proposals on Monday night. **********The new military approach, which will be presented at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels on Wednesday, appears to have widespread support among the allies, but differences of approach remain, and its approval is not certain. Nor is it known whether the Bosnian Serbs or their Muslim foes would be prepared to comply with its terms. Poll Favors Bombing **********The Administration's plan represents Mr. Clinton's response to widespread calls for the United States to do something to help halt the carnage in Bosnia. An ABC-TV poll released today indicates that a majority of Americans favor bombing Bosnian Serb gun positions ringing Sarajevo, as long as America's allies take part in the attacks. **********Fifty-one senators, meanwhile, urged Mr. Clinton to ignore a United Nations arms embargo and unilaterally arm the Muslim-led Bosnian Government so it can better defend itself. ""In our view, if the United States takes the first decisive step, our allies will follow,"" said a letter from the senators, led by Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. **********The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said today that any plane attacking Serbian forces would be shot down, the Belgrade-based Tanyug press agency reported. Two Aides Sent to Europe **********Seeking to demonstrate that he is also becoming active in reinvigorating the stalled Bosnian peace talks, Mr. Clinton ordered Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Charles E. Redman, the special envoy for Bosnia, to go to London, Paris and Bonn to offer fresh ideas for a peace agreement. **********Officials would not say what the new ideas are, but they insisted that the United States was still determined not to impose a settlement on the Bosnian Muslims. But still open is the question of whether the West is essentially asking the Bosnian Government to curb its military campaign to regain lost territory in exchange for Sarajevo's security. **********Under the American military proposal, NATO would give an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, who have relentlessly attacked Sarajevo for months, to move their tanks and artillery 20 kilometers, or 12.5 miles, from the center of the city. **********The Bosnian Muslims, who Secretary of State Warren Christopher has called ""the aggrieved party,"" would have the use of their own heavy weapons monitored by United Nations forces in and around Sarajevo. **********Seven days after the ultimatum goes into effect, heavy weapons of the Bosnian Serbs found within the restricted zone would be subject to bombing attacks, which would be carried out by American and other NATO planes in coordination with the peacekeeping troops. The plan also states that NATO could issue the ultimatum under existing United Nations authority and would not have to seek approval of the United Nations Security Council, where Russia would be able to use its veto. **********An early draft of the proposal, which was distributed to the NATO allies on Monday, included the deployment of advanced radar that could locate and relay sources of artillery fire. **********But that provision is now under review. American officials are concerned that deploying the radar would thrust NATO into a direct ground combat role in the Balkans. The radar equipment and the troops who would operate it would have to come from the United States, Britain, France or Germany.  Similar to French Plan **********The American plan is similar to a French plan that has been under discussion at NATO this week. Under the French plan, the Bosnian Serbs would have 10 days to withdraw their heavy weapons 30 kilometers, or 18.75 miles, from the center of Sarajevo. But a senior French official involved in the discussions said the two countries were essentially in agreement, and a senior United States official suggested that there might be some compromise on both the timing and the size of the restricted zone. **********France, which is the largest contributor of troops to the United Nations force in Bosnia, prefers a 10-day ultimatum to give as much defensive protection as possible to its troops, who protect the Sarajevo airport, in the event of retaliation against them. **********The French plan also states that NATO can approve the ultimatum in the absence of a new Security Council resolution. **********Indeed, a resolution adopted last spring designating Sarajevo as one of six protected ""safe havens"" in Bosnia authorizes air strikes if necessary to deter attacks against the safe areas and to protect the withdrawal of military and paramilitary units other than those of the Bosnian Government. Vote Must Be Unanimous **********Any vote on the ultimatum by the North Atlantic Council, the political arm of NATO, which is meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, must be unanimous, and there was still some opposition among NATO members. **********Canada's Foreign Minister, Andre Ouellet, said on Monday that air strikes could imperil the 2,000 Canadian soldiers in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, and lead to Serbian blockades of aid deliveries. **********The Greek Government spokesman, Evangelos Venizelos, said in Athens today that Greece opposed any armed intervention in the conflict. **********In remarks to reporters today, Mr. Christopher said the United States was poised to unveil some ideas for giving new life to the stalled peace talks. **********""You'll be hearing more about that from us in the next couple of days as some further steps unfold,"" Mr. Christopher said at a photo-taking session with Foreign Minister Manuel Tello of Mexico. Mr. Christopher added that the military and diplomatic steps were interlinked and advised the Bosnian Serbs to view American statements as evidence that the Administration was ""proceeding on a determined course.""  Vagueness Is Seen **********But French, British and Spanish officials today described Mr. Christopher as quite vague in talking about what the United States intends to do regarding the peace talks. **********""The Secretary keeps saying the United States doesn't want to put pressure on the Muslims, but I told him we have to get together and try to fix what kind of offer will satisfy the Muslims,"" said Javier Solana, the Spanish Foreign Minister, in a telephone interview from Spain. Spanish troops serve in the peacekeeping force in Bosnia. ""We have to take advantage of this momentum and we are looking forward to the new American proposals, but so far we don't know what they will be,"" he said. **********If, as expected, the United States gets more involved in the peace talks, it will represent a further shift in policy toward Bosnia. Thus far, Washington has steadfastly refused to become identified with the current peace plan, which would partition Bosnia into enclaves for each of the three Bosnian factions. **********The Administration has also argued that any peace that is imposed on the Bosnian Government, which has vowed to fight on to regain lost territory, would be impossible to enforce and would unfairly punish the victims of aggression."

In bonds, many analysts say rates have bottomed and will rise, albeit slowly, in 1994. The bottom line: investors who profited from the market run-up since the 1987 crash probably have to adjust their expectations for the next several years. **********Indeed, two of the three investment advisers asked by The New York Times to craft model portfolios for 1994 see a pullback in the market, perhaps in the second quarter, but they still predict returns of 7 to 10 percent. **********Their themes for 1994 are similar to last year's, but they caution that the favored sectors are less compelling now because most have already enjoyed good runs. **********All of the advisers tilted their portfolios toward smaller and midsize stocks, though two bet on a revival of badly battered consumer brand-name stocks. They mostly opted for value over growth managers, primarily for lower risk. And international investments, especially in Europe and the emerging markets of Asia and South America, play a big part this year. **********The most optimistic in the group is John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. ""All the talk is that there hasn't been a significant downturn since 1990, and we're due for one, but the surprise may be that we scrape by another year without one,"" he says. If the fundamentals remain in place, ""we can get 10 to 12 percent, which is a good year."" **********Mr. Rekenthaler would put 25 percent of his model portfolio into the Scudder Global Small Cap Fund. Small stocks have historically outperformed their larger brethren, he says, and Scudder has strong analysts internationally, where many small stocks are generally not well-researched. **********Nearly half the portfolio is invested in two funds Mr. Rekenthaler calls its ""cornerstones"": Strong Opportunity (25 percent) and IAI Regional Fund (20 percent). These are diversified domestic stock funds that should beat the Standard & Poor's 500, he says, but not lag too badly in a poor market. Both own companies considerably smaller and moderately cheaper than the 500. **********Another 20 percent is in T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income, which owns shares of seven Price fixed-income funds, for some income and down-market protection. **********The final 10 percent goes to the Third Avenue Value Fund, the only choice sold with a sales charge (5.75 percent). Because the fund invests in bankruptcies, turnarounds and special situations, it is risky. But its performance has been good, and it provides diversification because it's not highly correlated with the market, Mr. Rekenthaler says. **********Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser based in Buffalo, expects less than double-digit returns in 1994. The stock market tends to correct 2 to 18 months after the bond market peaks, which he believes it has, so ""I'm somewhat cautious,"" he says. **********Giving his portfolio a defensive tilt, he allocates 15 percent each to the Clipper and Yacktman funds. Both have large concentrations in health care and consumer brand- name stocks that made them lag in 1993, but both managers have top long-term records. **********He is also betting the economy will strengthen this year and interest rates will rise. He puts 15 percent each into Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, mainly real estate investment trusts, and Vanguard Specialized Energy, whose manager has been with the fund since 1984 and picks stocks on fundamentals rather than by energy category. **********Another chunk is overseas, in Oakmark International (15 percent) and Scudder Latin America (10 percent). Oakmark is 60 percent invested in Europe, owns no Japanese equities and can hedge currency in the event the dollar strengthens. The Scudder fund, he cautions, is a pure play on South America and therefore very risky. **********The final 15 percent is in Royce Premier, a small-cap value fund that is run by the managers of the Pennsylvania Mutual Fund but is much smaller, at $40 million, and more concentrated, with 50 to 75 stocks. **********Ken Gregory, principal in Litman/Gregory, a San Francisco-based investment advisory firm specializing in funds, sees no screaming buys today. That said, Europe, he suggests, offers relatively good value, so he would allocate 15 percent of his portfolio to the Tweedy Browne Value Fund, which is 90 percent invested there, mainly in smaller stocks. He would put another 10 percent into Acorn International, which also buys small companies, and 15 percent into Mutual Discovery, which is open to new investors through Charles Schwab & Company. Discovery owns an eclectic mix of bankruptcy and arbitrage plays and small-cap domestic and European stocks, Mr. Gregory says. **********Another 20 percent goes to emerging markets investments through the Montgomery Emerging Markets Fund. At home, Mr. Gregory says the area closest to being cheap is large-cap growth stocks, mainly pharmaceutical and consumer brand names, which he taps through the Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund (20 percent). **********His final 20 percent goes to Invesco High-Yield Portfolio, an upper-tier conservative junk bond fund, to decrease volatility of the overall portfolio and earn a stable 7 to 10 percent return, Mr. Gregory says."

Experiencing Delays in Arbitration,LAW; N.A.S.D. Experiencing Delays in Arbitration," **********WITH a little luck, someone who asks the National Association of Securities Dealers this month to arbitrate a dispute with a broker could get a hearing next March. But group officials and lawyers for investors warn that the process could take much longer. **********Arbitration requests have backed up this spring and summer. The first steps in the process -- getting a complaint accepted by the N.A.S.D. and having it served on a broker -- have stretched from days to weeks. Deborah Masucci, the association's director of arbitration, said the logjam could be traced to a surge in complaints just when there was considerable turnover in staff. **********""We had a significant increase in vacancies among legal assistants,"" Ms. Masucci said, adding that most jobs have now been filled. ""In the month of June we received the highest increased caseload in the last three years, somewhere in the 600- to 700-case range."" **********Although no one at the association pointed to a specific reason for the rise in complaints, the financial markets' decline this year undoubtedly contributed, as did reports of investor losses in esoteric derivatives -- contracts whose value is derived from an underlying financial asset or index. Furthermore, when presented with a choice of arbitration forums, investors are increasingly choosing the N.A.S.D. to resolve their disputes. **********Valerie Bailey, a senior lawyer at the association, noted that the caseload was considered exceptionally high last year as well. The group received 1,000 more cases in 1993 than in 1992, for a total of 5,419, a 24 percent rise. The recent surge on top of an already heavy caseload has caused disruptions ""at all levels, but primarily in getting cases served to respondents,"" she said. ""Last year we were able to keep up with the previous year"" in the number of cases resolved, ""but this year we're not."" **********The association tries to serve brokers within seven days of a complaint's being filed, Ms. Bailey said, but the lag time is now several weeks. It takes up to two months to choose arbitrators, and up to six months to hold a hearing. The association is now setting hearings for March. **********Lionel Glancy, a securities litigator in Santa Monica, Calif., said his arbitration cases often stretched out as long as court suits. ""Given that this is a simple process with limited discovery, one would expect that it would move more quickly,"" Mr. Glancy said. He said his cases took 8 to 16 months from filing to settlement. **********Brokerage account agreements generally specify that investors' complaints must be settled through arbitration at the N.A.S.D., the New York Stock Exchange or the American Arbitration Association. **********A Government Accounting Office report last year pointing out differences in arbitration awards among these groups appears to have encouraged investors to choose the N.A.S.D. **********""I think word went out that claimants do better at the N.A.S.D.,"" said Theodore Eppenstein, an investors' lawyer in Manhattan. ""The caseload there has increased, while the caseload at the N.Y.S.E. has decreased. But from my personal experience, it doesn't seem to matter."" **********Most disputes between investors and brokers arise over charges of unauthorized trading, failure to disclose details about an investment, misrepresentation of the investment or questions about whether an investment was suitable for a client. **********The process of securities arbitration has become increasingly complex in recent years, with more and more cases handled by lawyers instead of the investors themselves. To make sure a filing does not bog down, Mr. Eppenstein said, he often follows up by asking for specific arbitration lawyers or by making sure the N.A.S.D. has arranged conference rooms and court reporters."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/21/business/filing-raises-new-questions-about-borden.html,Glenn Collins,1994-11-21,,1223,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Filing Raises New Questions About Borden,Filing Raises New Questions About Borden," **********New information in a regulatory filing about Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company's proposed acquisition of Borden Inc. shows that a financial adviser to Borden had a $10 million incentive to complete the deal with Kohlberg, Kravis at the same time another suitor was trying to meet with the Borden board. **********The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission also suggests that the board did not seek counsel from its two financial advisers about the legal and legislative liabilities of tobacco when considering the proposed swap of Kohlberg, Kravis's RJR Nabisco stock for Borden. **********And the filing raises questions about the amount of information disclosed in a Borden letter to its shareholders on Oct. 28 about the terms of the deal. **********In September, after Borden agreed to be acquired for $2 billion by Kohlberg, Kravis, large shareholders complained that Borden's eight directors had failed to represent shareholders' interests in the negotiations with Kohlberg, Kravis, and questioned whether the board had been misled by its advisers. Borden, the financially troubled consumer products giant based in Columbus, Ohio, and its financial advisers countered that the acquisition represented the best deal for stockholders. **********According to an amended exchange statement filed by RJR Nabisco with the S.E.C. last Wednesday, Borden agreed on Sept. 13 to pay Lazard Freres, the adviser to the Borden board, $3 million upon the execution of the agreement to merge with the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation and an additional $7 million if ""K.K.R. and its affiliates acquire at least 50.1 percent of the outstanding Borden shares."" **********In addition, in an accord signed on Sept. 22, Borden agreed to pay CS First Boston, the financial adviser to the Borden management, a fee of $3 million when an exchange offer began and $7 million if Kohlberg, Kravis ""acquired at least 51 percent of the outstanding Borden shares,"" the filing says. **********The Federal documents show that the agreement for the $10 million incentive for Lazard, Freres was signed before the Borden board agreed to meet with another suitor for the company, Paul B. Kazarian. That occurred during the time when Lazard, Freres had been hired to give objective advice to the board about alternatives to the Kohlberg, Kravis deal. **********When Mr. Kazarian was permitted to meet with Borden's executives, on Sept. 21, representatives of Lazard, Freres and CS First Boston attended the meeting. Subsequently Mr. Kazarian made a suggestion that Borden allow its shareholders to vote on an alternative buyout proposal that Mr. Kazarian would offer. **********On Sept. 23, Frank J. Tasco, chairman of Borden, wrote Mr. Kazarian to say that Mr. Kazarian had failed to provide information about his ability to finance the transaction; the definitive agreement with Kohlberg, Kravis was signed that day. **********Mr. Kazarian, a former chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster Company with experience in turning around consumer products companies, has said he will offer a Borden bid, but none has been forthcoming. He declined to comment yesterday. **********The S.E.C. filing says that ""from time to time, in the past, Lazard Freres has represented K.K.R. and received customary fees therefore,"" something that Lazard has acknowledged. Executives from Lazard Freres have also said that they believed the deal with Kohlberg, Kravis represented the best interests of Borden's shareholders. **********""Everything that appears in our financial agreement with Borden totally conforms to industry standards and practices,"" said Louis Perlmutter, a general partner at Lazard Freres. ""There was absolutely no conflict of interest."" **********Another industry executive with knowledge of the Lazard Freres deal with Borden said that it represented a standard ""success fee"" arrangement and that the company would have also received a fee if a third party, like Mr. Kazarian, had come to terms with Borden. These provisions were not disclosed in the S.E.C. filing. **********Though CS First Boston signed its incentive agreement with Borden two days after the meeting with Mr. Kazarian, some investors presume that it was discussed and reviewed by lawyers while CS First Boston was advising Borden about the viability of Mr. Kazarian's proposal. **********A spokeswoman for CS First Boston said she could not comment on the compensation agreement. Spokesmen for RJR Nabisco and Kohlberg, Kravis, declined to comment, as did Mr. Tasco and members of the Borden board. **********In September, Kohlberg, Kravis, a specialist in leveraged buyouts, committed itself to buy Borden stock in a swap for $2 billion of its holdings in RJR Nabisco. The deal was valued at $14.25 for each Borden share. **********In a separate transaction, RJR tentatively agreed to buy 20 percent, or $500 million worth, of the Borden shares from Kohlberg, Kravis. **********But in early November, RJR Nabisco, which is based in New York and makes Camel cigarettes and Snackwell's Cookies, backed out of the preliminary agreement to buy 20 percent of the stock of Borden. **********On the same day, RJR announced a plan to begin separating its food operations from its tobacco business. It intends to sell 19 percent of its Nabisco foods unit in an initial public offering that could raise as much as $1 billion, which the company would use to pay down debt. **********Without the participation of RJR Nabisco, Kohlberg, Kravis will be the sole owner of Borden. Some Borden shareholders have said they are disappointed not only that their company will not get $500 million of RJR stock, which could have been converted to cash, but also that Borden will not have the expertise of the RJR board members and the company's experience with its successful food business. **********In initial Borden statements and news releases, the $500 million infusion from RJR Nabisco was presented as an important part of the Kohlberg, Kravis plan. Analysts, too, said the $500 million was an aid to the plans of Kohlberg, Kravis, because it could be used to pay down debt. **********The S.E.C. filing on Wednesday supplies the date that RJR decided to pull out of the Borden deal: Oct. 25. However, a subsequent letter from Mr. Tasco to Borden shareholders, dated on Oct. 28, describing the deal, did not mention the collapse of the plan to have RJR buy 20 percent of Borden's stock. The deal was announced on Oct. 31. **********""The Oct. 28 letter to shareholders was a very short letter put out for one reason -- to assure shareholders that they were not forgotten and would be receiving a full package of information,"" said Nicholas R. Iammartino, a spokesman for Borden. ""It was not intended to give all the substantive details."" **********Some investors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed surprise at another paragraph in Wednesday's S.E.C. document. According to the filing, in evaluating the proposed acquisition by Kohlberg, Kravis using RJR stock, the Borden board said issues like the impact of future tobacco liability litigation and governmental regulation were ""unknowable and could be devastating with respect to the value"" of the RJR common stock. **********But, the filing said, the board ""believed that since neither of its financial advisers had the expertise to evaluate such future liabilities, it was acceptable to exclude such issues from the financial advisers' opinions."" **********""How could the board possibly exclude the issue of tobacco liability, which is the single largest risk factor to RJR stock?"" asked one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********On Friday, Kohlberg, Kravis cleared another regulatory hurdle, when the Federal Trade Commission said it had no objection to the Borden purchase, implying that there were no antitrust implications to the deal. The deal still must pass scrutiny by the S.E.C."

Framed on a wall is the slender gold pen he used two decades ago to nationalize the largest oil reserves in the Americas. **********But the 71-year-old former President is spending his golden years under house arrest. Last year, he was forced from office and charged with corruption, and this year he spent two months in jail. **********Mr. Perez's experience so unnerved his predecessor as President, Jaime Lusinchi, who also faced an embezzlement trial, that on July 23 he slipped out of the country on a yacht. But not the resilient, flamboyant politician known to all Venezuelans as Cap. **********""My accusers wanted me to flee,"" Mr. Perez said with his usual spry vigor and combative humor. Brushing aside his impending Supreme Court trial on charges of embezzling $17 million, he said confidently: ""There are no crimes or criminals here. It is a complete manipulation."" **********Waving jauntily to onlookers, he entered prison in May. For 10 weeks, Mr. Perez was locked in a 12-by-9-foot cell in El Junquito prison in a west Caracas slum. He used the time behind bars to needle his longtime rival, Rafael Caldera, Venezuela's 78-year-old President, and to marshal support for his cause. **********Within hours of the jailing, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel-prize winning novelist, inveighed from neighboring Colombia: ""A country is adrift when justice is used as a political tool. This is very obvious in Venezuela today, and reveals a serious leadership crisis."" **********The Caldera Government received a letter of protest signed by the seven heads of state of Central America and another signed by 13 Caribbean heads of state. **********Enraged, Mr. Caldera temporarily recalled his ambassadors from the Caribbean. Mr. Caldera's backers said the former President was more popular overseas than at home and noted that he had been expelled from his Democratic Action Party a week after he was jailed. **********But, judging by the melee of flying metal chairs and thrown fists before the party's vote, Mr. Perez still enjoys a following. He received a steady stream of admirers in jail. **********""People rented buses and came from all over the country to see me,"" he said. ""A lot of people came whom I didn't even know."" **********After two months in jail failed to silence him, the Supreme Court consented to an appeal under a law that allows criminal suspects over 70 to await trial at home, under house arrest. **********Here, overlooking Caracas, where the scent of pine mingles with the smell of roasting coffee, he prowls his walled compound, receiving journalists and flinging barbs down the hill to the current occupant of Venezuela's presidential palace. **********""Unfortunately, President Caldera is a man who is not up to date,"" he said, referring to the new President's price and foreign currency controls. ""His political discourse has brought Venezuela back to state paternalism and to controls."" **********Criticizing Mr. Caldera's moves to suspend civil liberites, he said Venezuela was becoming ""a modern dictatorship, a state of collective intimidation."" **********Although Venezuela's Supreme Court is considering a gag order on the nation's No. 1 detainee, Mr. Perez shows no signs of keeping quiet. **********He noted that he lived through two coup attempts, a Supreme Court vote to strip him of presidential powers, and expulsion from the political party that for 53 years had been his second home. ""Nothing worse could happen to me,"" he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/business/mutual-funds-quarterly-review-varied-strategies-for-overseas-investors.html,Carole Gould,1994-07-05,,899,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Mutual Funds Quarterly Review; Varied Strategies for Overseas Investors,Mutual Funds Quarterly Review; Varied Strategies for Overseas Investors," **********After a strikingly good 1993, the international investing scene has proved disappointing so far this year. **********With the notable exception of Japan and Italy, returns have been weak. For an idea of what to expect for the rest of 1994 and beyond, three portfolio managers with strong records recently explained their performances and described what they were doing. **********The Scudder Latin America Fund has not fallen as far this year as the other nine funds investing in that region for one reason: cash. **********At times, the fund's cash hoard has risen to more than 15 percent. ""We felt that some sectors of the Latin American markets had become richly valued,"" said William F. Truscott, co-manager of the $620 million fund, which is down 7.7 percent for the quarter and 8.2 percent for the year. **********It's a far cry from the tack the managers took when they started the fund in late 1992. Through the end of last year, the managers were bullish on Latin America and kept little cash. **********Asked why prices were so rich, Mr. Truscott pointed to soaring investor interest because of the North American Free Trade Agreement and in emerging markets over all. Mexico is the fund's biggest bet. ""We expect strong economic growth in the years to come,"" he said. ""There would have been stronger growth this year had the country not undergone such a high degree of political turbulence."" **********Brazil and Argentina remain at roughly 20 percent of the portfolio each. The small chunk invested in Chile is through American depository receipts because direct investment there is difficult. **********Mr. Truscott describes his current view as ""reasonably cautious."" Coming elections in Mexico and Brazil have injected uncertainty into those markets. And higher domestic interest rates have caused a downturn in Argentina, which has a dollar-linked economy. **********The rest of 1994? ""That depends on whether we see more certainty in the political picture and whether interest rates stabilize,"" he said. **********Small and midsize European stocks make up nearly half of the $600 million Fidelity Worldwide fund, and its manager, Penelope Dobkin, plans to keep it that way. **********In Europe, big stocks outperformed small ones from late 1989 through mid-1993, Ms. Dobkin said. The cycle reversed as interest rates fell and economies hit bottom. At that point, she shifted her emphasis to small stocks, figuring they would have an edge for two to three years or more. **********She dumped the fund's investments in the emerging markets and Southeast Asia in the first four months of 1994 because of poor performance. That move helped raise her second-quarter gain to 1.2 percent and her year-to-date gain to 2.8 percent. **********Contributing to that solid performance was an increased weighting in Japan, which now accounts for 14 percent of assets, compared with 10 percent at the start of the year. There, Ms. Dobkin is concentrating on domestic investments -- department stores, automobile parts companies and construction companies. ""It's the Japanese consumer that has the greatest wealth, and they haven't been catered to,"" she said. **********Ms. Dobkin trimmed her United States holdings three percentage points in 1994 by selling cyclical stocks like farm equipment companies. Domestic holdings are mostly in health care, oil and computers. **********Although she has not sold anything in Latin America, she has not bought either, letting the region's weighting (mostly in Mexico) slip by half. **********Finally, the fund has a large amount of cash, but not intentionally, she said. It merely reflects the huge sums of money investors have moved into overseas investments this year. **********The $239 million Sogen Overseas, started in September, called the bets right in 1994 with an astonishing half of assets in cash. As a result, the fund is up three-tenths of 1 percent for the quarter and 6 percent for the year. **********Its manager, Jean-Marie Eveillard, who also manages Sogen International, is ""embarrassed"" by the huge cash position but blames sloppy foreign markets for it. ""Europe was cheap 18 months ago but no longer is,"" he said. ""Most European markets are down 8 to 10 percent in local currencies since the start of the year, and the second strike is that the bond markets have deteriorated."" **********But Mr. Eveillard stills likes Europe for the medium to long haul. The region is ""cheaper than the U.S. or the Pacific Rim,"" he said. **********Although the fund's broad diversification probably will not change, he has been buying shares and hopes to be fully invested in 6 to 12 months. **********For the long haul, he likes the Pacific Rim, calling it the world's major center of economic growth over the next 5 to 10 years. He eventually aims to buy stocks in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea, though he considers them pricey now. **********Japan, the top performer of the first half, is not on his list. ""My suspicion,"" he said, ""is that Japan is in a political and economic transition, which will lead to modest economic growth over the next 5 to 10 years, like the mature economies of the U.S. and Europe."" **********The fund also holds few Latin American stocks. Opportunities in the region are limited, he said. ""When American dentists own Telmex, what's left to be discovered?"""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/13/business/company-news-borden-agrees-to-a-takeover.html,Glenn Collins,1994-09-13,,1596,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Borden Agrees to a Takeover,COMPANY NEWS; Borden Agrees to a Takeover," **********Taking Wall Street by surprise, Borden Inc. agreed yesterday to be taken over by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company in an unusual transaction that would sharply reduce that leveraged buyout firm's equity in RJR Nabisco Holdings. **********The deal would make the financially troubled Borden a privately held, independent company, although analysts were uncertain whether it would insure that Elsie the Cow, Borden's beloved icon, would not eventually be put permanently out to pasture. **********The proposed $2 billion arrangement is the largest acquisition by Kohlberg, Kravis since it bought RJR Nabisco in 1989. For Borden, the deal shows just how steeply it has plunged in value from its stock market peak in May 1991, when it was worth $5.7 billion and its shares traded at $38.375 each. The takeover proposal is valued at $14.25 for each Borden share.  Long-Lasting Troubles **********The food giant's earnings have long been weak, and last December, the investment banker for Borden's board, Lazard Freres & Company, was unable to find a buyer for Borden or for any of its units. In contrast to the predictions of many analysts yesterday, executives of both Borden and Kohlberg, Kravis insisted that there would be no immediate sale of Borden's units or a merger of Borden with RJR Nabisco. **********In addition to its Borden and Meadow Gold dairy products, Borden also owns Wise snack foods, Cracker Jacks and Creamette pasta. **********The deal evoked sharply differing assessments from analysts and stockholders. Some said the transaction made sense for both Borden and Kohlberg, Kravis, while others found it hard to see any advantage for the buyout firm and said they regarded the deal as a prelude to Borden's dissolution. A Premium and a Discount **********But most agreed that Borden was being bought at a fire-sale price. Last September, Borden's stock was at $19.875, its high for the last 12 months. Kohlberg, Kravis noted that at $14.25 a share its proposal offered a 22.6 percent premium over the $11.625 closing price of Borden stock on Friday; that price was near a nine-year low. **********Yesterday, after the deal was announced, Borden gained $2 a share to close at $13.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of RJR Nabisco closed at $6.625 yesterday on the Big Board, down 37.5 cents. **********Borden agreed to the deal ""to improve shareholder value and strengthen the company,"" said Ervin R. Shames, who has been Borden's chief executive since December, when the board dismissed Anthony S. D'Amato. Mr. Shames said in an interview that there had been no discussions with Kohlberg, Kravis about his leaving, ""and as long as I perform well, I'll keep running the company."" He added that Borden ""will not be sold off or broken up."" **********Kohlberg, Kravis expects a definitive merger agreement to be executed within two weeks. The RJR board has yet to approve the plan, which is also subject to the approval of Borden's major lenders and regulators. **********Under the proposal, Kohlberg, Kravis would swap close to half its stock in RJR Nabisco to pay for all of Borden's shares, reducing its stake in RJR to 17.5 percent, worth $2 billion, from 35 percent, fully diluted. It acquired 100 percent of RJR Nabisco for $25 billion five years ago, but has been reducing its stake. **********Under the deal's complex pricing formula, Borden's shareholders are assured of receiving securities worth $14.25 a share so long as RJR's stock trades between $6 and $8 a share. But they do not have downside protection below $6, and they could make even more if RJR's stock soars beyond $8. Shifting Stakes **********RJR Nabisco announced that after Kohlberg, Kravis's acquisition of Borden, it would acquire a 20 percent interest in Borden and would get several seats on Borden's board. RJR will also be given warrants to purchase an additional 10 percent of Borden's stock. **********Morgan Stanley will represent Kohlberg, Kravis in the transaction. Lazard Freres will represent the Borden board, and CS First Boston will represent Borden itself. RJR has not yet retained an investment banker, a spokesman, Jason H. Wright, said. **********Borden will soon complete a move out of its former headquarters at 277 Park Avenue as part of a consolidation of operations in Columbus, Ohio. **********Analysts disagreed about the value of the proposed transaction. ""K.K.R. is buying control of Borden at an attractive price, and also reducing their overall exposure to tobacco liabilities substantially,"" said Max Holmes, a bond analyst who follows RJR for Salomon Brothers. ""This takes the pressure off Borden management, and Borden shareholders get to swap shares going nowhere for a more liquid RJR share."" **********But Terry Bivens, an analyst who follows Borden for Argus Research, said: ""I'm having a hard time seeing where the returns are for K.K.R.. even though K.K.R. is acquiring it on the cheap. As a food analyst looking at this business on the fundamentals, I don't see where the growth is."" **********Though Borden shareholders will get a premium for their stock, they will also get a partial interest in RJR Nabisco and its operations in tobacco, which has been a troubled industry in recent years. ""It's not a happy situation, any way you look at it,"" said Robert Monks, a principal of Lens, a Washington-based investment fund that had a $3 million position in Borden stock. ""We lost money,"" he said. **********""In effect, this is the end of Borden,"" said Hans Reinisch, a stockholder from Manhattan who has held Borden shares for nine years. ""I think Borden will just become a part of RJR. It's a sad commentary on how management can bring a once-great corporation to its knees."" **********Some Borden stockholders had worried about a possible bankruptcy of the company, after it posted restructuring charges of close to $1 billion in 1992 and 1993. Borden has been undergoing a continuing revamping and had tried to sell off units that accounted for more than $1 billion of its $5.5 billion in annual sales. **********""The fact that a very astute investor like Kohlberg, Kravis finds value in Borden shows that things aren't nearly that bad,"" Mr. Shames said. The proposed acquisition ""gives us the time to invest in marketing our consumer products, and the capital that our chemical products need,"" he added. **********As for RJR, Emanuel Goldman, an analyst who follows that company for Paine Webber, said it was ""noteworthy"" that ""K.K.R., the ultimate RJR insider, divests half its position in the company."" He added of the deal with Borden: ""I certainly was taken by surprise. The assumption was that they had passed on it last fall."" **********According to some of those present at the negotiations, the deal was completed in the Manhattan offices of the Borden lawyers, Wachtel, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, at 9 P.M. Sunday, when, as one participant said, ""All the pieces came together."" **********Price was the main sticking point, in addition to structuring the complicated deal to avoid legal problems. Some board members were present at the meeting, and others were consulted by telephone. **********The board had been informed on Wednesday of the status of negotiations, and a scheduled analysts' meeting with company executives the next day was postponed.  'Kicked the Tires' **********""There was no matchmaker,"" said an executive who participated in the talks. A year ago the Borden board had engaged Lazard Freres, to work on its latest restructuring. In December, after the resignation of Mr. D'Amato, the board asked Lazard to find a buyer for Borden. Kohlberg, Kravis ""kicked the tires,"" one executive said, but there were no takers. **********Kohlberg, Kravis maintained its interest as Borden's stock price continued to plunge, and about a month ago the firm approached Lazard about a possible acquisition, a person close to the company said. **********RJR Nabisco became involved when ""K.K.R. came to us last week and said, 'We want you to know we are doing this transaction with Borden,' "" Mr. Wright, the RJR spokesman, said. Charles M. Harper, the company's chief executive, and Lawrence R. Ricciardi, the president, said, ""We want to be in on this,"" and they suggested RJR's $500 million participation, Mr. Wright said. **********The size of the investment in Borden, he said, was about the size of RJR's recent investments in Terra Bussi, the Argentine biscuit company, and Royal Brands of Spain, another maker of prepared foods. **********Parties to the proposed acquisition do not believe that other suitors for Borden will step forward, because the company was on the block for eight months. ""Of course, you see the phenomenon that no one is interested until someone gets interested,"" said a company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Maybe someone who's been sitting on the fence will decide to get off."" **********Despite the denials, some analysts expect that Kohlberg, Kravis will sell Borden's struggling dairy division and its wall-coverings units, and merge its snack-foods business with RJR. But it might wait to do so until building up Borden divisions to make them more profitable. **********Some analysts said that the Kohlberg, Kravis move to reduce its stake in RJR displayed a lack of confidence in the company. ""If we'd wanted to get out of RJR we'd get out,"" commented a Kohlberg, Kravis executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We think RJR will do well in the future."" **********Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, the founding partners of Kohlberg, Kravis, said in a joint statement, ""With greater access to capital, and an incentive compensation program that encourages managers to think like owners, Borden will be well positioned to develop the full value of its many strong underlying assets and excellent brands."""

Chomp! That crunching noise you hear across America is the sound of pretzels, as a product that was once primarily a regional favorite makes its way into the mainstream. **********Interestingly, the boom in pretzels, which are still most popular in the Northeast, was not initially a result of elaborate marketing efforts or flashy advertising campaigns. Rather, it began in the last five years as consumers rediscovered pretzels, which, because they are baked, not fried, have a much lower fat content than other, better-selling salty snacks like potato chips. **********Only after pretzels began registering annual double-digit percentage increases in volume growth outside their traditional turf did marketers move to exploit the trend by significantly expanding advertising and promotional programs. Those activities are enlivening what had been a dowdy, virtually neglected product category and, by exposing pretzels to even more consumers, are further accelerating their gains. **********""The category is growing really aggressively,"" said Dwight Riskey, vice president for new products and market information at Frito-Lay Inc. of Plano, Tex., the nation's leading maker of munchies. **********""And it is very elastic to marketing support,"" he added, obviously pleased that while pretzels are Mr. Riskey's business, they certainly are no longer a risky business. **********Since 1961, Frito-Lay has owned a line of pretzels called Rold Gold, a pleasantly old-fashioned name that evokes an era when brands were deliberately misspelled in hopes of being noticed, from Duz detergent to Gleem toothpaste to Neet depilatory. But because of the regional orientation of the pretzel market, Mr. Riskey said, ""the brand wasn't at a size where a national marketing program would have made sense."" **********That changed in August, when, for the first time, Rold Gold was the subject of a national television advertising campaign from DDB Needham Worldwide, the agency for Frito-Lay brands like Fritos corn chips and Cheetos cheese-flavored puffs. A commercial featured Jason Alexander, who portrays the nebbishy character George on the NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld."" **********As he rode an elevator, Mr. Alexander performed a George-like riff on various attributes of the brand. ""What kind of a word is 'Rold'?"" he asked, adding, ""They're not gold; they're pretzel colored."" **********A much glossier second commercial, set at a hockey game, was introduced in February, and an equally glitzy third one, about a class reunion, starts running this week. Both use physical comedy and elaborate stunts to recast Mr. Alexander as the doer of superheroic deeds because of his affinity for a new fat-free version of Rold Gold; they introduce a theme that Frito-Lay hopes will become a catch phrase: ""It must be the pretzels."" **********""We want bigger thinking, bigger ideas, bigger productions,"" said Tod MacKenzie, vice president of advertising and public affairs for Frito-Lay, which has had such campaigns for other brands, like Doritos tortilla chips, from another of its agencies, BBDO New York. **********So, he added, after the initial commercial, developed by the New York office of DDB Needham, he and Alan Pottasch, the senior vice president for worldwide creative at Frito-Lay and a sibling company, Pepsi-Cola International, worked with the agency's Chicago office on ideas involving ""the product as hero and Jason as a personality."" **********Dennis Ryan, a senior vice president and group creative director on the account at DDB Needham Chicago, said: ""We didn't want to be stuck in an elevator forever. And after talking with Jason, he didn't want to be George for Rold Gold, sitting in a diner and talking about pretzels."" **********""Big, shiny advertising is a genre that is a little maligned,"" he added, ""but in this case you can prove it did the job."" **********Indeed, Mr. Riskey at Frito-Lay said: ""We did not anticipate the kind of impact we have seen from the advertising. It's really paying out for us."" **********Consumer awareness of Rold Gold has risen to more than 70 percent from about 50 percent, he added, and the number of plants that produce Rold Gold among their product lines increased to seven this year from three in 1991, including one that makes solely pretzels. **********Retail sales of the brand, which totaled only $56.8 million as recently as 1988, rose to $80 million in 1990, $110 million in 1991, $122 million in 1992 and $181 million last year. For 1994, Frito-Lay expects a similar improvement, Mr. Riskey said -- which would be another gain of 48.4 percent -- ""if not substantially better."" **********""We're growing at rates that are unprecedented,"" he added. ""I attribute a lot to the advertising."" **********To make sure, tests are under way in six markets around the country in which half the households are receiving the Rold Gold commercials as they watch television and half are not; cable and computer technology replaces Mr. Alexander's spots with public service announcements. Their shopping habits will be monitored to see differences, if any, in pretzel purchases. **********That way, Frito-Lay will know whether or not it must be the advertising."

Veto,CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE RUSSIANS; The Kremlin Asserts Itself By U.N. Veto," **********Russia's veto of a United Nations resolution on the Balkan war on Friday night was a sharp reminder that Moscow insists on playing a major role in defining the post-cold-war security order. **********It was only the second time that Russia used its veto power in the Security Council since the collapse of the Soviet Union three years ago, and it was the first such veto since the war in the former Yugoslavia began. **********Russia, which has long had a close relationship with the Serbs, vetoed a proposal to block fuel from going from Serbia into Serb-held areas of Bosnia and Croatia. The resolution was sponsored by Muslim countries that support the Muslim-led Bosnian Government. **********The veto could complicate new efforts by Russia, the United States, France, Britain and Germany to make their peace plan acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs. The Bosnian Government has already accepted the plan. **********The timing of the veto, just before a summit meeting in Budapest of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, suited Moscow perfectly. It should help allay nationalist pressure at home and serve notice that Russia means to have its say in future security alliances between Western and Eastern Europe. **********Russia, which has viewed with alarm the recent talk of including Eastern European countries in NATO, has argued instead for increasing the authority of the 53-nation European security conference, because Russia is a member. The United States has said the conference's role should be increased, but has strongly resisted Russian suggestions that it replace NATO. **********The meeting in Budapest on Monday and Tuesday will provide Moscow with another occasion to emphasize not only its differences with the West, but differences among the members of NATO as well. **********After months of efforts to coax and reassure the Kremlin, Washington thought it had persuaded Moscow to accept and join a loose military partnership between East and West, the ""Partnership for Peace,"" which could be the first step toward an enlarged NATO. **********Instead, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev showed up in Brussels this week at a NATO ceremony organized to bless the partnership and blasted his hosts. **********Attacking the Western allies' decision to discuss possible membership in NATO with aspirants like Hungary and Poland by the end of next year, Mr. Kozyrev said he would need further ""clarifications."" **********It was not the first time Moscow had suddenly blown cold on an issue that the United States considered settled. The NATO issue is particularly hard on Russia's nationalist pride, given that virtually all of its former allies in the Warsaw Pact are clamoring to join an alliance that was once its greatest enemy. **********American officials said Moscow had been informed in advance about NATO's plans, suggesting that Mr. Kozyrev was playing mainly to a domestic audience. As he has done over Bosnia -- and over Iraq in calling for the lifting of sanctions on Baghdad -- Mr. Kozyrev was hoping to widen ill-concealed splits among Western allies. **********Expansion of NATO is touchy even within the alliance. The United States has been pressing to issue membership guidelines next summer, but Germany and France have disagreed."

But the extreme rightist National Front was fiercely opposed, while the mosque's future neighbors fought the project in court. **********Indeed, even after the mosque was finally opened last month, France's mood was hardly welcoming. Weeks earlier, the Government had deported two dozen Arab men as suspected Islamic extremists, and since then, it has renewed its campaign to stop girls from wearing Islamic head-coverings to school. **********Yet for all of France's nervousness about having some four million Muslims living in its midst, a nervousness deepened of late by fears that an Islamic takeover in nearby Algeria would bring an influx of immigrants and refugees, the Grand Mosque of Lyons is a symbol of hope. **********Despite rightist demands that immigrants be sent home, the Government knows that they are here to stay. But it also believes that if France is not to feel permanently threatened by imported Islamic extremism, a French version of Islam must take root. And it is looking to the new mosque here to help that happen. **********""We now realize that Islam in France is a French reality and not just a foreign issue or an extension of foreign problems,"" France's Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, said at the mosque's inauguration. ""So it is not enough to have an Islam in France. There should also be a French Islam."" **********By that, he said, he meant an Islam that respected France's republican and secular principles, that recognized the rights of men and women, that did not view France as ""a space to conquer,"" that did not allow ""the tree of fundamentalism to hide the forest of moderate, tolerant and discreet Islam that you represent."" **********The response from the mosque's elders was the one Mr. Pasqua wanted. ""This mosque will be permanent proof that Islam is a religion that can be practiced in strict adherence to French law,"" said Rabah Kheliff, a French citizen who heads the Islamic-French Cultural Association of Lyons, which runs the mosque. **********The mosque has also tried to assuage French sensibilities. Its minaret, for example, does not soar like a church spire, but is a simple square turret just 80 feet high. And five times a day, the call to prayer can be heard only inside the mosque, not across the neighborhood. **********The mosque's Grand Mufti, Abdelhamid Chirane, an Algerian-born scholar who has spent the last 30 years in France, said he stood ""midway between two cultures -- the marvels of the Koran and the culture of Descartes."" **********The catalyst for the new debate has been evidence that sympathizers of Algeria's banned Islamic Salvation Front are beginning to infiltrate France's Muslim population and, even more, to influence some children of North African immigrants who, though born in France, feel alienated from French society. **********The Government's immediate response was to step up police surveillance of Muslim organizations, and as a symbol of its determination to uphold French secular tradition, to order schools to refuse entry to Muslim girls who insist on wearing headscarves to classes. **********But the search for a French Islam also implies that France must make room for its Muslim population. Already the Government is promoting formation of French-born imams to replace those brought from abroad, and it wants Muslims to form a national organization with which the French state can deal. **********The mosque in Lyons, like the country's six other large mosques, offers a focal point to Muslims who otherwise must worship in small improvised prayer rooms. ""I think this is the beginning of a French Islam,"" Mr. Chirane said. **********Unsurprisingly, Denis de Bouteiller, a National Front leader in Lyons, disagrees. ""The mosque is a symbol of the permanent implantation of the immigrants,"" he said. ""As for French Islam, Pasqua is dreaming. If foreign powers financed construction of the mosque, it's because they want something in return."" **********Certainly, the mosque was built only because King Fahd of Saudi Arabia contributed two-thirds of its $6 million cost. Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and Tunisia also chipped in, while French Muslims collected only $600,000. But Mr. Chirane insisted that the mosque was not controlled from abroad. **********""We are a very poor community so we had to get outside money,"" said Djida Tazdait, the president of Young Arabs of Lyons and Suburbs. ""But we want a French mosque, a French imam, even better an imam from Lyons."""

Because of their limited scope, these funds are usually more volatile than diversified stock funds. Investors sometimes have trouble sitting tight when share prices fluctuate: assets of health care funds, for example, have slid to $4 billion, from $6 billion in 1991, when such stocks were flying high. **********Among the losers early this year were utility funds, which have suffered from an uptick in interest rates. Most of the laggards, however, were victims of profit taking in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia, which enjoyed terrific run-ups last year but have fallen back. Pacific stock funds were hit hardest, not surprising given their 55 percent average return last year. Foreign and world stock fund categories were also penalized for Southeast Asian holdings. **********Over all, the year is off to a good start, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. Only the utilities and Pacific groups of the 19 stock fund categories tracked by Morningstar have shown losses so far, he said."

The results raised concern that the Free Democrats would lose seats in the Parliament in federal elections on Oct. 16, hurting Mr. Kohl's ability to form a new government. **********""If Kohl doesn't get a majority in Parliament, people will dump Deutsche marks,"" said Anil Agarwal, currency specialist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. Mr. Kohl's opponents, the Social Democrats, are considered to be less committed to controlling government spending and inflation. **********The dollar rose as high as 1.5573 marks yesterday before settling at 1.5527 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.5486 marks on Friday. **********The dollar rose against the yen after Ambassador Walter F. Mondale told reporters in Tokyo that the Clinton Administration had made some progress in trade talks with Japan, but ""we're not there yet."" **********With progress at the bargaining table, the Clinton Administration is considered less likely to resume calls for a strong yen, a tactic it pursued last year. A strong yen could help balance trade by making Japanese goods more expensive. **********The dollar rose to 98.75 yen yesterday from 97.85 yen on Friday. **********The Clinton Administration has set a Friday deadline for progress in the trade talks, after which the United States may impose trade sanctions on Japan. **********The dollar strengthened against most other major currencies yesterday, rising to 5.3060 French francs from 5.2922 francs on Friday and rising to 1,563.50 Italian lire from 1,559.50 lire.

Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said that after the market had slumped it clawed its way back. The employment report showed an increase of 217,000 jobs and a decline in the unemployment rate. ""The forecast estimates ranged from 120,000 to 150,000,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""At first glance it looked real strong and caused an immediate downdraft in the market that sent yields rising."" 30-Year Bond Recoups **********Initially, the 30-year bond slumped about three-quarters of a point, and the yield, which moves conversely to price, jumped to 6.90 percent, the highest level since June 8, 1993. In late trading, however, the price of the long bond moved in the opposite direction of the other treasuries, rising 2/32 , to 9224/32 , for a yield of 6.83 percent, unchanged from Thursday. **********Short-term bill rates were pushed higher on the expectations of another tightening by the Fed, traders said. The rate on the three-month bill rose 5 basis points, to 3.51 percent, while the yield on a three-year note rose 7 basis points, to 5.26 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********Mr. Johnson said investors and traders took the data to mean the Fed would raise short-term interest rates sooner rather than later, with some thinking the tightening could come as early as Monday. **********""But a closer look at the numbers indicated there were mitigating factors that detracted from the numbers' initial strength,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""At the top of list was that January payroll employment was revised lower, to a decline of 2,000, from an increase of 62,000. So that took away 54,000 jobs."" **********Another was that the average hourly earnings, indicating a slower rate of inflation, increased a very modest 2 cents, from $11.03, ""indicating there was not much pressure on wages, and that was good for the bond market now worried about inflation,"" Mr. Johnson said. Decline in Workweek **********""Lastly, the data showed a sharp decline in the average manufacturing workweek of 0.7 hour, to 41.1 hours,"" he said. ""The reason this is of some importance is that the average manufacturing week is a component of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, giving us a sense of where employment conditions are maybe headed."" **********Analysts said the decline in the average manufacturing workweek was the largest since January 1982, the middle of the last severe recession. **********""The point is that what initially appeared to be strong numbers, under examination seemed to be weaker, consistent with a pullback or decline in the growth of the economy to a 2 percent to 2.5 percent rate, from an unusually strong 7.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""So that news tended to reduce worry among bond investors that the Fed will need to prove to the market that it is pro-active, or need to raise short-term rates perhaps as much as 50 basis points."" **********Worries about the Fed's policy have not disappeared or moderated, traders said. There are still many in the market who said they believed the Fed would tighten rates well before its meeting on March 22. ""But worries about Fed policy are somewhat less intense as a result of today's numbers,"" Mr. Johnson said.  ""There's still a great deal of edginess in the bond market, but confidence that the bond markets can hold and even rally from current price levels is beginning to grow."" Trade Talks Cited **********Difficulties in trade talks between the United States and Japan, Mr. Johnson said, ""also weighed on the market with growing concerns about trade relations between the two countries sliding down a slippery pole toward protectionist legislation or trade war."" That would lead to higher inflation, he said. **********""I think the market is in the position for a meaningful rally as soon as investors realize that the bond market, in my view, has discounted all of the bad news on inflation and higher short-term rates that lay ahead,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""We could see the yield on the long bond move back down to the 6.50 percent level, from the current 6.83 percent."""

The rest would be distributed to Lilly shareholders next year. **********Analysts said that Guidant could be valued at $1.5 billion to $2 billion, based on the stock prices of comparable public companies. Based on the $800 million in 1993 revenues of the five Lilly units, the new company would have been among the 500 largest American industrial companies last year. **********Lilly, based in Indianapolis, said last January that it planned to sell or spin off the units, but analysts said the company evidently failed to find buyers. Although at least two of the businesses have strong market shares, their hospital customers have been holding down spending under growing pressure from health care purchasers. Price May Be Discounted **********Analysts said shares of a number of medical device companies were selling at higher prices, in relation to earnings, than Lilly and other drug makers. But Steven Gerber at Oppenheimer & Company said the initial price of Guidant might be discounted because institutional investors often unloaded shares of spinoffs that might not meet their requirements for dividends and earnings histories. **********Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that health care companies ""are usually spun out because they have a problem, not enough new products."" He added that the life cycle of medical devices was shorter than for drugs. ""Pharmaceutical companies just can't move fast enough in developing new products,"" he said. **********Randall L. Tobias, chairman of Lilly, said the sale would allow the company ""to focus our resources on our pharmaceutical operations."" Plans for the spinoff are subject to market conditions and Federal tax status approvals, Lilly said. **********Guidant will include Advance Cardiovascular Systems Inc., which Mr. Abramowitz said had about 35 percent of the market for balloon devices that open blocked arteries; Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., which has about a 50 percent market share for devices that deliver shocks to restore heart functioning, and Devices for Vascular Intervention Inc., which makes catheters to remove cholesterol deposits. **********The new company will also include two smaller units, Origin Medsystems, which makes miniature surgical instruments and Heart Rhythm Technologies Inc., a start-up unit that has no sales. **********Lilly said it would continue to evaluate offers for four businesses: the IVAC Corporation, Hybritech Inc., Pacific Biotech Inc. and the Physio-Control Corporation."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/18/business/beating-a-sales-slump-with-a-classic-formula.html,Stephanie Strom,1994-10-18,,1635,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Beating a Sales Slump With a Classic Formula,Beating a Sales Slump With a Classic Formula," **********Contrarian is not the first word one would associate with Talbots. **********The specialty women's clothing retailer has honed tradition and convention to a fine art, offering its customers timeless, classic clothing that varies little from year to year. **********But Talbots defies the conventional wisdom about the slump in the women's apparel business, which most analysts have attributed to a lack of fashion direction and innovation. **********Pleated skirts and duffle coats are not the stuff of high fashion. Still, Talbots' sales in stores open at least one year have climbed 9 percent so far this year. At a time when other specialty women's apparel chains are thankful to squeeze out a gain of a mere 1 or 2 percent, Talbots is a standout; only Ann Taylor Stores, another traditionalist, has done better. **********Talbots' success has come not from selling strappy chiffon dresses or chenille sweaters but from classic staples like double-breasted gabardine blazers, Shetland sweaters and wool challis skirts. Customers seem to treasure it for its simplicity and correctness, and the very thing that analysts complain about, its unwillingness to chase fashion. **********""I don't want to look like my mother, but I can't wear anything you see in Vogue,"" said Lisa Anderson, a 35-year-old management consultant who came to the Talbots store on Manhattan's Upper West Side last weekend in search of a navy gabardine suit to replace one that is wearing out. ""I work in the real world, not on a runway."" **********Talbots had a brief fling with fashion early in the decade, a dalliance that resulted in a $7 million loss in 1990. Quickly returning to its roots, the company's profits have grown at a 116 percent compounded rate over the last three years, and its stock has climbed from $19.50 a share last November when it offered shares publicly, to close at $32.75 yesterday, off 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. The November issue of Consumer Reports magazine rates Talbots the highest of any specialty store retailer based on 50,000 readers' responses to a questionnaire on shopping for clothing. **********The success of Talbots and Ann Taylor, as well as Sears, Roebuck and J. C. Penney, is forcing some of the experts to change their minds about what will fuel a turnaround in women's apparel sales. ""I'm beginning to believe that it isn't just that we haven't had fashion trends,"" said Janet Joseph Kloppenburg, a retail analyst at Robertson, Stephens & Company. **********For the last two years, analysts have promised that the next season's new fashions will light a fire under the women's apparel business. Sales of women's clothing did pick up in the first half of this year, rising 7 percent above the corresponding period last year, according to the NPD Group, a consumer research firm that tracks household spending. That was the best gain in more than a year, but not as robust as the pace set in the late 1980's. **********And retailers and analysts are starting to concede that fashion is not in the driver's seat. ""Most people who think a new fashion trend is going to jump-start this business are waiting for Godot,"" said Alan Millstein, a fashion industry consultant. ""There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the fashion offerings, particularly this year. The fundamental problem the retail business is going to have to live with in the 1990's is that the consumer has become less of a peacock."" **********Fundamental shifts in society are working in favor of stores like Talbots and against fashion leaders like the Limited, said Walter K. Levy, a retail consultant. He cites the greater acceptance of casual dress in the office place, a shift in priorities away from the individual and onto the family and the aging population, among others. **********Additionally, prices have changed very little over the last five years and in some cases have even dropped. ""You have to sell more units just to get the same sales you had last year,"" Mr. Levy said. **********While known for its adherence to tradition, Talbots is not totally devoid of fashion. Among the dozens of classic knit and leather gloves hanging on a wall are some pairs in bright red and green chenille. And while most of its hemlines fall demurely to mid-calf, there are some that rise rakishly above the knee. ""We have a fashion consciousness,"" said Arnold B. Zetcher, chief executive of Talbots. ""It just doesn't come straight off the runways in Paris."" **********That is because the Talbots customer, a Talbotian in company parlance, does not want it to be. As a commercial banker, Naomi Goodman cannot wear trousers, mini-skirts or see-through silk blouses. ""I can find a suit there that's well-made and maybe not fashion-forward but stylish,"" she said. ""I bought an olive-green wool suit there last season that I get more compliments on than anything else I own."" **********Talbots' talent, analysts say, is in recognizing those constraints and offering a wardrobe that works around them. Compared with other retailers, the company does an unusual amount of research into its core customer, who Mr. Zetcher describes as a 35- to 55-year-old working woman with an average household income of about $75,000 and a college education. Plumbing the depth of its customers' minds has led to new avenues of growth for the company, like the Talbots Kids store, a lingerie line and its petite sizes. Talbots now has more than 350 stores. **********From culling information about its customers' whims and fancies through catalogue mailing lists, numerous focus groups, which are unusual for a retailer of any size, and an annual benchmark study to determine how its customers rate its improvements, Talbots has an unusual rapport with its clientele. The company receives bushels of mail from its customers, and one loyal Talbotian even sent Mr. Zetcher a picture of her at an audience with the Pope wearing -- what else? -- a Talbots dress. ""I get a lot of wedding pictures,"" he said. **********In an effort to keep the dialogue going, Mr. Zetcher also goes to unusual lengths. He has sent thousands of loyal customers chocolates, Christmas cards and valentines as tokens of appreciation, and he bristles at the suggestion that such correspondence is a promotional tool. ""I don't include coupons,"" he said. ""I'm not trying to make a sales pitch."" **********Talbots did not always have its ear to the ground. A quarter-century after it was founded in 1947 in Hingham, Mass., where it is still based, the company had five stores in the Northeast, and a thriving catalogue business. General Mills bought it and expanded it to a 126-store chain before selling it in 1988 to the Jusco Company, a Japanese retailing conglomerate looking for a toehold in the United States. **********Jusco, which still owns 67 percent of Talbots, paid what many thought was the exorbitant price of $325 million only to have the woman who had built the business, Sally Frame Kasaks, leave. She now heads rival Ann Taylor Stores, which is posting eye-popping gains of its own using a formula similar to Talbots albeit with a greater fashion consciousness. **********Mr. Zetcher, who was hired as her second in command only months earlier, found himself in charge of a company that had outgrown its infrastructure. He made big investments in computer systems to better track inventory and installed the famous ""red phone,"" a fixture in every store that allows customers to call a central directory to find merchandise if the store does not have it. **********Talbots also departed from tradition and began flirting with fashion. In the late 1980's, it added colors like mustard, fuschia and olive to its traditional palette of navy, red and hunter green and introduced new fabrics and silhouettes. Customers responded by doing an about-face at the door, and the company reported a $7 million loss in 1990. **********That drubbing led to the benchmarking study, which is basically an annual survey of Talbots customers and their likes and dislikes, and a decision to reposition the company. Talbots decided to become a brand devoted to women who want high-quality, traditional career clothing at good prices. **********The company eliminated trendy merchandise to focus on ""wardrobing,"" dressing its customer literally from head to foot from braided head-bands to leather loafers, a formula that many specialty retailers use to build customer loyalty. It has increased its private-label merchandise to 95 percent of its mix from 25 percent, which has pumped up its profit margins. And it has slashed its mailing list to 60 million from 78 million in 1989 -- and increased catalogue sales from $153 million to $160 million this year. **********""We were just doing too much prospecting,"" said Clark J. Hinkley, chief operating officer of Talbots. ""We were trying too much to be all things to all people instead of being what our customer wanted us to be."" **********There seems to be little doubt these days about what Talbots is. Kim Giovanucci, a bookkeeper in Boston, is not a Talbotian, but when she was looking for a classic dress for her bridesmaids, she headed straight for the red door that is Talbots' hallmark. ""I'm not a Talbots shopper,"" she said. ""It's a little too classic for my everyday taste, but I was looking for a more elegant, sophisticated-style dress and I knew they would have one there."" **********She found a demure black velvet, tea-length dress at the store in Hingham and used the ""red phone"" to find four more for the wedding. ""It looked great on all my girls, even the heavy ones because it hid the bumps and bulges,"" Mrs. Giovanucci said."

Force of 54,000","15 Nations Offer Troops For U.N. Force of 54,000"," **********More than 15 countries have pledged at least 54,000 troops and other specialists toward the creation of a United Nations inventory of peacekeepers and equipment for future operations, a United Nations official said today. **********The United States is not among the 15, but the official, Col. Gerard Gambiez of France, said the Clinton Administration is considering his request for transport planes and ships, communications equipment, medical assistance and map reproduction. **********Currently, each time the Security Council authorizes a new peacekeeping operation, United Nations officials must go hat-in-hand to countries for troops, equipment and services, a process that can take months. The new plan would allow United Nations officials to know in advance what forces and equipment individual governments are willingto commit for peacekeeping missions. That would enable those forces to be deployed more quickly to crisis spots. Classic Peacekeeping **********The plan applies only to classic peacekeeping operations, like those in Macedonia and Cambodia, in which troops monitor an agreement with the consensus of all parties on the ground. **********It would not cover operations like those in Somalia and Bosnia, in which troops are permitted to use military might to enforce the peace. And countries can place restrictions on how and when their forces are used. **********Colonel Gambiez was named by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in January 1993 to head a team to broker agreements with many of the 184 member nations on troops and equipment that could be used by the United Nations in its peacekeeping efforts. He said the plan would take effect on Thursday, after he presents it to the member countries. **********Colonel Gambiez declined to identify the countries that have promised to send troops, equipment or supplies, but said the number had increased beyond 15 since a status report on the effort was released on March 28. **********He said that he and six associates who visited 50 countries and contacted 130 others to line up written commitments found that many were waiting to see what Washington decides.  ""We can play without the U.S.,"" the colonel said, ""but it would be a pity."" **********Colonel Gambiez said he has been consulting State Department and Pentagon officials in recent days.  ""My American friends, each time I talk with them, understand I'm looking for a standing army, which is not the case,"" he said in a breakfast meeting with reporters. **********Gordon Adams, associate director for national security and international affairs at the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a luncheon address today that Administration officials were considering designating American troops and equipment that could be used for peacekeeping missions.  Goal Is 100,000 Troops **********The goal of United Nations is the commitment of 100,000 troops and other specialists, ranging from infantry soldiers and logistic experts to doctors and police officers. **********The phenomenal growth in peacekeeping operations worldwide has taxed the ability of the United Nations to muster enough skilled peacekeepers and to pay for them. It now has some 70,000 soldiers in the field on 17 operations, an increase from just 10,000 soldiers on five operations in 1987. It has not been decided whether the 70,000 would be added to the 54,000 troops pledged recently. **********A provision in the original charter of the United Nations called for countries to designate forces that would be subject to automatic call-up by the United Nations. No country, however, has agreed to relinquish this degree of control over its troops. **********Edward C. Luck, president of the United Nations Association of the U.S.A., a private research organization in Manhattan, said the new plan is a good first step ""in the hopes countries get half-pregnant with the idea of committing forces to the U.N."" **********Colonel Gambiez said that he had plenty of offers from countries willing to contribute regular infantry troops to form the backbone of peacekeeping operations, but that only a handful of countries -- including Russia and the United States -- could provide large cargo planes, transport ships, medical assistance, communications equipment and important satellite lines. **********Russian lawmakers are considering legislation to designate specific forces for peacekeeping operations.  These forces would receive special training and extra pay."

Built by Saudi Government **********The hospital, built by the Government of Saudi Arabia and named in memory of one its kings, was completed last year. It was intended to be the equal of many in the West. **********In a country where cancers are generally fatal largely because of the lack of diagnosis and the birth rate is among the world's highest, King Faisal Hospital offered what Dr. Olinto described as ""the top of the line"" X-ray machines and ultrasound equipment. There are computer-run labs and rows of centrifuge units in a country that has one of the highest incidences of AIDS, especially among women and children. **********King Faisal Hospital unceremoniously opened its doors nearly six weeks ago, when a tide of Rwandans poured in and doctors were forced to begin treating them. **********The map of Kigali, with a note tacked to the bottom reminding the staff to mark an X for land-mine injuries, gets much more attention than the X-ray machine. **********Medical officials post sheets of notebook paper for victims of attacks. ""Large open wound right leg left arm urgent skin graft,"" read the note above the head of a youth in his early teens. War Brought Collapse **********Rwanda, one of the most densely populated countries in the world, was hard pressed to tend to the health and medical needs of its nearly eight million people before the war. The fighting has left the country's medical system near collapse, struggling to contend with the current medical load and unaware of how it will cope if the one million refugees, many suffering from cholera or dysentery, finally decide to return home. **********The only doctors at King Faisal Hospital are Dr. Olinto, 39, a Brazilian who works with the international relief group Doctors Without Borders, a second volunteer from that group and two local doctors. **********The hospital needs dozens more doctors. Dr. Olinto said most of the Rwandan doctors either had been killed during the civil war or had fled to Zaire and refused to return out of fear. **********So, instead of leading Rwanda into new medical frontiers, Dr. Olinto and his colleagues find themselves treating many of the country's old wounds. **********""We have all the medicines you need,"" Dr. Olinto said. ""The instruments we have. The problem for us is energy -- we need power."" He allowed journalists to follow him on his rounds through sun-lit wards and darkened corridors. **********The generators that are the only source of electricity at the hospital, and the rest of Kigali, are shut off during the day. The power is turned on from 6 to 10 P.M., during which time Dr. Olinto, a surgeon, does his work. Boys With Machete Wounds **********In a small room, four unidentified boys ranging in age from about 5 to 12 are recuperating from machete wounds. Dr. Olinto said that the boys had arrived the day before and that the most severely wounded of them had a gaping wound to the back of his head that had exposed his skull. **********""Their wounds are about 15 days old,"" the doctor said. ""I don't know where they were all that time or how they arrived here, but how could anyone do this to children?"" **********Around the corner in another ward, an emaciated 10-year-old boy identified only by his family name, Hamkurije, lay listless, recovering from an operation 15 days ago to remove his right leg after it was mangled when he stepped on a land mine. **********There were about 400 patients at the hospital today. Last week there were five times as many, some sprawled in the corridors and others sleeping on the balconies. But even today, the patient load was about twice the hospital's intended capacity. **********Part of the burden on King Faisal Hospital has arisen because the city's main hospital, Kigali Medical Center, has transferred many of its patients across town. The main hospital was the scene of one of the more horrendous of the many massacres that occurred during the civil war when patients identified as belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group were executed by the dozens. Help From Australians **********The Australians are expected to set up a military field hospital next week, which would help ease the strain. **********In between treating the war-wounded and cases of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition and AIDS, the staff at King Faisal has had to contend during the last week with cholera, possibly brought from Zaire, where the disease spread among the Rwandan refugees. **********As many patients are turned away as are treated. **********""It's unbelievable,"" Dr. Olinto said. ""But it's not possible to have good organization in wartime. It's impossible. You stay crazy here."""

But despite the seemingly large movement in stock prices, the leading stock indexes have merely returned to previous levels earlier in the month. **********After leaping nearly 40 points by 2:45 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average settled at 3,775.83, up 24.61 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped more than 4 points before settling at 464.51, up 2.19 points. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index kept nearly all of the day's gains and rose 5.69 points, to 747.98. **********On the New York Stock Exchange more than 307.4 million shares changed hands, or 7 percent more than this year's average of 286 million shares. **********But in the language of technical analysts, the stock market appears to be hitting a resistance level of 3,800 on the Dow. Seven times since Aug. 1, the Dow has approached or exceeded 3,800 in intraday trading, only to fall back by the end of the day. The latest was yesterday when the Dow briefly hit 3,791 and then retreated. **********There were notable stocks. Deere's third-quarter earnings were up 73.6 percent and the share price rose 3 5/8, to 69 5/8. **********Shares of Newbridge Networks, a maker of computer and telecommunications equipment, fell after the company proposed allowing employees to exercise their stock options at lower share prices. Newbridge fell 215/16 , to 29, and was the most active stock, at 6.8 million shares. After the market closed, it reported that first-quarter earnings rose to 52 cents a share from 41 cents, which was higher than estimates by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. They had a mean estimate of 41 cents a share. **********Philip Morris, still a favorite of institutional investors, rose 1 3/8, to 56 5/8. **********The dollar rose most of the day but then fell against the Japanese yen and rose against the German mark. It fell to 97.82 yen from 97.85 yen and rose to 1.5315 marks from 1.5288 marks. **********""It was just a day of respite,"" said David DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. He does not see a major and persistent rally for the dollar because the United States trade deficit with Japan continues and so do doubts among currency traders about President Clinton's leadership, especially in foreign policy. **********Nonetheless, the dollar's rise helped the bond market, where a $17.25 billion auction of two-year notes by the Government was considered successful. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose and its yield fell to 7.54 percent, from 7.55 percent on Monday. **********Beyond that there was little that could be discerned from yesterday's stock trading, analysts said. ""I don't think anything terribly special was at work,"" said David D. Holt, vice president for research and strategy at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. ""You just had two placebos: a strong greenback and a strong long bond."" **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.17 points, to 256.44, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,347 to 766. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.51 point, to 446.28. **********Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 17 rose, led by Caterpillar, which advanced 4 3/8, to 111 5/8, perhaps lifted by strong earnings at Deere, a rival in heavy equipment. **********Of the 500 stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 302 rose, led by General Electric, which gained 1, to 48 3/4."

""The market will stumble upward,"" said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis for A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. **********Mr. Goldman said the Dow Jones industrial average had risen about 200 points in the last five weeks, but in the last few days, had given back more than half the gains. ""People are going to understand this is an opportunity market,"" he said. ""When stocks are being thrown out of windows, it behooves you to hold a basket underneath and selectively catch some."" **********Still, traders appear to have some reason to worry about the three main factors that move markets, which are inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings. Inflation appears to be tame, but the weakened dollar has increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to attract foreign investors to United States assets, including stocks. **********Moreover, there was scattered anxiety among traders about the prospect of a slowing economy, brought about by the Fed's previous increases in interest rates, leading to lower second-quarter earnings. Companies start reporting financial results in two weeks or so. Recently, Lotus Development, Unisys and Cheyenne Software warned that their earnings were likely to disappoint Wall Street. **********Yesterday, the Dow fell below 3,700 for the first time since May 16. The Dow dropped 25.68 points, to 3,699.09. On Wednesday, it rose nearly 17 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.46 points, to 449.63, after rising 1.75 points on Wednesday. Sears, Roebuck, General Motors, Philip Morris, I.B.M. and Coca-Cola all fell. **********Especially hard hit was the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which fell 11.89 points, to 700.85, a decline of nearly 1.7 percent. Computer technology stocks like Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Intel all fell amid concern that a slower economy would hurt the demand for computers and related products. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.68 points, to 248.29, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 720 to 1,424. The American Stock Exchange market value index was off 1.97 points, to 431.25. **********The most active stock, at 14.6 million shares, was Cisco Systems, a computer-networking company, which fell 2 1/2, to 21, on concern among Wall Street analysts that the company's earnings would be hurt by a slowing economy."

But it has gradually been transformed nevertheless into an investors' darling. **********The index that First Pacific was not invited to join after five Jardine Matheson companies decided to be delisted has fallen 22 percent this year as the Hong Kong market has foundered on nervousness about China's economy, U.S. interest rates and local property prices. **********First Pacific has had a better time of it. With strong, diversified earnings growth and a rapidly expanding telecommunications business, First Pacific stock has risen 27 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock closed Thursday at 5.35 Hong Kong dollars (70 U.S. cents), down 15 Hong Kong cents. **********The company recently reported that its first-half net profit rose 81 percent, to $64.4 million on $1.64 billion in revenue. **********""This is an 8 to 9 dollar stock,"" Kirk Sweeny of Lehman Brothers said. He added that First Pacific's stock price made it ""the cheapest telecommunications company in Asia today."" **********The company, started in 1981 with five employees and $1.5 million, served as the overseas investment arm of the Salim family of Indonesia and some of its associates. But it quickly amassed a broad collection of holdings. **********First Pacific has recently winnowed its portfolio into four main lines of business: banking; real estate development and management; consumer marketing and distribution; and, increasingly, telecommunications. **********Investors clearly understood when First Pacific bought into the Dutch marketing and distribution group Hagemeyer NV. Investments in property and consumer-product distribution in Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines were also seen as logical. **********But analysts said an overactive corporate development unit made a spate of other acquisitions that stretched First Pacific's assets and mystified potential investors. **********""I don't make any apologies for our acquisition phase in the 1980s,"" said Manuel V. Pangilinan, who has been First Pacific's managing director since its start. ""Without it we could never have achieved our current size, but we are actively trying to reduce the complexity of the group."" **********In the past two years, First Pacific has ceased making acquisitions at the holding- company level. It has been selling off noncore assets to bolster existing businesses such as Berli Jucker Co., a consumer-goods company that is listed in Bangkok, and Metro Pacific, a Philippine conglomerate. **********The company plans to sell an 80 percent stake in United Savings Bank of California to the Salim family, a move that would largely complete First Pacific's consolidation, according to Mr. Pangilinan. **********""There has been a sea change in our philosophy,"" he said. ""We are now more highly focused on organic growth than asset trading. We are a fairly young company; we had to learn where we wanted to go."" **********First Pacific has ruled out the sale of its stake in Hagemeyer, but it said it would concentrate on expansion in Asia. The company said its expertise in telecommunications and real estate, which it developed in Hong Kong, would lead the way throughout Southeast Asia and, more gradually, China. **********From 1990 to 1993 First Pacific's earnings from Asian operations grew to 68 percent from 61 percent of total profit. The contribution from telecommunications businesses rose to 16.3 percent from 1.3 percent during the same period. **********Analysts from W.I. Carr Ltd. recently predicted that by 1996, First Pacific's Asian operations would contribute 78 percent of its its overall earnings, while telecoms would account for 30 percent. **********In the past year, First Pacific missed out on receiving permission to construct a fixed-line telephone service that would have begun to compete with Hong Kong Telecom and others in 1995. **********Some saw that as another slight for a company that stands outside Hong Kong's cozy corporate world of British and Chinese business circles. **********But in retrospect, the company said it was relieved to have been able to put its resources into markets with greater growth potential than fixed-line telephones. **********First Pacific already has a strong presence in wireless phones and portable pagers in Hong Kong. **********Smart Communications, which is controlled by First Pacific, has four telecommunications licenses in the Philippines. The potential for growth there is enormous - the country has one of Asia's lowest per-capita telephone rates. **********Analysts said they expected Smartcom to begin making operating profit in 1995 as it builds a nationwide cellular phone business, three local area exchanges, an international call gateway system and a paging service. Technical and financial backing will come from a still-to-be-named international telecommunications company."

But Kellogg is also testing the waters in neighboring Estonia and Lithuania and has established beachheads in a few Russian stores in St. Petersburg and Moscow. **********To win converts, Kellogg is relying mainly on slick television advertisements showing a family joyfully digging into their Corn Flakes, and on demonstrations in grocery stores that the company refers to as ""taste testings."" **********The emphasis is on American-style health and nutrition, but there's the unmistakable suggestion that breakfast can be fun, too. As a column of creamy white milk cascades into a bowl of Corn Flakes in the television ad, the camera moves in for a tight shot and the message ""eight vitamins"" flashes across the screen. **********One recent afternoon in Kekava, an old town just south of Riga, a young Latvian sales representative for Kellogg stacked a table in the immaculate Dalderi grocery store with red and white boxes of Corn Flakes and little white paper bowls. Behind the display were chest-high deli cases displaying giant blocks of cheese, a dozen varieties of sausage and glistening slabs of fatty bacon. **********The Kellogg display drew a cluster of women and children and a few men. The sales representative held a bowl of Corn Flakes and urged someone to have a try. **********""It's delicious,"" she said, ""It has lots of calories, lots of vitamins."" **********Ausma Meijere, a woman in her 60's in a heavy black coat, reached for the bowl and took in a couple of crunchy mouthfuls. A Different Taste **********""It's quite substantial,"" Mrs. Meijere said with mild surprise. ""Normally I have boiled macaroni with milk and sugar. But I'm planning to buy some of these. The crispiness is different from what we're used to."" **********On another afternoon in the Baltic Sea resort of Jurmala, Ilze Sulmane, a journalism lecturer at the University of Latvia, said her children adored cornflakes. But at the equivalent of a little more than a dollar and a half for a box in a country where most Latvians earn less than $100 a month, she said, ""we can't afford them."" **********""Sometimes,"" Mrs. Sulmane said, ""we buy them for a gift."" **********Juris Paider, the editor of Dienas Biznes, a financial newspaper in Latvia, can afford cornflakes. But like many Latvian men, as Kellogg discovered in focus groups and other research, Mr. Paider scoffed at the new breakfast food. **********""This is not food for a man,"" he said. ""My wife likes it because it is very fast, easy to serve. The kids eat it not only in the morning but between meals. They take little bits in their hands. But it's not for me. I've been eating a different kind of food all my life. I'm too conservative to change."" **********The grumpy reaction of some men notwithstanding, Richard Lovell, the head of corporate communications for Kellogg in Battle Creek, said that initial sales in the former Soviet Union, as well as in the new markets of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, had been encouraging. Mr. Lovell would not say how much cereal the company was selling in the region or give other details of Kellogg's sales or marketing strategy. No Quick Return Seen **********Kellogg invested $22 million in its Corn Flakes plant in Riga without expectation of a quick return. ""We don't expect to realize profits for years in an operation like this,"" Mr. Lovell said. ""It's going to be part of long-term growth."" **********It took 40 years to develop the Latin American market, Mr. Lovell said, and the company views Latvia, its 18th international outpost, in the same spirit. **********Already the world's most successful cereal company, with 51 percent of the market, Kellogg is opening another plant in Bombay, India, this summer and has started work on one in China that is expected to begin turning out breakfast cereal in mid-1995. **********Since becoming independent in 1991, Latvia has created a climate for foreign investors that seems tranquil compared with the chaos in much of the former Soviet Union. It has established its own currencies and has managed to rein in inflation. **********But Kellogg tumbled into Latvia through a series of improbable developments that began eight years ago. The first overture came not from Battle Creek but from Moscow. On a visit to the United States, Georgi A. Arbatov, an adviser on American affairs to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet President, fell in love with Kellogg cereals and wanted to see them on breakfast tables at home. **********So when Mr. Stewart, as a consultant to the Kellogg Foundation while at Ohio State, went to him in 1986 to ask for help in arranging some seminars on the military, Mr. Arbatov saw a chance for some horse trading. **********It was an easy sell, Mr. Stewart said, because Arnold G. Langbo, then president of Kellogg's international division and now chairman and chief executive officer, already had his eye on the Soviet Union, as well as China and India. **********But discussions sputtered along for two years before Mr. Arbatov suggested a joint venture with a collective farm outside Riga. Before the deal could be closed, the Soviet Union collapsed, Latvia became independent and Kellogg decided to go it alone. **********Mr. Stewart retired from Ohio State University and took charge of building Kellogg's plant in Latvia.  Every step of the way meant reinventing the wheel. Kellogg wanted to build its plant with Latvian workers but, Mr. Stewart said, ""No local builder understood the kind of standards we were talking about."" **********So Kellogg brought in architects, engineers and supervisors from England and Germany. The company also hauled in hardware and plumbing supplies as well as the machinery to make cornflakes. Kellogg has been able to buy some supplies locally, but the most important ingredient -- corn -- is still imported, reportedly from Canada and Argentina. **********Once the plant officially opened in November, Kellogg had to reach retail outlets in a country where there was no effective distribution system. **********Instead of recruiting a work force by word of mouth or through old relationships, Kellogg advertised in the Riga newspapers and interviewed hundreds of applicants. Every employee hired had a high school education and many had college degrees, Mr. Stewart said. But factory workers had to learn how to make Corn Flakes, a technique that is a closely guarded company secret. Office employees also had to learn Western management and accounting methods, and the sales force had to learn what it means to sell. **********""We started with a work force of people who had never seen a cornflake,"" Mr. Stewart said. ""And the skills of salesmanship and merchandising, none of that had existed here for more than 50 years."" **********But gradually, Kellogg has been making a dent. These days, Mr. Stewart said, ""You'd have a hard time finding a store in Latvia that doesn't have Kellogg's Corn Flakes."""

Ernest Tidwell of United States District Court here signed an order granting immunity to Christopher P. Drogoul, a major figure in a case involving billions of dollars in American Government-guaranteed loans to Iraq made by Mr. Drogoul's former employer, the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. **********There has been speculation that many of the loans, fraudulently obtained under a program to help countries pay for agricultural exports, may have been diverted to Iraqi weapons use in the years before the Persian Gulf war, when the Bush Administration was encouraging support of Iraq. **********Mr. Drogoul's testimony to the grand jury is expected Tuesday in Atlanta, his lawyer, Robert M. Simels, said. **********Federal prosecutors would not confirm the grant of immunity to the 41- year-old former bank manager, the scope of the current grand jury investigation, or even that there was a grand jury looking further into the case. **********But the impaneling of a grand jury would mark a new phase in the long-running bank fraud case. Over the last three years, there have been allegations that top officials in the United States and in Italy, where the Government controls B.N.L., knew about the purpose of the loans and tried with some success to limit earlier investigations to Mr. Drogoul and five other, lower-level bank employees. **********Earlier, Mr. Drogoul pleaded guilty to lying to bank regulators and to wire fraud, and is now serving a prison term. Several other co-defendants were also convicted of various crimes while working at the bank. **********There is speculation that any new grand jury would be looking at the role of others higher in the bank's hierarchy or of United States Government agencies involved in approving agricultural-export loans. Special Task Force **********Some members of Congress, as well as two Federal judges who have been involved in aspects of the case, have expressed the opinion that higher-ups at the bank in both in the United States and Italy had, in Judge Tidwell's words, ""clearly facilitated"" Mr. Drogoul's crimes. **********Although the prosecution of Mr. Drogoul was originally handled by the United States Attorney's office in Atlanta, the case since early in 1993 has come under a special Justice Department task force. It was created by Attorney General Janet Reno amid assertions by Mr. Drogoul and others that the Atlanta-based prosecutors were mishandling the case and keeping its focus narrow. **********John Hogan, the Washington-based Justice Department lawyer who heads the task force, would not comment on any matters in the case during a telephone interview today, nor would he discuss Mr. Drogoul, who is serving a sentence of three years and one month in the minimum-security Atlanta Prison Camp. **********But in a letter dated Feb. 4, written in response to an inquiry about the case from a citizen, Mr. Hogan detailed some of the areas under investigation. A copy of Mr. Hogan's response was obtained by The New York Times. Range of Inquiry **********The areas being investigated, according to the letter, included whether others shared criminal responsibility for the loans, whether other transactions in the case were also illegal, whether Federal export laws were violated by some of the commodities companies doing business financed by the Federal-backed loans, and whether public officials committed any crimes over the course of the case or in their statements about it to Congress. **********Mr. Simels said he believed that the grand jury was looking at the failure of Atlanta-based prosecutors to aggressively pursue higher-ranking people in the Italian bank, the Italian Government and even the United States Government. **********""Two judges have concluded that Rome headquarters knew, or should have known, about the loans and that the Federal Government's role in this was greater than anyone thought,"" he said. ""It would seem that the Justice Department has now concluded that there was an incomplete investigation and this is a rebuke of the actions of the the U.S. Attorney's office in Atlanta."""

Now, it buys about 100. **********The dollar's slide against the yen, as well as against the German mark, in recent weeks has evoked cries of alarm from Wall Street and has been read by some as a judgment of American policy -- and policy makers. ""The market is saying your economy is not in good shape,"" said Georges de Menil, a senior editor of the European-based journal Economic Policy. **********Yesterday, the dollar fell to a new record low below 100 yen, before recovering in late trading.  [ Page D6. ] **********But for many Americans who are not actively engaged in trading currencies or securities, the dollar's well-publicized woes have not meant very much. The economy is growing moderately, new jobs are being generated and inflation is modest. **********In the view of some economists, the biggest worry now is that the Clinton Administration, embarrassed by the symbolic weakness of a declining American currency, will care too much about the exchange value of the dollar and too little about the jobs and income, and will lean on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, impeding further growth. **********""The whole idea of having a floating-rate exchange system is to avoid currency crises"" that force governments to alter otherwise desirable domestic policies, said James Tobin, a Nobel laureate in economics at Yale University. **********While there are, indeed, some effects from a falling dollar, the impact on Main Street is real but relatively minor. When a dollar buys fewer yen or marks, it buys fewer goods made by foreign workers who are paid in yen and marks. Hence, the depreciating dollar is bad news for Americans who are shopping for a Sony camcorder or a bottle of Kirin beer or a Mercedes-Benz, unless the producers are willing to take smaller profits, and hold their export prices flat, as some have done. **********But even if prices of imported goods do rise, all those camcorders, cars and what-not imported from Japan and Germany represent just a small percent of American consumption. And at the same time, the value of the dollar has held firm against the currencies of many of the country's trading partners, and even appreciated against the currency of the biggest, Canada. **********Over all, a dollar buys just 3 percent less of the mix of goods and services Americans imported last year. Thus, even assuming that Japanese and German exporters were able to pass along their entire 10 percent rise against the dollar since the start of 1994 -- which they have not -- the impact on American living standards would be hard to discern. **********Of course, the direct price increases from higher import prices are not the only source of inflation for American consumers. Economists note that American companies with a history of less-than-aggressive price competition may use higher import prices as a lever to raise their own prices. ""I would be unhappy if Japan were forced to raise car prices,"" said George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who expressed fears that higher prices for Toyotas and Nissans, for example, would give Detroit an excuse to raise its own sticker prices. **********It is far from clear, however, that many German or Japanese industries have this much freedom to raise their prices without fear of losing customers in a global economy that is increasingly competitive in high-technology goods. German machinery exports, for example, now face competition from economies ranging all the way from Italy to South Korea to Brazil. **********But if inflation is not a significant concern, why have both the stock and bond markets responded so badly to the dollar's decline? American securities prices may have been expected to rise since the depreciated dollar makes American goods more competitive in world markets and thus makes American corporations more profitable. Reflection on Policy? **********One answer -- one apparently taken to heart on Wall Street -- is that the decline of the dollar and the parallel decline in the value of American securities are both symptoms of what Mr. de Menil calls a ""lack of credibility in American economic policy."" **********For all the hoopla over deficit reduction last year and the Federal Reserve's pre-emptive strike against inflation this year, he argues that America's budget and trade deficit problems remain serious and that Washington's will to squash inflation as the economy approaches full capacity remains in doubt. **********That is impossible to disprove. But it does not mesh well with the widely held view that the American economy is relatively healthy and relatively resistant -- for the moment, at least -- to the cumulative cost pressures that led to spiraling inflation in the late 1970's. **********Nor is it easy to reconcile the timing of the dollar's slide against the yen and the mark with any changes in American policy that would affect confidence in the economy. It is noteworthy that the dollar fared particularly poorly in June -- a month in which forecasters detected signs that the vigorous economic expansion of the last few months was running out of gas -- and therefore less prone to overheat. **********The very focus on exchange rates frustrates Mr. Tobin. The virtue of a free market in currencies, he said, is that it permits governments to pursue divergent economic policies that lead to different rates of growth and inflation rather than trying to keep them artificially in line so their currencies stay in tandem. **********In this case, he noted, flexible exchange rates have permitted the American economy to recover from recession even as Japan's and Germany's economy remained in the doldrums. Under the post-World War II system of fixed exchange rates, which held until the early 1970's, such divergence would have resulted in a currency crisis and the formal devaluation of one currency against another. **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Tobin's prescription for coping with the diminished dollar -- seconded by many others -- is to do ""roughly speaking, nothing."" And from his perspective, the irony is that American policy makers may take to heart implied criticism from financial markets, whose driving logic is, at times, questionable."

He barely had enough strength to hold the prayer beads that are his final comfort. **********""I used heroin with my friends, and we always shared the needles,"" said Mr. Myo Tun, 24 years old, as he drew a green cotton blanket beneath his bare feet. ""Even today my friends do not worry about AIDS.

""Any help would be welcome.""  A Medical Catastrophe **********One of the world's most isolated and secretive nations is opening up enough to admit that it has fallen victim to a medical catastrophe: an AIDS epidemic that is likely to ravage this country as it is now devastating Myanmar's neighbors. **********Doctors and health workers say a disastrous mix of factors -- a large population of intravenous drug users, a migration of prostitutes, a grave shortage of condoms and testing equipment, and a conservative social structure that makes AIDS education difficult -- means that Myanmar faces an AIDS crisis as serious as that now found in neighboring Thailand and India. **********But unlike its neighbors, Myanmar is the target of sanctions that have choked off most of the international aid for health projects that might control the spread of the disease. **********""Cutting off aid has hurt both the innocent victims of the epidemic and the potential victims,"" said Albina du Boisrouvray, founder of the Association Francois-Xavier Bagnoud, one of the few Western charities to support AIDS projects here. ""They don't have enough condoms. They don't have enough testing kits to test the blood. I'm flabbergasted by what they don't have."" **********Estimates from international health organizations place the number of people in Myanmar infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, at 150,000 to 450,000 in a population of about 43 million. The infection rates found in tests of intravenous drug users here -- nearly 80 percent are H.I.V. positive -- are the highest recorded anywhere.  An Uncooperative Neighbor **********Myanmar's neighbors are a big part of the problem, especially Thailand, where thousands of Burmese women are working as prostitutes, many of them in conditions that amount to slave labor. **********""What the Thais do is horrible,"" said a foreign health worker in Yangon, the Burmese capital. ""They recruit Burmese girls -- and they are girls -- and tell them that they will work as maids or waitresses. When they get to Thailand, they are forced into prostitution. And when they get AIDS, they are pushed back across the border."" **********Foreign health workers generally have few kind words for Myanmar's military Government, which has an abysmal human rights record. But on the issue of AIDS, they say, the Government appears to understand that it has a disaster on its hands, and to be doing something about it. **********""We realize this is one of the major health problems in Myanmar,"" said Dr. Myo Thet Htoon, the manager of the AIDS program of Myanmar's Ministry of Health. ""We know it could reach the whole population if we are not intelligent enough to prevent it."" **********According to the World Health Organization, the first H.I.V. infections were detected in Myanmar in 1988. In 1992, the last year for which full-year figures are available, 1,640 people tested positive for the virus out of 75,000 tested. **********Initially the principal transmission route for the virus was needle-sharing among intravenous drug users. But increasingly it is spread by sexual contact among heterosexuals, duplicating a pattern found in Thailand, where 800,000 are now estimated to be H.I.V. positive out of population of 57 million. The Money Is Lacking **********Thailand's AIDS-prevention program -- with its distribution of free condoms, widespread testing and vast public education program -- is considered a model for the developing world. But across the border in Myanmar, one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita income of less than $900 a year, the Government says there is no money for a comparable effort. **********Nearly a third of the blood supply here goes untested for the H.I.V. virus because of a shortage of test kits, which cost as little as 70 cents apiece. International aid groups donated about 1.2 million condoms to Myanmar last year, but that is not nearly enough to meet demand. Outside large cities, condoms are often impossible to find, and they carry a price -- about 10 cents each -- that is out of the reach of the very poor. **********The United Nations has stepped in to help with education. In 1991, Unicef produced a 60-minute film for Burmese television, ""Poisonous Love."" The central character in the film is a young man who contracts H.I.V. from a prostitute. He then goes on infect his wife and, possibly, his newborn child. **********It took Unicef a year to persuade the Burmese junta to show the film, and there was a long struggle with Government censors who insisted that a scene showing condoms be cut because it might offend many in this deeply conservative Buddhist country. **********The scene was left in only after Unicef made a direct appeal to Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of Burmese military intelligence and the man often described by diplomats as the first among equals in the junta. **********""Khin Nyunt's wife is a physician, thank goodness,"" a Western health worker said.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the advisers were ""clearly moving toward an easing of the embargo."" **********The advisers last week discussed a range of options, from partial abandonment of the embargo -- including allowing some American companies to enter into contracts with the Vietnamese for a trial period -- to a total lifting of the ban. A 'Reciprocal Gesture' **********The advisers met after Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, returned from a trip to Southeast Asia in mid-December with an upbeat assessment. **********Mr. Lord argued in favor of taking some immediate action to ease the embargo to reward Hanoi for its help in finding out what happened to the more than 2,000 American servicemen who did not return from the Vietnam War. **********""Lord felt there had been significant progress made and had argued that the Vietnamese were now expecting to see some kind of reciprocal gesture that would be aimed at easing the embargo,"" one official said. He added that the Vietnamese were not expecting full normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi at this time. **********Mr. Lord is on a skiing vacation and could not be reached for comment.  A Nettlesome Issue **********The trade sanctions against Hanoi have been a nettlesome issue for the Clinton Administration. As a candidate, Mr. Clinton pledged there would be no easing of the embargo until Hanoi made a ""full accounting"" of missing Americans. Yet that position is at odds with the Administration's emphasis on expanding overseas trade to improve the American economy. **********With its well-educated, highly disciplined and motivated people and its natural resources, including offshore deposits of oil and natural gas, Vietnam is considered to have great economic potential. American businesses and a number of members of Congress, both Democratic and Republican, have been pressing for an end to the trade embargo lest American companies lose out to European and Japanese competitors in exploiting the growing Vietnamese market. **********Some veterans groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars have also supported the idea of closer ties with Vietnam so long as progress is made on the prisoner of war issue. **********But vocal opposition by organizations representing families of missing Americans and by other veterans groups, including the American Legion, has placed a political roadblock in the way of better relations between Hanoi and Washington.  The Pace Quickens **********Because Mr. Clinton's avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War has been a hot political potato, he has tried not to offend opponents of liberalized relations. There are a few members of Congress who are fiercely opposed to widened ties, but their numbers are dropping and in any event the President does not need the approval of Congress to widen diplomatic or trade relations with Vietnam. **********While the officials said that no decision has been made on whether to lift the embargo, the pace towards normalization appears to be quickening. **********Last week's meeting of foreign policy advisers, reported in The Washington Post today, was the first time they had gathered to consider the next steps to take since Mr. Clinton eased the trade embargo in September. At that time, Mr. Clinton permitted American companies to bid for projects in Vietnam financed by international lending institutions. **********The decision in September followed a policy shift in July, when President Clinton said the United States would no longer try to block loans to Vietnam from institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. At that time, Mr. Clinton's advisers said that the lifting of the economic embargo would be conditioned on solid progress in learning the fate of the servicemen. **********Mr. Clinton specifically said he would require tangible progress by Vietnam is four areas: repatriating the remains of Americans known to have died in Southeast Asia; supplying documents that could help in the search; assisting in cases in which downed American airmen were suspected of being alive but were not returned in the large-scale prisoner release in 1973, and working with the Government of Laos to determine what happened to American airmen who were downed in that country. **********Virtually all those listed as missing are presumed dead, but the failure to find remains has fueled speculation over the years that some might be alive and held captive by the Vietnamese. For its part, Hanoi lists more than 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers, sailors and airmen as missing from the Indochina war.  Search Team Meets **********During his three-day trip, Mr. Lord received the remains of what the Vietnamese said were eight dead Americans at a ceremony in Hanoi. The repatriation brings to 67 the number of remains the Vietnamese have returned this year. Mr. Lord also traveled to Lao Bao, a village on the Vietnam-Laos border, for the first meeting of the United States-Vietnam-Lao search team. **********Mr. Lord, whose trip to Vietnam was his second in five months, praised the Vietnamese cooperation on the issue of missing Americans as ""absolutely superb."" At another point during his trip he told reporters, ""If you look over the whole year, we've made very good progress, indeed, tangible progress."" **********For his part, Mr. Lord gave the Vietnamese three million microfiche pages of captured wartime documents to aid Hanoi in the search for its missing troops. And he announced that Washington was giving Hanoi $2 million help it reintegrate returning Vietnamese boat people. **********In their meetings with Mr. Lord, Vietnamese officials told the American envoy that Hanoi wanted to ""proceed toward normalization as soon as possible."""

Ford, known for his sensitivity to sweet deals and impending turnarounds, is moving to their state. **********He and Ronald O. Perelman of New York won the bidding last week to buy First Nationwide Bank, the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan, from the Ford Motor Company for $1.1 billion. **********Mr. Ford plans to move from Dallas, where he pulled off the most profitable savings and loan purchase in the whole Federal distress sale, to San Francisco, where First Nationwide is based. **********Mr. Perelman and Mr. Ford formed First Gibraltar Bank from several failed Texas savings and loans they bought from regulators in 1988. With $5.1 billion in Federal aid and about $900 million in tax breaks, they at least tripled an initial investment of about $300 million.  Looking for Greater Rewards **********Now that the Texas economy has revived and banking here has settled down, Mr. Ford has been looking for places that offer higher rewards, even with higher risks. **********""I've got to leave town for work,"" he said with a chuckle in a telephone interview. ""We don't have any vision, intellect or genius that's proprietary. There are many people who can do as well as we do, especially when the markets are good. We tend to do better when the markets aren't so good."" **********That's the sort of overstated understatement that helps Mr. Ford command attention, whether at a south Texas hunting lodge or a Manhattan investment firm. **********""When Gerry Ford is in the room, you tend to know it,"" said James T. Conroy, senior vice president of Mac-Andrews & Forbes Holdings, Mr. Perelman's investment firm. **********If some analysts say that Mr. Ford could profit by breaking up First Nationwide, he will hear none of it. ""I think California over the next three to five years will be a better place to be,' he said. ""We plan to increase our concentration."" **********He is looking to build First Nationwide's deposits there by buying other savings and loans. **********Mr. Ford, who is unrelated to any former Presidents or automotive families, has often gone for turnarounds instead of plodding corporate maintenance. Born in Pampa, a county seat in the Texas Panhandle, he made the National Bank of Post, Tex., pop. 3,822, his first acquisition, in 1976. **********""Rather than going through a commercial banking training program, at the first bank I ever worked in I was the chairman,"" he said. ""And it was my own money, so we loaned it out like it was my own money."" **********Theodore H. Strauss, who as chairman of United National Bank was one of Mr. Ford's early backers, said he soon derived as much benefit from Mr. Ford as Mr. Ford derived from the bank. **********""He didn't have 10 cents, and if he did, it was borrowed,"" Mr. Strauss said. ""But he was already helping me find prospective customers."" **********Mr. Strauss is now a senior managing director in the Dallas office of the Bear, Stearns investment firm, which introduced Mr. Perelman and Mr. Ford. **********Adding other banks, first in small towns and then in larger Southwestern markets, Mr. Ford built his First United Bank Group, based in Albuquerque, N.M., into a company with $4 billion in assets. One's Idea, the Other's Money **********The First Gibraltar purchase, the largest Government sale in Texas, involved Mr. Ford's idea and Mr. Perelman's money. Mr. Perelman, who owns or controls properties including Revlon and the Marvel comic book company, has built one of the nation's largest fortunes. **********The terms of their First Gibraltar purchase -- including tax breaks, loss protection and the ability to shift bad loans back to the Government -- brought Congressional protests and another round of negotiations that somewhat reduced their profits. When regulators questioned First Gibraltar's payments for a Texas hunting lodge, a New York apartment and a corporate jet, Mr. Ford agreed to finance them separately from the savings and loan's operations. **********Most Texas banks own lodges where they entertain important customers, Mr. Ford noted. ""A North Carolina-based institution has one right near ours,"" he said, an unmistakable reference to Nationsbank, which bought the largest bank in Texas. **********Mr. Ford took his profits last year, selling First United to the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis for $495 million and most of First Gibraltar to BankAmerica of San Francisco for about $110 million. **********With a resulting fortune that some acquaintances estimate at $100 million, Mr. Ford by the middle of last year had become a passion in search of an object. No matter that he had suffered a mild heart attack several months earlier; he says he is now back playing tennis and working as intensely as ever. He is 49 years old, divorced and has four children 15 to 21 years old. **********Industry analysts generally said that in buying First Nationwide, Mr. Perelman and Mr. Ford had found the right object at the right time and price. Ford Motor agreed to keep $1.2 billion of First Nationwide's worst loans and take back $500 million if they soured. First Nationwide has total assets of $15.5 billion, primarily real estate loans concentrated in California. Mr. Ford will own at most 20 percent of First Nationwide and Mr. Perelman the rest. **********Analysts do not expect the First Nationwide deal to pay off nearly as well as First Gibraltar, however. **********""Although Ford was very generous, no private corporation has exceeded the largesse of the Federal Government,"" said E. Gareth Plank, a savings and loan analyst at Mabon Securities. **********Mr. Plank said that Mr. Ford and Mr. Perelman were still likely to reap annual returns of 15 to 20 percent, and then a big payout in several years from a sale, probably to out-of-state investors. A 'Very Enviable Position' **********""They will be in a very enviable position as some look to the recovered California economy and their market position there,"" Mr. Plank said. **********The state, aided by Federal relief and a construction boom after the Jan. 17 Los Angeles earthquake, resumed adding jobs early this year after a four-year recession. But Mr. Ford still faces several risks. **********Even those savings and loans that avoided rash real estate lending face many competitors, including mortgage banks and brokerage firms. Also, California's recovery could stall, or First Nationwide's loan portfolio could turn out weaker than Mr. Ford believes. **********Mr. Ford expects the Office of Thrift Supervision to approve the purchase within 120 days. He dismisses the possibility that regulators will reopen the matter of his profits from First Gibraltar. **********""A nonissue,' he said. ""It wasn't something we held for four years and then someone wrote us a big check. We took risks and we were rewarded."""

The media and entertainment company posted net income of $7 million, or 1 cent a share, in contrast to its loss of $93 million, or 25 cents a share, after payment of preferred dividends, in the period a year earlier. Revenues for the quarter jumped 9.6 percent, to $4.12 billion. **********The company attributed the performance to increased profits in its music, publishing and pay-television businesses, noting that operating profits in cable and film entertainment had declined for the quarter. **********Jessica Reif, an analyst who follows Time Warner for Oppenheimer & Company, said the earnings were on target. She noted a concern about a 5 percent drop in cable operating profits, which the company attributed to cable regulation. **********Time Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, said that the cable business could be hurt further by the effects of regulation but said the company was optimistic about its growth prospects."

Neither caused any injuries but both disrupted traffic at Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports, and made British citizens feel vulnerable again after months of relative peace. **********In between the attacks, the leader of the political arm of the I.R.A., Gerry Adams, issued a statement and gave a radio interview in which he seemed to suggest that more violence was in the offing. **********In the second attack, another four shells were fired shortly after midnight, striking an area where planes park for loading and unloading at Terminal No. 4, which primarily serves British Airways overseas flights, but some other airlines as well. The police say the shells in the second attack were fired from a secluded spot in a patch of woods next to the A30 highway, which runs along the southern side of the airport. **********The southern runway at Heathrow was closed from midnight until 7:15 A.M., as was Terminal No. 4. British Airways canceled nine flights and diverted three or four incoming ones and KLM canceled one flight. **********The policy of not informing passengers that a warning has been received and of not interfering with airlines' schedules is becoming a subject of controversy. After the first attack, the British Pilots Association demanded an inquiry on why it took so long -- 44 minutes -- to close the northern runway after four unexploded mortar shells had landed on or near it. Twenty-five planes were allowed to use the runway in that period."

Drugs at the Top: Risks and Remedies"," **********WHEN Wardell R. Lazard, a prominent Wall Street executive, died from an accidental drug overdose, and when Larry Kudlow, a top Wall Street economist, owned up to a drug and alcohol habit, the nation remembered what it already knew: drugs and alcohol are as big a problem in business as they are everywhere else. **********But, as those cases also suggest, the user often can be a chief executive or a very senior one.  Experts estimate that 10 percent of highly placed executives are impaired by drugs and alcohol, an incidence similar to that of the overall work force. And when the problem resides in the executive suite, it carries special business risks and requires special approaches to treatment. **********Sometimes a business crisis will stop a top executive's decline. More than a decade ago, James S. Kemper Jr., former chairman of the Kemper National Insurance Companies, described on national television how a business associate announced he would no longer do business with Mr. Kemper because of his drinking. Surprised, angry and defensive at first, Mr. Kemper -- who had more than 20 years of sobriety at the time of the broadcast -- said the event was a turning point in his life and his career. **********Unfortunately, such workplace ultimatums are rare. Fear prevents underlings from confronting an addicted chief executive. So does denial. After all, who wants to think the captain of the ship is impaired? Often, these denying employees will view drug or alcohol consumption as the effect rather than the cause of all or some of a company's difficulties. **********Whatever the reason, employees often make excuses for an impaired chief executive and shield him or her from addiction's consequences. In a definitive study of newly sober executives by Charles Shirley, an expert on alcoholism, about 15 years ago, 76 percent of executives reported that their secretaries conducted elaborate cover-up operations for them during their drinking days, and 60 percent said their fellow executives did the same. For chief executives, this alibi system can be very extensive, enabling them to long maintain their chemical dependencies. **********High-level executives can persist in addiction for other reasons. When lower-level workers are addicted, their declining performance is often easily noticed because their responsibilities are narrow. They are then held accountable for the decline and asked to choose between getting treatment and losing their job. Treatment professionals call this process ""bottoming out."" **********But executives, especially chief executives, have broader, more amorphous responsibilities; faltering performance can be plausibly explained by many things, from the general economy to intracorporate conflict. And while lower-level workers have supervisors who can detect addiction and take action, the chief executive is accountable only to the board of directors. He has no day-to-day boss. **********The result is that bottoming out -- a painful but necessary step on the road to recovery -- does not readily happen to chief executives. **********How can addicted chief executives be helped? Of course, family members and friends, who are among the biggest victims of addiction, are one source of pressure. Indeed, relatives sometimes spur an addict's employer to take action. One Harris, Rothenberg client, the chief executive of a large company, received treatment only after his fed-up wife called a director and threatened to sue the company and make a fuss in the news media. His company then sought professional help to confront him about his addiction. **********But, often, relatives do nothing. So, reluctant though they may be, co-workers must do their best to bring a boss's addictions to an end. And simply stating their case to the chief works only occasionally; employees should seek professional guidance on how to proceed. Other sources of pressure on chief executives are their fellow chief executives. Equal in rank and unattached organizationally, these executives may be more willing than others to seek professional help for their colleagues. **********Someone must take action, however. Besides the important human gains, the business benefits of a chief executive's recovery far exceed the costs of intervention and treatment. To reach the top, chief executives must have remarkable talents; treatment can restore those talents to the company. And the chances of success are relatively good. Although chemical dependency is an equal opportunity illness, executives generally respond better to treatment than other addicted employees."

The final regularly scheduled flight, an Air France jet bound for French Guiana, departed just ahead of a Monday deadline that was intended to increase both the  economic pressure on the country's military-backed government and its isolation. **********Though the suspension of commercial flights does not affect the vast majority of Haiti's seven million people, most of whom are too poor to afford foreign travel, it promises to have an important psychological impact, especially on the country's commercial and governing class. **********We are sealed in, the whole country,"" Raymond Lafontant, executive director of the Association of Haitian Industries, said in an interview Friday. ""I have a sense I am in jail."" **********Looking for Letter-Carriers **********Aware that the flight was their last chance to leave or to ship cargo abroad, many Haitians arrived at the airport early, including some who did not intend to travel but were merely looking for passengers willing to carry letters. **********Radio stations here, citing postal officials, have been saying in recent days that mail deliveries to and from foreign destinations will have to be suspended  unless the Government finds a way to bring in mail from overseas aboard charter  flights. **********In a radio interview this afternoon, a postal official said the Government hoped soon to begin using boats to bring in overseas mail. But he also said it was proving difficult to find shipping companies willing to take on the job, because they feared problems with American naval vessels patrolling just offshore. **********Originally, Air France refused to join American Airlines and other carriers that suspended their flights to Port-au-Prince on June 25 as part of the economic sanctions against Haiti. But when the Haitian military expelled a combined United Nations and Organization of American States human rights monitoring mission on July 11, France retaliated by announcing that service would end by Aug. 1. **********Mothers Seeks to Get Home **********At the airport this morning, the police allowed only passengers with confirmed reservations or boarding passes to enter the terminal, turning away more than a score of people who arrived with valid tickets only to be told their seats had been given to others. Among them was Yolande Brunache, who was planning to fly to Cayenne, French Guiana, to join her husband and year-old son. **********""I don't know what to do now,"" Ms. Brunache, 31, said, clearly stunned after  being turned away at the terminal entrance by an Air France ticket agent. ""This  is the last flight, and I have got to get on it."" **********In a similar situation was Erla Desrameaux, who flew here from her home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn last month to care for her 22-year-old daughter, who was ill at the time. Ms. Desrameaux, 48, a housekeeper at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, said she had bought a ticket with an open return but had  been unable to reserve a ticket back to New York, where she has lived for 25 years. **********""For the last three weeks I've come out to the airport every day there has been a flight, but every day it's been the same thing,"" she said. ""I need to get back, because I have an 11-year-old son who I left with a friend, and he needs his mother."" **********As the deadline for the suspension of service approached, plane reservations  became a coveted black market item, trading for more than 10 times their face value. **********U.S. Hopes to Charter Flight **********On Wednesday's flight, American officials here said, Air France bumped about 100 Haitian political refugees who have been granted asylum in the United States to give seats to other customers, many of whom appeared to be French nationals. **********A man who identified himself as the Air France manager here, but declined to  give his name, refused to discuss the company's ticketing procedures. ""My company says no interviews here, only in Paris,"" he said. **********American Embassy officials said they hoped to obtain permission from the military government for charter flights that would take those refugees, and more than 1,000 others whose applications for political asylum are being processed here, to the United States. ""We are confident that will happen,"" Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the embassy, said earlier this week. **********Also left behind are a large group of foreigners. Diplomats here estimate that about 3,000 Americans, 2,000 Canadians and 1,500 Britons are in the country, most of them residents who remain willingly. **********Consulate Closes Doors **********In addition, the American consulate has closed its doors as of Friday. From  now on, United States officials here said, the consulate will no longer grant visas of any type to Haitians, and will only be open to provide emergency services to American citizens. **********The United Nations embargo of Haiti is likely to tighten even further next month, when an international force is expected to begin patrolling the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. With American vessels sailing the waters off Haiti and interdicting shipments of goods proscribed by the sanctions, the country has been receiving essential items like gasoline mostly through that porous land frontier. **********But the United States has authorized $15 million to improve the policing of that border, and is ready to send helicopters, vehicles and technical advisers as part of the effort. American officials said an agreement with the Dominicans  had been in the works for several weeks and was awaiting the approval of President Joaquin Balaguer, who in the past has been friendly to the Haitian military."

It had earlier projected 1993 earnings of $59 million to $67 million, or 70 cents to 80 cents a share. **********Mr. Sulzberger said that the newspaper had lost more than a third of its advertising volume since the 1987 stock market crash and that despite signs of an improvement in the economy, ""there is little to suggest that much of this lost linage will return."" **********Because of increased competition for fewer advertiser dollars, Mr. Sulzberger said, the newspaper ""must respond to diminished revenue by rethinking the way we operate"" and reducing costs without affecting the quality of the newspaper. **********He said the newspaper would seek savings, including reductions in the number of white-collar employees and managers. He said that the newspaper would try to achieve the reductions through voluntary measures, but that he could not rule out the possibility that some employees ""will have to leave with severance packages."" **********Nancy Nielsen, the spokeswoman for The Times, said the newspaper would evaluate all categories of white-collar employees, including those in the newspaper's newsroom, as it determines where reductions would be made. Union Involved **********The newspaper's contract with the New York Newspaper Guild, the union that represents white-collar and some other employees, expired on March 31. Negotiations are continuing. **********The Times has contracts through the year 2000 with its production unions. Mr. Sulzberger's memorandum noted that the newspaper had reduced its staff by about 10 percent over the last six years, with most of the reductions coming from the craft employees. Mr. Sulzberger said it was ""reasonable to assume"" that the newspaper would need a similar reduction over the next few years from white-collar employees. **********The Times made its announcement after the stock market closed yesterday. Earlier, the Times Company's class A shares ended trading at $29.125, up 37.5 cents, on the American Stock Exchange."

Sani Abacha, against one of the country's wealthiest businessmen, Moshood K. Abiola. **********Mr. Abiola, a publisher and longtime political gadfly of the southern Yoruba ethnic group, is widely believed to have won the presidential election on June 12, 1993, defeating a candidate from northern Nigeria in what was seen as the country's fairest election since independence in 1960. **********But after organizing the vote in fulfillment of its pledge to restore civilian rule, Nigeria's military blocked the publication of the results and has clung to power.  Charged With Treason **********Mr. Abiola has been jailed on treason charges since June 23, when, one year after his presumed victory, he proclaimed himself President. His imprisonment has inspired an increasingly bold pro-democracy movement, whose strikes in the vital oil industry and elsewhere have led to sporadic violence and begun to cripple an economy in which per capita income had already been plunging. **********But what has worried people even more is that the crisis appears to have deepened ethnic and regional cleavages in ways that all sides say could threaten Nigeria's existence as a state. **********""We are at the edge of the precipice,"" said Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, a member of the Ibo ethnic group who led a secession movement in the 1960's. ""I pray that we do not fall into the abyss again."" **********He was alluding to Nigeria's worst ethnic conflict, when more than one million people were killed between 1967 and 1970 in the failed attempt of the country's eastern region to secede and form a new country called Biafra. **********Many people now say that as the current crisis drags on it has increasingly become, like the Biafra conflict, a confrontation between two of Nigeria's three largest ethnic blocs -- in this case the Hausa-Fulani bloc in the north against the Yoruba in the south. The former are mainly Muslim; their rivals are mainly Christian. 250 Ethnic Groups **********Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, and the three largest blocs -- the Hausa and Fulani, the Yoruba, and the Ibo -- make up about 60 percent of the population. The northerners are believed to be the most numerous. Although Mr. Abiola scored well in the election in many areas of the country, including the north, his support now comes overwhelmingly from his fellow Yoruba. **********Throughout the opposition leader's native southwest, but increasingly elsewhere in the south as well, employees from office workers to laborers have gone on strike alongside the oil workers to demand Mr. Abiola's release and installation as President. **********Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and largest oil producer, ranking 10th in the world in production. The United States is the largest customer for its light crude, and both world oil prices and gasoline prices in the United States have risen during the crisis here. **********Nigeria's largest refinery, in the southeastern city of Port Harcourt, was closed last week when soldiers entered the plant and sought to force striking workers to return to work. Severe Fuel Shortages **********Experts say the closing of the refinery means that unless Nigeria begins importing gasoline, severe fuel shortages will soon affect the entire country. **********In Lagos, the southwestern city of six million that is the commercial capital, the strikes have created a whole new kind of ""go slow,"" the city's name for its notorious, hours-long traffic jams. Whole neighborhoods are clogged with cars parked in lines that stretch for miles as drivers wait days for gasoline. **********Banks and offices throughout the city have been closed for weeks, and a shortage of the bottled gas and kerosene has forced people to adopt alternatives for cooking. **********Tensions have grown in crowded market areas as Ibo traders from the southeast have been attacked by predominantly Yoruba urban toughs. **********""This strike hurts everyone a lot,"" said Femi Adewole, an idled office worker who said he had not been paid for more than two weeks. ""Our only hope is that it will hurt the military most of all and allow us for once to have a government based on some kind of principle other than just power."" New Crises Feared **********Mr. Abiola's presumed victory would be the first election of a Yoruba as President, and throughout the southwest Yorubas have seen the annulment of the vote as an attempt by northerners to keep them from power. **********""My fear is that if we don't recognize the results of this election, we won't be able to have another national vote in this country,"" said Ray Ekpu, editor in chief of Newswatch, a Lagos weekly. ""Yorubas will protest or abstain, saying that they have been denied, and Nigeria will have an interminable series of crises."" **********Many among the country's northern elite have responded to the strikes by pressing General Abacha, himself a northerner, for tougher action to end the demonstrations. **********In the capital, Abuja, senior officials from the north grumble about what they say is ""weakness"" on the part of the Government. **********""The Yoruba are behaving like terrorists, holding the whole nation hostage, and all we can do is talk and compromise,"" a northern official said. **********General Abacha, who seized control of the Government last November, makes few public appearances. So far, his political initiatives have centered on a nationwide constitutional conference he ordered to reform the country's institutions and pave the way for a return to civilian rule at an unspecified date.  Northerners Rally **********Recognition of the result of last year's elections is not on the conference's agenda and seems unlikely to be considered. Some northern politicians, meanwhile, have begun to rally the people of their region against what they have depicted as a Yoruba-led bid by southerners to end the north's long hold on power. **********In part because they have dominated the Nigerian armed forces since the British colonial period, northerners have enjoyed almost exclusive control of executive power. Nigeria has been ruled by the military for 24 of its 34 years of independence. **********""If we don't close ranks and we allow the only power we have to slip away without having an equal hold on the bureaucratic and economic power like other sections, we will be making our generations unborn slaves,"" Umaru Dikko, a prominent northern politician, wrote last year to Muslim leaders of the north in a letter published here recently. **********Northern fears of southern power are fueled in part by the concentration of mineral and industrial wealth in the south. Although he is a Muslim, Mr. Abiola arouses particular fears among the predominantly Muslim northern elite because of his vast wealth, which insulates him from the influence of others in Nigeria's traditional money-based politics. Moreover, for years Mr. Abiola has used his wealth to finance philanthropies and scholarships for Nigerians throughout the country, making him the closest thing Nigeria has to a truly national figure. **********As feelings harden on all sides and economic damage mounts, many Nigerian political analysts and foreign diplomats say that there is little prospect of the military's relenting and allowing Mr. Abiola to assume full powers as President.  'Impossible to Go Back' **********At the same time, they say, Yorubas and other supporters of Mr. Abiola will not countenance any move to discard his presidential mandate completely. Instead, many say, a peaceful solution that would keep Nigeria whole requires releasing Mr. Abiola and giving him a role as a transitional leader in a government that would have to be carefully built to acknowledge regional fears and interests. **********""It seems impossible to go back to June 12 in its pure form and simply install Abiola, as his supporters are demanding,"" said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""But the country cannot continue to go on like this, and unless some kind of compromise is reached that acknowledges Abiola's victory, Nigeria could very well be torn apart."""

First and foremost, policies purchased in one's country of residence frequently limit coverage to medical expenses incurred while in that country. **********Second, and equally important, the cost of medical treatment is soaring everywhere, not just in the United States where health care reform is second only to crime as a major political issue. Indeed, in most countries medical inflation continues to outstrip broad indexes of consumer price inflation. That means that even a relatively short stay in a hospital can be financially crippling if you are not covered. **********A spokesman for the U.K.- based international health insurer Medicare said, for example, that a claimant recently spent a few weeks in a hospital in Singapore following a road accident, running up a bill of over $15,000. **********""Costs can assume nightmare proportions for prolonged illnesses,"" the spokesman said. ""Another claimant, who was diagnosed as having cancer of the colon while working in the United Arab Emirates has so far received treatment to the tune of $104,000."" **********Most hospitals will treat emergency cases regardless of whether or not the patient can pay immediately. But even that can be of small comfort if the hospital is poorly equipped or lacks qualified staff, conditions which frequently occur in remote locations. In extreme cases, emergency evacuation can be the only alternative. If that service is included in one's insurance package, it can often be arranged swiftly. **********According to Michael Kelly, president of International S.O.S. Assistance in Philadelphia, which specializes in emergency evacuation services, the majority of evacuations are the result of trauma due to accidents. ""In Asia, for example, orthopedic trauma-related injuries were double the number of evacuations due to infectious diseases, cardiovascular and digestive problems,"" he said. **********In a recent week which was fairly typical, Mr. Kelly said, International S.O.S. Assistance rushed a female scuba diver suffering from decompression sickness from Mexico to Houston, evacuated a man with appendicitis from Siberia to Helsinki, and speeded a woman suffering from a brain hemorrhage from Turkey to Boston. **********Private Patients Plan, an international health concern based in the United Kingdom, deals with about four or five emergency evacuation cases a month. ""While this sounds like a fairly small number, it is a vital service for the people involved,"" commented Philip Healey, head of the company's marketing and sales operations. PPP also offers a compassionate travel facility which pays for a relative or friend to travel with the patient at all times. **********Most expatriates, of course, recognize the need for some form of health insurance while overseas, but some analysts say that a surprising number have inadequate coverage. ""People tend to view insurance as something which can be stinted on, because the likelihood is that it will not be needed,"" said David Pryor, director of ExpaCare, another U.K.-based global health insurer, echoing a view expressed by physicians and independent observers as well. ""As far as health is concerned, it is not worth cutting corners."" **********If one is living in a country where the cost of health care is among the highest, it is worth considering paying a higher premium to get the requisite level of cover, analysts say. Indeed, if one resides in Singapore or Hong Kong, for example, which are notoriously expensive locales for medical treatment, a policy which limits the maximum annual cover to around $100,000 could prove quite insufficient. **********Those researching which international policy might best suit them are also advised to examine geographic restrictions. Many providers offer staggered premium structures with relatively low fees for coverage that excludes expenses incurred in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, and much higher fees for truly global coverage. **********One benefit of the growing number of people traveling and working abroad, however, is that health insurance policies are becoming increasingly sophisticated and price sensitive. Nowadays, coverage is available for just about anything - including injuries sustained in war zones - and it needn't cost a fortune. **********Standard products which offer coverage for hospital services, emergency evacuation and local ambulance services start at around $400 per year. ""There is little point in opting for an elaborate policy if you are based somewhere like Nigeria, where medical facilities are pretty basic, "" said Mr. Pryor. ""You will need to ensure that the policy covers you for medical evacuation."" **********Most of the so-called ""executive"" insurance packages offer outpatient coverage. This may include dental treatment, optical expenses and general practitioner costs, or could just be limited to outpatient hospital services. Make sure to check the fine print. Many policies ask the insured to pay an extra charge for outpatient treatment and other add-ons, but such coverage may still be worth having, analysts say, if it covers medical expenses for one's children as well. **********Finding the right policy can be time consuming, but it is worth researching the market thoroughly before taking the plunge, experts say. As well as comparing benefits and prices, check the method of reimbursement. And do not assume that the insurer will pay the doctor or hospital directly. Costs may have to be paid out of pocket before an insurance claim can be filled out and processed. **********If fees must be paid up front, and that is frequent particularly with relatively small claims, analysts suggest asking if reimbursement can be made in the currency of one's choice. Depending on exchange rate fluctuations, it might be advantageous to receive reimbursement in sterling or U.S. dollars rather than in the country where the expenses are incurred."

But they revoked the plea agreement in February, citing what they said was Mr. Hoffenberg's failure to testify fully and honestly about his business affairs. **********In April, Mr. Hoffenberg was indicted on more than a dozen counts of fraud and obstruction of justice, all arising from Federal allegations that he operated Towers as a vast Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of more than $450 million; a separate Federal indictment in Illinois accused him of defrauding an insurance company there. **********In a novel legal challenge, Mr. Hoffenberg's lawyers went to court last month to ask Federal Judge Robert Sweet to compel the Government to reinstate the revoked agreement. In a decision released yesterday, Judge Sweet refused, saying it would be ""premature"" to do so. John Pollak, a lawyer for Mr. Hoffenberg, said the decision left his client with the options of going to trial, pleading guilty under the old terms without any assurance the prosecutors would support a lenient sentence, or trying to negotiate a new plea bargain."

To terminate that deal, Reliance will pay General Signal a fee of $50 million, as well as $5.2 million to cover expenses. **********""This is definitely a better fit for Rockwell than it was for General Signal, and that's why Rockwell went after it,"" said Jack Modzelewski, an analyst for Paine Webber. ""It's a great fit at a full price. And the termination fee is pretty standard stuff."" **********On the New York Stock Exchange today, shares of Rockwell fell 50 cents, to $34.375; shares of General Signal rose 25 cents, to $36.25, and shares of Reliance gained 62.5 cents, to $30.875. **********While analysts initially expected General Signal to improve its $1.4 billion stock deal with Reliance, General Signal, which is based in Stamford, Conn., decided that doing so would have cut too deeply into the savings that had made a combination desirable. **********""A bidding war would have taken months and cut into the value of the savings we would have achieved,"" said Nino Fernandez, a spokesman for General Signal, which makes mechanical, electrical and telecommunications equipment. ""They've wired the $55.25 million to our bank, and we'll put that to work to make our businesses more efficient and to continue making small acquisitions."" **********Rockwell plans to merge Reliance's $1.2 billion operations in industrial motors, controls, generators, transformers and mechanical transmissions with Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which makes automation control equipment. The new unit will have $3.5 billion in sales, more than triple those of Allen-Bradley when it was bought by Rockwell in 1985. **********""This makes us a leading worldwide player in the factory automation business,"" said Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive of Rockwell, which is based in Seal Beach, Calif. **********The purchase not only fills out the product line of Rockwell, but will also improve the efficiency of its distribution network and give it the breadth to take on international competitors like Emerson Electric and Siemens. **********The deal also takes Rockwell farther away from the military business. In contrast to companies like Northrop, Grumman, Martin Marietta and Lockheed, which have sought mergers to survive cuts in military spending, Rockwell has built up its commercial businesses. **********About 20 percent of Rockwell's sales of $11 billion in the 1994 fiscal year, which ended in September, were to the Department of Defense, compared with about 50 percent in 1986. That figure should drop to about 17 percent after the acquisition of Reliance. **********Rockwell plans to sell Reliance's $470-million-a-year telecommunications business because it does not complement its own. While Reliance makes circuit breakers and other telecommunications equipment, Rockwell is a leading manufacturer of data facsimile modems. **********Analysts say Reliance, based in Cleveland, had favored a merger with General Signal despite its lower value, because the company and the management would have remained fully intact. John C. Morley, president of chief executive of Reliance, was to have become vice chairman of General Signal, and their boards were to have been merged. **********Mr. Beall said Mr. Morley would continue in his position, though analysts expect Mr. Morley to leave after the companies are integrated. **********The tender offer was to have expired at noon today. As of Friday, Rockwell said, 61.2 percent of the outstanding voting stock of Reliance had been tendered under the previous offer. **********Last week, General Signal gave the two companies permission to negotiate a deal. Rockwell agreed to sweeten its bid by $1 a share and will give Reliance's shareholders 10 days more to tender their stock."

Competing for an annual market estimated at $1 billion in sales and contracts, 47 American oil-service companies mounted stands here. **********""Until 18 months ago, the door was basically shut in our faces,"" said Bob Greenwood, a salesman with Bestolife, a Dallas company that makes drilling-pipe sealant. ""You could ship the product down here, but it would sit on the dock and rot."" **********Now that Brazil is discarding tariffs and protectionist quotas, American companies have won about half the oil-service market, a survey by the United States Consulate here indicated. Other opportunities await production and pipeline companies. **********By the end of the 1990's, Latin America is expected to pass the United States and Canada and become the world's second-largest oil-producing region, after the Middle East. Brazil is Latin America's third-largest oil producer, after Venezuela and Mexico, extracting about two-thirds of its oil from wells offshore Rio de Janeiro state. **********""With the new Government, there is going to be an explosion of this sector,"" said Etienne Kvassay, a Brazilian trade economist who prepared the consulate's survey. ""This market should grow at the rate of 30 percent in the next three years."" **********Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who will become President on Jan. 1, pledged during the campaign to relax the monopoly that Brazil's state oil monopoly, Petrobras, has enjoyed for 41 years over oil exploration, production and refining. **********Mr. Cardoso's campaign platform called for the establishment of partnerships and joint ventures between Petrobras and private business. **********The President-elect went further in a recent interview with Brasil Energy, an oil and gas monthly. ""Petrobras is already a sufficiently mature business to open itself up to partnerships or to competition with private companies,"" he said. **********In Petrobras's largest joint venture to date, two United States energy companies, Tenneco and Enron, both of Houston, signed contracts in August to participate as minority partners in the construction next year of a $1.8 billion, 1,400-mile pipeline linking gas fields in eastern Bolivia with the industrial heartland of southern Brazil. The project is regarded as a prototype for future joint ventures valued at $2 billion. **********Antonio Luiz de Menezes, Petrobras's project manager for the Bolivia-Brazil gas line, said United States companies had also been invited to bid next year on a second Brazilian gas line projected to run 375 miles within the Amazon basin. **********Oil exploration may be on the horizon. Betting that Brazilian legislators would approve a constitutional amendment next year to allow foreign joint ventures, executives and geologists from Amoco, Occidental Petroleum and Pennzoil traveled here for the petroleum congress. **********""I'm here to make contacts, to build up relationships,"" said Don B. Felio, director of new Latin American ventures for the Amoco Overseas Exploration Company. ""But there's a lot of competition for oil investment in South America. If Brazil decides it wants foreign investment, it will have to compete."" **********Steven Hopper, general manager of Pecten do Brasil, expressed optimism that exploration and production would be opened to foreign companies. ""There is not any doubt that the industry as a whole looks on Brazil as one of the plums in the world tree, up there alongside Russia,"" said Mr. Hopper, whose company operates a gas concession. **********Foreign companies are also benefiting from Brazilians' dissatisfaction with Petrobras's long monopoly. Of the seven countries where oil production is treated as a state monopoly, Brazil is the only importer, buying almost half its oil abroad. **********And with the nation's economy expected to grow 5 percent annually through the rest of the decade, Petrobras has no hope of making Brazil self-sufficient in the near future. Because offshore deposits make production expensive, Brazil would have to invest $13 billion a year to attain self-sufficiency by 2010. But with an exploration and new production budget of $3 billion this year, the company has been forced to shelve 270 expansion projects. **********Although Petrobras's international arm has operations in dozens of other countries, the company has a history of fighting foreign investment at home. And as Brazil's largest company, it can marshal immense resources -- 50,000 employees and annual revenue of $21 billion. **********In 1975, when Brazil briefly allowed foreign exploration contracts, Petrobras geologists allocated some of the least promising areas to the foreigners. After 35 companies had wasted millions of dollars drilling dry holes, Petrobras cried victory, claiming a 35 percent success rate in its own drilling operations. **********Last spring, when the Brazilian Congress was considering a proposal to allow exploration by foreign oil concerns, Petrobras responded by announcing four major discoveries of its own, flying legislators to its offshore platforms and spending an estimated $20 million to advertise itself as ""a Brazilian success story."" **********""Petrobras extorts money from the citizen, and then with this same money, convinces him that he should continue to be extorted,"" asserted Antonio Delfim Netto, a conservative Congressman from Sao Paulo. **********But with even sections of the left-wing Workers Party supporting relaxation of the oil monopoly, Petrobras's lobbying appears to have failed. Veja, Brazil's most influential news weekly, recently published a 10-page article attacking the company under the headline: ""Petrobras Is Afraid of Competition."" **********Representatives of United States companies that were hurt by contracts between 1975 and 1986 stressed that Brazil must now create more competitive conditions. The assignment of exploration acreage, they say, should be taken away from Petrobras, and joint ventures should allow foreign companies to work as operating partners, not limit them to financing operations for Petrobras. **********""It all depends on the geology and on the contracts,"" said the representative of an American company that lost millions in Brazilian dry holes in the early 1980's. ""There are a lot of other places in the world to invest in."""

Leader From Funeral,Gazans Eject P.L.O. Leader From Funeral," **********Gazans poured into the streets today for the funeral of an Islamic militant leader killed in a car bombing on Wednesday, accusing Israel of assassinating him but also venting their rage against Yasir Arafat. They denounced the leader of the new Palestinian Authority as a collaborator with the Israelis and shoved him out of a mosque as he tried to join the religious service. **********According to some reports, Mr. Arafat was treated so roughly by angry Muslims at the Omari Mosque in Gaza City that they knocked off his trademark head scarf. ""This is your peace, Arafat!"" people shouted at him. ""It's all liquidations and assassinations!"" **********Palestinian anger was also reflected in street protests that spread to East Jerusalem and several West Bank towns, including Nablus, where Israeli soldiers reportedly fired on rock-throwing demonstrators, wounding four. **********The incident put new strains on Mr. Arafat's leadership, already weakened by the Hamas violence in October that forced him into a precarious balancing act. Pushing him on one side is Israel with demands that he crack down on Islamic militants. Pulling him on the other are Palestinians who accuse him and his struggling self-rule government of having turned into Israel's lackeys. **********But all Palestinian groups, including Mr. Arafat's, were united today in accusing Israel of having planted the bomb that killed Hani Abed on Wednesday in the Gazan town of Khan Yunis. Officials of Islamic Holy War argued that the bomb was rigged so skillfully that it suggested an expertise found more readily among Israeli agents than Gazans. **********Israelis officials would not comment on the accusations. But they did nothing to discourage inferences that they were prepared to assassinate someone like Mr. Abed, 35, who was a leader of the Islamic Holy War group and had been suspected by Israel of having a hand in the shooting deaths of two Israeli soldiers in Gaza last May. **********At almost the same time that the bomb tore the Palestinian apart as he went to his car, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin spoke at a ceremony for fallen Israeli soldiers and warned that his forces would attack militant Islamic groups. **********""With one hand we are shaking the hand of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in peace, but with the other hand we are pulling the trigger in order to hurt the murderers of the Party of God, Hamas and Islamic Holy War,"" he said. **********A Rabin spokesman, Oded Ben-Ami, said today that those remarks were intended as a general warning to terrorists and not as a specific reference to the Abed killing. But Israeli officials have not denied, or confirmed, recent reports that the Prime Minister ordered ""hit squads"" to assassinate Islamic leaders, particularly from the Hamas group, to avenge the Oct. 19 bus bombing that killed 23 people in Tel Aviv. Hamas took responsibility for that attack as well as others in October. **********If Israel's leadership has decided on revenge, it would not be the first time. One by one, it tracked down 16 P.L.O. commanders held responsible for the hostage-taking that led to the deaths of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. All 16 are now dead. **********Uri Dromi, a Government spokesman, said, ""I think this region is becoming dangerous not only to the victims of terror but also to the perpetrators of terror."" **********That the familiar cycle of Middle Eastern violence would continue seemed almost assured as a leader of Islamic Holy War in Gaza, Sheik Abdallah al-Shami, warned that his group would take vengeance against targets in Tel Aviv. ""Rabin should prepare the coffins and the sorrow of the Israeli people,"" Sheik Shami said, standing near Mr. Abed's body while two followers held aloft automatic rifles. **********He also said that Mr. Arafat's police officers in Gaza would be targets, but later his group publicly apologized to the P.L.O. chairman for the ""irresponsible"" way he was treated at the funeral. **********Mr. Abed, who taught engineering in Khan Yunis, was also editor of a newly licensed newspaper that followed the Islamic Holy War line, which opposes any reconciliation with Israel. In May, after the shooting deaths of two Israeli soldiers near the Erez border crossing in Gaza, Mr. Abed was held by the Palestinian police for more than two weeks. They said it was to protect him from Israeli security forces out for revenge. **********The editor of another Gazan newspaper, Taher Shriteh, has been imprisoned by the Palestinian authorities for the last eight days along with his brother, Amr. No formal charges have been brought. **********But Mr. Shriteh, who also works for several foreign news organization, including The New York Times, was told that he had been arrested for supposedly distributing Hamas material. He says that he simply printed excerpts from a Hamas leaflet and passed them along also to Reuters and Agence France-Presse as part of his journalistic work."

Baltimore Has Seen the Future, and It Is Biotechnology"," **********THIS city characterized by blue collars and blue crabs is gambling billions of dollars that it can become as well known for biotechnology. **********Baltimore is working within a larger initiative by the State of Maryland to develop the region into a national powerhouse of biotechnology, and particularly marine biotechnology. **********While it is unlikely that Maryland will soon displace Silicon Valley or Boston as a biotechnology leader, several state agencies and private enterprises, including Johns Hopkins Institutions, have joined to make Maryland the nation's most active recruiter of biotech businesses. **********But Baltimore has more riding on biotechnology -- the science of engineering biology for commercial purposes -- than the rest of the state. The city's finances are eroding, as the young professionals who moved downtown in the late 1970's and early 1980's to renovate houses are packing up for the suburbs. With limited resources, the city is trying to build a new economic engine. **********Maryland isn't the first state to recognize the potential of biotechnology, nor is Baltimore the first city. California -- and San Francisco in particular, driven by Stanford University and the University of California -- has led the field for nearly 40 years. Boston's I-128 corridor has a host of hot ""bio-properties."" **********But Maryland has put together a coalition of sometime rivals to create what the state says is the most comprehensive recruiting effort in the country. ""Maryland is doing things it has picked up everywhere,"" said William H. Washecka, director of entrepreneurial services and high-technology for Ernst & Young in Vienna, Va. **********Baltimore's stab at biotechnology began about nine years ago, when Nova Pharmaceuticals, a drug developer, was spun off by a group of Hopkins researchers. The city's economic development leaders took notice, ordered studies and soon anointed biotechnology as the industry to revive the city and state. **********The secretary of Maryland's Department of Economic and Employment Development, Mark L. Wasserman, organized the state's education community, public and private sectors and acted as a liaison to the state legislature to build a large and diverse effort. ""The beauty of what is going on here is we have a lot of allies,"" Mr. Wasserman said, ""and we have so far had a minimum of pettiness and parochialism."" **********Maryland has a good foundation for biotechnology, with ample research laboratories from which to draw, including the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, the Federal Food and Drug Administration in Rockville, the United States Agriculture Department in Beltsville and the National Cancer Institute in Frederick. Baltimore boasts two prestigious institutions in Johns Hopkins Institutions the University of Maryland. **********While Baltimore is rich in researchers, it lacks investment funds. The state has set up a venture fund of $20 million to encourage entrepreneurs, but Baltimore competes with other communities in the state for a share of that money, which some critics say is too little to do any good. **********""To set up a government program with what I call a sprinkle and sprouting of dollars won't do anything to grow businesses,"" said Charles Newhall 3d, general partner in New Enterprise Associates, an early-stage venture capital firm in Baltimore. **********His solution is to commit 3 to 5 percent of the state's pension fund, or about $310 million, in high quality venture funds over 10 years as several other states have done. Maryland's economic development officials say it is a challenge to get a big financial commitment from the state's conservative pension-fund managers. **********Despite some sources of venture capital, investors are proceeding cautiously. ""I don't think it's a matter of money men saying, 'Let's invest in this region because it is under-invested,' "" said Mayo A. Shattuck 3d, president and chief operating officer of Alex. Brown & Sons, a prolific underwriter of initial public offerings in the life-science industry. ""It's a market-pull, not a cash-push situation."" **********The city is using cheap incubator space to entice entrepreneurs. ""We are in the 90's now, not in the early 70's, when we had a lot of Federal money to throw at projects,"" said Baltimore's Mayor, Kurt Schmoke. **********By some estimates, the city and its allies have set aside $2 billion to develop Baltimore the next 10 years. Johns Hopkins has invested $200 million in the Bayview Campus, a combined medical and research complex. **********The state has also spent $40 million to convert a downtown warehouse into the University of Maryland's Medical Biotechnology Center. **********The city and state have invested $47 million in the $100 million Columbus Center, the almost-completed marine biotechnology center, and the centerpiece of Baltimore's biotechnology push. The center will include a marine biotechnology research laboratory, a training operation, a maritime archeology department, and an exhibition hall to draw tourists from the nearby Inner Harbor. **********Private developers are also on the bandwagon. A former canning operation downtown is being converted into biotechnology space and already has a tenant, Osiris, which is developing drugs to promote regeneration of bone and cartilage, and is relocating to Baltimore from Cleveland. **********Baltimore and the area's competing county governments have also kicked in with tax incentives, offering new exemptions for property and machinery related to research and development. Baltimore City Community College and the University of Maryland at Baltimore are gearing up to train biotechnicians for the new laboratories the city hopes to attract. **********But industry observers say, those elements alone do not make a biotechnology power. ""I am somewhat skeptical of economic development activity,"" said Kenneth B. Lee Jr., national director of life-sciences industry services for Ernst & Young in Palo Alto, Calif. ""I think an incubator is a nice offer, but it is almost inconsequential in the life of a company. So they get free rent for a few months -- it takes hundreds of millions to get them to success."" For biotechnology to flourish, Mr. Lee said, the area needs venture capital, a technology source and an entrepreneurial work force. **********Recently there has been a shift to encourage entrepreneurs. At Johns Hopkins, a generous royalties scale was established, and the school created a system that allowed inventors to hold equity in companies that invested in their inventions, which had been forbidden by the university. The University of Maryland offers a richer royalty schedule than Johns Hopkins, but does not allow equity participation by its researchers. **********Baltimore hopes that its early successes will have a snowball effect.  Guilford Pharmaceutical, a spinoff of Nova that is developing diagnostics and therapeutics for neurological disease, raised $15 million through an initial public offering in June. Chesapeake Biological Laboratories is manufacturing sterile liquids for clinical trials."

As a result, few noticed the tiny telephone cards tucked into their official delegate packs. Printed as a promotional giveaway, the cards provided the delegates with $1 in free telephone service. Since $1 didn't go very far then - and travels even less now - most of the 20,000 cards found their way into New York City trash cans. Today, those $1 freebies sell for up to $1,400 among collectors. **********Telephone cards - small pieces of paper or plastic decorated with everything from historic monuments to soft porn images - have long been collected outside the United States. Of nearly 2.5 million collectors around the world, an estimated 1 million are in Japan. About 750,000 collectors are in Germany, where cards have been issued since 1983. Australia, Singapore and Britain are also collector hotspots. **********However, in the United States, where the first telephone cards sold to the public did not appear until the late 1980s, only a few thousand people have started phone card collections. **********One of the first U.S. collectors to discover the craze was Lin Overholt, a former math teacher living in Florida. Nearly two years ago, he placed an ad in a European magazine to trade old credit cards. In response to his ad, Overholt received over two dozen letters from around the world, including Italy, Hong Kong and the Seychelles Islands. ""I even got a call from a guy in the Caucasus,"" said Overholt. His monthly publication, Lin Overholt's Card Trader, now has subscribers in 25 countries. **********For most Americans, telephone cards are the numbered pieces of plastic issued by Baby Bells and long-distance companies. These cards allow traveling customers to bill calls to their home address. Outside the U.S., however, most telephone cards are so-called ""debit"" cards issued for specific amounts. Once the amount on a card has been used up, a new card must be bought. **********In most cases, the local telephone monopoly issues the cards and sometimes sells the face of the cards as advertising space. Alternatively, a telephone company may treat the cards like stamps, creating thematic designs such as aerospace or tropical plants. **********There are two types of telephone cards: stored memory cards and remote memory cards. The former, cards containing silicon chips, magnetic stripes or optical bands, must be inserted into a telephone in order to be used. Most cards produced in Europe and Asia are stored memory cards. **********In the United States, nearly 170 companies now issue telephone debit cards, according to Steve Hiscocks, publisher of International Telephone Cards, a bimonthly publication with subscribers in 65 countries. More than 90 percent of those cards are ""remote memory"" cards which do not need to be inserted into a telephone but do require the holder to dial an access number followed by an identification code. **********""There is some snobbery among collectors that stored memory cards are the real thing as compared to these bits of paper issued in the U.S.,"" said Mr. Hiscocks. ""But that'll change once remote memory cards start catching on outside the U.S."" Five companies have already started issuing such cards in the United Kingdom, he added. **********Though American phonecards have only recently entered into the collecting spotlight, most collectors say U.S. cards present some of the best deals available. A 10-year old German phone card can cost over $6,000. On the other hand, an AT&T card decorated with a hamburger, french fries and a soft drink that was initially given away by McDonald's can be had for $125 to $250. **********Among collectors, the value of the cards is not determined by the beauty of the design but rather by the rarity of the cards and their condition. ""A lot of times the cards issued on a trial run or limited basis are the ones that appreciate the most,"" says Chris Garibaldi, one of the leading U.S. telephone card dealers. ""Those are the cards that end up in the trash can fastest and so they become quite hard to find."" **********Cards from two of the first American companies to issue telephone cards, Phoneline U.S.A. and Amerivox, are now quite valuable. Early cards issued by Amerivox and decorated with an American eagle trade for $2,000 to $3,000. **********Cards issued on campuses, military bases and in prisons prior to 1990 are also of high value although they may be quite boring to look at. A set of 3 cards issued to inmates of Manning prison in Columbia, South Carolina, now trades for $200 although the cards have no graphic or design. **********In Germany, where over 70 million cards have been issued, few collectors can afford to buy samples of each card. As a result, most have moved into thematic or topical collecting. ""Any transport theme such as cars or airplanes is quite popular,"" said Hiscocks. ""The Japanese, on the other hand, have a strong tendency toward the cute. They tend to like bunny rabbits for some reason."""

Some family members have won a $1.47 billion jury verdict against five current directors and a former director of Amerco Inc., U-Haul's closely held parent company. **********The suit was brought by Samuel W. Shoen, a son of the company's founder, who in 1988 tried to take control of the company through an alliance with other family members. But a brother, Edward J. Shoen, blocked that effort through several board maneuvers. **********On Friday, an Arizona state jury ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Samuel W. Shoen said yesterday. He said the trial lasted seven weeks. **********Edward Shoen, one of the directors hit by the jury verdict, was also assessed with $70 million in punitive damages. **********""We are going to ask the judge to reduce the amount of the award,"" said Richard W. Schapiro, a lawyer for Amerco. ""The jury's verdict has nothing to do with reality, it is grossly exaggerated, and is unfair."" **********Mr. Schapiro said the award, which is supposed to compensate certain shareholders for the shares representing about half of the company in 1988, is worth more than the entire company. **********The $70 million punitive damage award against Edward Shoen will also be contested, Schapiro said. **********The verdict is the latest chapter in a feud that has split the family of Leonard S. Shoen, who founded the company more than 45 years ago. Leonard Shoen was ousted as chairman of Amerco in a boardroom coup orchestrated by a son, Edward J. Shoen, in 1986. Samuel Shoen left three months later. Leonard Shoen has 12 children. **********U-Haul rents trucks and trailers for moving, and self-storage equipment. **********According to the lawsuit, a stock issuance and other moves by the board to thwart Samuel Shoen's takeover bid rendered the plaintiffs' stock almost worthless. Worth $81.12 a share before the antitakeover actions, the stock plunged in value to 48 cents a share afterward. **********The jury calculated the damages based on the decrease in the shares' value."

At the same time, the army of the former government has regrouped and is preparing to mount another war. **********""The refugee population has been taken hostage by its former leaders,"" said Mario Goethals, director of Doctors Without Borders-Belgium, an aid group that led the fight against cholera in the camps last summer and still has a hundred doctors here. **********Relief groups are also hostages, he said, because to do anything requires working through the former leaders. **********The situation has reached the point where Doctors Without Borders and other nongovernmental organizations are thinking about pulling out. **********""Ethical problems are haunting N.G.O.'s at least as much as U.N.H.C.R.,"" Joel Boutroue, director of operations here for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said of his group and the nongovernmental organizations in a recent memorandum to the agency's headquarters in Geneva. ""The fact that we are indirectly assisting several thousand persons with a bloody past and eventually helping them to regain strength for future military activities is not a happy thought, but it is a fact."" **********""During the cold war, refugees were a political tool and ethical issues have not always been high on the agenda of the international community,"" Mr. Boutroue wrote. But given ""the seriousness of the charges against some segments of the population in the camps as well as the prospects of renewed military activities by these same elements,"" he said that the refugee agency was compelled to ""radically reconsider"" its programs. ""We may be better off withdrawing."" **********Relief groups often find themselves dealing with unsavory leaders. In Somalia, for example, the aid effort has sustained the various faction leaders, Mr. Goethals said. Rwanda Experience 'Morally Different' **********""What distinguishes this situation from others is that there was a genocide,"" he said. ""This makes it morally different. You ask yourself, are you going to continue supporting, indirectly, what happened in Rwanda? We didn't support the Nazi party after World War II."" **********""It doesn't have anything to do with politics,"" he said about the discussion among relief agencies about whether to withdraw. ""It's about ethics and morality, about the highest human values we have."" **********More than 70 nongovernmental relief organizations are now here. Every day, huge cargo planes roar in, laden with relief supplies paid for by taxpayers around the world. Trucks lumber along the asphalt road, hauling thousands of liters of water drawn from Lake Kivu, then chlorinated by the Japanese military contingent here. **********A volcanic-rock field just south of the camp at Kibumba, which contains nearly 200,000 refugees 17 miles north of Goma, has been stripped of foliage by bulldozers to make space for a huge warehouse operated by the International Federation of the Red Cross. Ten huge white tents -- each 30 feet wide, 75 feet long and 20 feet high -- are stacked with 4,000 tons of food and supplies, from beans to jerry cans. **********Up the road a mile, the federation operates a surgical field hospital, under the direction of a doctor from the Australian Red Cross. The chief surgeon is from the Swedish Red Cross, the operating theater is equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment donated by the Norwegian Red Cross, and its electricity is supplied by generators given by the German Red Cross. **********A refugee from Kigali, a professional, was astonished as he walked around the site. No hospital in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, is this modern, he said. Few in Africa are. **********There is also a medical center operated by Goal, an Irish relief agency, and a clinic staffed by the Association of Medical Doctors for Asia. **********At Katale, a sprawling camp for more than 200,000 refugees 36 miles north of Goma, has a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders-Holland and a medical clinic run by Care-Australia, in addition to a water system installed by the London-based development organization Oxfam that would be the envy of nearly every village in Africa. Nine squat circular tanks hold 800,000 liters of water, which is chlorinated before being sent into the camp through blue plastic pipes. **********Tons of food are distributed in the camps, on a regular basis. **********But food is not reaching those most in need, relief workers say. That is because the former Rwandan officials control the distribution ""in order to consolidate their power and to manipulate and dominate the camp population,"" according to the United Nations refugee agency. At Times, 'Free' Food Must Be Bought **********Diversion of supplies is common in relief operations, but not on the scale seen here. In every camp, men sit beside large piles of relief goods -- from bags of flour to stacks of blankets and cans of cooking oil -- with fists full of Rwandan bills. **********The United Nations has distributed a huge number of plastic sheets used for shelters -- more than the number of shelters. But one man sitting in his hut as the rain beat down said he had had to buy the plastic sheeting. And a few days ago, he said, he stood in line for salt but the supply ran out, so he had to buy salt for his family of seven. **********The relief groups have tried to set up independent refugee organizations to handle aid distribution. But that has been impossible, they say, because the militia threaten relief workers and the people they choose to work with. **********""We do not have at our disposal any means to hope that we will be able to change the present situation,"" Mr. Boutroue wrote. ""On the contrary, we are witnessing a clampdown by the ex-government forces on the various refugee organizations we have been trying to set up.""  Threats Prevent A Population Count **********The United Nations has been prevented from registering the refugees because of threats from former Rwandan leaders. **********There are probably 600,000 people here, relief workers say. But former Rwandan leaders insist that there are more than two million, partly because they want more aid to come in, and partly because they want to discredit the current Government of Rwanda, arguing that it cannot be considered legitimate if so many people live outside the country. **********A refugee who talks about going home risks being killed, refugees and relief workers say. At least 30 have been killed in recent weeks. **********""I can not even say that my mother lives in Kigali,"" said a 24-year-old woman who had been a university student, and who like many of the refugees finds her family split between the camps and Rwanda. ""I would be killed."" **********Mr. Goethals, of Doctors Without Borders, said: ""Everybody is looking at human rights in Rwanda. Nobody is looking at human rights here."" If human rights monitors were sent into the camps ""they would be killed,"" he added. Rumors of Deaths At Home Fuel Fears **********To keep the refugees in the camps, militia and former leaders spread rumors that people who have gone home have met gruesome deaths. **********Some fears about returning are clearly well founded. Refugees, particularly middle-class professionals from Kigali -- and there are thousands here -- are reluctant to go home because they have heard stories about houses in Kigali now being occupied by Tutsi, which is common. **********And there are frequent killings in rural areas. Antoine Bugingo, a 42-year-old peasant, said that in September soldiers came into his village near Ruhengeri and killed ""many people."" He said two of his brothers and two cousins were tied up and taken away. He hid and then fled to Zaire. **********Mr. Bugingo said his father-in-law had returned to Rwanda and had then been killed. He said he learned that from others who had returned to Rwanda and had since come back to the refugee camp. **********The killings in Mr. Bugingo's village may not reflect a pattern or a policy of intimidation by the new Rwandan Government, but the incident and the story fuel the message being spread by former leaders. **********Senior officials from the former government visit the camps regularly. Recently, the former Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, spoke in Kibumba. He told the refugees that the time to go home was drawing near. Saying that negotiations were not possible, he left no doubt that the refugees would be going home with their army. Army Kept Guns, And Is Regrouping **********The former army, after its humiliating defeat, has regrouped and soldiers, who are still being paid, have resumed training in forest areas off limits to journalists and relief workers. And they have their weapons. **********Some of the soldiers live with their families about 10 miles west of Goma in the camp at Mugunga, where they receive aid from relief groups. Others live in the bush. They are not helped directly, but because they are stronger than the refugee populations, and armed, they have no trouble getting food. **********When the relief agencies talk about withdrawing, they wrestle with the reality that their withdrawal would deprive some needy refugees of assistance. **********""There are definite risks"" in withdrawing, wrote Mr. Boutroue, of the United Nations High Commissioner's office. ""But we are presently in a situation which will become increasingly untenable from a political, humanitarian and ethical point of view."""

Operating income for Philip Morris rose 14 percent, to $2.7 billion, on revenues of $16.4 billion, a figure that was 4 percent higher than the comparable quarter last year. **********""Given all that the company has been through, the positive picture is a surprise,"" said Roy D. Burry, an analyst who follows Philip Morris for Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********He referred to concerns over Philip Morris's potential legal liability for the health problems of smokers, fears of increased regulations and excise taxes, all of which have driven down the company's stock. Investors have pushed the company to consider splitting in two so that its other units, including food and brewery operations, would not suffer from tobacco's problems. **********In May, directors tabled that proposal, and last month, Michael A. Miles, the chief executive and chairman who was believed to have endorsed it, resigned. Taking over were two longtime tobacco executives, R. William Murray, the new chairman, and Geoffrey C. Bible, the new president and chief executive. **********The positive earnings report may give Mr. Murray and Mr. Bible a lift the next time they meet with the company's large institutional shareholders, many of whom continue to press for a corporate firewall around the company's tobacco operations. A meeting was scheduled for today, but was postponed after Philip Morris could not assure the shareholders that directors who are not part of the company's management would be able to attend. No new date has been set. **********Despite the positive earnings report, shares of Philip Morris fell 75 cents yesterday, to $53.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. ""I think that continuing concern about litigation, especially the proliferation of state law suits, is restraining the stock,"" said Diana K. Temple, an analyst who follows the company for Salomon Brothers. **********Quarterly operating income was at its highest level since the company, in an attempt to regain market share, set off a price war in April 1993 by slashing prices. It cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes, its leading brand, by 40 percent, and also reduced prices on its other premium brands. **********Citing figures from the A. C. Nielsen Company, the company said yesterday that the retail share for Marlboro Cigarettes reached 28.5 percent, an increase of 6.5 points from March 1993, before the company began its Marlboro price cuts. ""That is the highest share Marlboro has ever had,"" Ms. Temple said. **********Philip Morris's other premium brands, as a group, posted a retail share of 9.1 percent, up from a low of 8.3 percent in August 1993, when the company realigned its wholesale list prices. **********International tobacco sales grew in the second quarter as well, with revenues advancing 6.8 percent, to $4.3 billion, and with operating income climbing 19.2 percent, to $688 million. Volume was up 16.3 percent over a year ago, to 128 billion units. **********""International is the crown jewel in Philip Morris,"" Ms. Temple of Salomon Brothers said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/13/world/rebels-in-mexico-spurn-peace-plan-from-government.html,Tim Golden,1994-06-13,,1123,,The New York Times,World,News,article,REBELS IN MEXICO SPURN PEACE PLAN FROM GOVERNMENT,REBELS IN MEXICO SPURN PEACE PLAN FROM GOVERNMENT," **********After three months of consideration, peasant rebels in the southern state of Chiapas have flatly rejected the peace settlement offered by the Government and have called for new negotiations. **********The decision, announced late Saturday night in sharply worded communiques, appeared to dash Mexico's hopes for a final agreement ending the Chiapas uprising, which is now suspended under a cease-fire, before national elections on Aug. 21. Tensions immediately rose throughout the state. **********Leaders of the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army said that unless they were attacked, they would not break the cease-fire, which their forces and the Mexican Army have observed since Jan. 12. Nor, the insurgents said, would they disrupt the voting for a new president, governor and federal and state legislators. **********But in rejecting the peace settlement largely on the grounds that the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had refused to assure a democratic process, the Zapatistas also clearly heightened the prospect of serious conflict if they and other opposition groups find the elections to be less than free and fair. **********""Disgracefully, the historic blindness of the supreme Government has kept it from seeing that its refusal to cede to the drive for democratization will lead the country to a painful confrontation of consequences that cannot be foreseen,"" the guerrillas' general command warned. **********After a day of urgent meetings with his negotiator for the Chiapas conflict and other senior aides, President Salinas issued a statement emphasizing ""the determination of the Government to continue promoting peace through a political solution to the conflict."" **********The statement said Mr. Salinas had instructed the military to continue observing the cease-fire, while trying to prevent the smuggling of weapons into the region. The negotiator, Manuel Camacho Solis, said the Government would also proceed with social and public-works programs that it promised in the draft agreement, but only in Chiapas communities outside the conflict zones. **********Under the settlement that it proposed on March 2, after 10 days of talks with masked rebel leaders, the Government made an offer that was widely viewed as generous in its response to the deep economic and social inequities of the region. But it was also seen as unyielding in its refusal to link national political changes to the rebels' demands. **********The rebels have called for an end to the backwardness that has defined Chiapas in the country's economic geography, and the Government answered this with promises to give support to impoverished farmers, build roads and schools and create new industries and job-retraining programs. It also agreed to continue the redistribution of land in the state, even though it had declared an end to such measures two years ago. **********In response to the Zapatistas' complaints of discrimination against the Mayan peoples who comprise most of their supporters, the Government offered new laws to expand the rights and insure the protection of Mexican Indians. For Chiapas alone, where a long history of coercion and fraud have kept the ruling party in power, Mr. Salinas agreed to make the state's political and legal systems more democratic. Districts Redrawn **********The state congress has already redrawn legislative districts and taken a few other steps to slightly increase Indian representation and reduce the governing party's influence in the organization of local elections. **********What the Salinas administration said it could never negotiate directly with armed guerrillas, however, were their demands for political changes at the national level to assure more democratic elections. **********Prompted by the sudden appearance of the rebel movement just as Mexico entered triumphantly into the North American Free Trade Agreement on Jan. 1, the Government has negotiated with the two main opposition parties to produce the most significant democratic reforms of Mr. Salinas's administration. Protests Could Resume **********Those changes have included a wider role for election observers, putting the federal election agency under the control of nonpartisan citizens and imposing stricter limits on campaign financing and spending. But the changes have satisfied neither the Zapatistas nor some of the most important figures on the political left, and this has increased the possibility of protests or more serious unrest if the governing party retains its 65-year hold on power. **********""The electoral reform was, by all accounts, incomplete,"" the Zapatista leadership asserted in one of the four communiques it issued. ""The system of a one-party state must be destroyed."" **********The insurgents said their rejection of the Government's proposal was decided by a series of votes by the mostly Indian peasant communities that support them in the Chiapas highlands and the Lacandon rain forest. After village consultations, from which journalists were almost entirely barred, the rebel leaders said only 2.11 percent of their supporters voted for the proposed settlement, while 97.88 percent voted against. They said almost nothing, however, about how the vote was conducted or how many people had taken part. **********In many interviews in Chiapas this year, peasants who joined the insurgency have generally spoken of their decision to take up arms as the result of desperation, because the poverty and mistreatment they experienced had grown intolerable as the richest Mexicans steadily grew richer. **********Yet in rejecting the settlement, the rebel leaders focused many of their complaints on national political issues like the voter rolls, which they asserted would permit the Government to commit ""electronic fraud"" in the August elections. Without a fuller democracy, the Zapatista leaders have argued, any solution to their more specific demands can only be partial and temporary. **********The Zapatistas' criticism resonated in part because it came only days after the country's leading leftist presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, began to reiterate his earlier insistence that a huge fraud was in the works. **********While Mr. Cardenas's Democratic Revolution Party joined the negotiations that produced most of the national reforms, he has appeared to distance himself from them as he has fallen to third place in public opinion polls, behind Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon of the governing party and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party. **********Concerned about the volatility of the situation, the politically ambitious Government negotiator, Mr. Camacho, has begun meeting with a diverse group of politicians in an effort to form some kind of nonpartisan front to assure fair elections and avoid violence afterward. **********The Zapatista leadership appeared to give Mr. Camacho a face-saving way to leave the negotiations, praising his efforts and declaring the first stage of the insurgents' dialogue with the Government at an end.

With unemployment at 8 percent, city leaders plainly feel they can no longer afford to look gift horses in the mouth. **********""Ten years or so ago the nationalists didn't want any more foreigners in Geneva, but they are not so self-confident any more,"" said Liesle Graz, a Swiss writer and journalist. ""There are empty shops in Geneva these days. That's something new."" **********So with a rare but desirable creature promising to arrive on the shores of Lake Geneva, the Swiss authorities are doing everything they can to make it welcome. **********At the start of next year, the Secretariat to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has managed world trade for the last 47 years, will be transformed into the bigger World Trade Organization. The new organization will have hundreds of well-paid international civil servants with lifetime job security. **********Two years ago Geneva and Vienna lost out to The Hague in a fight for an international inspectorate to enforce the chemical-weapons ban. Last year Geneva lost out to New York for theagency that will monitor compliance with environmental goals set at a meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. **********Last year the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to move its headquarters back from Vienna. But Vienna has tried to persuade OPEC to change its mind, offering a magnificent 18th-century palace to replace its undistinguished office building. **********Now the Swiss Government is negotiating to try to insure that the World Trade Organization will remain in the vast stone building the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade occupies on Lake Geneva's shore. **********Peter Sutherland, the director general of GATT, insists that ""the negotiations are real and the outcome not preordained."" **********Arthur Dunkel, the previous head of GATT and a Swiss, agreed, saying, ""It's good to remind the Swiss that nothing is forever."" Mr. Dunkel has just created a group that lobbies for changes to keep the city attractive to international organizations. **********Financially, the stakes are high. Geneva is host to 15 United Nations institutions as well as to other international groups. **********Here are gleaming aluminum and glass fortresses for the World Health Organization and the International Labor Organization, a silvered concave tower for the World Intellectual Property Organization and a new green and brown tiled building that will soon be home to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but is already too small. **********Their combined payroll last year was more than 25,000, and the Geneva Statistical Office estimates they spent $2 billion in the local economy, providing 10 percent of regional income. They organize 1,500 international meetings, which attracted more than 81,000 delegates last year. **********All the same, ambiguities remain in Switzerland's attitude. It still refuses to join the United Nations. **********But whenever Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali needs it, Switzerland lends him a private jet, free of charge. **********And Geneva agreed recently to appoint a special commissioner to help all these organizations resolve their problems. Vladimir F. Petrovsky, a former Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and the senior United Nations official in Geneva, appreciates the change.

""The mercenaries thought they had cleared the area by bombarding the shore before they landed, but we took cover and picked as many of them off as we could until the army came."" **********The rest was easy, Mr. Alvarez said, caressing his bronze medal of honor and puffing a filterless cigarette as he spoke. ""Once our army got its defense mobilized, it was fast work,"" he said. ""We had 20,000 soldiers on the ground the next day, with tanks and planes. There was no way we could lose."" **********The ranks of those who witnessed the first confrontation between the Kennedy Administration and the young Government of Fidel Castro are thinning, but the sleepy seaside town that Washington targeted for its invasion still serves as a sort of living museum of Cuba's testy relationship with its powerful neighbor. And the animosity between Cuba and the United States continues to shape the life of the town. **********Soon after the attack, the town's valor was rewarded with several blocks of modern low-rise apartment buildings. Roads were improved and houses wired for electricity and telephones. There were also new schools, and for the first time adequate health care. Castro Still Visits **********For years afterward, residents say, Mr. Castro would visit the area to fish, stopping to talk with the people, reinforcing their pride in having lived one of the most famous chapters of Cuban history. **********The 66-year-old leader still comes to the area, residents say, but nowadays he confines himself to a secluded vacation spot clear across the broad coral-lined Bay of Pigs. **********Hotel workers complain that the leader's attachment to the bay has led to a prohibition against boating in the surrounding waters, a measure taken for security. But the grumblers forget that the growth of the local hotel industry -- now by far the biggest employer -- is another spinoff of the town's history. **********Even before the doomed attack by 1,500 Cuban exiles, Mr. Castro had planned for Playa Giron to be a ""workers' resort,"" a place where exemplary state employees would be rewarded with beach vacations. **********But as Cuba's integration into the Soviet bloc consolidated, the simple concrete bungalows put up along the beach here came to be used more to reward other kinds of workers: Russians, Czechs and others escaping the Eastern-bloc winters. The cachet of the town's history only reinforced the resort's appeal. **********Nowadays, the only souvenirs remaining of this Eastern presence are the boxy Russian short-wave radios in each room, which were presumably used to keep up with the news on Radio Moscow. Hotel receptionists and bellboys practice their rusty French and English instead of Russian. Westerners Now Come **********With the Soviet bloc gone, Playa Giron has been given over to Western tourists on a modest budget, the Canadians and Germans and French whose hard currencies have eased some of the town's seediness and have even given it a feeling of flushness. **********Although Americans are not forbidden to travel to Cuba, Treasury Department regulations that were imposed as part of a 33-year-old United States embargo of the island prohibit most Americans from spending money in this country, thus restricting travel. **********With hard-currency tips to be earned and other revenue flowing in, from the prostitutes who dance with tourists during the hotel's salsa act each night to the handicraft vendors, the town seems free of much of the grind that permeates life in Havana. **********""This was the most backward area of the country before the revolution,"" said Miguel Beltran, a 20-year-old student and one of several residents who stopped to speak to a foreign visitor. ""We have something to show for our efforts at least."" **********Despite this positive outlook, the standard of living of Western tourists and the privileges accorded them have brought new resentments here, as they have elsewhere in Cuba. **********""If a foreigner dies in an accident with us, it's at least two years of prison, automatically,"" a hotel worker said, laughing wryly at an example he gave of how a strapped Government's quest for dollars had subverted its values. ""If a Cuban dies, nothing happens. Zero."" Pondering the Embargo **********But if the residents feel some resentment toward the tourists, many also scratch their heads over how the bitterness between Cuba and the United States has somehow managed to outlive the cold war. Even with their history, they think it is time to end the embargo. **********""With our Soviet partners, we became used to having a little of everything,"" said Boris Daniel, a 22-year-old engineering student. ""Eighty percent of our trade was with the socialist bloc. We need new partners and yet the Americans continue to squeeze us."" **********Ramon Lopez, a 32-year-old economist who was riding in a horse-drawn carriage, a popular mode of transportation because of the shortage of gasoline, said: ""We are trying to build lives for ourselves, but all this time we have been blockaded. We have never hurt your country and we don't understand why."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/27/business/mutual-funds-sifting-fact-from-fiction-on-taxes.html,Carole Gould,1994-03-27,,960,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Mutual Funds; Sifting Fact From Fiction on Taxes,Mutual Funds; Sifting Fact From Fiction on Taxes," **********MANY mutual fund investors probably will be surprised by the amount of taxable income their tax-free bond funds produced in 1993. The reason: higher bond prices last year caused by falling interest rates created capital gains for fund shareholders. The average national municipal bond fund paid 16.03 cents a share in taxable income last year, according to Morningstar Inc. **********Here are more tax myths that fund investors should watch out for: *********** Myth: ""Ordinary dividends"" reported on Form 1099 for bond funds should equal the total dividends paid by the fund in the year. Dividends noted on statements throughout the year cover only a fund's income. But on Form 1099 the ""ordinary dividends"" category also includes any short-term capital gains (earned from securities held by the fund for one year or less), which many funds had last year because of falling interest rates. Long-term gains are reported separately. *********** Myth: Retirees who receive Social Security benefits can rely on municipal bond funds for tax-free income. In reality, too much tax-free income backfires because 50 percent of Social Security benefits become taxable when tax-free income plus half of Social Security benefits plus other income exceeds $32,000 for married couples, $25,000 for individuals. For 1994, a second bracket has been added, so that 85 percent of Social Security benefits will be taxable when the formula amount exceeds $44,000 for married couples or $34,000 for singles. *********** Myth: Foreign tax credits are not available to investors in international funds. Many investors who put their money in overseas funds last year will receive a Form 1099 reporting foreign taxes paid by the fund on income from foreign securities. Investors may receive either a credit for those taxes, that is, a dollar-for-dollar offset against their 1993 taxes, or deduct the amount on Schedule A of Form 1040. The credit is generally worth more, said Fred W. Haas, a tax partner with Coopers & Lybrand in Baltimore, but the forms used to claim it are cumbersome. *********** Myth: People who have owned fund shares for a year or less have no long-term capital gain income. The holding period is based on the amount of time the fund has owned the securities, not how long investors have held their shares. *********** Myth: Income paid by national muni funds is free of Federal taxes only. National funds buy issues of many states; income paid by a particular state's issue is free of state and local taxes for residents of that state.  The fund company should report this information to you in a tax information letter. *********** Myth: You owe no taxes when you switch money among funds in the same ""family."" Many fund companies let investors switch among the stock, bond and money market funds in their group by telephone. Because it's so easy, many people don't realize that telephone switches are really taxable sales. The Internal Revenue Service says that you sold shares in the first fund and then invested the proceeds in the second, and taxes are owed on any gains. *********** Myth: Dividends paid by Treasury funds are fully taxable. Dividends on Treasury issues are subject to Federal taxes, but not state and local taxes, though New York, New Jersey, California and Connecticut deny the tax break unless a fixed percentage of the fund is in Treasury securities. *********** Myth: Tax-free bond funds make sense only for people in the highest tax bracket. Because tax brackets have been creeping up, more people are better off in tax-free muni bond funds. To figure the equivalent taxable yield of such a fund, divide its yield by 1 minus your bracket. For example, the yield of the average national tax-free bond fund was 4.34 percent in February. That equals an equivalent taxable yield of 6.29 percent for investors in the 31 percent bracket -- 4.34 percent divided by 0.69 (1 minus 0.31) -- or 6.78 percent in the 36 percent bracket. *********** Myth: Reinvested dividends are not taxable. Taxes are owed on dividends in the year paid, even though you receive no cash from the fund. Because of this, investors who do not keep meticulous records pay taxes twice: first in the year when dividends are paid, and then again when the shares are sold. To avoid double-paying, add all dividends and capital gains distributions to your ""cost basis,"" generally the amount you paid for the shares.  When you sell shares, any gain is calculated by subtracting your cost basis from the sales proceeds, so increasing the basis reduces the gain and therefore the amount of taxes owed. *********** Myth: The method used by fund companies to compute your taxable gain is always best. Some companies will figure the gain or loss when you sell shares, but you may be better off doing it yourself, Mr. Haas said. Most fund companies use the ""average cost"" method to calculate a gain or loss, figuring your basis in each share by dividing the total cost of all the shares held by the number of shares owned. But if you bought shares in a fund at various times and paid different prices, you can trim your taxes by selling the highest-priced shares first. **********To do so, you must be able to identify on the sales confirmation the purchase date, or dates, of the shares being sold. When you buy shares, therefore, note the date, total amount paid, price per share and number of shares in each transaction. Keep all statements that detail purchases and redemptions. **********If you don't figure your taxes in those ways, you must assume the shares you sold were the first ones acquired."

The market had advanced 2.6 percent between May 31 and Monday. **********Late yesterday, the Treasury's 30-year bond was down 12/32 of a point, or $3.75 per $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.26 percent, from 7.21 percent on Monday. **********The bond market's promising outlook derives mostly from evidence that the economy is not growing fast enough to generate a surge in inflation, traders and money managers said. **********""People are more comfortable with the inflation scenario, more comfortable with the idea of a slowdown in demand"" in consumer spending, Mr. Feezer said. Late Selloff in Dollar Helps **********A late selloff in the dollar helped push bonds lower. The dollar fell 1.12 Japanese yen, to 104.17 yen, after the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said the United States was prepared to use trade laws to force Japan to open its markets. That threat caught many currency traders off guard, since it contrasted sharply with what had seemed a more conciliatory American stance toward Japan in recent weeks. **********The dollar's decline in turn unnerved bond traders. ""Ultimately, a weaker dollar is inflationary,"" said William Shea, head United States bond trader at the Nikko Securities Company International. **********The two-year Treasury note's yield was unchanged at 5.76 percent. The note yielded 150 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, less than the 30-year bond, up four basis points from Monday. **********As evidence mounts that the economy's growth rate is slowing, Treasury bond yields could fall to 7 percent or lower by the second half of the year, investors said. **********""I figure the inflation rate won't be as onerous as people think it will be,"" said Warren Schmalenberger, director of fixed-income investments at Transamerica Fund Management, a Houston firm with $2.25 billion in bond mutual funds. ""I am optimistic on bonds. I think that yields are going to come down."" **********The Federal Reserve has raised the rate on overnight bank lending rates four times this year. Now the central bank is inclined to watch how much growth slows, Mr. Schmalenberger said. ""I think they pause here for the foreseeable future,"" he said. **********So long as the Fed is not raising rates, bond yields are likely to fall, he said. **********Meantime, inflation is not likely to accelerate because the Fed -- and the bond market -- will not let it, Mr. Schmalenberger said. This built-in brake on inflation will help drive yields down. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds. **********""When you have a Fed that is concerned, and a market that's concerned, they will raise rates to where the economy slows"" and inflation subsides, Mr. Schmalenberger said. **********So far this year, 30-year Treasury bond yields have fluctuated between 7.66 percent, an 18-month high, and 6.30 percent, set before the Fed began raising rates in February. The record low yield is 5.77 percent, reached on Oct. 15. **********Meantime, there is little evidence that the inflation rate is about to accelerate. Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months ended in April, down from 2.7 percent last year. Some Traders Still Bearish **********Still, some traders remain bearish on the bond market. ""Another two and a half points up doesn't change the trend,"" said Chris Madell, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. The four-day rally amounts to ""false euphoria in a bear market, which is not to say we can't go higher near term."" **********But, he added, ""I don't trust this thing for one second. I could be wrong, but if it's over, it will be one of the shortest bear markets in history."" **********Treasury bonds began falling in Asia in tandem with a rout in Japanese bonds. Declines there later spread to European bond markets. **********Japanese Government bonds plunged as much as one point amid press reports that the Bank of Japan will end its monthlong policy of keeping money rates near historic lows. A Bank of Japan official denied the reports. **********British bonds also fell one point amid expectations that European economies are rebounding. **********Among other Treasury securities, the three-month bill fell two basis points to a discount rate of 4.11 percent. The six-month bill fell four basis points to a discount rate of 4.47 percent. And the one-year bill fell one basis point, to a discount rate of 4.86 percent. **********The yield on three-year note rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent. The yield on the five-year note rose to 6.51 percent from 6.49 percent. And the yield on the 10-year note rose to 6.94 percent from 6.90 percent."

The outside of the year-old shop is designed to look like a castle, with gold-tipped turrets and a marble entryway, and inside the dogs are treated like royalty. **********""I think it would be lovely to have real children someday, but I cannot believe that I will love children as much,"" said Mrs. Wu, 30, who has a high-paying job in a Shanghai cargo company and has adopted a Western first name. **********Once seen here only as a source of food, dogs are the newest status symbol in China, one more sign of this country's embrace of capitalism and the things that money can buy. **********A recent Government survey found that 6 of 10 city dwellers in China already have a television set, a refrigerator and a washing machine. For many newly affluent urban families, a pet dog comes next on the list. **********Nowhere are dogs more of a passion than in Shanghai, a metropolis of 13 million people that is China's biggest, richest and most cosmopolitan city. With the opening up of the economy, Shanghai has reclaimed its role as the country's financial capital. **********But the enthusiasm of Shanghai's dog owners is not shared by the old-line Communists who still run this city, who will tell you that some of the ""running dogs of capitalist imperialism"" have two legs, while others have four. **********Pet dogs are not just ""naughty"" in the eyes of municipal officials -- as in the name of that pet shop -- most of them are illegal. In July, the city announced plans to capture and kill as many unlicensed dogs as the police could hunt down. **********""We have trapped several hundred dogs over the last few weeks,"" said Xu Wei Qu, senior veterinarian with the Shanghai Municipal Center of Veterinary Medicine. ""People are becoming rich and they want to keep dogs as a way of showing off. But they do not know how to care for these pets."" **********The city estimates that Shanghai has 100,000 dogs. But only 3,700 have licenses, available only to the handful of dog owners who can prove that they have a large home and tolerant neighbors, and have vaccinated their dogs against rabies. **********Dr. Xu said the city had begun this summer's anti-dog campaign mainly out of fear of a rabies epidemic. After more than 30 years without a recorded case of rabies, he said, Shanghai saw the disease return in 1992. Last year two people died after bites from rabid dogs. **********China's Communist leaders have always gone easier on cats, mostly because they are much less of a drain on the food supply -- and, like dogs, are sometimes used as food themselves. There is no licensing requirement. **********But dogs have never fared well in this city or anywhere else in modern China. After the Communists took control of the country in 1949, pet dogs were banned as a symbol of decadence, a criminal extravagance at a time of food shortages. If they were good for anything, they were good for dinner. Dog meat remains a common dish in China and in a number of other Asian countries, including South Korea and Vietnam. **********The dog-hating pronouncements are still seen in the Government-controlled press. ""China is still very poor,"" the Guangming Daily newspaper said last month. ""There is no reason for us to spend such a lot of money on dogs."" Dogs, it said, ""bring great stress to social order and stability."" (Never mind that the country's supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, is known to dote on his own pet dogs.) **********The police may be tough on dogs here -- in Shanghai, captured dogs are usually carted away in cages, later to be used in medical experiments and then killed -- but they are downright brutal in the capital, Beijing. **********There, dogs are beaten to death on the spot, often as their owners watch, by police officers wielding long metal poles. Beijing's dogcatchers are known as da gou dui -- ""dog-beating teams."" **********The thought of such savagery sends chills through the customers wandering the aisles of the Naughty Dog shop, where they come to choose among brands of imported Australian pet food ($15 for a four-pound bag), Japanese-made dog shampoo ($10 a bottle) and chew-toys in the shape of baby bottles. **********The shop, a joint venture between Taiwanese and Chinese investors, sells dogs from air-conditioned cages along one wall. The purebreds are imported from Taiwan and include a $2,000 Yorkshire terrier and a $1,500 French poodle, its tail and ears dyed lavender. Those prices would represent more than a year's income for most Chinese workers. **********""We can special-order larger dogs like German shepherds,"" said the manager, Zhu Shunwei, 22. ""It only takes a month for delivery."" **********Mr. Zhu is trying hard to drum up business, which has fallen sharply because of the city's dog roundup. ""People will become very angry if their pets are taken away,"" he warned. **********Yang Bing, a 26-year-old computer technician who did not want to give her full name because she wants to protect her pet, was shopping for a present for Didi, a small, pug-nosed dog of undetermined breed that she bought three months ago for $180, equivalent to two months' salary. **********""I used to walk the dog every day, but now it is too dangerous because the police might see her,"" said Miss Yang, who is having trouble sleeping at night as she plots Didi's escape from Shanghai. ""If they come after my dog, I will try to get her to my friends in the countryside, where she will be safe. I will not let them hurt my Didi."""

In the perverse financial world, no good news goes unpunished. The markets hate job numbers that are too strong, because they're afraid the inflation bells will go off -- though no one's actually seen any inflation -- and the Federal Reserve will clamp down again. So on Friday's surprising report that unemployment fell to 6.4 percent and 267,000 payroll jobs were added in April (to top it off, without the truckers' strike that would have been 73,000 higher), the stock and bond markets went into mourning. The Dow industrials, off more than 50 at one point, lost 26, while 30-year Treasury bond yields hit 7.54 percent, an 18-month high. . . . Even as the job numbers soar, though, there are dark spots: New York State has lost 97,000 jobs in 12 months, a worse performance even than California. And last week Digital Equipment said it would cut at least 20,000 more jobs. **********The Noisy Month of May  A silent spring? Not a chance. As nature bursts blissfully forth, gardeners brace for attack, their deafening arsenal -- lawn mowers, weed bashers, leaf blowers, you name it -- gassed up and ready. But noise pollution is just the beginning. While car emissions are scrutinized, garden tools spew far more filth, creating fully 10 percent of air pollution, the E.P.A. says. Mowing for an hour matches the pollution caused by driving 11 1/2 hours. So last week the E.P.A. said it will regulate garden-tool emissions. But it didn't mention one clean, silent, forgotten alternative: the reel mower. How does it run? You push it. 'Healthy,' Redefined  For many, food-buying is a constant struggle between healthy foods and high-salt, high-fat siren calls. And some food packagers seemingly offer the best of both worlds by slapping words like ""healthy"" on all sorts of things. No more. Last week the F.D.A. and the Agriculture Department said that from now on ""healthy"" on a label must mean healthy inside. Products must be low in fat and low in salt, and have certain redeeming vitamins. An industry lobbying group says the rule is too restrictive because, say, green beans do not meet the vitamin threshold. But wouldn't it be silly to put ""healthy"" labels on beans? Shopping for Dollars  Governments and currency speculators have very different wish lists. Governments want things nice and steady, otherwise trade gets distorted. A strong dollar makes American goods too costly abroad, while a strong mark makes German goods too costly here. But speculators like movement: then they can roll their dice and -- with all their fancy strategies -- score big if they bet right. Speculators have been betting heavily against the dollar lately -- perhaps because they thought President Clinton wouldn't act to support it -- and their bets have helped batter the dollar. But last week Washington and its allies decided it was enough and, in the biggest intervention in the currency markets in nearly two years, 16 nations went on a dollar shopping spree, propping it up for the moment. The question is, Will speculators be scared into reverse -- or will they simply take a breather?  Auto Sales Hit Cruising Speed  When sales surged 19.7 percent in March, auto makers worried that their recovery was so dazzling it would burn out -- that no buyers would be left. They prefer steady growth, a foundation for lasting good times. That's just what they got in April, as the most recent figures showed a far more modest 4.9 percent rise. What cooled things off? Higher interest rates, probably -- but also, many dealers simply didn't have enough cars and trucks to sell. The buyers -- or, as one analyst described them, ""close to six million units of pent-up demand waiting to be satisfied"" -- are still out there, to keep this recovery purring. COMPANIES Drug Makers Face Reality  Even without health reform, drug makers are racing to adjust to new realities. One new reality: the spread of ""managed care"" andhealth plans that buy vast quantities of drugs at discount. Managed-care drug companies could control 80 percent of the market in five years. So to keep from being left behind, drug giants are climbing aboard. Just last week SmithKline Beecham agreed to buy Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a discount-drug marketer, and Pfizer and Value Health said they'd create a managed-care unit.  I.B.M., at Your Service  I.B.M. has set itself a reasonable goal: make a decent profit. But the way it's always done so, making computers, provides only scant returns these days. So last week it had a new idea: It will, in effect, try to turn its vast marketing force into consultants, experts who can give clients just what they need, including software and tailor-made plans, not just sell them machines. Marketers will be divided by industry, not by which machine they sell. A Low-Voltage Send-Off  It was a moment that could have marked the beginning of an era: a leading auto maker saying it would mass-produce an electric vehicle. But when Chrysler announced plans for its electric mini-vans last week, it did so as if it had already given up on selling them. It said it would build the mini-van to comply with a California law requiring such vehicles by 1998 but said its range was so short, and its price would be so high, that few people would buy it. But now, at least, electric vehicles have a foot -- well, a battery -- in the door.  A Death at Tenneco  Michael Walsh could handle simple matters like turning Tenneco around, but not brain cancer. In February, after a long battle, he stepped aside. Last week he died at 51. At Kodak, Less Is Sharper  George M. C. Fisher knew he had to get hopping. He's Kodak's chairman now only because his predecessor was ousted for not cutting costs fast enough. His plan: pare Kodak to the basics. Last week he said he'd sell just about everything but pictures: the drug unit Sterling Winthrop, plus household products and medical testing businesses. It'll be a far smaller company, with revenues more like $13 billion than $20 billion. Southwest: On Its Own  No matter how much pressure the industry's heavies put on Southwest Airlines, it refuses to play by their rules -- and this upstart has become the nation's most profitable airline. For one thing, it has refused to pay fees to be listed on the big computer reservation systems, and last week rival carriers moved toward deleting Southwest from those systems. Southwest's response was typical of its I'll-take-you-all-on approach. It simply started its own computer system. Pretty soon, American et al. may clamor to be listed there. Jett Wants His Money  Joseph Jett wants his money. Kidder, Peabody dismissed him as its top government bond trader, saying he'd created $350 million in fake profits to inflate his $9 million bonus, and froze nearly $5 million Mr. Jett had in a Kidder account. But last week, ""vehemently"" denying wrongdoing, Mr. Jett went to court to try to dislodge that money. So what about that $350 million? Mr. Jett may say supervisors knew what he was doing. But if those profits were fiction, how could his pay -- presumably a cut of those profits -- be treated as fact? INTERNATIONAL If Ribbons Count, Yes, It's Open  In a sense, the Channel Tunnel is here. Opening ceremonies were held last week, complete with heads of state cutting ribbons. The huge project, intoned the Queen, rejoins ""what nature separated some 40 million years ago."" It was fitting that she took the long view, for the tunnel was supposed to open a year ago, and its cost, at $15 billion, is nearly twice the original budget -- and counting. And, ribbons aside, it's still not open: Shuttles for trucks? In a few days, maybe. Passenger trains and car shuttles? This summer, maybe -- for special guests. Regular service? With luck, this fall. And where do investors stand? Don't ask. Vietnam Comes Calling  Unlikely as it may sound, Vietnam wants Americans back. It badly needs rebuilding and foreign investment, and it is wary of getting it only from Asian neighbors. Last week, a delegation from Ho Chi Minh City was here in search of investors, the first such expedition since the American trade embargo was lifted in February. But if it gets any nibbles, all sides must be patient. The two nations have no diplomatic relations yet, and Vietnam is not likely to get most-favored-nation status, which brings low tariffs, for a couple of years."

The directors of these mutual savings units have often used them to obtain large blocks of free stock and stock options for themselves. **********Savings and loan executives and some state regulators have defended these arrangements as appropriate rewards for executives who have run their institutions well. But Clinton Administration officials and many members of Congress have called for new restrictions. **********The proposed guidelines issued today by the F.D.I.C. were broadly worded and set no specific limits on compensation for insiders. The independent agency set a 60-day period for public comment on how detailed the final guidelines should be and whether they should be issued at all. **********Eugene A. Ludwig, a senior Treasury Department official who sits on the F.D.I.C.'s board, said that the agency's first draft ""would permit insiders to continue unjustly appropriating the value of mutual savings banks when they convert to stock ownership."" He cited a small mutual savings and loan in Wisconsin that plans to deplete its capital base -- while continuing to comply with minimum capital standards -- by providing free stock to its managers as a reward for their long service. **********But Mr. Ludwig voted for issuing the proposed guidelines, saying he hoped the public comments could be used to draft better final guidelines. **********Representative Stephen L. Neal, a North Carolina Democrat who is pushing legislation this year to cap executive compensation in these deals, was also dubious of the initial F.D.I.C. proposal. ""It doesn't sound like they've done anything,"" he said in an interview this afternoon."

Lehman's derivatives revenue tripled last year to $399 million, 11 percent of its total revenue. Mr. Rulle's equity derivatives unit represented about 20 percent of its derivatives revenue. **********""Lehman is in the second half of the top dozen derivatives dealers globally,"" said Paul B. Spraos, publisher of Swaps Monitor, a newsletter on derivatives. The Canadian bank has been a major provider of derivatives relating to the Canadian dollar, but has had a smaller presence in other markets.  A Field of Growing Attention **********Derivatives are a rapidly growing category of instrument that have values that are linked to -- or derived from -- the prices of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Corporations often use them to protect against rises in interest rates or raw material costs. **********Investors use derivatives as substitutes for owning securities or to hedge the risks of their portfolios. A typical equity derivative would be an option that gives investors a cash payment if a stock market index rises but limits the loss if the market falls. **********Derivatives are among the most profitable product lines for banks and brokerage firms. But their growth in the United States has paused somewhat, as a handful of large corporations disclosed losses from speculative contracts and several bills to increase derivatives regulation have been introduced in Congress. **********Jim Beqaj, executive vice president of C.I.B.C., said that the controversy did not reduce the bank's commitment to building its derivatives business. **********""I don't think derivatives are a boom,"" he said. ""There is a secular shift as customers move out of traditional financing and investment instruments into other vehicles."" Building a Trading Presence **********C.I.B.C., the second-largest bank in Canada behind the Royal Bank of Canada and the seventh-largest in North America, decided earlier this year to merge its commercial lending business with its Wood Gundy investment banking subsidiary. It has already hired several senior traders to form a proprietary trading operation that will invest the bank's own money. And it expects to hire executives to underwrite junk bonds and securities backed by financial assets such as consumer loans, Mr. Beqaj said. **********Mr. Rulle plans to hire 50 to 60 derivatives traders and salespeople in the next year, mainly in New York. Initially, the bank will focus on selling more derivative products to its existing Canadian customers, he said. **********Mr. Rulle ran Lehman's entire derivatives business from 1990 to 1992, but in 1992 his responsibilities were narrowed to managing just the company's equity deratives unit. **********Joining Mr. Rulle will be four other Lehman executives: Bruce Berger will head trading and risk management; Eric Claus will run transaction development; Frank Gelardin will head marketing, and Jeff Seltzer will oversee legal and regulatory matters. **********Lehman said its business would be unaffected, adding that on an interim basis, Donald Crooks and Gene Abrams, two top equity executives, would oversee equity derivatives. Lehman's fixed-income derivatives department continues to be run by Craig Schiffer."

It is led by many younger people, like Frances MacEachen, 28, editor of a new Gaelic-English newspaper here. **********Ms. MacEachen's vehicle is Am Braighe. The Gaelic words mean ""higher ground,"" a name she chose because she hopes the paper will move Cape Breton's Gaelic culture there and because most of the immigrants in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were from the hillside Braes or higher ground of Lochaber, a district of the Highlands. **********Back then in Scotland, thousands of the poor -- including her great-great-great-great-grandfather -- had been effectively cleared from their tenant farms by landlords who earned more money raising sheep than collecting the small rents. Their culture was passed on in the New World from generation to generation -- until the era of television and much speedier assimilation. **********""I was caught between two cultures and afraid the old one would die,"" said Ms. MacEachen, the youngest of seven children born into a traditional Gaelic household a few miles away in Port Hood. Her year-old quarterly newspaper has a press run of 8,000 and readers as far away as New Zealand. **********Because only some 1,000 Gaelic speakers are left in Nova Scotia, most of the tabloid-sized journal is written in English. **********Still there are chunky sections in Gaelic, including some movie reviews, old-timers' stories and reflections, and a Gaelic learners' section with vocabulary and exercises. It shows, for example, that the word for fiddler is am fidhlear. Advertisers promote Gaelic-English dictionaries, fiddlers' and singers' tapes and albums, genealogical research and walking tours of Scotland. **********Ms. MacEachen, who founded the newspaper with a brother, Ron, who manages advertising and marketing, does the page layouts in the tiny kitchen of her mobile home on Route 19 between the Esso station and MacMillan's general store. **********""It's pretty much a kitchen operation -- close to the stove where I can get a cup of tea, but sometimes the door of the refrigerator gets in the way."" **********Bernadette Campbell, 35, is another of the younger people in the area rediscovering their Celtic origins. She operates a Gaelic Cultural summer day camp for children and writes a column and takes photographs for Am Braighe. **********Prof. Kenneth E. Nilsen, who holds the chair in Gaelic studies at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, said the trend was apparent at the university. **********""Our enrollments are going up every year to the point where we now have over 100 students in Celtic studies,"" he said. In the early 1980's, there were only 10 to 20. **********It is also seen in the resurgence of fiddle music and the dances and songs that go with it. One local group of singers and fiddlers, the Rankin Family, hauled in four trophies in March at the Juno awards, the annual awards from the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. **********""The native Gaelic speakers, mostly in the older generation, have a tremendous repertory of Gaelic folklore and songs, and it seems that this combination of spoken Gaelic, folklore, playing the fiddle with abandon and now the newspaper are feeding off each other,"" Professor Nilsen said. **********The boom is bringing financial success as well. Young fiddlers are increasingly in demand for parties and festivals here, whirling out tunes with names like ""Cregnish Hills,"" ""Miss Lyall's Reel,"" ""Mason's Apron"" and ""High Road to Linton."" **********""We're booked every weekend this summer,"" said Rodney MacDonald, 22, who performs in pubs and dance halls with his first cousin, Glenn Graham, 20. They learned staccato bowing and other fiddle techniques from their uncle, Kinnon Beaton, a celebrated fiddler. **********Jackie Dunn, 25, another local fiddler, has a degree in music but she said she was sure she started hearing the fiddle when she was in her mother's womb. ""I guess I liked it,"" she said. ""They never had to force me to learn the violin."" **********The revival has been spurred by a constant flow of people between Cape Breton and Scotland, where the British Government is spending millions of pounds each year on Gaelic arts, cultural tourism, education and broadcasting. **********Ms. MacEachen said the idea for her paper began taking shape as she was traveling in the small communities of the Outer Hebrides, where she saw the revival of Gaelic language and culture working as an instrument for economic development. **********She hopes that will happen here, where unemployment is high and youth has been moving away. **********""Not too many years ago our people were discouraged from speaking Gaelic,"" she said. ""It was called gibberish. Now it's a real source of pride."""

Yeltsin to order a halt to the fighting immediately and to resume talks with Chechen leaders. **********For the first time since the 40,000 Russian troops entered Chechnya, France and Britain expressed concern over the growing violence. The United States has held to the view that the conflict is an internal Russian matter. The international organization Human Rights Watch/ Helsinki criticized President Clinton on Thursday for his silence over Russia's tactics. **********With Russian television news showing film from Grozny of dead bodies, burned-out apartment buildings and weeping civilians, the military incursion described by the Kremlin as a police action has begun to look like all-out war. **********Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, the President of predominantly Muslim Chechnya, urged citizens to undertake a holy war against the Russians and appealed to neighboring regions to come to their aid. **********Reports from Grozny said residents continued to flee despite the Russian report that it was encircled. **********Mr. Yeltsin, who has been recovering from minor surgery and out of sight since ordering Russian troops to Chechnya, was described by aides as working on an address to be delivered Saturday to the nation about his plans to settle the conflict, though they could not say whether he would deliver it himself. **********Some of the President's top advisers are sounding increasingly defensive on Mr. Yeltsin's behalf. **********While on an official visit to India, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said that the air force was bombing only strategic targets, and that he discounted reports of high civilian losses. Reports from Grozny said that at least 24 people were killed in Thursday's air raids, and dozens more were reported to have died in today's bombing attacks. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin said attacks in Chechnya were being conducted ""only against military equipment and those facilities from which fire is maintained."" He added: ""I think there are not many casualties among civilians. That is just idle talk."" **********Sergei A. Kovalyov, a former dissident who heads the parliamentary commission on human rights, remained in Grozny today, where he has been trying to keep his own count of civilian casualties. He recently sent a message to the United Nations, complaining about Russian human rights violations. **********Two days after praising Mr. Kovalyov, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev today denounced him for appealing to the United Nations without checking with the Kremlin. **********The Russian Government, rattled by widespread and unusually public dissension in military ranks, was under additional pressure today after an American freelance photographer, Cynthia Elbaum, was killed in Thursday's air raids. **********The British Foreign Office urged Moscow to prevent further bloodshed and protect human rights in Chechnya. The French Government appealed to Moscow to insure the safety of foreign nationals and journalists working there. **********The Russian Foreign Ministry said today that it ""deeply regretted"" the photographer's death and urged all reporters to leave combat zones. **********The Russian Government has not given its estimates of civilian casualties in Chechnya, but after days of silence, it released its figures for the death toll among its own soldiers. Deputy Prime Minister Oleg N. Soskovets said that 24 Russian Army soldiers and 20 Interior Ministry troops had been killed and that 116 had been wounded. **********Mr. Yeltsin sent hundreds of tanks and 40,000 troops into Chechnya on Dec. 11 to end the oil-rich three-year-old bid for independence. Russia justified its intervention on the grounds of national unity and its need to restore order. **********But the Russian public does not appear to share the Kremlin's view. A survey of 1,600 Russians published in the newspaper Izvestia showed that only 30 percent said they favored ""decisive measures"" in Chechnya. Thirty-six percent said they favored a peaceful resolution, and 23 percent said Russia should withdraw its troops.                    --------------------       Chechens Clog Roads **********GROZNY, Russia, Dec. 23 (AP) -- Throngs of Chechens clogged the roads out of Grozny today despite reports that Russian troops had surrounded the capital. **********Thick clouds of black smoke billowed over the city, and the thunder of artillery roared ever nearer. Doctors short on medicine and equipment struggled to tend the wounded. **********Russian troops were seen advancing on Grozny from the west and the south, and the Russian military claimed its ground forces had encircled the capital, although the main road out of the city to the east was open during the day today. **********Chechen forces reportedly staged guerrilla attacks on Russian units to the northwest, and Chechen fighters were said to have repelled a Russian tank attack near the town of Argun, six miles east of Grozny. **********In graveyards around the city, Chechens held funeral services for victims of the fighting. On the edge of Grozny, about 30 men stood in a snow-covered cemetery holding hands in prayer as they buried Ruslan Pashayev, 23, whose body was wrapped in a white sheet and a carpet and lay on a stretcher. **********During the funeral, a Russian plane flew low overhead, dropping a bomb that exploded with a crack and a flash a few hundred yards away."

They have mock elections and focus groups. They have a strategy group to cope with surprises and a briefing committee to keep the candidates in sync. They have a slogan that is almost generic: ""Now Is the Time."" They have Nelson Mandela sun visors. **********On paper, the African National Congress campaign is a juggernaut, the very model of a modern vote-harvesting machine. **********But they also have thousands of children toting guns. They have squatter-camp warlords and tribal enclaves. They have local leaders who think ""on time"" means within 90 minutes of the dot. They have the Communist Party for a partner and redbaiters for opponents. They have a few million voters who don't believe a ballot is secret. They have Winnie Mandela. **********On the ground, the 16 weeks until South Africa's first free elections promise to be, despite the best labors of the attending professionals, a spectacle of amateurs, a festival of loose cannons and late starts, with violent outbursts of intolerance and charming moments of unintended candor. Little Suspense on Outcome **********So far, there is little suspense about the outcome. All polls predict a decisive A.N.C. victory. But the campaign will be a running test of that organization's metamorphosis from a liberation movement to a political party and ultimately a Government. **********""The A.N.C. is trying to make the most modern political machine in South African history,"" said one foreigner close to the campaign. ""But they're going upstream, against their own traditions."" **********The congress begins the campaign brimming with confidence. **********Popo Molefe, the chief campaign coordinator, said in an interview this week that the goal is not just victory but 67 percent of the new Parliament, enough to enable the winning party to rewrite the constitution without cutting deals. Uphill Battle for 'Colored' Vote **********In the elections for nine provincial legislatures, the congress has a clearly uphill battle in only one: in the Western Cape, where the large mixed-race population known here as ""coloreds"" favors President F. W. de Klerk's National Party because they fear being washed aside in a tide of black affirmative action. **********As its main roadshow attraction, the campaign has already tested small town meetings that feature Mr. Mandela alongside a panel of other congress leaders. The tactic shrewdly spreads the spotlight to lesser known figures and spares the 75-year-old patriarch of the liberation movement, the campaign asset extraordinaire, the exhaustion of answering all the questions. **********But the African National Congress is not Nelson Mandela, as he learned himself upon emerging from prison in 1990. Expecting to find the autocratic organization he left behind, he instead discovered a fractious democracy of local barons, street committees and civic associations, of youth groups, women's groups and labor groups, all sweet-talked into union by constant negotiations. **********Among the likely stars of the campaign are militants who have never proven easy to script. Winnie Mandela an Issue **********Foremost among them is Mr. Mandela's estranged wife, Winnie, who retains a passionate following among the rank and file and has a taste for hectoring the A.N.C. leadership as soft and elitist. **********Despite her conviction in the kidnapping of a Soweto boy who later turned up murdered, Mrs. Mandela last month campaigned her way to the presidency of the congress's Women's League. **********Unless the congress changes its own rules, Mrs. Mandela is barred from its list of parliamentary candidates by her conviction of a non-political crime, but her position in the Women's League automatically makes her a campaign stalwart. **********""I think she understands that discipline is necessary in an election campaign,"" Mr. Molefe gamely predicted. In any case, he added, while she alarms many whites she is beloved among blacks. **********""It's important that in organizing the campaign we should not be influenced by white perceptions,"" he said. ""We have one percent of the white vote. Most whites are seeking out white parties. They can't therefore define the nature and content of our campaign."" Threat of Old Hatreds **********The most serious threat to a smooth campaign is the crackle of violent hates: the township vigilantes and partisan wars, the areas off-limits to rival campaigns, the racial hit squads from the white and black fringes, and the constant but unspoken worry of assassination. **********Mr. Mandela contends the violence hurts his organization worst, because many in the black townships regard the A.N.C. as an instigator of it. From this he concludes, he told reporters today, that Mr. de Klerk has deliberately failed to police township violence, hoping terrorized blacks will abandon the congress. **********The de Klerk team dismisses this as campaign cynicism, but it makes no secret of its plan to target the A.N.C. for rough punishment during the campaign. Fringe Challenge Dismissed **********In an interview this week, Olaus van Zyl, executive director of the National Party, virtually dismissed the potential challenge from the Inkatha Freedom Party and right-wing white parties, which are still contemplating whether they will take part in the election. **********Except for the most militant nationalists, he said, whites will soon determine they have no other home but the National Party. **********""We can get 60 percent of the whites, 70 percent of the coloreds, say 60 percent of the Indian vote,"" he said. ""Those are realistic."" **********And so the party's best prospecting ground for additional support is among the anticipated 16 million black voters, he said. Looking for Undecided Blacks **********Although Mr. van Zyl's latest poll shows only 4 percent of blacks likely to vote for the party -- compared with 66 percent committed already to the A.N.C. -- his hopes rest on a large undecided vote that includes many blacks who say they are open-minded about Mr. de Klerk. **********""If we had to have an election today, certainly the A.N.C. would win it,"" he said. ""But this is something new. We've never had this election before."" **********Among blacks, according to the poll, the National Party has a higher positive rating and much lower negatives than Inkatha, a Zulu-based party that blacks by an overwhelming majority consider an agent of violence. (While 16 percent of blacks polled said they rejected the National Party ""completely and on principle,"" 71 percent said that about Inkatha.) **********In pursuit of black votes the party has commissioned studies of elections in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia and Kenya. The party's main outside consultant, Satchi and Satchi -- best known to Americans for British Airways and Tide detergent ads -- ran President Daniel arap Moi's re-election campaign in Kenya. **********The message of all the research is clear, Mr. van Zyl said. **********""Our main opponent is the A.N.C.,"" he said. ""By far the biggest amount of our energy and actions will be directed against the A.N.C. If we are successful against the A.N.C., we will automatically win support from the right as well."" Theme of Attack **********The theme of the attack has already emerged in Mr. de Klerk's early campaign speeches: the National Party has renewed itself by abandoning apartheid, while the African National Congress is still a liberation movement, the organization that rendered townships ""ungovernable,"" unleashed local ""self-defense units"" that now terrorize innocents and disrupted the economy with strikes, boycotts and international trade sanctions. **********""We've found many of the black people are up to here with intimidation, and we use that,"" Mr. van Zyl said. ""We say, 'If they tell you when to stay away from work and when you can go to school and when to boycott and when you must come to a meeting, just think what they will do with you if they're in government.' "" **********Whatever blacks think of the National Party, it is a message that scores with many. That is why the African National Congress, almost as strenuously as the National Party, will be underscoring how much it has changed. **********And it is why Mr. Mandela, speaking today on the 82d anniversary of the founding of his organization, hit a theme hardly customary for a party basking in triumph over white rule: **********""Our message,"" Mr. Mandela said, ""is that we should forget the past."""

It's now clear that the institution, and the view of the world that went with it, are fast going out of fashion. **********The reasons are simple. The bulk of the G7 -- that is Western Europe and Japan -- is in an economic trough deep enough to preclude rapid recovery in 1994 or even 1995. Areas of growth and real economic opportunity increasingly lie in Latin America and Asia outside Japan. **********The United States, the one major Western nation showing fairly robust growth, has already drawn its conclusions. The Clinton Administration shifted America's traditional foreign policy focus in 1993, southward to Mexico through the North American Free Trade Agreement and eastward to the Pacific through a summit meeting of the 15-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. **********These trends will continue in 1994. They will offer businesses and investors who are not risk-averse, opportunities in Asia, particularly China, and in Latin America; and they will provide cynics with more evidence of the growing supremacy of trade interests in global diplomacy. **********One in every six Boeings built is now bought by China: President Clinton will, therefore, probably find a way to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status in June, despite qualms about human rights. Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti do not buy many jets or semiconductors: They will be quietly forgotten if possible. **********The policy is known as economic security -- that is harnessing America's diplomacy to the creation of jobs and turning a blind eye to certain wars. It's a significant shift, and the implications are just beginning to unfold. **********One is already clear: No major economic or political initiatives are to be expected in Eastern Europe, where fudging will remain the order of the day, as wary eyes are fixed on Russia. That is bad news for Western Europe, still struggling to emerge from recession and desperately needing a spur from its under-developed eastern hinterland. **********Growth of no more than 1 percent in Western Europe is to be expected in 1994, and that thanks only to Britain, where growth will reach 2.5 percent. Soaring unemployment and the growing cost of the welfare state seem likely to penalize the rest of Europe. ""These are going to be the nasty nineties for Europe,"" said Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez. ""From a European point of view, the United States looks like an economic paradise."" **********If Europe needs solace for its doldrums, it should look to Japan. The nation that had seemed unstoppable in the late 1980's now looks as vulnerable and unpredictable as its Nikkei stock market index. The price of wild over-confidence in stock market and property speculation is being paid. **********Deep adjustments seem necessary. They include some modification of Japanese companies' traditional commitment to lifetime employment and tax cuts to spur consumer spending and perhaps demand for American goods. But these changes will take time. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts growth of 0.5 percent for Japan in 1994. The yen may have to depreciate to spur a recovery, but that will be resisted in Washington, where the view is that Japan should import more and use a strong yen to do so. **********Alan Stoga, the managing director of Kissinger Associates said, ""The big risk in the world economy in 1994 is Japan. The machine is no longer working, and its markets look increasingly fragile. A significant collapse cannot be ruled out."" **********The Asian mantle has been taken up by China, with 1.2 billion potential customers, a double-digit growth rate and a seemingly irrevocable embrace of a market economy that has business people from Detroit to Dusseldorf excited, despite the severe illness of Deng Xiaoping. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany went to Beijing in November and came back with contracts worth $4 billion. In the airline industry alone, China needs 40 aircraft a year for the next two decades: That is manna from heaven for Boeing, Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas. **********David D. Glass, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, foresees the day when Chinese people will feel as at home in Wal-Mart stores as Americans. To realize such ambitions foreign corporations will have to overcome the distrust of outsiders that is deep-rooted in a 4,000-year-old society and still fed by the rhetoric of a closed political system. **********Outside China, growth and investment prospects still look strong in the rest of Asia, although after an 80 percent gain in these equity markets in 1993 in dollar terms, some correction may be due. **********Similar forces will continue to push money into Latin America, where the economies of Chile, Argentina, Peru and Mexico are beginning to reap the benefits of market reform. Capital flowed out of Latin America in the 1980's, but is now returning. The North American Free Trade Agreement has tied not just Mexico, but by optimistic implication the whole area, to the United States. **********""Even after gains of 45 percent in 1993 in dollar terms, the outlook is very attractive, and stocks in Latin America remain cheaper than in Asian markets,"" said Jay Pelosky, director of Latin American strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. There are risks, and elections in Brazil and Mexico in 1994, but Chile's elections suggest that market reform can, in the end, be popular. **********If, however, Latin American and other emerging markets look too volatile, the United States' economy -- with a predicted 1994 growth rate of over 3 percent -- is worth pondering. Although Wall Street has had a long bull market, growth with low inflation is likely to mean continued low interest rates -- and that's good for shares. ""The U.S. is the bright spot in the world economy,"" said Mr. Potts of Banque Indosuez. **********So, President Clinton should be able to hold his head high when he arrives at the G7 summit in Naples in July. If he's ready to take account of economic reality, he might suggest an expansion to a G11 -- adding, say, Mexico, Brazil, China and, to keep President Boris Yeltsin happy, Russia. **********What used to be called North-South trade, and might now be better termed inter-developmental symbiosis, has become the crucial issue for growth. The symbiosis is between the cheap labor and fast-growing markets of the ""South"" and the technology and new job-creating exports of the ""North."" Such an expansion of the G7 would take account of America's new doctrine of economic security, which entails directing foreign policy less to such traditional partners as NATO and more to the developing nations growing fast enough to create jobs and wealth in America."

Nanny Tax Lets Poor Pay, Rich Profit"," **********AMID their partisan bickering last month, Republicans and Democrats took time out to congratulate themselves for a piece of work well done. ""A pleasant effort to correct the egregious wrong"" done to taxpayers, said Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., an Indiana Democrat. A chance ""to make the lives of many hard-working Americans a little bit simpler,"" said Representative Jim McCrery, a Louisiana Republican. **********What was all this bipartisan sweetness and light? None other than the so-called Zoe Baird bill, signed by President Clinton three weeks ago and retroactive to Jan. 1. But far from achieving ""justice, fairness, civility,"" as Mr. Jacobs said, the ""nanny tax"" law is a Scrooge-like act that leaves the most vulnerable Americans out in the cold. **********For one, the new law works a surprising switch. Remember the outrage in 1993 at the news that Ms. Baird and other prominent politicians had not paid Social Security taxes for maids, nannies or other domestic workers? Amid reports that only 25 percent of household employers followed the tax rules, few doubted that Congress would soon stop such wholesale wrongdoing against low-paid employees. **********But in fact, the new measure does not help workers. It helps their privileged employers! **********Parts of the new law make sense. Employers can now pay the Social Security taxes annually, and on their own income-tax returns, instead of making special quarterly filings. And the law also excludes students under 18, thus relieving employers from its strictures for youngsters who baby-sit or mow the lawn. **********But Congress also quintupled the law's wage threshold -- from $50 a quarter to $1,000 a year. This is a shameful tax break for wealthy citizens, one that will reduce the Social Security benefits of those who clean their houses and care for their children. The numbers are vast. Hundreds of thousands of workers will be deprived of disability insurance and old-age pension credits, say the actuaries at the Social Security Administration. **********Under the old law, both employers and household workers had to pay a tax, now set at 7.65 percent each, when workers earned $50 or more a quarter. These payments gave workers the right to Social Security benefits. **********By raising excluded income to $1,000 a year, the new law deprives household workers of Social Security's protections for all lesser sums. And the $1,000 is a minimum. In the future, it will be adjusted for inflation in $100 increments. **********This is bad enough. But the nature of household work worsens the effect. For while the law calculates the $1,000 separately for each employer, tens of thousands of full-time employees work only one day every two weeks, or a half-day every week, for the same family. With workers commonly earning $4.25 to $5 an hour, many will fall short of the $1,000 threshold for each of several or many employers. As far as the Social Security Administration is concerned, all that hard work and income will have disappeared. **********INSTEAD of raising excluded income to $1,000, Congress should have lowered it to $1. Other workers enjoy first-dollar Social Security coverage. Why shouldn't domestic workers? **********Some people may suspect that domestic workers themselves favor the new law over the old, perhaps wishing to minimize their Social Security payments. This idea is misguided. Avoiding Social Security payments is shortsighted, especially for domestic workers; the lowest-paid are most in need of Social Security. **********But misguided or not, worker preferences played no role in the law. Baldly put, the new nanny tax penalizes household workers as a favor to their wealthy employers -- whose annual incomes may be 10 or even 100 times as great. For Congress to know this, and then to parade this measure as a step to benefit ""hard-working Americans,"" is scandalous. **********With this statute, Congress wanted in part to avoid the embarrassment of massive violations of the tax law. But to increase compliance by kicking the neediest workers out of Social Security makes as much sense as to reduce the homicide rate by decriminalizing the killing of poor minority women."

But it was clear that for most of those who went to Canada, the healing process was completed long ago. **********""It doesn't make any sense to maintain animosities just for the sake of revenge or harboring past hatreds,"" Mr. Nagler said.

Canadian media attention and political energy were drawn into American issues. Canadians started going on marches to Alabama and demonstrating here against the war in Vietnam. **********""There was a big injection of radical political thinking that almost overwhelmed the Canadian left,"" said Prof. Stephen Clarkson, a Canadian-born student of the era at the University of Toronto.

Mass Evacuations Opposed **********As a matter of policy, the United Nations refugee-relief agency has opposed arranging mass evacuations because it does not want to be perceived as abetting the Serbian effort to drive out Muslims and Croats. Tens of thousands more Muslims and Croats live in other Serbian-held towns in the northwestern area, known generally as the Banja Luka region, and United Nations officials fear an evacuation of Prijedor could lead to an exodus from the region. **********""In general we think these people should be taken out,"" Mr. Janowski said, in a reference to the Muslim and Croats of Prijedor. ""But I don't think there is a plan. **********""Both Muslims and Croats are desperate and asking that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees take them out of Prijedor,"" Mr. Janowski said. ""More violence cannot be ruled out."" **********He said that about 25 Muslims, ""totally terrified,"" had taken refuge in the headquarters of a local Islamic charity organization and that some Muslim neighborhoods of Prijedor seemed to be entirely deserted. ""The guess is that the population fled to other safer neighborhoods where there are fewer Serbs,"" he said. Limited Evacuations **********Some 55,000 Serbs live in the Prijedor area, where nationalist Serbs carried out mass killings of Muslims and put thousands of others in concentration camps in May and June 1992. **********Under the limited evacuation operation introduced last August, the Red Cross takes the refugees by bus to the Croatian border. United Nations refugee-relief workers then transport them to camps and arrange for their passage to other countries. **********A Red Cross representative here said tonight that a decision to evacuate members of minority groups from Prijedor could be taken in two days if the killings continue. ""We are making our interventions with the different parties,"" said Robert Monin, the head of the Red Cross mission in central Bosnia. **********Mr. Janowski said that efforts to get people out of western Bosnia had been hampered by a reluctance of third countries to take them in. Attacks on Gorazde **********Sarajevo radio reported fresh Serbian infantry and shelling attacks on Gorazde today. The report said that 15 people had been killed and more than 60 wounded in the besieged eastern pocket since the latest wave of Serbian attacks began Tuesday. **********Fighting was also reported around Maglaj, where the Bosnian Army has been attacking Serbian positions. **********Mr. Janowski said the recent deaths of six Serbian policemen from Prijedor on a battlefront near the industrial city of Doboj apparently set off the killings. **********""The bodies of the policemen were returned to Prijedor two or three days ago,"" Mr. Janowski said.

No easy task for a network delivering information on demand through 500 television channels. **********Who really wants that much? How would someone at the end of a terminal choose what he wanted anyway? Or is this cliché just a bunch of hype? Answers are beginning to emerge, and the cross- cultural linkups are nothing ever seen before. **********Whatever shape it takes, the the system will be broader than France's successful Minitel, which probably will go down in history as a commercial pioneer in interactive communications. But the Minitel appears to have both the logic and the limits of a long, straight French route nationale, offering computer access to users for everything from train schedules to off-color conversations but essentially a service to provide information from data banks or, at most, a link to another interlocutor. **********Its impetus is largely public, as befits a child of a European state phone monopoly, while the U.S. version grows out of interactive private pleasures, notably computer games played by phone. Ensuring that the network can access libraries and reaches schools is a priority of the current administration. **********Multidimensional if experimental networks are already being being organized in America. Silicon Valley's hometown paper, the San Jose Mercury- News in California, is offering articles on demand to network subscribers. Time Warner Inc. has wired up a section of New York City with 150 channels as a straightforward experiment in communications technology, while ironing the bugs out of another center to serve 4,000 households in Orlando, Florida, with a data bank containing the equivalent of 500 movies, which up to 1,000 subscribers will be able to call to their home screens. **********In the Saguenay region of Quebec, a consortium of five companies is planning cabled access next year for 34,000 Canadian households to tap bank accounts, order from shopping catalogues, see movies on demand, make individual computer linkups, and even play the provincial lottery. The sponsors have very little idea whether the customers really want all these services by wire in their homes, and this is a marketing test to find out. **********Several dozen of the most advanced brains and the deepest business pockets gathered recently for an annual conference on such questions, organized by the show-business newspaper Variety and by Wertheim, Schroeder & Co. Wertheim, Schroeder is one of the increasing number of Wall Street investment houses with expertise in the field of what Reed Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, called the global information infrastructure. **********They agreed on only one thing: The highway is coming, and any business that refuses to admit it faces bankruptcy. The convergence of technology is already under way in telecommunications, warned Raymond W. Smith of Bell Atlantic Corp., who is searching for smaller deals following the failure of his company's proposed merger with Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable television company in the United States. **********Mr. Smith's model was the already familiar integration in offices everywhere of the telephone, the fax machine, the computer, and the office copier, ""which will merge into one system,"" he predicted, along with the companies that now produce them. **********In due course, he said the combination of fiberoptics, microprocessors, digital switches and video will become a similar seamless web known as the information superhighway - and the companies providing these elements will have to cement their business relationships in just the same way Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. swallowed up their suppliers or converted them into commercial vassals. **********Whether telephone or cable companies will emerge as the common carrier is an open question. Mr. Smith said phone companies had unmatched expertise in switching, billing, and delivering to individual consumers - or ""eyeballs"" as they are known in the cable trade. Gerard M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner, argued that the phone company's classic pairs of copper wires ""just can't cut it"" in carrying video signals, and that cable therefore would lead the way. **********But both agreed that, as Mr. Levin put it, ""content is king."" Taking up that theme, Mr. Smith predicted that ""the brand-name purveyors of information will drive the system"" because viewers tend to stay with the familiar and tested names. **********New ideas also produce new words. With the arrival of cable, broadcasting yielded to ""narrowcasting"" some time ago to describe the specialized news, sports, entertainment, educational and other specialty channels on cable in America. Interactive television will be something called ""point-casting,"" important to advertisers because they will be able to focus their messages on individual users who have chosen material from an advertiser's marketing area. **********Other panelists suggested such things as combining airline reservation networks in travel agents' offices with videos of the world's 1,000 leading vacation destinations so customers could choose their destinations at the point of sale. Experience suggests, however, that everyone is in for surprises. BellSouth Corp. offered doctors channels to link them with with specialists for interactive diagnosis and discovered that the physicians really wanted news on the latest developments in their field from science, government, and finance. **********But surfing across 500 channels offers no quick fix, so how will all this video on demand actually reach the consumer without drowning him? Some kind of editor armed with a computer program will probably have to operate in tandem with the network switchgear, matching each viewer's subject interests with what's available to provide an individualized menu. That thought came from Christie Hefner, chairman of Playboy Enterprises Inc., which is deep into interactive television and knows a thing or two about satisfying the special tastes of consumers. From generation to generation, some things never change."

We don't see the prospect of a direct hit."" **********Indeed, as of today, meteorologists were not predicting any major storms headed in the base's direction. **********Still, Mr. Sheets said, ""there's nothing physically that says Gitmo is immune to hurricane activity."" He noted that Hurricane Flora whipped around Cuba for four days in 1963, causing massive damage elsewhere on the island. **********Rear Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, the director of operations for the Atlantic Command, said in a telephone interview that 48 hours before a hurricane is predicted to hit the Guantanamo Bay area, the military would put into effect a four-part plan that would safely shelter or evacuate all refugees at the base. **********The military would move 14,000 people to empty ammunition bunkers dug into the sides of the rugged hills on base. The shelters can withstand winds of over 160 miles per hour. **********Two cruise ships in Guantanamo Bay, now chartered to shelter American troops working at the camps, would be emptied and filled with about 8,000 refugees. The ships would sail south and out to sea to avoid the storm. Other Navy ships might also be tapped to ferry refugees. **********The military would also charter several large commercial jetliners like 747's or L-1011's along with 24 Air Force C-141 cargo planes to fly about 6,000 people a day to other sites, probably some of the countries that have agreed to take in Haitians and Cubans temporarily. With two days' notice, planners estimate they could fly out about 12,000 people. When the storm passed, the refugees would be flown back to Guantanamo Bay. **********As a last resort, the military would use existing buildings on the base, such as schoolhouses, warehouses and maintenance sheds. Those buildings are not hardened but can withstand winds of up to about 100 m.p.h.  Admiral Fargo estimated the buildings could hold about 30,000 people. **********To avoid costly false alarms, the military has decided to wait until a storm is 48 hours away before putting the emergency plan into effect."

About 65,000 people, two-thirds of them refugees, are trapped there. **********The radio report said dozens of civilians were wounded this afternoon when the Serbs pounded Vitkovice, a village just south of Gorazde, with tanks and mortars. The broadcast also said that parts of a nearby factory were in flames and that the Serbs had launched new infantry assaults on the south bank of the Drina River, which divides Gorazde. **********A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo said today that 64 civilians had been confirmed as killed in the offensive.  Talks on Cease-Fire **********After a meeting here this morning, the United Nations commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, said that the Serbian nationalist leader, Radovan Karadzic, had called for a general cease-fire and that talks on implementing it may begin Thursday at Sarajevo airport. **********""They may feel they are now in the position to sit at the peace table, having put pressure on the other side,"" General Rose said of the Serbs. He described the Serbian attacks on the Gorazde pocket, a United Nations-declared safe area, as ""a tactical operation to relieve pressure elsewhere and gain some sort of political advantage."" **********The pocket has been cut off since last May, and Serbian commanders clearly want to take control of the main road running through it. **********Speaking to reporters outside the ski hotel the Bosnian Serbs use as their headquarters, General Rose said that for security reasons Dr. Karadzic had refused to make good on a promise to allow the general to enter Gorazde. The Serbian leaders gave permission only for 11 United Nations military observers to enter the town. **********""They cited security and the problems we would face going in there,"" said General Rose, who had planned to visit the town himself. **********United Nations officials in Sarajevo said tonight that they did not know whether new military observers had actually made it into Gorazde. Last summer, the Serbs held up the deployment of the first military observers for weeks and they have never allowed a full United Nations military contingent to be stationed there. **********""If the Serbs say the situation is such that they don't want us to go there now, we have to accept that,"" the general said, referring to the rejection of his own visit. ""They have said that in two days' time the situation will have been sufficiently resolved that they will allow us to go in."" **********General Rose said Dr. Karadzic and the commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, Gen. Ratko Mladic, had assured him ""two or three times"" that the Serbian artillery around Gorazde would not shell the town. **********United Nations reports from the area have said for days that the Serbs were mounting an effort to drive the Muslims from the south bank of the Drina River, United Nations officials in Sarajevo said.  Conflicting Information **********But United Nations military spokesmen have played down the Serbian attacks on Gorazde, saying that information from the pocket has been incomplete. **********The military observers' reports, however, have for days described what is clearly a large-scale Serbian offensive. In one of their latest dispatches, the observers expressed dismay at statements by United Nations officials here understating the seriousness of the Serbian assaults. **********""We have repeated that our assessment of the situation is now serious and that the continued potential for loss of civilian life is very high,"" said a report filed by United Nations military observers Tuesday night. **********""It is very disquieting to hear radio reports from the international media reiterate that the situation is not serious,"" the report added, saying that the observers had heard on a British short-wave radio report that a United Nations assessment had called the Gorazde offensive a ""minor attack into a limited area."" **********""We again do not concur with that position,"" the report said. ""Repeat. It is a grave situation."" **********""Saying it is a minor attack into a limited area is a bad assessment, incorrect, and shows absolutely no understanding of what is going on,"" the report says. **********The report says the Serbs have pulled to within two miles of the center of Gorazde. The military observers reported that they do not expect the Serbs to move closer to the town from the south until a well-defended strategic high ground is overrun. **********""If the high points around the city are taken, I do not wish to make an assessment of the result to Gorazde city,"" another confidential report says. **********Aid workers reporting from Gorazde took exception to statements by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, Gen. John Shalikashvili. The American general said on Tuesday that the threat of air strikes against the Serbian forces attacking Gorazde would not be effective, as they had been in stopping the relentless Serbian shelling of Sarajevo, because the Gorazde attack is not based on heavy artillery. **********But a doctor working for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Gorazde said: ""I have visited the Gorazde hospital many times each day since the offensive against Gorazde began on 28/29 March, and all the injuries I saw except one case were inflicted by artillery. Also all the bodies I saw had been killed by artillery fire."""

It started with very expensive houses and moved out from central areas of Belgravia and Mayfair to more peripheral areas."" **********That upturn spread in 1993. Property prices rose in the top- scale London areas of Kensington and Chelsea, Holland Park, Notting Hill, St. John's Wood, Regents Park, Hampstead and the Docklands. Unusually, the increases fed quickly into the suburban counties surrounding London. **********Miss Barnes predicts that the price surge has only just begun. Savills is forecasting increases this year of 25 percent for prime central London property and 19 percent for top-notch property in Britain as a whole. **********What brought the market back to life? Experts say the catalyst was Britain's withdrawal of the pound from the European exchange-rate mechanism in the fall of 1992. The 20 percent drop in the value of the currency coupled with the plunge of 20 percent to 30 percent in property prices suddenly made apartments and houses in Britain highly attractive to foreigners. **********Savills' Prime Central London Residential Property Index rose by 10.5 percent during 1993. The company's country house index for the suburban counties climbed 11.6 percent. **********BOTH INDEXES cover the top 10 percent by value of apartments and houses sold in each region. In such areas as the Docklands, this would include studio apartments that might sell for as little as £120,000 ($180,000); in the most expensive London areas of Belgravia and Mayfair, on the other hand, houses might cost several million pounds. **********This compares with last year's slim 1.2 percent rise in the Halifax building society's nationwide index, which spans all echelons of the market. Most forecasts for the top end of the market also exceed the gentle recovery of about 5 percent predicted by the Halifax index for 1994. **********But Savills' prediction of sharply higher prices this year may turn out to be excessive. **********Stephen Pirrie, head of the West End office of Hamptons, the real- estate agent, said that based on the results of the first quarter, property price were more likely to climb by only about 12 percent this year. **********He said that of the buyers he deals with regarding property in the exclusive areas of Knightsbridge, Belgravia, St James's and Mayfair, 85 percent are from outside Britain. Middle Eastern buyers have recently made a comeback, and Russian buyers have started to appear as well, he said. **********For those international investors buying on a relatively short-term basis, Mr. Pirrie said that yields on rental property of 9 percent to 10 percent in 1993 had fallen to about 7.5 percent so far this year. But he noted that there was now a much greater chance of significant capital appreciation on such properties than there was a few years ago. **********According to Miss Barnes, one of the surprising features of this recovery has been the swiftness with which the prices of country houses have tracked those in central London. In the past, price increases drifted only slowly outward from London's prime areas. **********Again, interest from international buyers has been the key. About 11 percent of sales at Savills' Sevenoaks office in Kent came from overseas investors in 1993. The nearby Guildford office in Surrey also saw strong overseas buying. **********Richard Smith, an associate director of Savills in Sevenoaks, said interest in beamed farmhouses in the £300,000-to-£500,000 price range was so strong that good property became relatively scarce toward the end of 1993. So far this year, such properties have sold soon after they hit the market. **********While the sale of one 16th-century five-bedroom farmhouse fell through in 1993, it recently sold for £450,000. **********Mr. Smith said the overseas buyers were from Greece, France and the United States; there also were a few expatriate Britons from Hong Kong. **********The attractions of the area included its proximity to London and various amenities, he said. **********""We are in an area that is very popular for education,"" he said. ""It has very good local grammar and public schools for boys and girls. We have got a mixture of country and communications. We are 40 minutes from London, and in the country as well."" **********Colin Mackenzie, head of the country house department at Hamptons, said he was being approached not only by Hong Kong expatriates, who were willing to pay up to about £300,000 for choice property, but by foreign business people seeking a base in Europe or a place to entertain European clients, who were often willing to go as high as £1.5 million. **********Mr. Mackenzie also stressed that such buyers tended to want houses within short distances of international airports. He said that those buyers with a European base in mind sought property no more than an hour's drive from Gatwick or Heathrow airports, while those seeking to offer corporate hospitality tended to look for something within a half-hour of the airports. **********Large country houses in this area that were selling for about £500,000 last year might sell for £600,000 in 1994, he added."

Although the magazines are profitable, they, like many other women's publications, have faced increasing competition for readers and advertising dollars. **********The acquisition of the New York Times publications will make the Bertelsmann unit, Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing, a strong force in the women's magazine field. The other leaders are the Hearst Corporation, which owns Good Housekeeping and Redbook; the Meredith Corporation, which owns The Ladies' Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens, and Hachette Filipacchi, the French media company that publishes Woman's Day. These publications, along with Family Circle and McCall's, are known as the Seven Sisters women's service magazines. **********The deal will permit Bertelsmann, which competes aggressively overseas with Hachette, to bring that competition directly to the United States, where Hachette owns Elle in addition to Woman's Day. **********Gruner & Jahr already owns YM, a magazine aimed at teen-age girls. Through aggressive promotion and a fine-tuning of YM's editorial content to appeal to contemporary teen-agers, Gruner & Jahr has been able to expand the magazine's circulation to 1.8 million from 900,000 in the last 18 months. The company also owns Parents, the leading family magazine, which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million. **********There had been rumors for several months that the Times Company might sell its magazines. Axel Ganz, president of Gruner & Jahr's international magazine division, said yesterday that the companies had held talks for about three months. **********""I have known Walter Mattson for a number of years,"" Mr. Ganz said yesterday, referring to the former Times Company president, who remains a company director. ""I had always said we might be interested."" **********Lance R. Primis, president of the Times Company, said in a telephone interview yesterday that the company had commissioned a study in December by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, the management consulting firm, to find ways to improve the magazines' profitability. When the study was completed in April, ""we saw the cost reductions that might be required to improve the magazines' profitability,"" Mr. Primis said. He added, ""When word got out about the study, we began to get inquiries of interest."" **********Gruner & Jahr, he said, ""made us a great offer."" **********The chief problem in the women's magazine field has been a decline in magazine advertising pages in recent years, as packaged-goods companies that have historically been the biggest buyers of space have curtailed their magazine advertising spending. Moreover, such advertisers have been spreading their money over an increasingly diverse and fragmented women's field -- from the traditional hearth-and-home magazines to publications aimed at women with careers, like Working Woman. 25-Year Commitment **********The Times Company has been building its women's magazine business for nearly 25 years, beginning with the acquisition of Family Circle from Cowles Communications in 1971. But Leo Scullin, a independent magazine consultant, said yesterday that he thought the company had ""decided that what it does best is to concentrate on its core business."" **********Last year, the Times Company acquired The Boston Globe in a $1.1 billion stock merger, signaling its intense commitment to the newspaper publishing business. **********Mr. Primis did not disagree with that analysis, but said the company did not plan to sell its remaining magazines. It still owns a group of leisure publications consisting of Golf Digest, Tennis, boating magazines, skiing publications and others. **********Although the Times Company does not break out financial figures for individual magazines, the entire collection of magazines accounted for 25.6 percent of the company's $2.02 billion in revenues for 1993, but only 9.7 percent of the $126.58 million in operating profits. **********""The bigger holdings of the company are newspapers,"" Mr. Primis said. ""But we have successful magazine, broadcasting and information services divisions. There is a lot of action going on in the information services division. We have a small-bet strategy going on in that area."" Paying Off Debt **********Mr. Primis said the company intended to use some of the proceeds from the Gruner & Jahr deal to pay off long-term debt and buy back shares of the company's stock. **********The agreement was announced after the stock market closed yesterday. Earlier, the Times Company's class A shares ended at $24.25, down 12.5 cents each, on the American Stock Exchange. **********Officials of the companies plan to meet with their magazine staffs this morning. As for any management changes at the Times Company's magazines, Mr. Ganz said: ""We will first go in and get to know the people. We are in the magazine business. It is a people business. You have to get to know the people."" **********Some publishing analysts said, however, that Gruner & Jahr might be willing to lay off staff members and cut costs more aggressively than the Times Company had been willing to do. And one industry expert noted that the Times Company's Child magazine was a direct competitor of Gruner & Jahr's Parents, which might make Child a candidate to be closed. Special Rates Aren't Seen **********Mr. Ganz said he did not expect his company to start offering advertisers special rates for buying a package of ads in all of their publications, because Gruner & Jahr's various magazines are aimed at such different age groups. But he said he thought Gruner & Jahr brought editing expertise to the publications that would be beneficial. **********The New York Times Company acquired Family Circle as part of a stock deal with Cowles in which it also acquired three television stations and other properties. It acquired McCall's in 1989 from Working Woman/McCall's Group, a joint venture of Dale W. Lang and Time Inc., at a price estimated at more than $80 million. **********In recent years, the women's magazine field has become increasingly competitive as advertising pages have stabilized at about 10,000, while costs have continued to increase. Circulation has fallen slightly over all, though publishers have often compensated for that by raising cover prices. **********Family Circle had a circulation of 5.1 million for the six months that ended on Dec. 31, 1993, down 3.2 percent from the period a year earlier. Once sold primarily at supermarket checkouts, it is now almost as dependent on subscription sales. **********McCall's circulation fell 2.1 percent for the second half of 1993, to 4.6 million, compared with year-earlier figures."

Kravchuk draw up a list of responses by Monday to stop Crimea's slide toward independence. **********Though the new resolution set no deadlines, nor suggested what might be in store for the pro-Russian leadership of Crimea, lawmakers said they felt they had made a tough statement by rejecting Mr. Kravchuk's proposal to submit the Crimean problem to a Constitutional Court, whose creation would take at least a month. **********Crimea is nearly 70 percent ethnically Russian and was a part of Russia proper until 1954. The dispute between Kiev and Crimea has been rumbling since 1992; it erupted shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, creating a potential hot spot directly involving Russia. **********Twelve days ago it was reignited when the Parliament in Crimea adopted a Constitution that would give it greater autonomy from Kiev.  Crimea has since flouted Kiev's deadline for rescinding its Constitution, set for last Monday. The Crimean Parliament did not even bother to put the issue on its agenda. **********In the Ukrainian Parliament today, passions ran high. Just before submitting his plan, Mr. Kravchuk accused Crimean leaders of plotting ""a strategic course to separate the Crimean republic from Ukraine and return it to Russia."" **********Despite these resolute remarks, Mr. Kravchuk's proposal appeared to be an acknowledgement of weak leadership in Kiev, where the Parliament is deeply divided and the President is viewed as a lame duck during the approach to elections on June 26. **********Russia's influence in Crimea, where the disputed Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea fleet is based, is also keeping Mr. Kravchuk's hands tied. **********Three days of talks between the Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers last week failed to resolve the impasse over basing rights. For the first time, Mr. Kravchuk said today that the Russian Navy was ""temporarily based on Ukrainian territory,"" eventually to be withdrawn from Crimea to Russia. **********Both militant and mainstream nationalists in Parliament protested the President's response to Crimea, with some demanding the establishment of direct presidential rule and a state of emergency there. **********Centrists and leftists from the east of Ukraine, where similar pro-Russian tensions are brewing among the large numbers of ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers, argued that Ukraine should move, like Russia has, to a federal structure, where all regions would have more autonomy. **********""We must take reality into account and accept Crimea as they are whether we like it or not,"" said Gennady Y. Ugarov, an eastern deputy who belongs to the Unity faction. **********Anton D. Buteiko, who was a key player in sealing the deal to rid Ukraine of its nuclear weapons as Mr. Kravchuk's chief adviser on foreign affairs and who is now a leading deputy in the centrist faction, said he was disturbed by Kiev's ineffectual scolding in the face of Crimea's insouciance. **********""A master can tell his cat to stop eating his steak, but if the cat continues eating anyway, it is sometimes necessary to use a strong stick,"" Mr. Buteiko said. ""Crimea has had three warnings."""

Two California H.M.O.'s in a $1.1 Billion Merger"," **********Ending two months of negotiations, the FHP International Corporation and Takecare Inc. signed a definitive merger agreement yesterday that the companies said was the highest-priced acquisition in the health maintenance organization industry. **********FHP agreed to pay nearly $1.1 billion in cash and stock to acquire Takecare. The companies said Takecare shareholders would receive $80 for each share, with 35 percent of the value in cash, 15 percent in FHP common stock and 50 percent in FHP convertible preferred stock.Creating a Giant **********The merger of the two California health maintenance organizations will create the second-largest publicly owned H.M.O., with annual revenues of more than $3.25 billion, and the fifth-largest H.M.O. in the United States, with more than 1.6 million members in eight states and Guam. **********FHP is paying ""a tip top price"" for Takecare, said Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. A common pricing measure in the H.M.O. industry is the market capitalization for each member. Using that measure, FHP is paying $1,250 a member, about $250 more than the industry average, Mr. Abramowitz said. **********Shares of FHP fell $1.75, to $26.50, in Nasdaq trading yesterday. Shares of Takecare soared $7.875, to $72.25, in Nasdaq trading, a 52-week high. **********The acquisition, which the two companies expect to complete in June, is the latest consolidation move in the industry. Margo Vignola, an analyst for Salomon Brothers, said two forces were fueling the mergers: the rising stock prices of H.M.O.'s and the cash that many of them have on hand. The two ""make acquisitions a lot easier,"" she said. **********The two companies announced an agreement in principle on Jan. 10, in which FHP offered to acquire all of Takecare's stock for $62 a share, or $829 million. But Takecare allowed the agreement to expire, and a shareholders' group filed a lawsuit to stop the merger because of a higher offer from the United Healthcare Corporation. United, based in Minnetonka, Minn., offered about $869 million in an all-stock transaction valued at about $65 for each share of Takecare. **********United Healthcare, the largest H.M.O. in the country, said on Monday that it would not pursue a merger with Takecare. Analysts said they suspected that United had halted the negotiations because Takecare's management wanted cash included in a purchase. Other analysts said United was busy completing two other acquisitions. **********In the meantime, Takecare opened another round of bidding and FHP increased its offer, said a spokesman for Takecare.Two Strategies **********Analysts said the merger would unite two H.M.O.'s with different yet complementary strategies operating in the California market and several other states. Takecare, based in Concord, Calif., is a commercial health care provider for a total of 769,000 members in Northern California, Colorado, Illinois and Ohio. Commercial providers offer company health plans. **********FHP, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., is the largest Medicare risk contractor, serving 325,000 elderly people in Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada. **********Medicare risk providers, which treat elderly patients and are reimbursed by Medicare, generate about three times the revenues of commercial providers, said the spokesman for Takecare, who added that the company had been seeking a partner to strengthen its competitive position in that market segment."

But the United States fears this will prove even milder than the bland resolution it has proposed, sending the wrong signal to North Korea.  Toward Chinese View **********In Beijing, the visiting South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, who has already backed China's call for a mild statement rather than a resolution, appeared to move further toward the Chinese view that the crisis should be resolved through negotiations. After two days of talks, President Kim said he, too, hoped a solution could be found through negotiation. **********He said that he and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, had ""confirmed a common position"" on the North Korean issue and that they would ""cooperate closely"" in dealing with it. **********But earlier, in an address at Beijing University, he had made clear that he was pressing China, North Korea's only significant ally and the source of much of its oil and food, to use its influence to end North Korea's nuclear ambitions. ""I ardently hope that China will play an active role in this effort,"" he said. ""We have never wanted the North to be isolated and we will spare no effort to help Pyongyang join the international community as a responsible member."" Details Not Disclosed **********He said he is sending his Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo, for talks in Washington on Wednesday before traveling on to Tokyo. But he declined to disclose any details of his own talks with Chinese leaders. **********In Vienna the North Korean Ambassador to Austria, Kim Gwan Sop, said North Korea would only agree to new inspections if the United States agreed to a third round of talks with on normalizing relations. But in Washington the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, repeated the Administration's position that these talks could be held only when North Korea allows the nuclear inspections and exchanges envoys with South Korea. **********The third round of talks was to have started in Geneva on March 21 but Washington canceled the meeting after North Korea prevented the international inspectors from carrying out tests to determine whether civilian nuclear material has been diverted for military use."

In all of these efforts, Time Warner plans to use its existing cable television systems, which are clustered around numerous cities, as the cornerstone for two-way communication services. **********In Manhattan, however, the company is limiting itself to the relatively narrow business of providing so-called alternative access services between business customers and long-distance carriers. **********Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner, said the company would eventually seek to offer ordinary telephone service to residential and business customers but must first negotiate interconnection agreements with Nynex and upgrade its network with considerably more optical fiber. These agreements allow a rival telephone carrier to receive and transfer calls to the established telephone network and they provide the terms under which each company is compensated for handling the other's calls. **********Meanwhile, Time Warner will have lots of company in trying to raid Nynex's business. The nation's two biggest alternative access companies, Teleport Communications Group and MFS Communications Inc., have been providing service in New York for years. Teleport, which is owned by three other cable television companies, is teaming up with the Sprint Corporation in an effort to offer a full range of residential and business telephone services. MCI Communications, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, is also preparing to enter the New York market to offer a full range of local phone services. **********But Time Warner could ultimately be a powerful contender in New York, given that its cable systems already serve one million subscribers in the city. ""This is our biggest operation in the country,"" Mr. Luftman said. ""New York is clearly a major opportunity in terms of competitive access business, and ultimately in the local telephone business."" **********Time Warner's stock closed up 37.5 cents a share yesterday, at $34.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.  The company's plan to offer local telephone services in Rochester came after it signed an interconnection accord with Rochester Telephone and the New York State Public Service Commission. Rochester is likely to be the nation's first market to give residential consumers a choice of local phone services. **********Time Warner's telephone operations in New York will be managed by Time Warner Communications of New York City, a new unit of Time Warner Cable of New York City."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/world/gi-s-tally-macedonian-traffic-flow.html,Roger Cohen,1994-07-31,,913,,The New York Times,World,News,article,G.I.'s Tally Macedonian Traffic Flow,G.I.'s Tally Macedonian Traffic Flow," **********I understand what's going on,"" said Sgt.  Scott Culver, as he gazed down from the small American Army camp here at a long line of trucks waiting to cross the border into Serbia. ""You don't need a Ph.D. for that."" **********What was going on, as it does every day, was that the United Nations trade embargo on Serbia was being violated. Dozens of trucks loaded with merchandise were heading north into Serbia, meticulously observed by United States soldiers  of the 2d Battalion of the 15th Infantry Division, based in Schweinfurt, Germany. **********Over the past 24 hours, Sergeant Culver and Staff Sgt. Charles Inderrieden had logged six oil trucks, 34 regular trucks and two double trailer-trucks heading north, and 71 cargo cars on a train going into Serbia from Macedonia. They had also observed and reported 68 cargo cars going south from Serbia into Macedonia, and a few donkeys with carts heading in both directions. **********""It's not my job to wonder why,"" Sergeant Inderrieden said. ""If I'm told to count it, I count it."" **********The bizarre scene at this shabby border crossing underscores the complexity of United States policy toward the former Yugoslavia. Committed to the stability of Macedonia -- the most southern of the former Yugoslav republics -- the Clinton Administration has dispatched a battalion of soldiers as part of a United Nations force. **********Turning a Blind Eye **********But that very stability depends in part on turning a blind eye to Macedonia's growing trade with Serbia, one of the few economic outlets for this  landlocked country whose southern border has been sealed to trade by the Greek Government that claims an exclusive prerogative over the name ""Macedonia."" **********""If we are supporting the stability of Macedonia, can we really threaten them with sanctions for flouting the trade embargo on Serbia?"" asked one Western diplomat in Skopje. The diplomat noted that 80 percent of Macedonia's trade used to be with other lands of the former Yugoslavia. **********Already one third of the Macedonian work force is unemployed, and salaries have not been paid for close to two months in several state-owned enterprises. The economy is reeling from the Greek embargo, which has cut off the nearest access to the sea and to important raw materials. **********But if the difficulties of Macedonia are real, so too is the damage its trade with Serbia does to the effectiveness of the United Nations sanctions. The Serbian economy, which was collapsing beneath hyperinflation late last year, has stabilized as goods have begun to pour in. Empty Threats **********Indeed, at a time when the United Nations is threatening even stricter sanctions if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject a peace plan for the territorial division of Bosnia, the scene at the Macedonia border makes a mockery of such threats. **********The Bosnian Serbs are well aware of the gap between announced international policy and the reality of the situation along the borders, a gap that has yawned since the beginning of the Bosnian war in 1992. **********Moreover, it is clear that by adopting a moderate course with Greece, the United States is acquiescing in a Greek border policy that virtually obliges Macedonia to trade with Serbia. Even though it has recognized Macedonia, the Clinton Administration has declined to send an ambassador to its capital, Skopje. **********The American presence in Macedonia was recently bolstered from 300 soldiers to more than 500. That move, one American official in Skopje said, reflected a desire to ""show we are doing something about the problems in the former Yugoslavia."" **********Showing the Flag **********In Macedonia, that effort is limited to the northern border with Serbia, although tensions are at least as great on Macedonia's southern border with Greece and on the eastern border with Albania, where official support for restive ethnic Albanians in Macedonia has irritated the Macedonian Government. **********The mission of the American soldiers is essentially to show their presence and so help keep the peace, but the United Nations force has no mandate to stop  the expanding Macedonian-Serbian trade. **********Asked about the trucks going over the border, the commander of the American battalion, Col. John Baggott, said, ""I don't know if it's smuggling or what."" **********The people who do follow the Macedonian-Serbian trade closely come from a United Nations mission in Skopje made up of about 50 officials. But they, too, say they are powerless to enforce the embargo. **********Truck Traffic Triples **********""Our job is to assist the Macedonian authorities and to report what is happening to the United Nations sanctions committee,"" said Pierre Gravel, the chief of the mission. ""We restrict ourselves to that role. We cannot prevent the local authorities from allowing trade with Serbia if they choose to. **********""Of course,"" he added, ""the sanctions committee has made a number of formal protests."" **********Mr. Gravel said the number of trucks crossing the border each week had increased to about 1,000 from about 300 last year. Some of these trucks were empty, he said, and most of the others contained food. But many contained oil, clothes, leather, chemicals, fertilizer and cement. **********Vast business interests are clearly at stake in this traffic. Earlier this month, a Canadian official arrived in Skopje to take up a job monitoring the border trade. It was to be his second assignment in Macedonia. **********But the day after he arrived, he was threatened in his hotel room by local thugs who said he and his family would suffer if he interfered in the Macedonian-Serbian trade. ""I arranged for the official to leave for Canada the next day,"" Mr. Gravel said. ""We are not going to take any risks."""

What the package does not include is a lot of profits. **********Consider, for example, that the New York Rangers hockey team lost $3.7 million last year and, as recently as May, was expected to lose $7 million this year. The Rangers are now expected to edge into the black for 1994 -- but only as a result of the extra ticket sales and additional cable television revenue from the playoff season that culminated in June with the Rangers' first Stanley Cup in 54 years. **********The profit margins are thin indeed for the Madison Square Garden properties, according to ""the book"" -- the sales document currently being provided to potential buyers by Allen & Company, the investment banker managing the sale for Viacom Inc. Portions of the closely guarded document, which was prepared in May, were recently given to a reporter by a person familiar with the negotiations. **********The potential buyers are said to include several big media and sports-business companies, with the sale price expected to end up somewhere between $750 million and $1 billion. **********For its money, according to the book, the winner will be acquiring an enterprise that had $329 million in revenue last year. But because of high costs and entangling business relationships among the various units -- between the sports teams and the MSG cable network, for example -- Madison Square Garden had an adjusted operating cash flow of only $22.1 million last year. That figure, which represents the cash generated by the various business units minus corporate expenses and other charges, is perhaps the best measure of the financial performance of Madison Square Garden. **********Viacom acquired Madison Square Garden as part of a $9.7 billion purchase of Paramount Communications earlier this year. Almost immediately, Viacom set to work to sell the Garden, deeming that it would be worth more for its sale value than it would as a continuing operation in Viacom's media empire. **********After an initial round of bids conducted to gauge buyer interest, Viacom has now set Aug. 15 as the date for final bids.   The current front-runners in the final round are said to be the Liberty Media Corporation, the cable programmer, and John Labatt Ltd., the Canadian brewer whose sports holdings include the Toronto Blue Jays and the Sports Network cable channel. Liberty and Labatt are now discussing a joint bid for the Garden. **********Second-tier bidders are thought to include Nike Inc., and a team of the Cablevision Systems Corporation and the ITT Corporation. A joint venture between The New York Times Company and the Delaware North Company has apparently dropped out of the running, according to a business executive familiar with the bidding. **********The executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that if Liberty won, the deal might include settlement of a lawsuit filed last year by Viacom against John C. Malone, who controls both Liberty Media and Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company. Under such a deal, the executive said, Viacom might retain some stake in the Garden properties. **********Among the companies said to be in the running, only Liberty Media has been willing to comment on the bidding. In a telephone interview last week, Peter Barton, president of Liberty Media, was unwilling to discuss any specifics, however, other than to tout his company as a front-runner.  ""It is foreordained that we will own the Garden,"" he said. **********The eventual winner of the bidding will face two challenges. The first is to reduce a cost structure that analysts say has become rather plump as a result of high operating expenses for the arena and the MSG Network's pricey contract to carry New York Yankees baseball games. **********The second challenge is to figure out, given the sibling relationships, what each member of the Garden family might be worth in its own right. Expensive to Operate **********Costs at the Garden are high for a myriad of reasons. To begin with, midtown Manhattan, where the arena is situated, is an expensive place to do business. But several executives familiar with the numbers say the administrative and other overhead costs for the Garden properties, which totaled $14 million last year, could be reduced significantly if the new owner was more cost-conscious. **********A much bigger factor is the $486 million contract that the MSG Network signed in 1988 with a team the Garden does not own, the Yankees, to carry games through the year 2000. The sales document shows that, after Viacom acquired the Garden, it decided the value of the Yankee rights was $137 million less than what MSG had paid; Viacom said in the document that it would take a write-off for that amount against its earnings. **********The combined $22.1 million in cash flow last year for all the Madison Square Garden properties represented a sizable improvement over its 1990 cash flow of $5.8 million. Even so, Paramount was sufficiently concerned about the operation in the spring of 1993 that it commissioned a report from Booz, Allen & Hamilton, the consulting firm, about improving the Garden's performance.  Better Services, More Events **********The report indicated that there was room for improvement in managing the Garden by reducing staff and improving services like concessions and souvenir sales and by holding more events at the arena and the Paramount Theater that is attached to it. **********According to people close to the Garden, the report also suggested that the sports teams could be marketed more aggressively in retail shops that the Garden might license or operate throughout metropolitan New York. The stores would sell team caps, T-shirts and other sports memorabilia. **********Viacom has already responded to at least one of the suggestions. As part of an effort to stage more events at the Garden, Viacom's Nickelodeon cable channel plans to produce a series of Christmas stage shows there beginning this year. The shows are intended to compete with the traditional Christmas shows at Radio City Music Hall. **********As for the two sports teams, there was not much room for criticism in the Booz, Allen report. Stanley R. Jaffe, who had responsibility for the Garden as president of Paramount Communications until last April, endorsed a policy of spending heavily to improve the two teams. **********That investment has begun to pay off, for the Knicks as well as the Rangers. In calendar 1993, the Knicks earned $7.4 million on sales of $53 million, according to the documents. This year, after coming in second in the National Basketball Association playoffs, the Knicks could make as much as $10 million on sales of $60 million.  Questioning the Numbers **********People with knowledge of the Madison Square Garden data say the Knicks and Ranger information in the sales document does not fully reflect the teams' profitability. ""The statements don't reflect the cash flow that the teams generate,"" one executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity. **********The documents show that the MSG Network pays only about $3.7 million a year for the rights to the Knicks games and a comparable amount for rights to the Rangers' games. Some people with knowledge of the data say both teams could have charged the cable channel significantly more money if they had been independent of the network. Two people close to the Garden say the Knicks, at least, might have also been able to get some money for games from broadcast television. **********Currently the N.B.A. has deals with NBC and the TNT cable channel to carry the playoffs and some other league games. The National Hockey League has a comparable arrangement with the cable network ESPN. But those deals still leave individual teams free to license rights to the bulk of their games as they choose. **********A number of teams have split the rights between broadcast and cable television. Not the Garden, however, which has given MSG sole rights to all games not covered by the league contracts. **********People familiar with the Garden's operations have said that David Checketts, president of the Knicks, has been unhappy with his boss, Robert Gutkowski, president of Madison Square Garden, over the matter of television rights to Knicks games.  Garden's Gain, Knicks' Loss? **********Mr. Gutkowski, who much earlier in his career was vice president of programming at ESPN, is credited with building the MSG Network, which has a projected operating cash flow of about $30 million for 1994. But Mr. Checketts is said to contend that MSG's financial growth has come at the expense of the Garden's own teams and that Mr. Gutkowski wanted to offset the heavy cost of the Yankees by paying less for the Knicks. Both men declined to comment. **********Because of the high price Viacom is seeking and the potential challenge of improving the Garden's profitability, some media executives who have seen the documents believe that Liberty Media or Cablevision, both of which already have cable sports programming services, may stay in the bidding the longest. Each has a strategic need for MSG Network, generally considered the most valuable asset of the Garden properties because the cable business has greater growth potential than the sports teams or the arena. **********Cablevision, which is based in Woodbury, L.I., and is one of the nation's largest operators of cable television systems, already owns Sportschannel. That cable service carries the games of many New York-area professional sports teams including the New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils hockey teams, the New Jersey Nets basketball team and the New York Mets baseball team. **********One question for any buyer would be what do with the teams and the arena itself. Keeping the Garden properties intact, of course, would be one option. But one person who has seen the numbers said a cable company could probably sell the sports teams individually and get as much as $150 million for each team."

Whoopi Goldberg introduced Mrs. Clinton as ""very cool"" at the gathering of 980 people who had paid from $125 to $1,000 each to also hear a speech by Barbra Streisand, a long-time member of the committee. But also in the audience were Lisa Henson, president of Columbia Pictures; Laura Ziskin, president of a new movie division at 20th Century Fox; Marilyn Bergman, the Oscar-winning lyricist and an advocate for artists' rights; Susan Grode, an entertainment lawyer; Lili Fini Zanuck, a producer and director; Anthea Sylbert, who runs the Hawn-Sylbert Movie Company, and others whose dollars and dedication to goals like economic equality for women and abortion rights have helped shape the political landscape. **********""The H.W.P.C. gives Hollywood's women executives a way to interact with Washington,"" said Mark Gill, a public relations executive and president of the Show Coalition, a nonpartisan political organization that tries to give the entertainment industry access to candidates. ""And it's a way for Washington to connect with the money and influence of Hollywood. The H.W.P.C. is good at mobilizing celebrity clout. They do a spectacular job using their two resources: the dollars they bring in and their members' visibility."" **********Standing amid the hubbub at the luncheon was Margery Tabankin, the organization's departing executive director, who has brought Washington skills -- from her years overseeing philanthropies and heading the Vista program during the Carter Administration -- to running the committee for the last five years. She smiled as Phil Angelides, the Democratic candidate for California State Treasurer, stepped over to shake her hand (""We gave him $15,000,"" she said), and then she posed for a photograph with United States Senator Barbara Boxer, whose successful 1992 campaign was bolstered by the committee's support. **********Clearly hoping for some of the same stardust, Ms. Brown, California's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, worked the crowd. Ms. Tabankin said committee members had already written checks totaling $400,000 for the Brown campaign, while the committee had given $50,000. This luncheon, for Congressional races, raised $200,000 for 40 ""progressive"" candidates, she said. **********The group, a political action committee, was founded a decade ago by 15 high-powered Hollywood women, including Paula Weinstein, Rosilyn Heller, Nancy Hardin and Barbara Boyle, all production executives turned producers; Pat Tourk Lee, a TV producer; Joan Hyler, an agent, and Ms. Bergman, Ms. Sylbert and Ms. Grode. **********""Most of us,"" Ms. Heller said, ""had been in groups with men where women were relegated to a back position. The feeling was that we finally had the power, which is money."" **********Ms. Grode, now a partner with Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hayes & Handler, said the Republican agenda of the early 80's ""left no room for any women's voices. We wanted to help elect those representatives who could speak to those points of view."" **********Ms. Hardin says the group's strength has always come from a core of women willing to play hardball. ""They are not afraid to say, 'if you don't buy a table, so-and-so may not make their next movie with you.' "" **********Ms. Sylbert added, ""We knew how to raise money, just as we knew how to raise money for movies."" **********Since its founding, the committee has raised $5.2 million to back candidates. Two events alone, featuring Ms. Streisand, raised $1.2 million for the Clinton Presidential campaign in 1992 and the same total for six Senate candidates in 1986. It now has 225 members from the entertainment industry, who pay dues of $1,500 a year (that's ""one less Armani jacket,"" Ms. Sylbert said). **********But some significant Hollywood women have opted to make their own political way. **********Pat Kingsley, a powerful press agent, has long worked apart from the committee with her star clients to support candidates including Michael Dukakis in his 1988 presidential bid against George Bush. The committee's strength, she said, is its ""access to the celebrities, Streisand especially."" **********Dawn Steel, a former chairman of Columbia Pictures who is now an independent producer, credits the organization with ""helping me get conscious."" But she left it in 1992 when the policy committee refused to support Mel Levine in his Democratic primary campaign against Ms. Boxer for the Senate seat. ""I'm far more conservative than they are,"" she said of the committee. **********But Ms. Steel continues to back Democrats on her own, throwing events for President Clinton and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California that have yielded hundreds of thousands of dollars. ""The money I raised allowed me to have my own voice,"" she said. ""It's arduous, but it's not brain surgery. **********""What makes you a powerful person,"" she said, drawing the same conclusion as the committee, ""is when you raise money."" All you need, she added, ""is a good Rolodex."""

Greenspan Perplexed **********Consumers, though, remain worried about the economy ""despite what is obviously solid evidence of economic strength,"" said Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, in a speech in San Francisco today. **********Perhaps reflecting this unsettled mood, consumer borrowing rose in February at about half the pace expected by analysts, according to new Fed figures. Installment credit rose by $3.54 billion in February, the ninth straight increase, after rising $6.38 billion in January. **********The Commerce Department's report on capital spending showed that the industries with the largest planned increases included steel works and blast furnaces; stone, glass, and clay producers, and auto and truck makers. **********The Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation in Virginia is planning to spend $10 million over the next two years to install a ladle furnace to meet demand. ""We can hardly keep up,"" said Thomas Crawford, the company's assistant vice president and secretary. ""We're producing a lot of steel, and it doesn't seem to be enough."" **********Coca-Cola intends to increase spending by 50 percent, or $400 million, this year, with 75 percent of the money going toward international expansion. Other American businesses are spending more on their international operations, too. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said foreign affiliates of United States companies planned to raise spending on factories and equipment by 8 percent this year, the biggest gain since 1990."

An attractive price of 97 for a December bond option helped underpin a late morning rally that pared the worst losses of the session. **********The price of the 30-year Treasury bond came off earlier lows to finish unchanged at 921/32 for a yield of 8.12 percent. Prices of shorter-term maturities were unchanged to slightly lower. **********Concerns about the ability of the market to absorb next week's large supply of new two- and five-year notes weighed down prices yesterday. Lukewarm demand for the notes in when-issued trading has prompted dealers to squeeze yields a little higher to generate interests. **********A two-year note was offered yesterday at a price to yield 7.28 percent, while the yield on a five-year note was 7.81 percent. Both notes were up a couple of basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. The Treasury plans to auction $17.25 billion in two-year notes on Monday and $11 billion in five-year notes on Tuesday. **********The market received a small lift from a stronger dollar, which makes bonds more attractive to foreign investors. The dollar gained yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit with Japan narrowed in September. **********But the overall trade deficit widened 4.6 percent for the month. The fear among investors is that the widening gap between United States imports and exports could drive the dollar lower, discouraging foreign investors from buying American bonds. **********Some market analysts said yesterday that the market appeared due for an upturn. Bond prices fell on Thursday and Wednesday, and some say the market is becoming oversold. But any rally will be limited because investors continue to cash in on every uptick in the market. **********Robin Mesch, chief analyst for fixed-income products at Thomson Research in Portland, Ore., said investor interest on the long bond had been been piling up at a price to yield 8.13 percent, or 9226/32 , in the cash market. ""The market has run into congestion, and I anticipate there will be a massing of buyers at around that level,"" Ms. Mesch said. **********""Next week, I think you'll see some directional movement initiated from a price of 9621/32 in futures trading,"" she said. ""The time is ripe for the market to test one extreme of the trading range. But I think those gains will be capped at a price of 9818/32 for a yield of about 7.99 to 8 percent."" **********In the municipal market, where tax-exempt mutual funds have been hit with shareholder redemptions because of the rise in interest rates and loss of value, mutual funds continued to sell bonds to raise cash, causing bonds to slump for a third day."

Don't Try It Around Her,Profile; Workplace Discrimination? Don't Try It Around Her," **********IT was one of Judith P. Vladeck's early sex-discrimination trials, in 1978. Her client, a Western Electric engineer, had been stunned one day to find that a co-worker had dropped on her desk an obscene cartoon that was a nude likeness of her. Ms. Vladeck made it her business to admit the sketch of her 200-pound client as evidence early in the trial. **********""I used to keep it in a red folder at the counsel table,"" Ms. Vladeck remembers. ""Whenever I thought the judge's attention was flagging, I'd start to wave it around."" **********The Federal Supplement, a legal reference that is no obvious spot to skim for the lurid, was so taken with the tactic that it published a copy of the drawing with the court's remarks that the cartoon was obviously ""created, disseminated and ultimately thrust upon this plaintiff to humiliate her as a woman."" **********Such a flair for the dramatic is but one item in Ms. Vladeck's bag of tricks as an advocate for women and others who contend that there is discrimination in the workplace. The tireless showmanship -- combined with laborious analysis of details like performance reviews and salary histories -- appears to work. **********In December Ms. Vladeck reached a $16 million settlement with the former Shearson Lehman Brothers on behalf of former executives of E. F. Hutton, which Shearson bought. She has also taken on giants from Union Carbide to Chase Manhattan to the City University of New York. And won -- or settled for millions. **********""She is considered by the defense bar to be the dean -- or the deaness -- of the plaintiffs' bar"" in employment disputes, said Allen Fagin of the New York firm Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, who has opposed Ms. Vladeck in about 10 cases over the years. ""She is a formidable adversary who is vigorous in pursuing her clients' rights."" **********Is she getting more business because of the epidemic of layoffs? ""Of course,"" she says, often ""because of the way layoffs are handled."" **********At 70 (""I really wish you didn't have to mention my age""), the chain-smoking Ms. Vladeck shows no desire to cut back on her frenetic 11-hour-a-day schedule, which her daughter and law partner, Anne Vladeck, begs her mother to trim to a five-day week (from seven). **********In the City University case, in which Judith Vladeck painstakingly documented past faculty salaries, the judge ruled that the university had discriminated against women for 15 years. When The New York Times asked in 1983 whether Ms. Vladeck thought the multimillion-dollar settlement was equitable, she gave a classic Vladeck answer that became the paper's quotation of the day: ""If we were to calculate the real back pay in this case, they'd have to take Brooklyn College and City College and auction them off to pay the damages."" **********Most recently, she has been representing the female chief of a New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center division who says she was passed up for a promotion in favor of a less-qualified man. (A spokeswoman for New York Hospital says, ""We have denied and continue to vigorously deny that there has been any discrimination."") The case is sure to attract attention as an example of the ""glass ceiling"" many women say they bump into as their careers move closer to the top. **********""She is more apt than others to push the envelope a bit,"" said Lawrence Sandak, an employment lawyer and friend of Ms. Vladeck's who frequently represents the management side. ""When you get that phone call that your client has been sued, the last thing you want to hear is that Ms. Vladeck is on the other side."" **********Not that she wins every case. When Nancy Ezold, a lawyer at the Philadelphia firm Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen, was turned down for partner, she turned to Ms. Vladeck, who said the resulting trial was the nation's first to challenge a law firm's denial of partnership on the basis of sex discrimination. The court found that the firm had discriminated, saying that the performance evaluations of men who were made partner were sometimes less favorable than those of Ms. Ezold, and that she had been held to a higher standard. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the trial court's decision, saying that in dealing with professionals, employers are entitled to a certain amount of subjective judgment in promotion decisions. Ms. Vladeck, bitter over the defeat, disputes that assertion. **********Ask her if she's ever represented an employer, and Ms. Vladeck is incredulous. ""Are you kidding?"" she says. ""Never."" **********Ms. Vladeck graduated from the Columbia University School of Law in 1947, one of 26 women in a class of 174. ""The placement office didn't even send women on job interviews,"" she remembers. ""So I went to work for Conrad & Smith, the only law firm that would hire me."" **********That became a part-time job in 1950, ""after I started popping kids,"" as Ms. Vladeck puts it. Today, Bruce, 44, is head of the Federal Health Care Finance Administration; David, 42, is director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group; and Anne, 39, is one of her mother's partners. By 1957, though, when Anne was 3, Ms. Vladeck joined her husband's nine-year-old New York firm, which specialized in union labor and civil liberties law. Stephen Vladeck died in 1979. Although her firm, Vladeck, Waldman, Elias & Engelhard, still has a substantial roster of union clients -- including the Newspaper Guild of New York, which represents employees of The New York Times -- the firm is best known for bringing suits involving bias for sex, age or other reasons. **********While the firm is closely identified with its outspoken senior partner, ""It's hardly a one-person show,"" Mr. Fagin said. ""She's attracted a level of talent that would probably not otherwise have found its way to a small firm."" **********Added Susan Ritz of Steel, Bellman, Ritz & Clark, a New York firm that specializes in civil rights law, ""She's mentored a lot of younger people, which is very important."" **********To some who oppose her in discrimination cases, Ms. Vladeck identifies too strongly with her clients, perhaps allowing compassion to cloud her ability to see weaknesses in a case. Her response to such talk: ""I think it's that I see it too clearly and that troubles them. I think what distinguishes me has been that I really do care."" **********Others say her biggest flaw is simply that she is willing to fight to the bitter end. ""Judy is not afraid to take a case to its conclusion -- when you negotiate with her, it's with the full understanding that if you can't find a mutually satisfactory way to work out the problem, you will see her in court,"" Mr. Fagin says. Sometimes, he added, that means she fights an iffy case to the end when a settlement would have better served her client. **********Anne Vladeck jokes that opposition lawyers at white-shoe firms frequently go to great lengths to avoid coming to Vladeck, Waldman's modest Times Square offices for negotiations ""because they think they're slumming it."" In the Union Carbide case, in which Ms. Vladeck argued successfully that a labor lawyer should not have been forced to retire at 65, she said the company's law firm, Kelley Drye & Warren, ""really treated us as if we were the great unwashed"" -- though Merrill Stone, Kelley Drye's managing partner, insists that ""we have never thought of them"" that way. **********MS. VLADECK is accustomed to seeing the opposition look down their noses, and even appears to enjoy a bit of reverse snobbery. But not all clients appreciate her sometimes disarming lack of pretension. When one client in the 1970's found out that Whitney North Seymour, a top New York lawyer, would be arguing against Ms. Vladeck, she had second thoughts. ""She said, 'Maybe we should get somebody better,' "" Ms. Vladeck said with a chuckle. **********Good thing she didn't. Ms. Vladeck won the case for the client, Val Winsey, a Pace University professor who had been denied tenure. Professor Winsey was reinstated with back pay and received her tenure, but not until after reversal of a lower court whose judge said he didn't see what all the fuss was about, considering that Professor Winsey should be grateful to have had a hard-to-get teaching job in the first place. **********""When he said that, I got so exercised that I threw out my arms more dramatically than usual and said, 'Your honor, no woman will stand a chance in this court,' "" Ms. Vladeck remembers. Later, when the Pace lawyers argued that Ms. Vladeck's client was a troublemaker who devoted too much energy to challenging the system, Ms. Vladeck responded with words that would be mimicked in the appeals court ruling in her favor. ""The only way women are tolerated is if they are supine, silent and submissive,"" she remembers saying. **********When the opinion in Pace's favor was reversed, the ruling said that ""those who fight for rights are often perceived as troublesome, but the law does not require people to be supine."" **********Ms. Vladeck represents those who do fight, and her successes have perhaps as much to do with her ability to identify with her clients as they do with her litigating abilities. Claudia I. Henschke, the New York Hospital physician whose discrimination lawsuit is in the fact-finding stage, kept her composure through an hour of recent questions about her accusations of discrimination and damaging gossip, including rumors that she had gotten ahead through a sexual liaison with a hospital administrator. But when asked her impressions of Ms. Vladeck, Ms. Henschke broke down. ""She just understood what I was going through,"" she said, her eyes welling up with tears. ""I remember sitting there, just knowing there was somebody who would stand up for me."" **********Ms. Vladeck also takes care to show her clients that their options are frequently many -- and surprising. A big area where she's taught that lesson -- particularly to women -- is in determining how much money will make them whole. ""I try to teach women that they should not be afraid of big numbers,"" she said. ""The first time I settled something in the $1 million range, I was in a panic. I discovered then that it's a hell of a lot easier to get $100,000 than to get five cents an hour for blue-collar workers."" Judith P. Vladeck   Current position: Senior partner, Vladeck, Waldman, Elias & Engelhard.  Born: Aug. 1, 1923, Norfolk, Va.  Education: Hunter College, 1945; Columbia University School of Law, 1947.

He added that this would happen if ""Muslim forces should capture their areas, as they are attempting right now."" **********""Croatia has helped them, and it will do all it can to help them,"" the Defense Minister said on state television. ""If necessary, Croatia will go a step further."" Leader of 'Herzegovina Lobby' **********Mr. Susak, a Canadian pizza entrepreneur, is considered the leader of the militant ""Herzegovina lobby"" in the Government. The group is believed to represent the many ethnic Croatian emigres with roots in the southwestern region of Bosnia who have poured in money to support both the Zagreb Government and the separatist militia in Bosnia, the Croatian Defense Council, usually referred to by its initials in Serbo-Croatian, H.V.O. **********President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia struck a bellicose note in a year-end television interview, warning: ""The Muslims must either abandon their aggression or the world will have to understand the steps we will have to take to defend Croats there."" **********The armed forces commander, Gen. Janko Bobetko, also warned that ""Croatia has to set aside substantial means in order to assist our kin"" in what he pointedly referred to as ""Herzeg-Bosnia,"" the name the Croatian Defense Council uses for the ministate it is trying to establish. **********""Anyone who would try to trespass on what is ours will be attacked with all weapons available,"" General Bobetko said. ""We shall not allow even a small part of our territory to be taken away."" Serbs Hold Third of Croatia **********Already, about a third of Croatia itself has been occupied by Serbian separatists supported by the Serbian Government. The Serbs took the territory in the war that broke out after Croatia seceded from the Yugoslav federation in 1991. When Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence the next year, and was attacked by Bosnian Serbs supported by the Serbian Government and army, Croats fought alongside the Bosnian Muslims. **********But late last spring, when peace talks seemed to be heading toward a three-way partition of Bosnia, Croats began their own drive for territory. **********The Croatian Defense Council, however, has suffered a series of reverses since June as the Bosnian forces have advanced along a broad front. The Bosnians have captured six towns, including some of the most fertile and populated land that had traditionally been Croatian, and have turned as many as 10,000 Croatian civilians into refugees. **********Mr. Susak, the architect of Zagreb's policy in Bosnia, which has included financing and arming the Croatian Defense Council, said the Croatian Army had spent much of the year reorganizing and getting new equipment. **********In an effort to strengthen the Croatian Defense Council, a regular Croatian Army commander, Gen. Ante Roso, who previously served in the French Foreign Legion, has been sent to take charge of the militia. Bosnian Army Improves **********But the Bosnian Army, according to United Nations military observers as well as its own commanders, has improved rapidly, moving from a hastily improvised band of fighters to a credible, although lightly armed, infantry force. **********The current fighting centers around the fertile Lasva River valley spreading around Vitez, northwest of Sarajevo. In a campaign that started around Christmas, Bosnian Government forces have made gains in hamlets and strategic road junctions around Vitez, which contains, among other things, a large explosives plant. The explosives factory is crucial to the Muslims, who are hampered by the international arms embargo, because it would help to manufacture their munitions. **********Any Croatian attempt at direct military intervention could raise the prospect that Zagreb, like Belgrade, could come under international economic sanctions. Both the United Nations and the European Union have warned that sanctions would swiftly follow Croatian military action. **********Bosnian leaders professed themselves unimpressed with the Croatian threats. **********""The Croatian Army is already intervening,"" the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said on television.""They have been there for a while."""

Japan is still mired in economic woes, though there is some talk of a rebound. China, whose growth in the last year has been in the mid-teens, could experience a slowdown -- to merely spectacular 10 percent growth. Then there is Russia, which must balance international calls for austerity with domestic politics and slow- or fast-paced privatization. From around the world, correspondents of The New York Times assess local economies. **********After a clear look at the dark underside of Russian nationalism, manifested by the spectacular vote for Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in last month's elections, Westerners must regard Russia as one of the world's great crap shoots. **********The West and its fiduciary agent, the International Monetary Fund, had high hopes for a resounding victory by the Westernized economic reformers who dominated the Russia's Choice party, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar. **********A reformist majority in the new parliament, they thought, would provide the political mandate for a sweeping economic program. They were wrong. **********There are many reasons that almost half of Russia's voters did not vote, as there are for the fury of those who voted for Mr. Zhirinovsky and the Communists. But there is no denying that a large majority voted against what they understood to be the kind of economic reform advocated by Russia's Choice and the West. **********Such a vote will make an I.M.F. austerity program, which would result in large increases in unemployment, almost impossible politically. **********So Russia enters the new year at a crossroad. To listen to the voters too avidly would mean gutting economic change and bring about even higher inflation and instability, further fertilizing the ground for fascism, Mr. Gaidar argues. **********So he is relying on President Boris N. Yeltsin, who consciously remained above the fray, to ignore the voters and follow the usual Russian route to reform: from on high, by decree. **********But it is likely that Mr. Yeltsin will continue to fudge, to steer a sloppy, compromising course between irreconcilable concepts of how the Russian economy should be managed. That might not insure disaster, but it could mean more of the same, only with higher inflation, as Russia muddles through. **********Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the non-Government reform economist, suggests an alternative: faster privatization to break up monopolies and produce competition, combined with less worry about fighting inflation. Mr. Gaidar counters that ""to talk about a softer anti-inflation policy when inflation remains at 15 percent a month is professionally senseless."" **********The economic reformers in the pre-election Government, led by Mr. Gaidar and Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, were never dominant. In fact, economic reform in Russia has little deserved the ""shock therapy"" label. Diplomats have started calling it ""bulimic"" instead, because sharp doses of reform are followed by long periods of chaos, inactivity and bureaucratic paralysis. Inflation ran at 20 percent a month, with a drop to 15 percent in November. **********That drop, intended to encourage the I.M.F to pony up an additional $1.5 billion in special transition loans to cover the budget deficit, was created through a simple refusal to pay Government obligations, including salaries, to miners, farmers, soldiers and others. So Russia will begin the year with a sizable bill -- some 5 trillion rubles, or $4 billion, -- in deferred payments. That is nearly 10 percent of G.N.P., which will push inflation up again no matter what decisions any new Government makes. STEVEN ERLANGER"

Considers Starting a Magazine for Gay Readers,THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Time Inc. Considers Starting a Magazine for Gay Readers," **********Time Inc. Ventures, the division of Time Inc. that develops new magazines, is looking into the possibility of starting a publication aimed at gay and lesbian readers. **********The concept was brought to the division by Maer Roshan, the former editor in chief of the short-lived QW, a magazine for gay men and lesbians that closed in late 1992 after its principal backer died of AIDS. The proposed magazine would include news, features and profiles, and would aim to encompass the spectrum of gay political opinion. **********Time Inc. officials emphasized that the idea is among five or six magazine proposals considered by the division at any given time and that most ideas do not make it into print. Still, the fact that a leading publishing company is seriously considering a gay publication shows the growth and potential financial strength of the category. **********""It is a project that has come before us and we are intrigued with the idea,"" Robert L. Miller, president of Time Inc. Ventures, said. ""We continue to analyze it and anticipate making a decision in the next two months as to whether it is a project we would want to involve ourselves with.""  Planning a Prototype **********People familiar with the proposed magazine say Time Inc. Ventures has provided $25,000 in seed money as well as management expertise to help develop a prototype. David H. Steward, general manager of Martha Stewart Living -- a magazine that came into being through the division -- is said to be working on a business plan. **********If the project receives the green light, a test issue would appear on newsstands this summer or early fall. Time Inc.

""What I keep envisioning is the power of the Time Warner sales force to present the gay and lesbian market to advertisers who have been very receptive to the idea of gay and lesbian consumers but very fearful of backlash."" A Growing Field **********Still unknown, of course, is the impact of a Time Inc. publication on existing magazines for gay men and lesbians. Among the magazines started in the last three years are Genre, Out, Ten Percent, Deneuve, Victory, Our World and Frontiers. The oldest of the publications is the 26-year-old Advocate. **********Roberta Garfinkle, senior vice president and director of print media for McCann-Erickson Worldwide, the advertising agency, said a magazine owned by Time Inc. would appeal to advertisers because the resources of a leading publisher would be behind it. But she said the real question about any magazine directed at a specific audience was, ""What are you going to do that is different, timely and different from what other magazines are providing?"" **********Mr. Roshan, who is 26, declined to comment on his proposed magazine. But colleagues say he has likened it to a gay New Republic and a gay Rolling Stone. He is apparently also aiming at a crossover audience -- readers who are not gay but might find the magazine interesting. **********Friends of Mr. Roshan say he wants to include provocative articles that some gay publications may find too discomforting. These might include pieces like the one Mr. Roshan ran in QW about increasing numbers of gay men having unsafe sex again. **********""It will not be an outing magazine,"" a person familiar with the project said. ""It will have mainstream journalistic standards with a gay sensibility."""

Volkswagen Advances In Its Battle With G.M."," **********Volkswagen A.G. won another round today in its running legal battle with General Motors when a German civil court ruled that VW had not broken the law by luring away seven former G.M. managers last March. **********The suit was filed last spring by Adam Opel A.G., G.M.'s German subsidiary. The seven managers left G.M. and Opel to join their former boss, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who abruptly left General Motors in Detroit, where he had been chief of purchasing, in March to head Volkswagen's production and purchasing. **********General Motors and Opel contend that Mr. Lopez and the seven employees systematically gathered and stole trade secrets, including the design for a new small car and detailed price lists for parts. Mr. Lopez and his colleagues have consistently denied committing any crimes.No End to Wrangling **********Today's ruling represents a minor victory in civil court for Volkswagen, but it is by no means the end of the legal wrangling between Europe's largest auto maker and its American counterpart. **********Both German prosecutors and the United States Justice Department are looking into General Motors' allegations that Mr. Lopez and his colleagues committed industrial espionage, and today's verdict will have no bearing on those investigations. **********Opel has also filed a separate lawsuit against Mr. Lopez accusing him of stealing proprietary information. That case is expected to come to court during the next two months. **********Last month, the Frankfurt Superior Court dismissed on a technicality an Opel request for an injunction to block the seven former managers from working for Volkswagen. **********In today's decision, Judge Gunther Kinnel of the Frankfurt State Court rejected Opel's contention that Volkswagen had gained an unfair competitive advantage by hiring the seven former G.M. managers. When the trial began last month, Opel's lawyer, Heinz Wetterkamp, argued that VW's move was part of a ""massive campaign"" in which VW tried to recruit as many as 28 managers from G.M.. **********Opel was seeking to have the seven managers banned from working for Volkswagen for two years, retroactive to the date they began.Argues No Damage to G.M. **********Volkswagen's lawyer, Jurgen Kicker, countered that the seven men who left had found themselves isolated after Mr. Lopez's departure and that this prompted them to follow their former boss. He argued that neither General Motors nor Opel had suffered material or legal damage because of their departure. **********The court ruled that Opel had not proved its case and said in a statement that hiring employees away from a competitor violated the law only if the new employer had dishonest motives and did not solely want to make use of the new worker's normal business skills. In this case, it found no sign of dishonesty. **********Acting under a German legal requirements that the losing party in a civil suit pay the bulk of court costs, Judge Kinnel said Opel would have to pay four-fifths of the legal costs of the case while Volkswagen would pay the remaining fifth. **********A spokesman for Volkswagen's board welcomed today's decision, and Mr. Kicker said that in his opinion it confirmed Volkswagen's claims that it had not used proprietary information from General Motors to gain a competitive advantage. Mr. Wetterkamp of Opel said the company would study the decision closely and then consider whether to appeal."

It authorized the prosecution of war criminals living anywhere in the United Kingdom, which comprises England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. **********The Scottish court's decision, however, will not affect the possible prosecution of suspected war criminals elsewhere in Britain. **********Three years ago, a parliamentary report in Britain suggested that there might be as many as 78 war criminals living there. **********The Scottish prosecutors made their decision despite a ruling in a 1992 civil libel case, in which a Scottish judge publicly described one of the suspects, Anthony Gecas, a 78-year-old Lithuanian, as a war criminal who had been involved in the killing of ""innocent Soviet citizens, including Jews in particular."" **********The judge's characterization came after Mr. Gecas, who settled in Scotland after the war and became a naturalized British citizen, lost a libel action against a Scottish television program. **********The broadcast documentary had accused him of taking part in war crimes while serving in a Lithuanian police battalion under German command in World War II. Further Prosecution Doubted **********In Jerusalem, Efraim Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, expressed his disappointment over the decision, and said he now doubted that any of more than 30 suspects who took up residence in Britain after the war would be prosecuted. **********""Prosecutors don't want to bring cases unless they can be 500 percent sure they will succeed, and no prosecutor can ever be that certain,"" Mr. Zuroff said."

The old valuation was based on the assumption that Macy would emerge from bankruptcy in July, while the new proposal expects it to come out next January, according to secured creditors who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Creditors generally were unhappy with Macy's plan, and the company is expected to submit a revised proposal on April 29. **********Under bankruptcy law, the claims of Macy's senior creditors, whose claims are secured by real estate and other assets, must be resolved before the unsecured creditors, which include bondholders and trade creditors, receive anything. Cash for Some Creditors **********The senior creditors' proposal allocates little to Macy's bondholders but sweetens the deal for the company's trade creditors -- suppliers and other vendors who were owed money when the retailer filed for bankruptcy in January 1992. The proposal offers them cash for their claims. **********Bondholders and trade creditors have contended that Macy is worth $4 billion or more. They say the secured creditors are placing a lower valuation on the company so that they will end up with its equity, which is likely to increase in value. **********Secured creditors presented their new proposal to Macy management on Thursday and said yesterday that it had been well received.

It declined to discuss the details of Gibson's charges. **********This is the first legal action by any of the half-dozen prominent companies that disclosed losses related to derivatives earlier this year. The Procter & Gamble Company, which said that it had lost $157 million in transactions also with Bankers Trust, said yesterday that it was still considering legal options. An Obligation Claimed **********The suit by Gibson, a greeting card company based in Cincinnati, argues that Bankers Trust had an obligation to disclose more fully the risks of the derivative transactions and perhaps to protect the company from them. It seeks $73 million in damages. **********Bankers Trust is expected to respond that as in most financial transactions among large corporations its derivatives dealings with Gibson were at arm's length. In other words, ""buyer beware."" **********Many derivatives experts sympathetize with Bankers Trust's position. ""It's just human nature when a trade goes against you, you find someone to blame,"" said Leslie Rawl, a partner in Capital Market Risk Advisers, a derivatives consulting firm in New York. **********She said a number of other companies posted losses related to derivatives but had not made them public. **********Like most large companies, Gibson had begun using a very common form of derivative known as an interest-rate swap in order to reduce the cost of its interest payments on the money it borrowed. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is based on, or derived from, an underlying financial asset like interest rates, in the case of swaps, or stocks or commodities. **********The lawsuit, filed in Federal court in Cincinnati, says the company was encouraged by Bankers Trust to enter into increasingly complex swap structures that were more speculative and volatile than Gibson realized. These contracts lost value rapidly this spring as interest rates began to rise sharply. **********In addition to large corporations, a number of mutual funds and other investors have found that this year's rising interest rates have caused more damage than expected to some derivatives and other complex financial concoctions like certain mortgage-backed securities that had been designed to profit from declining interest rates. **********The derivatives debacle at Procter & Gamble, for example, has shaken its upper management. Edwin Artzt, Procter & Gamble's chairman, said earlier this month that he had turned down $100,000 of his $420,000 annual bonus because of the derivatives losses. In addition, P.& G. disclosed yesterday that Raymond D. Mains, who had been the company's treasurer when the derivative transactions occurred, had retired as of Sept. 1. He had been on ""special assignment"" since the derivative problems emerged April, the company said. **********""We're not surprised Gibson has filed suit,"" Mr. Artzt said in a statement yesterday. 'Cheating' Charged **********In its complaint, Gibson describes itself as financially unsophisticated and dependent on Bankers Trust, which the company says is its ""lead bank"" for advice and guidance regarding a series of swaps meant to reduce the interest cost of $30 million of bonds that Gibson had issued. Gibson contended that Bankers knew that it had policies to maintain a conservative financial posture. **********The company accused Bankers Trust of ""cheating Gibson out of nearly $500,000"" in relation to several swap transactions that actually earned a profit in 1992. Gibson charges that Bankers paid it $260,000 to close out transactions that it subsequently learned to be worth $750,000. **********After that, the suit says, Bankers Trust ""recognized its opportunity for gain at the expense of an unknowing customer and, ignoring its obligation as Gibson's adviser and banker,"" solicited Gibson to enter at least 16 additional transactions. **********The suit also asserts that Bankers Trust ""knowingly and deliberately did not reveal the material risks and misrepresented the nature of the transactions and thereby deceived and defrauded Gibson."" **********At least one of those transactions committed Gibson to make a series of payments that would be determined by a formula involving taking the square of a common short-term interest rate known as Libor, for London interbank offered rate. By squaring the formula, Gibson's costs would increase rapidly as rates went up. Gibson says the disclosure of risks by Bankers Trust were inadequate. **********In particular, the company says that the bank's disclosure assumed that the transaction would be held to maturity and did not how the market value of the swaps could fall during their life. Gibson had planned to use an accounting treatment for the swaps that did not recognize changes their changes in value. **********But like executives at many other companies, Gibson's accountants changed their view when the market dropped and forced it to recognize its losses early. Gibson charges that Bankers Trust should have warned that its planned accounting treatment would be inadequate. **********Among other charges of impropriety, Gibson says that at 11 P.M. on March 3, Bankers Trust gave the company an ""ultimatum"" that it had to pay the bank $17.5 million by the next morning to cover losses on derivative transactions or enter into another transaction that would limit the company's losses to no more than $27.5 million. The company chose the loss-limiting transaction, which it later said publicly cost $3 million. **********Gibson is claiming actual damages of $23 million and punitive damages of $50 million."

They say the practice continues today. **********Though the Russians defend the practice as safe, it is at odds with accepted global standards for nuclear waste disposal and is contrary to what they have previously said they were doing. The disclosure has set off a debate among experts over the likely consequences of the radioactive injections, which some experts say represent a new kind of nuclear danger that might haunt the planet for centuries. **********The Russians told a small group of Western experts that Moscow had injected about half of all the nuclear waste it ever produced into the ground at three widely dispersed sites, all thoroughly wet and all near major rivers. **********The injections violate the accepted rules of nuclear-waste disposal, which require it to be isolated in impermeable containers for thousands of years. The Russian scientists claim the practice is safe because the wastes have been injected under layers of shale and clay, which in theory cut them off from the Earth's surface. **********But already the wastes at one site have leaked beyond the expected range and ""spread a great distance,"" the Russians told the small group of international scientists, who were handpicked to receive the news. The Russians did not say whether the distance was meters or kilometers or whether the poisons had reached the surface. **********Decades or centuries might pass before scientists know whether the injections are calamitous or benign. **********Some American experts say that in all likelihood things will work out favorably but that close study is prudent. ""Does it have the potential for impacting the environment in Russia and the world?"" said Dr. Clyde W. Frank, a top official of the Energy Department. ""We're a long way from understanding that. We're dealing with a long-term situation."" **********But others say the injections could be one of the deadliest assaults ever on the earth's environment. ""Far and away, this is the largest and most careless nuclear practice that the human race has ever suffered,"" said Dr. Henry W. Kendall, a Nobel laureate in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who learned of the injections while advising the Federal Government. ""It's just an enormous scale of irresponsibility."" **********Repeated efforts to reach Nikolai N. Yegorov, a high official of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and leader of the delegation that made the disclosure, were unsuccessful. **********The Russian experts say they began injecting the waste as a way to avoid the kind of surface-storage disasters that began to plague them in the 1950's. But by any measure, the injections were one of the cold war's darkest secrets. Moscow said nothing of large injections and dissembled publicly by claiming to stand by accepted standards for radioactive waste disposal. Moreover, the injections are yet another environmental black mark against Moscow, which before the disclosures was already being criticized for environmental recklessness. **********The three sites are at Dimitrovgrad near the Volga River, Tomsk near the Ob River, and Krasnoyarsk on the Yenisei River. The Volga flows into the Caspian Sea and the Ob and Yenisei into the Arctic Ocean. **********The amount of radioactivity injected by the Russians is up to three billion curies. By comparison, the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant released about 50 million curies of radiation, mostly in short-lived isotopes that decayed in a few months. The accident at Three Mile Island discharged about 50 curies. **********A curie is the amount of radiation given off by one gram of radium and, in any nuclear material, is equal to the disintegration of 37 billion atoms per second. An old-style luminous watch dial with 12 radium dots emitted about three one-thousandths of a curie of radiation. **********The injected wastes include cesium-137, with a half life of 30 years, and strontium-90, with a half life of 28 years and a bad reputation because it binds readily with human bones. A half life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay into atoms that are less complex and often less harmful to humans. **********The Russians are working with the Department of Energy, which runs America's nuclear complex, to try to better predict how far and fast the radioactive waste is likely to spread through aquifers. **********At best, the Russian waste may stay underground long enough to be rendered largely harmless by the process of radioactive decay. **********At worst, it might leak to the surface and produce regional calamities in Russia and areas downstream along the rivers. If the radioactivity spread through the world's oceans, experts say, it might prompt a global rise in birth defects and cancer deaths. **********The benign scenario is more likely than the calamitous one, many experts say. But uncertainties persist, partly because there are no comparative data on the large-scale injection of radioactive waste, diminishing the accuracy of forecasts. The Norm Safely Storing Radioactive Waste **********The alchemy at the heart of nuclear reactors is the main source of the world's radioactive waste. Uranium atoms split by nuclear fission form hundreds of different types of fragments, most of which are radioactive. Examples are cesium and strontium. In addition, atoms of uranium-238 can capture the speeding subatomic particles known as neutrons and metamorphose into heavier elements like plutonium-239, which is also radioactive. **********Liquid waste arises when factories take highly irradiated fuel rods and mine them for such valuables as plutonium, which can fuel nuclear bombs and reactors. The first step is to dissolve a fuel rod in acid. After the plutonium is extracted, the leftovers constitute a witches' brew of poisons. **********The mining procedure is done by or for most advanced nuclear states, including France, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. The United States, which eschews the reprocessing of civilian fuel rods, mined military ones during the cold war. **********At the start of the nuclear era America injected some of its liquid waste into the ground at its Hanford Reservation in Washington state, but the radiation levels were low and only one of nine wells reached down to the water table, said Dr. Donald D. Wodrich, an official of the Westinghouse Hanford Co., which manages the site. In terms of curies, he said, the total radiation was ""tens of thousands or less."" **********A different method was tried at the Oak Ridge complex in Tennessee. Liquid waste was mixed with cement and injected deep into shale formations, where the mix spread out into thin pancakes. Steven L. Wyatt, an Oak Ridge spokesman, said some 1.4 million curies of radioactive waste were injected between 1959 and 1984, after which the method was dropped because of environmental worries and the discovery of radioactivity in observation wells. **********Save these exceptions, the United States has stored its liquid radioactive waste above ground, mainly in big steel tanks, awaiting solidification and permanent disposal -- the preferred method worldwide. The Hanford site in Washington has 177 tanks holding 57 million gallons of waste with a strength of about 360 million curies. **********Eventually, all the waste is to be solidified into glass or ceramic blocks and stored underground in dry, man-made caverns. The candidate site in the United States is a desert ridge in southern Nevada known as Yucca Mountain, which in theory is to be honeycombed with storage tunnels and open for business in 2010. By American law, the waste is to be isolated from ground water and the general environment for 10,000 years, until radioactive decay has rendered them less hazardous. **********It had always been thought that virtually all nations that generate highly radioactive waste planned similar methods of disposal. In general, the aim of all storage is to keep waste away from ground water and the possible contamination of people. The Rumors Radiation Dangers Were Hushed Up **********During the cold war, the Soviet Union made about 55,000 nuclear warheads, the vast majority with plutonium recovered from irradiated fuel rods. The Soviets mined both civil and military fuel rods and mixed the waste. Publicly, Soviet scientists said tests had been conducted of low-level waste injections, like those at Hanford, but declared the general goal of solidifying liquid radioactive waste for burial in deep, dry caverns. **********As the cold war ended, the Russians began to detail a series of atomic tragedies. The Kyshtym disaster of 1957 turned out to be the explosion of a liquid-waste holding tank near the Urals that sent aloft a radioactive cloud 20 million curies strong. Lake Karachai, at the same site, was purposely filled with 120 million curies of radioactive waste, making it the most contaminated spot on the earth's surface. **********Soon, rumors swirled in the Russian news media about large injections of radioactive wastes beneath the earth. In 1993, a group known as the Tomsk Ecological Initiative, based near one of the Siberian injection sites, said that major faults there were sending radioactive waste up toward surface waters, posing a grave ""threat of contamination."" **********Despite rising angst, Russian scientists spoke increasingly freely about the injections, especially to sympathetic American peers. Talks took place between the Energy Department and its Russian counterpart, the Ministry of Atomic Energy. **********Responding to such reports, the Energy Department began to analyze how poisoned water might move through the West Siberian basin, where Lake Karachai and two injection sites are located. Last April, an 80-page study was circulated within the Government by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, an arm of the Energy Department. **********""Nuclear fuel cycle activities of the former Soviet Union have resulted in massive contamination,"" it said, adding that the goal of the study was ""to help determine future environmental and human impacts."" **********The study noted that the West Siberian basin, though very stable geologically, is also very wet, raising serious questions about its potential as a path for the distribution of watery poisons. The Disclosure Russian Scientists Shock Americans **********In May, Russian scientists addressed a small scientific conference held at the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, in California. They were apparently ready to address the issue publicly amid growing rumors about the injections as Russian society became more open. The four-day international meeting was sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department and was specifically designed as a forum for the Russian disclosures, its organizers say. The Federal and private attendees were all experts in deep injection, which is studied and used globally for the disposal of non-radioactive waste. **********Eleven Russians attended the meeting, including Mr. Yegorov, a Deputy Minister of the Atomic Ministry. They presented five papers written by more than a dozen scientists, among them E. I. Mikerin of the Atomic Ministry, E. V. Zakharova of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and A. I. Rybalchenko of the Scientific Research and Design Institute for Industrial Technology in Moscow. **********The injections began more than three decades ago as a safety precaution after the Kyshtym disaster and a string of other calamities drove home the dangers of surface storage, the papers said. No mention was made of the method's cost, which is undoubtedly quite low compared with those usually used by Western nations. Four possible sites were investigated but only three were found to be geologically suitable. **********The preferred stratum for deep injection, one paper said, was porous sandstone covered by abundant layers of shale or clay, which were seen as good barriers to upward migration. Possible leakage routes, it said, would be along ""permeable tectonic faults"" or sandy regions where wastes could filter through. **********""The protection of the human population from the effects of radioactivity is the principal goal,"" one paper declared. **********A main result of the injections, said another, is that ""the health of thousands of people has been protected and their life spans prolonged."" **********The wells used to inject the material were described as working like oil or water wells, only in reverse, pumping fluids deep into the Earth, usually under high pressure, rather than pumping them out. The radioactive fluids went directly into underground formations -- not into cement mixes or steel liners. **********It appears that in most cases shallow geological strata were used for low-level wastes and deeper strata for stronger ones, some of which are exceedingly hot. To a certain extent, spreading is controlled by pumping out water from peripheral areas, creating low-pressure spots that draw wastes in desired directions. The papers said water samples are routinely taken from wells outside the injection areas to hunt for signs of radioactivity. **********Dimitrovgrad, a nuclear site near an arm of the Volga River, has the deepest injection wells of all. They range from about 3,600 feet down to 4,600 feet, or almost a mile. **********Unexpectedly, a paper said, the waste injected into one zone ""penetrated a thin limestone layer with formation fractures and spread a great distance."" It gave no other details, such as whether the spread was horizontal or vertical or both. Nor were details given of the amounts injected at Dimitrovgrad, which Western experts said might be small. **********The largest injections apparently took place at Tomsk, a sprawling nuclear complex. A Russian paper said they amounted to 30 million cubic meters, or about 8 billion gallons. In comparison, the reservoir in Central Park in New York City holds about 1 billion gallons. The injections were at depths of about 800 feet to about 1,200 feet. **********The shallowest injections of all look place at Krasnoyarsk, near the east bank of the Yenisei River. Liquid waste was pumped to depths of about 650 feet and 1,400 feet deep. The total injected volume was 1.2 billion gallons. **********In one well, temperatures reached 356 degrees Fahrenheit -- hot enough to melt lithium or sulfur -- before cooling was achieved by the addition of low-level liquid radioactive waste, a paper said. **********The natural flow of water in the shallow strata at Krasnoyarsk is about 500 feet a year and in the deep strata is about 10 feet per year. These rates, a paper said, provide for ""subsurface retention"" of liquid wastes for 300 and 1,000 years respectively. **********Overall, injections at the three sites disposed of ""about half of all the radioactive materials produced in Russia as a result of activities of the atomic industry,"" one paper's abstract said. **********The Russians gave the most sensitive numbers orally at the meeting or in private talks with American scientists. **********The current radioactivity of the injected wastes is 1.45 billion curies, they said. That means that the original injections, before radioactive decay over the years and decades, had a strength of up to three billion curies of long-lived isotopes. **********""They spilled their guts,"" recalled Dr. Michael G. Foley, a geologist at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory who attended the meeting. ""It was incredible."" The Aftermath Experts Divided On Ramifications **********Predicting how the waste will move through the ground is a difficult job at best. There are many variables requiring complex calculations of geochemistry and hydrology. Experts, their opinions at times seemingly colored by their nuclear views, are divided on whether to expect sunny skies or fierce storms in the unfamiliar land of radioactive injection. **********Dr. John A. Apps, a geochemist at Lawrence Berkeley who was cochairman of the meeting, said the Russian papers undoubtedly gave ""a rosier perspective"" than actually exists. ""You can smell it,"" he said, noting oblique references in the papers to failed drill casings and the occasional use of existing wells rather than new ones drilled specifically for radioactive wastes. **********Even so, he said he expected the injected waste is ""not going to become a big issue."" It might stay put, he said, and if leaks occur they might be controlled by containment dams or surface pumping. The biggest danger, he said, was that waste might find its way into ancient, buried river beds and spread undetected. ""That would be a very serious problem,"" he said. **********Dr. Apps added that environmental restoration of the injection sites was unlikely given the costs. **********""One can conceive of immensely expensive efforts,"" he said. ""But practically, the formations will be contaminated until the primary fission products are decayed -- five or six hundred years. Remediation would be prohibitively costly."" **********Dr. Frank of the Energy Department said the injections were not as troubling as they might seem since many companies and countries have safely pumped toxic substances -- though not radioactive ones -- into the ground. ""Injection is not brain surgery,"" he said. ""There's a lot of technical data associated with this kind of thing."" With Russia, he said, the key questions are ""Is it too much? Is it in the wrong place?"" **********B. Suzi Ruhl, president of the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation, a public-interest law firm in Tallahassee, Fla., that monitors the injection of hazardous wastes in the United States, expressed shock at the shallowness of the Russian wells. In Florida, she said, injection wells were typically 1,500 to 2,000 feet deep, and in Texas they were up to 6,000 feet deep, or more than a mile. **********""It's amazing,"" she said of the Russian injections. ""I thought I'd heard everything."" **********Dr. Foley of the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, who is a hydrologist, said the injection sites had to be studied carefully to assess their potential for dangerous leaks. A key issue is to what extent cesium and strontium will bind with local clays and minerals, he said, slowing their rate of spread through the local aquifers. **********The existence of worrisome faults, as the Tomsk ecologists claimed, was unsurprising, he added, saying faults appear in any ""block of rock big enough for a house or a building."" Only further study would reveal their presence and whether they might block or promote the leakage of wastes. **********The Russians, Dr. Foley said, have no computers powerful enough to do intensive modeling of local water-flow patterns. One item on the cooperative agenda is how to conduct such studies, he said. **********Dr. Kendall of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has received high-level Federal briefings on the injections, said there was reason for immediate worry. ""They misjudged the geology, and some of the wastes are on the way back to the surface,"" he said, adding that there was a real possibility of the waste ""getting into the food chain."" **********Ultimately, Dr. Kendall said, the magnitude of the danger would depend on the flow rates of underground waters. ""Typically those flows are not very fast,"" he said. ""But you can get surprises. That's the thing that scares you -- nasty surprises."" **********Dr. Charles B. Archambeau, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado, said: ""It's down there and it's done. They put it close to these rivers -- that's the big danger -- that it will seep in there over time, that cancer rates and all kinds of other things will go up."" **********Whether hundreds, thousands or millions of people would be affected is uncertain because of the lack of waste-constituent data and the wealth of possible leakage scenarios. Experts say a big release is unlikely given the odds of slow leaks and the fact that waste potency will continue to drop because of radioactive decay. **********Deadly or benign, the injections ultimately have to be judged in the context of the cold war and a bureaucracy in Moscow driven by a desperate desire to maintain parity with the West, said Dr. Apps of Lawrence Berkeley. **********""A lot of compromises were made that will come back to haunt them,"" he said."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, White House officials said the United States would grant asylum interviews to potential refugees on United States vessels in the Caribbean or at sites in other countries in the region. **********Administration officials said they had not yet decided which countrieswould be asked to receive the refugees for processing. They have considered and rejected approaching Honduras and Guyana. **********Refugees deemed not eligible for asylum would be returned to Haiti. **********Shortly before he took office last year, Mr. Clinton announced that he would continue the Bush Administration's policy of intercepting boats filled with fleeing Haitians and forcibly returning the refugees to Haiti without a hearing. During the presidential campaign he had described that policy, instituted in May 1992, as cruel.. **********When he decided to adopt the Bush Administration's approach, President Clinton defended his action by saying that allowing Haitians to land would encourage thousands more to risk their lives on the high seas. **********But a senior White House official said that recent developments in Haiti, including reports of a renewed wave of military terror and killings, had forced a reconsideration. **********""The situation in Haiti has become more violent, and the Government more repressive,"" a senior White House official said today. ""Our concern has increased about that percentage of people who take to the boats who have a justifiable claim for political refugee status."" **********The official said that no more than 10 percent of Haitians who now apply for asylum at processing centers in Haiti are found to be eligible, and that the United States does not expect this to change. **********Many have been judged to be economic refugees. Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere, and international sanctions adopted after the 1991 coup against Father Aristide have aggravated the deprivation faced by ordinary people. **********In settling on the new approach, which officials expect to announce formally on Sunday and put in place in about two weeks, Mr. Clinton is reviving a formula that the United States used from 1982 to 1992 but discontinued, in part because interviews conducted on Coast Guard vessels were considered unreliable. **********Human rights campaigners had also raised concerns about shipboard reviews because of living conditions aboard the smaller Coast Guard vessels. **********This time, officials said, the processing will take place on board larger Navy ships that can better accommodate the individual asylum hearings. The White House remains opposed to reopening the processing center at the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, used in the first few months after the September 1991 coup. **********The options approved today allow the White House to address the immediate issue without encouraging a flood of Haitians to set out for Florida. **********The change of policy comes as part of a general re-examination of Haiti policy, which the President has recently said must be revised.  A Storm of Protest **********Over the last few weeks, the Administration's 16-month-old approach to the Haiti question has stirred wrath among members of Congress, who have called for a military invasion, a suspension of the direct return policy and an extension of an oil embargo to cover nearly all trade with Haiti. **********The Clinton Administration's policy on forcible repatriation of refugees has also angered Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected President, who has lived in exile in the United States since he was ousted by the Haitian military. **********On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to tighten the embargo in response to a call by the United States for tougher action to press the military to let Father Aristide return.  Hunger Strike by Robinson **********Mr. Clinton had also been asked to abandon the repatriation policy by Randall Robinson, the executive director of the TransAfrica Foundation, who has been fasting for nearly a month in an effort to step up pressure on Mr. Clinton to change the policy. He has lost 12 pounds from his 6-foot 5-inch, 195-pound frame on a diet of juice and water and was treated briefly in a hospital for dehydration this week. **********Asked about the change in policy today, Mr. Robinson only responded: ""I hope that the Administration will change course but, of course, I can't respond until I hear it officially from the Administration."" **********Administration officials had considered and rejected shipboard or third-country hearings just two weeks ago. Holding hearings in another country was then considered too expensive and unwieldy, and officials questioned whether the country involved would be able to deport the refugees who were denied asylum. **********Administration officials who have spoken with Mr. Robinson said today that his condition played some role in their decision to revise the policy now. But they also stressed that the White House had been reviewing it for more than a month and did not negotiate with Mr. Robinson. **********Mr. Clinton met for three and a half hours today with Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Defense Secretary William Perry, Madeleine K. Albright, the American delegate to the United Nations, and other senior aides. Limits of New Policy **********The aides emphasized afterward that the change in policy did not mean the United States would open its docks to any Haitian fleeing the nation for economic or other reasons unrelated to political persecution. **********""We don't want any Haitian to believe he or she can get a better deal by taking to boats instead of going to internal processing centers,"" a White House official said. ""This is not an easier way to get in."" **********American officials have abandoned efforts at achieving Father Aristide's return through negotiations and have recently begun hinting in public that they would consider using force to oust Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military leader. Cool to Proposal on Island **********Some human rights groups have supported creating a safe haven on Ile de la Gonave, off the Haitian coast, for people fleeing persecution. But the Administration rejected that last year because it would require building installations and American military occupation of Haitian territory. **********Father Aristide said in an interview conducted before Mr. Clinton's meeting today that American policy would have to shift to take into account the latest repression in Haiti. **********""Our Haitians cannot flee political repression,"" he said on the CNN program ""Both Sides"" with Jesse Jackson. ""The U.S. vessels are around our island. And when they escape, they send our refugees back to this house on fire after seeing 5,000 killed by the military."""

Officials See Hurdles In Curbing Stern's Employer,THE MEDIA BUSINESS; F.C.C. Officials See Hurdles In Curbing Stern's Employer," **********Pointing to a recent court decision that struck down Federal restrictions on indecent broadcasting, officials at the Federal Communications Commission said today that they might not be able to stop the company that employs Howard Stern, the radio personality, from buying more stations. **********Mr. Stern's chief critic at the F.C.C., James H. Quello, a commissioner, conceded today that the commission would face big legal obstacles in any attempt to block the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Stern's employer, from buying three radio stations for $170 million. **********Last week, the commission turned aside pleas by Infinity executives and delayed approving the company's application to buy the three stations. But an outright denial of the transactions now seems unlikely. **********""I don't think we can use the withholding of a license as a sanction in itself,"" Mr. Quello said. **********Mr. Quello, who has tried to block Infinity's plans for expansion, said the deals could be stopped only by trying to revoke all of Infinity's radio licenses -- an unlikely move that would lead to a long court fight. **********The commission has been locked in a running battle with Infinity over Mr. Stern's raucous scatological broadcasts and discussions of topics like the size of sexual organs and masturbation. Since 1990, the commission has imposed about $1.2 million in fines on Infinity. The company is challenging the fines in court and has yet to pay them. **********Infinity Broadcasting executives and Mr. Stern declined to comment on the issue today. **********In December, Infinity executives said that a delay on at least one acquisition past Jan. 1 would cost it millions of dollars because of financial penalties in its contract to buy a Los Angeles station, KRTH-FM, for $110 million. In addition to the deal to buy the Los Angeles station, Infinity is trying to buy two stations near Washington, WPGC-AM and WPGC-FM, for $60 million. **********Infinity, which is based in New York, owns 20 stations in big cities and has been one of the most aggressive buyers of radio stations. Class A shares of Infinity closed at $29.25 today, up 50 cents, in Nasdaq trading. On Dec. 30, the day before it was reported that the F.C.C. had delayed the two deals, the stock closed at $33.25. Dispute Within F.C.C. **********Other officials of the commission are unhappy about remarks Mr. Quello made last week to reporters.  Aides to two commissioners, Ervin S. Duggan and Andrew C. Barrett, disputed Mr. Quello's contention that they had agreed to delay a decision on Infinity simply because of new complaints against Mr. Stern's. Rather, they said, the decision was held up because the commission was still analyzing a recent Federal court decision on indecency rules. **********""It's not clear that the administrative process holds room for holding up a decision because there are complaints pending,"" Mr. Barrett's aide said. ""It's not something we would contemplate."" **********Mr. Quello said today that his earlier remarks were ""absolutely accurate"" and that he had an informal agreement to delay action from both Mr. Barrett and Mr. Duggan until the F.C.C. resolves two new complaints stemming from several of Mr. Stern's shows last summer. **********On Friday, the commission's general counsel is expected to provide the commissioners with a review of options on Infinity, ranging from an outright dismissal of the new complaints against Mr. Stern to an effort to revoke one or more licenses that Infinity already holds.  Hands Tied by Court **********But Mr. Quello and other F.C.C. officials say they now believe that a decision last month by the United States Court of Appeals here makes it very difficult to pursue more Draconian measures, like blocking the station acquisitions. **********The F.C.C. has defined indecent programming as material that is ""patently offensive"" as measured by contemporary community standards for broadcasting and that depicts ""sexual or excretory activities or organs."" Under its most recent rules, indecent programming was barred between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M. **********Last month, however, the Court of Appeals rejected those rules as unconstitutional and overly broad.  Among other things, the court said the commission had failed to justify its rules and could adopt a new enforcement program only after a ""full and fair hearing."" **********At a minimum, that requires the F.C.C. to limit the time of day when indecent programming is prohibited and requires it to demonstrate more clearly that children are in the audience before prohibiting a particular program from being broadcast. Balancing Adult Rights **********Lawyers for broadcasters say the decision goes even further, noting that it requires the commission to find some way to balance the rights of adults against the responsibilities to children. **********Mr. Quello said today that with or without the court ruling, the commission did not have the authority to block Infinity from buying additional stations unless it found that the company was unfit to be a broadcaster. That would mean beginning a process to revoke all of Infinity's radio licenses, something that would be fought by Infinity at every step. **********Besides challenging the F.C.C. fines, Infinity has hired the Washington lobbying firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow to plead its case."

But the two American F-16C's that attacked Serbian positions outside the besieged town of Gorazde crossed a major political boundary. **********The attacks marked the first time that air power has been used against Serbian positions in Bosnia, as well as the first time in the 45-year history of the NATO alliance that it has ever carried out a bombing raid. It also represents an important milestone for the Clinton Administration. **********With this strike, NATO has not only demonstrated its determination to protect United Nations personnel under fire and taken action to protect the 65,000 people trapped in Gorazde, but it has also refocused the debate over the use of air power in Bosnia that has divided Administration officials. **********""This is a clear expression of the will of NATO and the will of the United Nations,"" President Clinton said at the White House, referring to the air strikes. ""We have said we would act if we were requested to do so. We have now done so and we will do so again if we are requested."" **********Just last week, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the United States would not ""enter the war"" to stop Gorazde from falling into Serbian hands. But now, under the guise of protecting United Nations peacekeepers, United Nations commanders have called on American air power to do just that. **********Mr. Perry said today that he strongly supported the request from the United Nations commander in Bosnia for air strikes and asserted that his earlier comments had been misinterpreted. **********""We need to take a hard look on Monday and see what happened,"" Mr. Perry said in a telephone interview. ""If they stop shelling, we can believe that one demonstration of air power had a very large effect. If they don't, we expect General Rose to request more air support, and we are ready to do it."" **********While the stated purpose of the strikes was to protect the handful of United Nations observers and refugee officials in Gorazde, Clinton Administration officials said they hoped they would also serve the larger purpose of stopping the Serbian advance.  [ Page A6. ] **********""Basically it is, according to the U.N. resolution, to protect the Unprofor personnel,"" Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate at the United Nations, told CNN, referring to the United Nations peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. ""But the point is that it's very important for this attack to stop, for there to be a withdrawal of forces, and that the talks for the cessation of hostilities go on and then that we can move on to a comprehensive settlement."" **********Another senior Clinton Administration official said, ""The air strikes hopefully will have a broader deterrent effect than protecting a couple of dozen people already in there."" **********In the past, the Serbs have backed down when confronted by credible threats of NATO military power. That was clearly the hope today, but by this evening, no one could be sure how the Serbs would respond or if further strikes would be needed. Nonetheless, the authorization for more air strikes is already in place under United Nations guidelines. Tens of Thousands Killed **********The air strikes today come against the background of a two-year war in which tens of thousands of Bosnia have died while the West debated the value of air power to stop Serbian advances on the ground. Previously, the West has taken two limited steps to protect the Muslims in Gorazde: the establishment an artillery-free zone around Sarajevo and the threat to shoot down warplanes violating the ban on flights over Bosnia. **********While those steps worked, the open question -- much debated within the Clinton Administration and among military specialists -- was whether the use of air power might be expanded to protect other enclaves encircled by Bosnian Serb forces. **********For weeks, the Pentagon has argued that it was difficult, if not impossible, to protect additional Muslim enclaves because the terrain surrounding them was different from Sarajevo and the Serbian weapons positions surrounding them were not easy to locate and target. **********Neither Defense Secretary Perry nor General John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ever ruled out the use of air power to protect United Nations personnel in Gorazde. But the thrust of their comments was to play down the utility of air strikes to silence the Serb tanks, artillery and small arms firing at the city. **********Today's NATO action, however, puts to the test the theory that air strikes could be expanded to protect other Muslim towns and back up American diplomacy. **********Western officials said today's attack was launched after Serbian forces surrounding Gorazde renewed their attacks on the town, after having occupied the high ground overlooking the city. The Serbs had already been warned by the United Nations to pull back from their positions after some United Nations personnel in Gorazde were wounded by Serb fire. **********The commander of the United Nations military in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, requested a NATO air strike, and his request was relayed up the United Nations chain of command and eventually to NATO. **********Last month, it took more than three hours for his United Nations superiors to approve a similar request by General Rose for NATO strikes to defend French peacekeepers near Bihac, allowing the Serbs to attack and then pull back. But this time the request was approved within an hour. **********Two F-16C's carried out the attack under the direction of a United Nations air controller in Gorazde. United Nations and American officials said a strike had been carried out against a Serbian command post on the outskirts of the town that was surrounded by artillery. American officials said the American fighter-bombers had also hoped to hit tanks attacking the town but that bad weather had made attacks on the tanks difficult. **********""There has been great concern about whether the U.N. had the will to actually pull the trigger and it did,"" a senior Western diplomat said. ""The U.N. did it by the book. The procedure worked well. It shows this thing can actually work."" 'Clear Call to the Serbs' **********The expeditious use of the United Nation command and control procedures for calling in air strikes was an important demonstration for the Administration as it seeks to persuade a nervous Congress to agree to the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers once a peace settlement is reached. **********The larger question is whether the strikes will provide Washington with the diplomatic leverage it needs to complete the accord, a hope expressed by President Clinton today. **********Summing up the episode, Mr. Clinton described the attack as ""a clear call to the Serbs to pull pull back from Gorazde and resume the negotiations."""

This year, through March 31, the NAREIT index has gained 3.4 percent, while the S&P 500 turned in a loss of nearly 3.8 percent. **********Analysts say the strong showing by REITs has much to do with the overall U.S. recovery, but also with a positive backlash in the long-troubled real-estate sector. **********""We're just coming out of a long recession, perhaps even a depression in real estate,"" said Cathy Creswell, a REIT analyst at the brokerage Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. ""The feeling in the market is that rents are rising, especially in the apartment sector, and that occupancy is increasing as well, which will create a need for space. REITs and their shareholders should benefit from these trends."" **********""We were among the first to start pounding the table on REITs,"" she added. ""They make sense not only for the individual investor, but for the real-estate industry as well. Things are moving more from the private into the public market."" **********SOME ANALYSTS say that REITs hold the key to a largely untapped market. According to some estimates, as much as 30 percent of property in Europe and Asia is owned by shareholders, compared with only 1 percent in the United States. Some see the market capitalization of REITs, now about $25 billion, rising to $200 billion by the end of the decade on their confidence that more retail and institutional investors will discover REITs. One of the hurdles to that goal, however, may be the relatively low profile of REITs compared to mainstream securities. **********Generally speaking, REITs develop, buy and operate residential and commercial properties, such as apartment complexes and shopping centers. They derive most of their income from rent and mortgage payments. Like typical equities, shares in REITs are traded on major stock exchanges. **********But that is where many of the similarities end. By law, REITs must pay out 100 percent of their taxable net income to shareholders in the form of dividends. That is the way they were designed - as ""conduit"" securities - when they came into being in 1960. It also is why they are known as a ""yield-bearing"" stock. **********Moreover, compared with such instruments as certificates of deposit or one-year Treasury bills, REIT yields are looking fairly attractive. According to Alex. Brown & Sons, the average annual dividend yield for shares bought in a REIT on March 31 will be 6.93 percent. **********Some analysts caution private investors against investing in young REITs. **********""With the IPOs, individual investors frankly have no better hope than to have a very educated broker who has a highly educated analyst who has either done the analysis himself or listened to an expert,"" said Brant Baber, a partner with Baber & Kalinowski, a law firm in Fairfax, Virginia, that specializes in real-estate finance and securities. **********But with more established REITs, Mr. Baber said, ""You can really look and get a feel based upon what they've done and how their stock has performed."" He added, ""Their past has often plotted the trajectory for their future."" **********Among such established REITs now highly recommended by a consensus of analysts are Federal Realty Investment Trust, based in Maryland; Equity Residential Properties Trust, based in Chicago, and Merry Land & Investment Co., based in Florida. **********Post Properties Inc. and JDN Realty Corp., both based in Atlanta, also are appearing on many analysts' ""buy"" lists. **********Adam Markman, an analyst for Green Street Advisers, a California firm specializing in REIT analysis, said that although the REIT industry had gone through several periods of growth and collapse in the past, today's REITs were safer. **********""One of the most significant differences is that balance sheets now show very low levels of leverage, with debt typically at about 30 percent,"" he said. ""That's a lot different than in the old days when things were primarily debt-driven."" **********An old criticism of REITs has been that they are highly sensitive to rising interest rates. Such a concern might seem particularly relevant in today's interest-rate climate. **********But Miss Creswell played down the interest-rate factor. ""With the economy in recovery, REITs hope that higher rental incomes will offset the effects of higher costs of borrowing,"" she said."

Doug Kennett. All the injuries, including those to the 45 Haitians, were minor, Colonel Kennett said. **********About 120 Haitians scaled double rolls of concertina wire and tried to escape by swimming a mile-and-a-half across Guantanamo Bay, but were picked up by Coast Guard and Navy ships. **********Refugee advocate groups said the clash was the culmination of weeks of growing unrest among the Haitians at the camps, who have complained of having no jobs, no recreational activities, no reading material and no way to make contact with friends and family back in Haiti. **********""This was largely inspired by the situation of hopelessness and indefinite detention,"" said Arthur C. Helton, director of migration programs for the Open Society Institute in New York. ""There are no activities for detainees, and most of them are frankly bewildered."" **********Pentagon officials could not explain why it took the military more than two days to release information about the violence, the worst disturbance since the military built the tent cities in early July. **********""We were trying to consolidate the information,"" said Lieut. Col. Baxter Ennis, a spokesman for the United States Atlantic Command in Norfolk, Va., which operates the camps at Guantanamo Bay. But Colonel Baxter acknowledged that the command was ""looking into"" why news of the incident was delayed. **********Against the warnings of refugee advocates, the Clinton Administration has decided that for now it is cheaper and more convenient to keep the 15,458 Haitians at Guantanamo Bay rather than spending tens of millions of dollars building and operating camps in other countries that have offered temporary ""safe haven"" to refugees fleeing political persecution. **********Military officials gave this account of what happened: The uproar started about at 9 A.M. Saturday when several hundred Haitians in one of the four camps began to protest their living conditions by singing and chanting political slogans. The chanting quickly spread to the three other camps, ultimately involving about 750 Haitians. **********About 120 Haitians from the camp where the demonstration started clambered over the razor-sharp wire and dashed the few dozen yards from the converted air strip to the bay waters. Refugees in the other camps also tried to flee, pelting American military police officers with whatever debris was handy. Backed by reinforcements, the police quelled the disturbance about at 1 P.M."

The Kvaerner Group, a Norwegian industrial company with extensive experience in hydro-electric power, and Asea Brown Boveri, an electrical equipment maker with Swedish roots, are the principal owners of Mount Hope Hydro Inc., an American company that is seeking to build a pumped storage electric generating plant here, taking advantage of the area's industrial heritage, its proximity to New York and the hard, monolithic rock below the ground. **********The leaders of the project say that technological advances in generating equipment, particularly the ability of generators to go from a standing start to full power in less than 15 seconds, compared with 3 to 5 minutes for standard combustion turbines, means the plant could provide reserves and balance for the electrical grids in the mid-Atlantic area. **********""Most existing pumped storage units were designed in the 1950's and 1960's, and technology has moved on,"" said Frank S. Fisher, the president of Mount Hope Hydro. ""There are machines now capable of working at much greater pressures and with a much faster response capability."" **********The Mount Hope project has been pending in one form or another since 1972, when it became clear that deep-pit mining was losing out to lower-cost open-pit mines. **********Pumped storage plants are a means of dealing with the troublesome nature of electricity: it must be consumed as it is generated and is difficult to store. Because the demand for power varies during the day, a pumped storage plant uses cheap, nighttime electricity to pump water uphill and then lets it flow downhill, spinning generators to produce electricity during demand peaks. **********Such a plant is a net consumer of electricity because not all the energy in the falling water is converted into electricity and power must be imported to pump it uphill. Studies of the Mount Hope project predict that for every 78 kilowatt hours of electricity produced, 100 kilowatt hours will have to be imported for pumping. A kilowatt will power a thousand 100-watt lightbulbs at once. **********But utilities often strain to meet demand on summer afternoons, while big generators operate at inefficiently low levels at night; so the energy imbalance is considered tolerable. **********THE problem with many pumped storage units is they often involve rivers or lakes, where big variations in the water levels interfere with recreation and can have a harmful impact on the environment. Consolidated Edison struggled for 17 years to build a pumped storage plant on the Hudson River at Storm King Mountain in Cornwall, N.Y., before bowing to public and government resistance in 1980. **********Mount Hope is designed to overcome environmental and asthetic objections by being situated almost entirely underground. When it is filled, it will be a closed-loop system, with the same water used over and over, so there should be no impact on surface waterways. **********Mount Hope Hydro has a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency to build the plant, which will cost about $2 billion. But it still lacks an important element for any industrial undertaking: customers. No electric utility has signed up to buy power from the project, though several are studying it. **********And the economics have been questioned by Jeffrey Williams, strategist with the PJM Interconnect Association, the regional pool that coordinates power generation for eight utilities in the mid-Atlantic area. ""Pumped storage shifts costs from day to night,"" he said. ""But right now, the difference in cost between night and day are not that great."" **********Mr. Fisher of Mount Hope Hydro said talks were under way with several potential power users as well as utilities and that some announcements might be made soon. He must begin construction by August 1996, after which the Federal permit will expire. **********The original design incorporated the 2,400-foot-deep main shaft of the New Leonard iron mine, abandoned in 1979, as access for power cables. But a revision was forced by environmental and community objections to another part of the plan: use of the artificial Mount Hope Lake as the upper reservoir. The current design calls for the construction of a 55-acre, 1.6 billion-gallon reservoir at a nearby rock quarry. It would be connected to underground generating equipment through a 2,800-foot vertical shaft -- the equivalent of two and a quarter Empire State buildings stacked on top of each other. **********The half-mile plunge would give the water enough energy to drive six turbines and generators putting out at maximum of 2,000 megawatts -- the equivalent of nuclear power plant. Because the system would be closed, it could be turned on and off as needed, a luxury not enjoyed by most pumped storage units. **********THE lower reservoir would be a series of tunnels in the dense granite rock at the 2,500-foot level that would have the same capacity as the upper reservoir. The turbines and generators would be reversible, acting as both motors and pumps. **********The developers said the location close to New York gave them an opportunity to sell power in an area with relatively high rates. And they said Mount Hope's long industrial history was essential to overcoming the local objections that had made it difficult to find sites for power plants. **********The water in the upper reservoir could run the plant at full power for about five hours, but Mr. Fisher doubted it would be run at full power steadily. A more efficient way would be to operate intermittently, he said. That way, the plant would be available to provide power quickly if a conventional plant shut down. **********But the hydro-electric plant could also increase the operating efficiency of utilities by feeding power into grids until demand increased enough to justify starting a conventional plant. Similarly, as demand declined, Mount Hope could supply electricity so that generating plants did not have to operate at inefficiently low levels."

A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********""The relentlessly robust economic data this week swept away investors' earlier doubt that the expansion has regained momentum,"" said John Lipsky, the chief economist for Salomon Brothers. ""The uptick in activity raises the ante for the Fed as well. The dollar's new swoon also adds to pressure on the Fed to act decisively."" **********The latest MMS International survey shows third-quarter forecasts continuing to creep higher, with the median among economists now up to 2.8 percent, from 2.5 percent a week ago. **********Traders said the modest comeback in bonds on Friday was supported by commodities prices, which retreated from their increase on Thursday. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities futures fell 2.28 points, to 231.63. **********""Today's behavior certainly underscores what a sour mood this market is in,"" said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International. ""The market was due for a corrective bounce after such sharp declines this week, but today's meager rebound fizzled out."" **********Mr. Hale predicted that the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bellwether issue should move well above 8 percent in the near future. He noted that next week's Treasury auctions would add to the supply and said that traders remain worried about more declines in the dollar. Yesterday, in intraday trading, the yield on the long bond moved up to as much as 8.03 percent, the highest since the spring of 1992. **********The 30-year bond rose 7/32 , to 9420/32 , for a yield of 7.97 percent, down from 7.99 percent on Thursday, with bills virtually unchanged. **********Next week the Treasury plans to sell $28.25 billion of new two-year and five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the two-year note was being offered to yield 6.81 percent and the five-year to yield 7.46 percent. Both were up 10 basis points since Wednesday, when the Fed announced the terms of the auctions. **********Elliott Platt, managing director of economic research of the taxable fixed-income division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said he thought there was a chance that the Fed would raise the Federal funds rate on Monday or Tuesday in anticipation of evidence that final sales in the third quarter picked up strongly. **********""We think that the case for a more immediate firming would be bolstered by expectations for Friday's G.D.P. report,"" Mr. Platt said, referring to the gross domestic product data due out next week."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/world/cuba-to-allow-all-farmers-to-sell-some-food-on-the-open-market.html,Tim Golden,1994-09-18,,1399,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Cuba to Allow All Farmers to Sell Some Food on the Open Market,Cuba to Allow All Farmers to Sell Some Food on the Open Market," **********In a step away from the highly centralized Communist system that has defined its economy for more than three decades, Cuba announced today that it would allow all farmers to sell part of their produce on the open market. **********Government officials said they were acting to ease the crushing shortages of meat, chicken, most vegetables and other food, which have set the black-market price of a big fish at the equivalent of a mechanic's monthly wage. **********""Today, the political, military and ideological problem of this country is to look for food,"" Cuba's Defense Minister and second-ranking leader, Gen. Raul Castro, said in an interview published today in the Communist Party newspaper Granma. **********Several foreign experts on the Cuban economy said the measure could be an important step toward a more productive economy driven by material incentives, depending on how liberally it was applied. **********But they cautioned that the move was still a small one when set against the overwhelming problems that have plagued Cuba since the fall of its Soviet-bloc trading partners in 1989 and the tightening of the American embargo three years later. **********In interviews, senior Cuban officials said the move would go far beyond the so-called free farmers' markets that Cuba created in 1980 and then abolished in 1986 as a bourgeois threat to Communism. **********Unlike that experiment, in which only small farmers were permitted to sell their surplus produce on the open market, the new policy will encompass everything from state farming cooperatives to the Cubans who grow vegetables in their front yards. **********Farmers will still have to sell the Government a fixed amount of their harvest, based on what they grow and where they grow it. They will be allowed to sell anything they produce above those quotas at whatever price supply and demand dictate. The producers will be licensed, officials said, and their profits will be taxed. **********Cuban officials denied that the announcement was tied to pressure from the Clinton Administration, which has said that it will ease the 32-year-old American economic embargo against Cuba only if the Government of General Castro's brother, President Fidel Castro, moves toward free markets and democratic politics. **********Indeed, Raul Castro said that while ""much more"" democracy was needed within the Cuban Communist Party, ""any other party would belong to imperialism, and that we will never permit."" **********Yet in laying out the agricultural changes just a few days after they began trumpeting their successful halt to the flight of thousands of refugees under an immigration agreement with the United States, Cuban officials said they hoped the measure would contribute to an improvement in the long-hostile relationship between the countries. **********""This is not being done to seek a reaction"" from the United States, the President of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, said in an interview with foreign reporters on Friday night. ""But I think it will have some repercussions."" **********Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College who has studied the Cuban economy for years, said: ""It would be taking things out of perspective to simply applaud this as a positive, which it is. It is welcomed. But at this moment the economy is a disaster. They need to take bolder measures."" **********Mr. Zimbalist and other economists said that although the announcement was being made at the start of the planting season for many vegetables, it would still take months to show any significant increase in food over what is already available on the black market. A drop in prices, they suggested, could take even longer. **********But diplomats and other political analysts said the move could have an important psychological effect in the meantime. **********""After all the rafters, people needed some sign that changes were going to be made,"" a European diplomat said. ""This is a sign."" **********The scarcity of food and other basics like soap was the central factor in the flight of more than 30,000 Cubans after President Castro reacted to the hijackings of some state-owned vessels and a riot against the security forces in Havana on Aug. 5 by allowing people to leave the island freely in homemade rafts. **********Much of the country's industrial plant has been paralyzed for lack of fuel and spare parts; agricultural yields have plummeted along with supplies of fertilizer, and oxen have replaced tractors on many farms. **********Mr. Alarcon, Cuba's chief negotiator in eight days of talks with American officials in New York this month, denied that there had been any secret agreement to extend the discussions beyond the subject of immigration at a later point. **********There has been considerable speculation in both countries about the possibilities of such a deal, in part because Cuba was widely seen to have agreed to stop the flood of refugees on terms favorable to the Clinton Administration. **********Under the New York accord, the United States is to issue at least 20,000 visas to Cuban immigrants each year. The agreement also ratified Mr. Clinton's reversal of the longstanding American policy of taking in any Cuban who wanted to emigrate to the United States. **********But American officials refused to lift new restrictions on travel and the sending of money from the United States to people in Cuba, or to even discuss the embargo that Cuban officials blame for most of their economic troubles. **********Havana has nonetheless been unfailingly enthusiastic about the accord. In part, Cuban officials have seemed to want to reassure disgruntled citizens of some light at the end of their long sacrifice. They have also clearly hoped to show Americans that they can be counted on to respect what they sign. **********""The fact that we have been able to negotiate this agreement calls into question the argument that Cuba is not serious,"" the head of the Communist Party's Americas Department, Jose Antonio Arbesu, said in an interview on Friday. **********""We have made changes here that are important,"" he went on. ""What is absurd is to think that this is a quid pro quo, that they can lift the blockade in exchange for this, that and the other. If they want to influence Cuba and changes in Cuba, the best way to do that is not with a policy that has shown for 30 years that it does not work."" **********The move toward free markets for agricultural products follows a series of changes over the last three years that have included a wide opening to foreign investment, the creation of some semi-autonomous and private companies and the establishment of a parallel economy in American dollars. **********Economic planners led by Carlos Lage, who heads the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers, have struggled lately to sop up some of the 11 billion excess of Cuban pesos that has driven inflation in the black market. The inflation has raised prices for items like cigarettes and rum and resulted in workers and schoolchildren being charged for the lunches that were previously free. The peso now trades on that market at about 100 to the dollar. **********Alluding to the reduced peso surplus, first steps toward taxation and the creation last year of new state cooperatives in which farmers are allowed to use some Government land for themselves, Mr. Lage said in a brief conversation on Friday, ""There are conditions now for an agricultural market."" **********Neither he nor other officials provided details about how or precisely when the markets would be established, or how the authorities would deal with the emergence of intermediaries between farmers and consumers. In abolishing the peasant markets in 1986, President Castro said they had become ""a source of enrichment for neo-capitalists and the neo-bourgeois."" **********Several officials said the Government would probably try to control the transportation of products from larger farms, but they added that the food problem was so severe they had no choice but to tolerate the likely enrichment of some farmers, truck drivers and others. **********""At essence, supply and demand should be at play, as well as regulations and taxes that we should apply,"" Raul Castro said. But he added, ""We must be clear about one thing: If there is food for the people, the risks do not matter."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/19/business/fed-looks-at-leaks-and-hunches.html,Sylvia Nasar,1994-05-19,,1377,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Fed Looks at Leaks and Hunches,Fed Looks at Leaks and Hunches," **********The Federal Reserve, under Congressional attack for being selectively secretive, is so worried about leaks these days that it is investigating whether Wayne D. Angell, who departed recently as a Federal Reserve governor, received inside information about the Fed's activities or simply had a brilliant hunch. **********The focus of their inquiry is a report that the outspoken Mr. Angell wrote a few weeks ago for clients of Bear, Stearns, the Wall Street firm that is his new employer. In the report, he said eight or nine of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks had filed requests for an increase in the discount rate the Fed charges for the loans it makes to banks. **********The knowledge that the boards of regional banks were pushing for an increase in the discount rate would be helpful in predicting the vote of the Fed's Open Market Committee, which determines monetary policy, on the economically significant Federal funds rate, and very few people are close to those requests.  A 'Closely Guarded' Secret **********While each bank's president knows how his own board voted, none of the banks' presidents knows how the boards of the other banks voted. That tally, Mr. Angell said, is known only to the seven members of the board of governors of the Fed and about 10 top staff members. **********""Of all the closely guarded secrets, that is one that's not known, even to the district bank presidents,"" Mr. Angell said. **********So far the central bank's zeal is being rewarded by a burst of annoyance from Mr. Angell. He told the Fed's inspector general, Brent L. Bowen, who came to interview him, that his prediction -- which turned out to be essentially correct -- was an educated guess. In addition, Mr. Angell, a plain-speaking Kansan, said he had accused the investigators of giving away information by confirming two weeks ago that his hunch was essentially correct. **********Mr. Angell said he told the investigators, ""You want to investigate me, but I think Congress should have you investigated because you have just confirmed my guess."" **********For its part, the Federal Reserve maintained a dignified silence yesterday. Mr. Bowen followed a longstanding policy by refusing to comment. ""It's a policy of mine not to confirm or deny any investigation,"" he said. ""I have to stick with that."" **********J. Virgil Mattingly Jr., the Fed'sgeneral counsel, would not comment.  And the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, declined a request for an interview through a spokesman, Joseph Coyne. **********The episode comes in the midst of a noisy and protracted tug-of-war between Mr. Greenspan, who is fighting to maintain the central bank's traditional maneuvering room, and Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, who is chairman of the House Banking Committee. Mr. Gonzalez, a populist, has been pushing to make the Fed more accountable to Congress and open its deliberations to more public scrutiny. **********Mr. Gonzalez has repeatedly used the fact of past leaks to demand that the Fed release videotapes of monetary policy meetings, arguing that the Fed's traditional secrecy was being breached anyway. Although there have been some specific instances of actual leaks, Mr. Gonzalez has said he has been particularly irked by news accounts of decisions by the open market committee immediately after they were made, but weeks before the Fed's formal minutes were released. **********To counter, Mr. Greenspan has engaged in unprecedented disclosure -- since January, he has formally announced increases in the Federal funds rate when they occur, rather than let the markets discover them -- and has made an even greater effort to stop leaks. **********Mr. Angell, an inflation hawk who admires supply-side economics, served on the board of governors for eight years before joining Bear, Stearns as chief economist in mid-April. He made his Wall Street debut by writing an article on the Op-Ed page of The Wall Street Journal that called for bold action by the Fed to lay to rest inflationary fears. ""There seems to be a hesitancy to restate the price-stability pledge on the part of the Fed's leadership,"" he wrote. ""Yet I, for one, am counting on my former colleagues to do the right thing."" **********But recently, he has bolstered his prediction that the open market committee would raise both the largely symbolic discount rate as well as the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for borrowed funds, by at least a half-point with his suspicions about the positions of the regional banks. It was two weeks ago, after the report on the regional banks, Mr. Angell said, that he received a telephone call from Mr. Bowen's office. **********""They said they wanted to visit with me to find out whether someone had leaked to me the number of banks that had a request in to the board for a discount-rate hike,"" Mr. Angell said. **********The notion that Mr. Angell -- a shrewd, fourth-generation wheat farmer, banker and economist who left the Fed in February -- may indeed have made a good guess is hardly far-fetched. As a longtime member of the board of governors who was a director of the Kansas City, Mo., Fed before that, Mr. Angell still has intimate, current knowledge of the thinking not only of the board and the bank presidents on the open market committee, but also of many of the directors of regional banks. **********The board of governors, not the open market committee, changes the economically unimportant discount rate, taking into account the wishes of the Fed's member banks. But the board's stance can influence the committee's deliberations, in which all the presidents participate. ""A Fed president with a board that's asking for a rate increase comes into the meeting as a man with a mission"" or more inclined to vote for tighter money, Mr. Angell said. **********A measure of the seriousness of improper disclosure of a regional bank's position on the discount rate: In 1989 a member of the New York Fed's board was sentenced to prison for leaking such information to a bond trader. A Request on Rates **********In theory, the Fed's board of governors does not lend money to banks; rather, the district banks do. Because it is ""their"" discount rate, the boards of the banks -- composed of business people, bankers and community representatives -- put in a request that the Fed's board is supposed to take into consideration when it decides whether to change the discount rate, something rarely done unless the Federal funds rate gets out of line or the open market committee wants to add an exclamation point to a policy change. Every two weeks, the regional bank's research director polls the directors on what discount rate they want. **********After weeks of speculation and turmoil in the financial markets, the Fed raised both rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday. And yesterday, the Fed disclosed that all 12 district banks had requested an increase in the discount rate. ""It was really kind of consoling,"" Mr. Angell said, referring to the fact that his figure of eight or nine banks making requests was not far off. **********Mr. Angell said his calculation was an informed guess based on a bank-by-bank assessment of their boards' stances on inflation. As chairman of the Fed's bank activities committee that oversees the operations of the regional Fed banks, Mr. Angell had talked directly with many of the chairmen and deputy chairmen of the boards of the regional banks. ""I knew these people very well,"" he said. **********Mr. Angell sounded exceptionally pleased with himself yesterday. ""I'm a behavioral scientist and my job is to anticipate how people will behave,"" he said. ""I just came to the conclusion that a number of banks had requested a discount-rate increase."" **********As chief economist of a big Wall Street bond trading house, Mr. Angell was hired amid great fanfare to make exactly those kinds of predictions and to share insights that would give traders at Bear, Stearns an edge in a huge, fast-moving market. ""My job is to seem to have a handle on how the Fed will act so that traders will take into consideration what I have to say,"" Mr. Angell said. ""I've been pleased with the kind of interaction I have had."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/world/heavy-shelling-and-firefights-rake-sarajevo.html,Chuck Sudetic,1994-01-07,,1109,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Heavy Shelling And Firefights Rake Sarajevo,Heavy Shelling And Firefights Rake Sarajevo," **********Smoke billowed from burning homes along a battlefront in the southern part of this city today after predawn artillery barrages were followed by furious infantry clashes and heavy shelling that lasted until dusk. **********Soldiers of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government and Sarajevo radio reports said the Serbs had launched the attack. Serbian radio blamed the Bosnian Army for starting the clashes, which took place along a front line near the old Jewish Cemetery. **********Today was the besieged Bosnian capital's sixth consecutive day of heavy clashes and shelling, which have left at least 37 people dead and scores wounded. The shelling closed down Sarajevo airport for a second consecutive day, cutting off the United Nations flights that supply the city's 280,000 people with food and medicine. The city remains without electricity and water service. House-to-House Fighting **********""This is the heaviest attack on the Jewish cemetery line since the early days of the war,"" said Samir Curt, a 21-year-old Bosnian Army platoon leader, who was hospitalized with a bullet wound in the elbow this morning. But he said the Serbs had not gained any ground in the house-to-house fighting. **********[ The continued shelling came amid unconfirmed reports in Washington that Lieut Gen. Francis Briquemont of Belgium, the United Nations commander in Bosnia, had formally requested air strikes to staunch the fighting. ] **********United Nations officials said here tonight that Bosnian Serb military commanders warned that Sarajevo would come under even more intensive artillery fire if the Bosnian attack did not stop. **********The Grbavica neighborhood where the fiercest clashes took place is in Serbian hands, but it is south of the Miljacka River, which forms a natural defensive barrier for Bosnian Government forces north of the river. The Jewish Cemetery is on a gentle, open slope with clear lines of fire down into the Muslim-held heart of the city -- in effect an ideal gun platform for the Serbs. Thus the Government's interest in seizing the cemetery and the Serbs' interest in holding it. Deaths Underreported **********Though the Serbian barrage of Sarajevo today was less intense than those on Tuesday and Wednesday, Serbian gunners again battered residential areas. Hospital officials said at least 4 civilians had been killed and 50 other people wounded. Deaths during heavy artillery barrages tend to be under-reported because it is too risky for survivors to take their dead to morgues. **********United Nations officials counted 752 Serbian shells striking Government-controlled neighborhoods of Sarajevo, especially Dobrinja and Grbavica, an area near the Jewish Cemetery, said Maj. Manuel Cabezas, a United Nations military spokesman. United Nations officials consider their shell counts to be greatly underestimated. **********An exploding shell decapitated a woman who was walking early this evening along the almost-deserted Marshal Tito Street, the city's blown-out main shopping strip. About an hour earlier, French soldiers attached to the United Nations military force here removed a dead man lying on the same street next to the Bosnian Presidency Building. **********At the city's main hospital tonight, Bosnian soldiers, wearing red ribbons to distinguish themselves from the Serbs in close-quarter combat, brought in a comrade who had been wounded early this morning and could not be removed from the muddy battle ground for 10 hours because of the ferocious fighting. **********Exploding shells at the city's airport also wounded two French soldiers, United Nations officials said.  [ Three more French soldiers were wounded in a second incident, The Associated Press reported. ] **********The shelling in the downtown area forced the Government to order its employees to spend the night in the Presidency building, the first time workers have been told not to leave the building since the Serbs began attacking the city 21 months ago. **********A shell also ripped into the seventh floor of the Holiday Inn, home to most of the foreign diplomats and reporters here. 'Opportunity for Action' **********""This is a good opportunity for action by those who said they would use force if Serbian artillery attacks on Sarajevo continue,"" said Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, speaking in Bonn on the eve of another round of peace talks between President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. **********[ According to one unconfirmed report, General Briquemont made the request for air strikes to his immediate superior, Gen. Jean Cot, the commander of the United Nations Protection Force for Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia. General Cot would then request permission from the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. **********[ Senior French Defense Ministry officials said General Cot told them that he had spoken with General Briquemont, but did not disclose the details of their conversation. The officials said that General Cot told them that he would ask for air strikes when the conditions were right. **********[ ""We told him we would be ready to support him if he asks,"" said one senior Defense Ministry official. ""He said he will ask when he thinks the conditions under his mandate are met."" ] **********During previous surges in Serbian shelling of Sarajevo, the Clinton Administration has warned that the United States might use air strikes to knock out the Serbian artillery batteries if the shelling continued. This week the French Defense Minister, Francois Leotard, called on the United States to intervene in the conflict with air power, supply units or the deployment of peacekeeping troops. **********United Nations officials said today that hunger among residents and refugees in some central Bosnian villages has become critical because the Serbian and Croatian militias have halted aid convoys and because local officials in some Government-held areas have diverted aid to the Bosnian Army. Soldier Tells of Fighting **********Today's clashes erupted about 5:30 A.M. with a fierce barrage along a trench-riven area stretching from the Vrbanje Bridge, which crosses the Miljacka River near the Holiday Inn, to Zlatiste, a hilltop neighborhood about 800 yards from the bridge. An infantry clash began two hours later and lasted well into the evening. **********""It was a well-coordinated attack,"" said Mr. Curt, the wounded Bosnian platoon leader. ""The Serbs came up out of their trenches, but they didn't gain any ground."" **********""They were trying to take streets that we have held since the war began,"" he said. ""They are now occupying the same positions they held before this morning's attack, the same positions they used when they shot Suada Dilberovic."" **********Mr. Curt referred to the war's first victim, a second-year medical student killed by a Serbian sniper on the Vrbanje Bridge during a peace demonstration in April 1992."

Originally September sales were reported as a 1 percent gain. **********The 30-year bond declined 14/32 of a percentage point, to 94 18/32 , for a yield of 7.98 percent, up from 7.94 percent on Friday. Shorter maturities also fell in price. **********Early reports of a healthy start to the pivotal Christmas retail shopping season put pressure on the market because they were consistent with a moderate upward trend in consumer spending. **********""Both confirmed that the economy is still very, very strong,"" Mr. McClintock said. To bond investors a strong economy translates to a pickup in inflationary pressures, and those pressures point to higher interest rates. **********Also, Mr. McClintock added, consumer confidence was strong. ""If people have jobs, they will continue to spend money on homes,"" he said. ""They may be smaller, but they're still buying homes."" **********Last week, with the stock market on the skids, many people shifted money to the fixed-income market. Analysts speculate that economic data coming out this week will be strong, and that will mean interest rates will have to go higher to slow the economy. ""I personally think the peak in yields still lies ahead,"" Mr. McClintock said. He sees the long bond somewhere between 8.5 percent and 9 percent, with the yield curve -- the difference in short- and long-term rates -- flatter than it is now before the Fed is satisfied. A flattening of the curve is generally regarded as a sign that the economy has started to slow. **********Yesterday the Treasury sold $27.2 billion in new three- and six-month bills, as the average rate at auction rose a bit. The three-month rate was up two basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- from the previous weekly auction, to 5.40 percent, while the six-month rate was up one basis point, to 5.86 percent. **********The early signs of holiday sales matching or even surpassing last year's 6 percent gain helped put a crimp on speculation of a slowing economy. Providing evidence of the strong Christmas retail start, data from Telecheck showed check volume on the Friday after Thanksgiving up 5.7 percent from a year ago, while Mastercard reported charge volume up a sizzling 36.2 percent, in part a reflection of the increased use of credit cards this year. **********Traders expect the long bond to top 8 percent this week, with several economic reports due. **********Today, the Government will release revised data for third-quarter gross domestic product, or the total output of goods and services. **********On Thursday, the National Association of Purchasing Management will publish its November survey of business conditions. And on Friday the key employment report is expected to show the economy added 240,000 jobs in November, up from 194,000 in October. **********In the municipal bond market, prices were lower, with investors looking toward higher yields on this week's $2.7 billion of new issues. Yesterday's biggest offering was by Pennsylvania's Intergovernmental Co-op Authority, a $124 million sale of bonds negotiated through Smith Barney Inc. **********The bonds were initially priced to yield as much as 7.20 percent for an issue due in 2024, but because of good investor demand the yield was lowered to 7.13 percent. Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 4.20 percent in 1995 to 6.85 percent in 2009. **********Because the issue is insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, the financing is rated triple-A by the major rating agencies. **********The following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month bills auction: (000 omitted in dollar figures)              3-Mo.

But what about to Japan, where 60 percent of men smoke and no-smoking zones in restaurants remain a rarity? **********The preliminary answers from Canadian Airlines International, which last month became the first international airline to make all its flights to Japan smoke-free, are clear: Let them light up, or risk losing business. **********""It's not doing our competitive position a helluva lot of good,"" said Tony Buckley, general manager for Japan and Korea. **********Passengers in business class, who pay about double the fare of group passengers in economy, decreased 32 percent in September compared with the year before, even as overall traffic rose by double digits during the month, he said. **********The decision to make its flights to Japan smoke-free goes back to 1990, when the Canadian Parliament passed a law regulating smoking in the workplace and on commercial aircraft. The airlines were given three years to phase out the total number of smoking seats by at least 25 percent each year. **********Since domestic flights in Canada, as well as those to the United States, were already smoke-free, the reduction affected only international flights. **********Canadian Airlines began by banning smoking on flights to Australia. It followed with South America and Europe in 1992. Reluctantly, it turned to Asia, banning smoking on flights to Hong Kong and Taiwan. To its pleasant surprise, Cathay Pacific in Hong and Mandarin Airlines in Taiwan followed suit. **********In 1993, the airline lobbied and won a year's extension on banning smoking on its 19 weekly flights to Japan. But last June, Parliament told them to snuff out all smoke by September. That left Japan. **********Mr. Buckley, a smoker, said only similar legislation by the United States would clear the competitive air across the Pacific."

The other was for a series of spots, carrying the theme ""You will,"" describing coming A.T.& T. technologies like voice-activated door locks. **********After the ""i plan"" commercials stopped running, said James D. Speros, brand management director for A.T.& T. corporate advertising in New York, a decision was made not to renew Mr. Selleck's contract for only the few ""You will"" commercials. His voice-over narrations have been re-recorded, Mr. Speros added, by Jason Culp, a young actor who is the son of the actor Robert Culp. **********The substitution underscores why celebrity voice-overs have become so popular in advertising. The Selleck problem was easily solved by replacing one voice with another -- compared with the more difficult process of scrapping spots and refilming them when a celebrity appears on screen."

Then German unification excited the local media and advertising industries in 1991 with the prospect of 15 million East Germans snapping up West German publications after four decades of subsisting with Communist Party propaganda. **********Now euphoria has succumbed to recessionary reality and increased competition is denting publishers' profits. **********While Focus, a splashy newsweekly that hit the newsstands on Jan. 1, 1993, recently made German media history by passing the venerable Der Spiegel in the contest for paid advertising pages, traditional titles are suffering. **********The success of most new publications has come at the expense of their entrenched competition, not from the expansion of the pan- German market. Industry insiders say the crowding-out phenomonenon will be compounded by a second spurt of magazines now preparing to enter the fray: **********- **********Gruner & Jahr AG, the print media division of the German publishing giant Bertelsmann AG, announced last week the Sep. 29 launch of Tango, a heavily illustrated newsweekly aimed at a young, well-educated and well-to-do readership bored by Der Spiegel and unwilling to switch to Focus. **********Tango will come out on Thursdays, the same day as Stern, Gruner & Jahr's flagship magazine. Stern's editor-in-chief ended up quitting, not convinced that the two magazines' readerships didn't overlap. **********- **********Heinrich Bauer Verlag KG, Gruner & Jahr's crosstown rival, will counter Tango with Feuer (Fire), a Monday newsweekly aimed at the same audience. **********- **********Burda, the Munich-based publisher of Focus, plans to introduce a second, still-to- be-named newsweekly in addition to a women's magazine named Lisa. **********- **********Der Spiegel, which usually sneers at upstarts' attempts to nip at its heels, has announced that its previously sporadic Spiegel Spezial, each issue of which is devoted to one topic, will soon appear monthly. It has also added a considerable amount of color pictures and graphics to its flagship magazine. **********Meanwhile, Axel Springer Verlag AG said it had canceled plans to introduce a German version of News, its successful Austrian newsweekly on grounds that the market was getting too tight. **********Perhaps the biggest clash of German media titans, however, will target the nation's 50 million television viewers. A jungle of new cable TV channels has expanded the market for guides to help viewers decide what to watch. Circulation of TV magazines has increased from 16.3 million in 1990 to 21.5 million today. Industry analysts estimate that the market has another 4.6 million potential readers. **********Media insiders predicted an aggressive push-and-shove for advertising and readership that will leave many long-time contenders bruised and a lot of their challengers gasping for breath. **********Hans Werner Kilz, editor-in-chief of Der Spiegel, has described the approaching showdown as ""throwing money out the window"" because there are too many newcomers. **********Nevertheless, publishers continue to rush new titles to press in order to avoid losing market share with advertisers and subscribers. **********""New magazines are cannibalizing existing titles,"" said Rolf Wickmann, the Gruner & Jahr board member responsible for domestic magazines. ""But because the overall market is stagnant, bringing out new titles is the only way to avoid losing money."""

Fighting is financed by pillaging and plunder. And neither combatants nor civilians enjoy even the minimal protections accorded in conflicts elsewhere. **********As a result, Liberia has come to bear little resemblance to a modern state, becoming instead a tribal caldron governed less by commonly understood rules than at any time since it became Africa's first republic in 1847 under freed American slaves. **********""Things have deteriorated to the point where what we are seeing emerge nowadays are sub-warlords, each of whom is a law unto himself,"" said Amos Sawyer, an author of Liberia's Constitution. He served as interim President but resigned in March when militias refused to respect an agreement to disarm. **********""If we don't arrest the situation quickly,"" Mr. Sawyer continued, ""we will soon be back to where we were at the end of the 19th century, when this country was a stage for roving tribal gangs that fought back and forth for territory."" **********Others say the country has already deteriorated to that point. **********Despite the international peacekeeping efforts, attacks by guerrilla groups have left the thickly forested country -- which is nearly as large as Virginia -- with only two usable highways, neither more than 50 miles long. **********Even these stretches of road are kept open only by heavily armed soldiers with a Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force of 10,000, maintaining barricades often as close as a mile apart. **********[ Nigeria said Friday that it planned to bring home about 4,000 of the troops it contributed to the peacekeeping force, because of logistical and economic constraints. ] **********Despite the presence of the peacekeepers, Gen. Charles Julue, one of the most feared commanders in a war marked by widespread atrocities, seized one of the country's last largely unscathed landmarks, the Executive Mansion, on Sept. 15. **********He declared himself to be the leader of a previously unknown group, New Horizons, and promised to ""restore normalcy to our fellow Liberians."" In 1990, during the Government of President Samuel K. Doe, General Julue was widely blamed for the killing of 300 children whose remains were found in a well near the northern town of Sanoquelli, where his forces had been operating. **********General Julue's coup attempt was short-lived, ending when warships from the peacekeeping force pounded the seaside mansion, forcing his rebels -- renegades from a decomposing national army -- to surrender and adding the fortresslike building to the war's scrap heap. **********General Julue was captured, stripped naked in the street and beaten by a crowd, and he is to be tried for treason. The general is being detained by the peacekeeping force, and there is a debate about how and by whom he will be tried. **********If his bid for power stood out for its audacity, taking place as it did under the noses of the West African peacekeeping force, it otherwise fit neatly into the pattern of chaotic recent events in this war-torn country of 2.5 million. **********In rural areas, as in the capital, whatever structures have been left standing are bullet-pocked and deserted. Throughout the countryside, villages lie empty. **********With more than half of the population having been forced into exile or living crudely as nomads, shifting this way and that through the forest in response to the fighting, refugee camps in neighboring Guinea and the Ivory Coast are home to more residents than any Liberian city except the capital, Monrovia. **********The civil war began on Dec. 24, 1989, when Charles Taylor, an exile who formerly headed a Government warehouse in the Doe Government, entered the country from the Ivory Coast. With an initial band of 60 fighters, Mr. Taylor announced his intention to topple Mr. Doe, who took power in a military coup in 1980. **********Mr. Doe's national army, stacked with fighters from his own Krahn tribe, soon began attacking the ethnic groups of Nimba County, the bordering region where the rebellion had begun. This campaign only fueled Mr. Taylor's militia, generating recruits from the victimized ethnic groups, who quickly retaliated against civilians as well as soldiers in Krahn areas. **********Mr. Taylor was prevented from taking Monrovia only by the intervention of the West African force, which entered the embattled city eight months after the war started. But he had no sooner begun putting Mr. Doe's soldiers on the defensive when Mr. Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia and the army began splintering into what has become an alphabet soup of ethnic factions. **********Mr. Doe was captured and killed by one faction in September 1990, setting off a race for power by a new generation of militia leaders. **********Although Mr. Taylor's Patriotic Front forces controlled much of the countryside outside of Monrovia for most of the war, the fighting of recent months has seen them nearly wiped out by the proliferating rebel groups that have focused their attacks on his onetime fief in the town of Gbarnga, 100 miles northeast of the capital. **********Liberia's precedent for tribalism was provided by the country's founders, freed American slaves who retained almost total control over politics and much of business until Mr. Doe's violent takeover in 1980. Following the example of the so-called Americo-Liberians, Mr. Doe heavily stacked his Government and army with members of his own ethnic group, which is estimated to account for less than 10 percent of the population. **********In response, opposition to Mr. Doe's dictatorial rule quickly became tribal in nature. **********Few hold out any hope that the war will end even if Mr. Taylor is defeated. The latest attacks, which have pushed his forces out of Gbarnga and destroyed the city, came just after the West African alliance brokered a peace agreement in September, whose signers included the three main faction leaders: Mr. Taylor; Gen. Hezekiah Bowen, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia, and Alhaji Kromah, who heads Ulimo, or the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy. Roosevelt Johnson, a former associate and a Krahn, broke off from Mr. Kromah in the last year and formed another group using the name Ulimo. **********In the same week, the forces of Mr. Kromah were routed by the recently formed militias of the two other main factions, the Liberian Peace Council and the Central Revolutionary Committee, neither of which signed the peace agreement. **********""Once we have eliminated Taylor, we can establish a truly national army, not one based on tribe,"" said Francois Massaquoi, who leads one of the recently formed groups, the Lofa Defense Force, which is composed exclusively of fighters from his own ethnic group. **********""I must admit, our real target is Alhaji Kromah, who has committed atrocities against our people that you just wouldn't believe,"" Mr. Massaquoi said in an interview in the town of Kakata, 30 miles northeast of Monrovia. **********A thin young fighter of 24 who recently surrendered to the peacekeeping force in Kakata offered another explanation of the war when he was asked why he had been fighting: ""I am a poor man, with nothing, and they told me that if I joined the militia I would be given something."" **********Exasperated diplomats and other observers say the attacks by new groups, coming just as another peace effort -- the 29th by one count -- was getting under way, represented the classic pattern of this war, which has killed an estimated 150,000 people. **********""The only politics here are the politics of destruction,"" said Paul McDermott, director of the Liberian office of the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which has been involved in mediation efforts here. ""Everyone is looking to sucker-punch someone else, and every alliance is negative. It doesn't offer much hope."""

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's democratically elected President ousted in 1991. **********Although the action was carried out by only a minority of Haiti's Parliament, the military's backing was seen as an effort by the ruling junta to make formal its ouster of Father Aristide. **********With the step today, the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, and his military allies seem to be hardening their rejection of Mr. Clinton's appeals to step aside or face tougher economic sanctions and possibly military force. **********In Washington, Clinton Administration officials and supporters of President Aristide said they would not accept the action as legitimate. The White House denounced the installation of the new President, Emil Jonassaint, as ""cynical, unconstitutional and illegal."" **********Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Clinton remained committed to restoring Father Aristide to power and that he would seek to extend the punitive sanctions already imposed on 600 of Haiti's leaders to Mr. Jonassaint and other members of the newly declared Government. **********The appointment of Mr. Jonassaint follows months of threats by General Cedras and his followers to install a successor to Father Aristide. Administration officials described the move today as a disturbing sign of intransigence by the Haitian officers in the face of new demands from Mr. Clinton and the United Nations that they relinquish power. **********General Cedras and four other senior members of the army's high command attended the ceremony in Port-au-Prince at which Mr. Jonassaint took the oath of office, and the Legislative Palace where it took place was ringed by scores of heavily armed soldiers and armed civilians. **********The 13 Haitian senators and 30 deputies who supported the move and attended the ceremony today contended that Father Aristide's long absence from Haiti left them with no option under Haiti's Constitution but to turn to the Supreme Court justice as his provisional successor. **********Representing only a minority of each body, the group included eight senators elevated after irregular elections organized by the military in January 1993. An Act of 'Open Defiance' **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the procedures used to replace Father Aristide ""seem to us to be invalid."" The Haitian Embassy in Washington, which supports Father Aristide, issued a statement denouncing the move as ""just one more act in open defiance of the international community by the coup regime."" **********Michael Barnes, a top adviser to President Aristide, called the step ""just another cynical, tragic piece of evidence that the military regime in Haiti has no intention of fulfilling the commitment it made last year to give up power and permit the restoration of democracy."" **********A United Nations Security Council resolution approved last week calls on General Cedras and his supporters to honor the accord they signed last summer at Governors Island in New York and step down by May 21 or face a near-total economic embargo. **********Mr. Clinton, who pressed for that new ultimatum, has said only that it would not be wise to rule out the use of force if those sanctions fail. But his aides have made clear that sentiment within the White House is moving in favor of military action to oust Haiti's leaders if the sanctions do not force them to step down within several weeks or months. **********American officials in Washington nevertheless acknowledged today that the move by the right-wing Haitian legislators appeared to serve notice that the army leaders would not easily be swayed. A senior official said it was being regarded by the Administration as an effort by General Cedras and his supporters ""to demonstrate that they are in control, that they are going to call the shots, and that they are not intimidated by sanctions."" A 21-Gun Salute **********The honors showered by the Haitian military on Mr. Jonassaint in Port-au-Prince today included a 21-gun salute at the National Palace and a chance to review the Presidential Guard on the lawn of the gleaming white-domed building, whose gates were flung open for the first time in months. He was later ushered upstairs to a reception. **********In his short acceptance speech, Mr. Jonassaint called on the United States and Haitians to allow his Government a chance to put its policies in action. ""Let there be a truce to give the Government a chance to make decisions,"" he said. ""We ask all citizens to show patience, to give us a chance."" **********But a radical right-wing Senator, Bernard Sansaricq, delivered a fiercely nationalistic speech in which he appealed to the United States to switch its backing from Father Aristide to Mr. Jonassaint. **********Haiti has been without a day-to-day leader since the resignation in December of Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was appointed by Father Aristide as part of a procedure that was supposed to lead to his reinstatement. Father Aristide has refused to name a new Prime Minister until General Cedras steps down. **********To reinforce its tough new stance, the Administration has sought to persuade other nations to agree to join in a United Nations force to keep peace in Haiti once its military leaders are gone. **********While Canada has said it would take part, no Latin American countries have agreed. But officials of Mexico , which has long championed non-intervention in the internal affairs of other nations, passed up a chance to criticize the American threat of military force in Haiti while senior United States officials were in Mexico City for discussions this week."

Nabisco Expanding In Chicago"," **********The Nabisco Biscuit Company is moving forward with a plan to build a bakery and distribution center on the Southwest Side of Chicago, an area that has become home to many food companies. The company announced the expansion plan in December and said it would close on the deal this month. **********The company will buy part of the property that once housed the Rheem water heater plant. The site has been vacant for five years and is just south of Nabisco's existing plant, Mark Gutsche, a spokesman for the Nabisco Foods Group, said. Mr. Gutsche would not disclose the price for the 38.5-acre site but said the company planned to invest $300 million to $500 million in the project. **********Nabisco's bakery in Chicago, built in 1953, is the company's largest, employing about 2,400 people. When the company began to outgrow its space, it considered several options, including building a plant overseas, Mr. Gutsche said. ""The main benefit of staying here is our people,"" he said. ""We have some of the finest and most skilled bakers in the world."" **********In addition, the company can continue full production while building the expansion and training its employees, he said. **********The company plans to demolish the Rheem building and put up a 100,000-square-foot distribution warehouse and improve its training operations, he said. **********Nabisco is the latest of several companies -- including Tootsie Roll, Sweetheart Cup and World's Finest Chocolate -- that have leased or bought warehousing and manufacturing property in the area, bordered roughly by 67th and 79th Streets and Cicero and Western Avenues. **********The Lincoln Business Center, Tootsie Roll, Nabisco and Sweetheart all were helped by enterprise zoning, in which the city provides tax advantages to companies that decide to locate in certain neighborhoods. Nabisco and Tootsie Roll also received ""pay as you go"" tax-increment financing through the city, which allows them to receive property tax rebates as they continue to invest in the area and hire people. **********Sweetheart Cup, which makes paper and plastic products, leased 587,000 square feet of warehousing space in November 1992. The company has a 10-year lease from the owner, the Lincoln Property Company, with an option for another 10 years, said Daniel M. Carson, vice president and general counsel for Sweetheart, which is based in Chicago and has 18 plants in the United States and 2 in Canada. Sweetheart's Chicago operations employ about 1,650 people in manufacturing, warehousing and corporate offices, Mr. Carson said. **********""We moved here because of the proximity of the existing plant,"" Mr. Carson said. ""This gave us significant operating efficiency and the option to expand."" **********The existing plant will continue to operate, but all warehousing has been moved to the center. Sweetheart has hired an additional 25 people as a result of the new space, Mr. Carson said. **********Another tenant at Lincoln is World's Finest Chocolate, which makes chocolate products primarily for school fund-raising drives. The company leased 220,000 square feet from Lincoln in July to house its new advance-order program, Michael P. Morris, the plant manager, said. **********The new warehouse is close to the manufacturing plant, where all of the company's chocolate for the United States is produced. Mr. Morris would not disclose the lease terms, nor would he discuss the amount the company plans to invest in the new site. The company uses mostly temporary employees, with the number fluctuating from 25 to 150, he said. **********Tootsie Roll had been renting 1.5 million square feet at the site of the old Tucker autombile plant from the mid-1960's until last summer, when it bought the building from the Equity Company. The deal, estimated at $50 million to $60 million, brought Tootsie Roll an additional 900,000 square feet of space, bringing its total plant size to 2.4 million square feet. **********The candy company obtained $20 million through low-interest loans and plans to invest about $100 million in the site during the next 15 years, city officials said. Tootsie Roll, which is based in Chicago and employs about 800 people, plans to add at least 150 jobs, Ellen Gordon, president of Tootsie Roll, said. **********The first boost to the area was the development of the 907,000-square-foot government warehouse in which Sweetheart Cup leases space. It was bought in June 1992 by Lincoln Property, and converted to the Lincoln Business Center. The warehouse was used to make airplane engines during World War II and later as a storage site. The center is adjacent to the Ford City shopping mall. **********Nabisco has given the Greater Southwest Development Corporation, a community business organization, $50,000 to study ways to attract and keep business in the area, said Harold Meyer, assistant director of the group. **********""From our point of view, we would like to use the momentum from Nabisco and Tootsie Roll and others to help expand the industrial base in the area,"" Mr. Meyers said."

But a Ministry official said security forces were sent to the scene, near the village of Baqour, about 200 miles south of Cairo, to search for several assailants. **********In a statement faxed to the Cairo office of The New York Times, the Islamic Group, the main Muslim militant group, said its gunmen had carried out the shooting attack. **********The statement said the attack was in retaliation for the death sentence recently handed down against an Egyptian Army officer and two soldiers accused of mining an airstrip near the Libyan border in an apparent assassination attempt against Egyptian Government officials. **********""This is swift retribution in reply to the death sentences only,"" the statement said.

""Some people wanted to kill us."" **********Irena Wos, 35, an architect from Poland, was wounded in the hand. A hospital official said the two Egyptians -- Soheir Wahib, 45, from the southern town of Kom Ombo, and Armanios Kaldas Armanios, 56, from Cairo -- had unspecified minor injuries. **********The train attack underscored the Government's difficulty in containing the violence that has decimated the country's $2.2 billion tourist industry. **********Reuters reported from Asyut that cartridges found at the scene of the train attack were inscribed with militant slogans like ""Islam is Coming"" and ""Revenge For Our Martyrs."" **********It was the first attack on a train known to carry tourists. The militants, usually operating in small groups, have attacked tour buses and Nile cruise ships in the past. **********The militants have also killed state officials, Government informers, police officers and Coptic Christians in their campaign to bring down the Government of President Mubarak and install an Islamic theocracy. Overall, more than 300 people, including three foreign tourists, have been killed over the last two years. **********In a signal that it is widening its campaign to include foreigners who live in Egypt, the Islamic Group said it opened fire on a bus carrying Romanian workers in Asyut on Monday. And on Wednesday, members of the group opened fire on a Nile cruise boat just north of Asyut. There were no injuries in either incident."

The five most attractive of these licenses are likely to sell for at least $80 million each. But few people were willing to make firm predictions because almost nothing had gone as expected since the bidding opened on Monday. **********Meanwhile, a second auction was held today in a separate ballroom here at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, as more than 1,000 people participated in an open-bidding auction, offering more than $160 million for dozens of licenses for tiny sliver of frequencies that have been assigned for interactive television services. **********Because these interactive television licenses are seen as much less valuable, and the market prospects for the services much more speculative, the bidding was much less competitive and is expected to end on Friday. In most cases, each license today was fetching between $3 million and $4 million -- within a few minutes of bidding time. **********The End Is Unpredictable **********Officials at the Federal Communications Commission, which is overseeing the  auctions, said today that it was still impossible to predict when the bidding would end for the 10 paging licenses. The bidding is being conducted in rounds,  with the companies entering bids anonymously from curtained booths to avoid collusion. **********Under the commission's rules, the agency will begin a new round of bidding for all 10 licenses until there are no longer any new bids. On Monday, each round was lasting about one hour. But the F.C.C. began picking up the pace today, shortening each round first to 30 minutes and then to 20 minutes. **********Any one bidder may buy as many as three licenses. Most of the activity has now boiled down to four determined groups that seem intent on the five most valuable nationwide paging licenses, which will allow for two-way messaging and  paging services. The other five licenses are for lower-capacity systems. **********The four companies have rotated positions as the bidders. In each round the identity of the company behind any specific bid remains concealed by an anonymous registration numbers. But the biggest contenders are believed to include the BellSouth Corporation, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., Air Touch Communications and Paging Network Inc. **********Because the companies offering paging services generally do so on a regional  basis, the prospect of new nationwide licenses is particularly attractive to the bidders. **********""You have a very finite number of licenses in a very competive market,"" said  Janice Obuchowski, head of Freedom Technologies, a telecommunications consulting firm."

""If it ends in Liège, it has no sense,"" says Frank Duboisse, a spokesman for the Walloon ministry of public works. ""It's a dead end for our region, not an opportunity."" **********Flemish officials meanwhile have yet to issue permits for much of the Brussels-Cologne line that passes through Dutch-speaking territory, insisting on better soundproofing and environmental protection. **********The standoff has pushed back the planned completion of the Paris-Brussels line by one year, to May 1997, at an added cost of some 3 billion Belgian francs ($91 million). Etienne Schouppe, the head of the Belgian railways, warned recently that a ""bidding war"" between the French and Dutch-speaking communities would cause further delay and damage the project's financial viability. **********Although Belgium's internal dispute is unique, the resulting delays are not. At their summit meeting in Corfu, Greece, on Friday and Saturday, European Union leaders are expected to approve a massive program of transportation projects, the most visible element of their efforts to boost Europe's growth and competitiveness. But many of the 11 top priority projects face a multitude of environmental, administrative and financial hurdles. **********The British government will seek bids this year from private builders for a high-speed rail line from London to the Channel Tunnel, but construction will have to wait another two years for enabling legislation from Parliament, and the link is not expected to be completed before 2002. **********Environmental concerns in Austria are expected to delay by more than two years the start of work on a rail-freight link between Germany and Italy via the Brenner Pass. And France and Italy have yet to agree on whether a high-speed rail line from Lyon to Turin should handle truck traffic, a decision that could boost the French tab alone from 18 billion French francs ($3 billion) to 40 billion. **********Officials at the European Commission acknowledge the problems but say their program for trans-European networks is helping to cut delays. ""That is one of the reasons why we have initiated the exercise, to try to inspire the member states to overcome the difficulties,"" said Lars Mitek, an aide to the economics commissioner, Henning Christophersen, who is steering the network program. **********But the delays have undermined the commission's goal of launching a big new borrowing program to mobilize support for the networks and fill a funding shortfall estimated at 5 billion European currency units ($6 billion) out of 32 billion Ecus to be spent in the next five years. **********Despite continued appeals from the commission president, Jacques Delors, EU finance ministers firmly rejected borrowings this month. They said there was no shortfall, given the slow phasing-in of construction and prospects for raising private capital. **********""The difficulty is not getting the financing,"" said Italy's finance minister, Lamberto Dini. ""The difficulty is getting the planning and the authorization from local authorities."" **********In Belgium, Elio di Rupo, the federal minister with overall responsibility for the rail project, will meet with Flemish and Walloon authorities July 1 to try to broker a solution to the regional conflicts holding up construction of high-speed lines. **********Pierre Forton, the director-general for ground transport under Mr. di Rupo, predicted an agreement would be reached within a few weeks."

Kuchma. **********Mr. Kuchma, the 55-year-old former head of a missile factory who is making his first foreign trip since his election in July, said that as a result of the pledges, he sees a ""stable, economically powerful, democratic and independent Ukraine, which will be integrated into the world's political and economic system."" **********Mr. Kuchma, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia, and senior officials from industrialized nations and international financial institutions are here to attend the Conference on Partnership for Economic Transformation in Ukraine, which grew out of initiatives at the Naples economic summit meeting last summer. **********At the sessions in Naples, $4 billion in aid was promised for Ukraine, a country of 52 million people, but the money was conditional on land redistribution, privatization of state enterprises, elimination of price controls, drastic cutting of the budget deficit and other measures to accelerate changes from a centrally planned economy. **********Mr. Kuchma was able to announce to a plenary session today that much of the program has now been approved by his Government and endorsed by Ukraine's Parliament, where many deputies have been critical of a process they fear would lead to ""corrupt capitalism."" **********Ukraine, the second most populous country in eastern Europe after Russia, is generally acknowledged to be much further behind in its efforts to become a market economy. **********The International Monetary Fund announced it has just approved $371 million to help Ukraine finance imports this winter. The United States is giving $100 million and Canada $25 million for the same purposes. Western European countries and Japan are also being asked for financial support. The monetary fund is considering another $400 million of credits for Ukraine next year. **********Lawrence Summers, Under Secretary of Treasury for International Economic Affairs and head of the United States delegation, said that in Ukraine there is now a ""clear path"" for reform, which represents a ""very significant break from policies that have greatly reduced performance of the economy."" **********Mr. Kuchma has been trying to overhaul a stagnant economic system. High inflation has led to plummeting income and living standards. The country's economic output actually declined by 27 percent in the first half of this year. During the last three years, wages adjusted for inflation have fallen by more than 50 percent. **********The Ukrainian currency, the karbovanets, is now trading at more than 100,000 to the dollar, compared with its initial rate three years ago of 200 to the dollar. As part of the reforms, a new convertible currency, to be called the hrivnia, is to be introduced in about four months. It would be supported by a $1.5 billion I.M.F. stabilization fund. **********Foreign Minister Kozyrev pledged his Government's help by announcing that Russia would postpone $635 million of payments on Ukraine's debt to Russia, which he placed at $2.7 billion, against $4.3 billion of total Ukrainian debt. **********Mr. Kozyrev's presence was seen as an effort to bolster Russia's demands for full G-7 membership. As he put it in comments to reporters: ""The G-7 should become the ""G-8."" **********Like Canada and the United States, Ukraine and Russia are each other's biggest trading partners."

Today, a new Constitution swept away black homelands and all the other legal fancies of apartheid. **********""We have moved from an era of pessimism, division, limited opportunity and turmoil,"" Mr. Mandela declared after depositing his ballot on the porch of the settlement school, converted to a stage for this moment of calculated history. ""We are starting a new era of hope, of reconciliation, of nation-building."" **********The most startling statistic of the day may have been this one: Despite months of pre-election dread, and despite the efforts of a bomber who detonated a carload of explosives at the city's international airport this morning, wounding 18 people, the police did not report a single person killed in election-related violence today. **********A few hours after the airport bombing, the police announced that they had arrested 31 white separatists accused of an election-eve bombing campaign that killed 21 people. **********The day was characterized by some chaos as voters overwhelmed ill-prepared polling stations in cities and black townships. **********President F. W. de Klerk declared Thursday a national holiday to free people for the second day of voting, and the Independent Electoral Commission was under growing pressure to extend the voting into Friday. **********The African National Congress was expected to win a solid majority in the new Parliament, giving it the right to name Mr. Mandela as president. Mr. de Klerk is likely to become one of two vice presidents in a unity government that is to see the country through the first five post-apartheid years. **********Mr. de Klerk keeps his presidency and his white Cabinet until May 10, when a successor is inaugurated. Pride and Patience **********Ordinary voters -- if people who waited all their lives for the opportunity can be considered ordinary -- seized their moment with little sign of euphoria or awe, but with pride and patience. **********""I feel now that I am a South African,"" said Henry Groodboom, a 19-year-old descended from a mix of settlers and slaves in the Afrikaner town of Graaff-Reinet, one of many luminous new voters sampled during a 1,000-mile flying circuit of polling places. **********Blacks and whites alike proclaimed the day ""historic"" and ""unforgettable,"" but often with opposite inflections. **********In the cornfield town of Bothaville, blacks nervously but resolutely took their places in line with edgy whites to vote at the town hall, a block from the spot where in February racists blew up the African National Congress office. **********Whites there, who were dividing their votes between Mr. de Klerk and the separatist Freedom Front, predicted a fury of celebratory black lawlessness when the A.N.C. victory is proclaimed this weekend, followed by an era of redistribution and decline. **********""There's such a huge percentage that is not cultured and developed,"" said Francois van der Linde, the Bothaville pharmacist. ""Such big numbers, and they think they can do what they like."" **********""It had to come some time,"" conceded Willie Nell, who farms corn and peanuts, speaking with the resignation that keeps fear company. **********Then in an oblivious voice that caused the black woman before him in line to stiffen, he added: ""They haven't got any qualification of government. They've just got a lot of people making promises."" **********In the villages of the eastern Cape, the hilly cradle of the liberation movement, the wives of absent migrant workers dressed up and brought picnics and made their wait the ultimate social event. **********Voters settled down along a quarter-mile of overgrown dirt road, waiting their turn in the crumbling schoolhouse in Qunu, Mr. Mandela's birthplace. **********""As soon as we will have voted for him in power, then we will be free,"" said Jim Sandlana, 67, a retired gold miner. After depositing his ballot he announced, ""My heart is relieved."" Divided Over Patronage **********Residents of the town were divided over whether Mr. Mandela's ascent would mean a flow of patronage -- maybe even a paved road -- to their hilltop settlement, a possibility that seemed daringly new but somehow unsavory. **********Mluleki Mandela, a nephew of the likely president-to-be, said his uncle ""cannot afford to do that"" since he is obliged to be the leader of everyone, but he conceded that some among the 5,000 villagers were counting on such favors. **********Every village worthy of a spot on the map seemed to have its polling place, each tended by a flock of monitors from places as far away as Belgium or the United States. **********Some voters fumbled over the novelty of multicolored ballots, leaning around their polling booths to announce that they had forgotten for whom they were supposed to vote. But in many places the voters seemed less amateur than the officials who were organizing the event.  Chairs and Umbrellas **********The lines snaking through black townships around Johannesburg moved so slowly that many voters stood the entire 12-hour voting day without getting close to the front. **********In Soweto some brought chairs and sun umbrellas, and cold-drink vendors worked the lines. **********""We've been waiting five hours,"" said Thomas Lethiba, 24, ""But other people have been waiting 40 years."" **********After ballot papers and voting booths failed to materialize at the D. H. Williams Community Center in Katlehong, a black township east of Johannesburg, the crowd of thousands who congregated along a stinking pool of sewage grew restive, demanding at least the symbolic advance of being admitted through the gate to the parking lot. **********Finally the crowd surged forward, breaking holes in the gate and sprinting through just to line up again outside the hall itself. **********""They want to come in by force,"" said Oupa Duma, a monitor, to which a waiting voter replied: ""We don't want to come in by force. We want to come in by law."" **********Amazingly, in a township where dusk has long been viewed as the killing hour by rival vigilantes, thousands stood their ground past dark. **********The head of the Independent Electoral Commission, Judge Johann Kriegler, said the commission had ordered another 9.3 million ballots printed, and said the police would investigate whether any of the shortages were due to theft. **********Mr. Kriegler speculated that the unexpected deluge of voters might be evidence that black migration to the cities had been grossly underestimated by the census. **********Among other gifts, the day brought South Africa a new flag, raised just past midnight in the nine cities that will serve as provincial capitals, and a new national anthem, the haunting liberation hymn, ""Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika,"" or ""God Bless Africa."" The new anthem will coexist with the old Afrikaans anthem, ""Die Stem,"" or ""The Call of South Africa."" **********""Die Stem"" has long been resented as the melody of apartheid, but this concession to the feelings of the white minority was no longer an issue today at the sweet and clumsy festival of democracy. **********In Alexandra, the teeming township closest to Johannesburg, nothing could contain outbursts of jubilation. **********""It was great fun, it was fun, fun, I like it!"" shouted Emma Yende, 48, emerging from the polling place at the Dutch Reformed Church. ""It's my first time voting, you know. My mother never voted, my father never voted, my grandfather never voted."" **********And Michael Ninetshikandwani, 43, who arrived at 4 A.M. to be first in line, was so excited that after voting and posing for photos he rushed off to slaughter a goat in celebration."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/world/russia-fights-a-rising-tide-of-infection.html,Michael Specter,1994-10-02,,748,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Russia Fights A Rising Tide Of Infection,Russia Fights A Rising Tide Of Infection," **********Frightened by the staggering increase in infectious diseases across Russia, the nation's chief sanitary officer is warning that without emergency action epidemics here could soon spread out of control. **********Rates of cholera, dysentery, diphtheria, tuberculosis and many sexually transmitted diseases have exploded in the past year. The rise is due largely to sharp reductions in funds for public health, a flood of often sick refugees from former Soviet republics, poor hygiene, and severe shortages of antibiotics. ""We are doing everything we can to protect the health of this country,"" said Yevgeny N. Belyayev, head of Russia's State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Surveillance. ""But the facts are not encouraging and time is short."" **********Russia is not alone among the countries of the former Soviet Union in facing the surge of infectious illness. In Ukraine, a cholera epidemic has developed so quickly that by today 18 people had died and doctors predicted that the disease would soon spread to nearly every part of the country. The country's chief epidemiologist, Vitaly Movchanok, said that many Ukrainian rivers are so contaminated by industrial waste and other refuse that most water filter systems are inadequate to protect against the cholera virus. **********The spread of infectious diseases, from cholera to syphilis, has been viewed with particular alarm by health officials because their prevalence often presents the clearest indication of a health care system unable to cope with its most basic problems. Most of these diseases are easily preventable, relatively cheap to cure, and if treated properly unlikely to cause long-term complications. **********But untreated they are deadly -- from the plague that has afflicted India and led Russia to suspend all business or tourist travel there -- to the cholera epidemic that began in the southern Russia this summer and has spread across Crimea and into the center of Ukraine. **********Infectious diseases are particularly dangerous because they can spread with exponential speed. In 1992, for example, Russia recorded 3,900 cases of diphtheria. Last year, the figure jumped to 15,210, according to statistics released this week. In the first six months of 1994 alone the number has tripled again, to almost 48,000 cases in the nation. By comparison, in the United States last year with a far larger population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not register a single case of diphtheria. **********Similarly, the number of cases of venereal disease among girls aged 12 to 16 tripled in Russia in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1993. The absolute figure remains low -- fewer than 2,000 cases have been reported in the nation. But the growth suggests a heightened level of unprotected sexual activity that almost guarantees an eventual surge in the number of AIDS cases here. **********In the past, Soviet officials often bragged about the health care system and many people say it has gotten worse since the Soviet Union dissolved. But it is impossible to know how much of the current crisis simply reflects honest, well reported disease statistics -- something that was not possible until a few years ago. **********""Russia has been hit with several intractable problems at once,"" said Murray Feshbach, a Georgetown University demographer. Mr. Feshbach spent the last week in Moscow, conferring with health officials. **********""Russia has a severe money problems and it is obvious when you look at the health budget,"" he said. ""They came late to realizing how rapidly these illnesses could spread. Refugees from all parts of the former empire are coming to Russia and bringing with them an incredible collection of diseases. And many Russians remain skeptical that the health care system can do them any good."" **********Open borders also present a critical problem for Russia. Again, democracy has proven far messier than the old days of Soviet border guards. Earlier this year, when cholera erupted in Dagestan, in southern Russia, officials slapped a quarantine on the region. But anybody with $20 could buy a pass that would let them board the next train to Moscow. **********Despite its economic problems, Russia is still relatively prosperous compared with most countries of the former Soviet Union and many other countries in the region. As a result, every train station in Moscow is filled with people from Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Armenia and many other countries. **********""These infections often come from beyond our borders,"" said Mr. Belyayev. ""But once they are here it is a problem for all of us."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/04/business/company-news-lotus-gets-a-big-order-for-software.html,Glenn Rifkin,1994-01-04,,802,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Lotus Gets A Big Order For Software,COMPANY NEWS; Lotus Gets A Big Order For Software," **********In a significant endorsement of Lotus Development's business-office software, Coopers & Lybrand, the big accounting and consulting firm, has decided to adopt Lotus's products for use on all of the company's personal computers. **********Coopers & Lybrand, which has already purchased 28,000 copies of Lotus Notes and Lotus's suite of spreadsheet, word processing and other desktop applications, intends to put Lotus software eventually on every personal computer used by Coopers's 70,000 employees in offices in 120 countries. The companies plan to announce the agreement this week. **********Although the initial order is worth only about $10 million to the Lotus Development Corporation, and analysts said the deal might eventually total $20 million or so, it is Lotus's biggest single-customer agreement yet. And it could have a broad impact because Coopers is an influential business consultant on the corporate use of information technology. Lotus Notes Leads the Way **********""Our intention is to establish a collaborative computing strategy for not only our own people, but for our clients and suppliers as well,"" Ellen M. Knapp, the firm's vice chairwoman for technology, said yesterday. **********The deal is further evidence that Lotus Notes, currently one of the business software industry's best-selling products, is swaying large corporate clients toward other Lotus software. Lotus reportedly sold more than $100 million worth of Notes in 1993, and analysts say demand remains strong for the product, known as ""groupware,"" which lets co-workers on a network work simultaneously on the same computer file. **********""This is very positive for Lotus,"" said Terry Quinn, an analyst with Furman Selz in New York. ""It shows that large companies are making a strategic commitment to Notes."" **********Notes is helping Lotus gain ground on the Microsoft Corporation in the ""suite wars."" Suites are bundles of applications like spreadsheets, word processing and graphics that are sold together for a fraction of what the programs would cost if bought individually. Suite sales are growing nearly 40 percent a year, twice the rate of the total applications market. Gaining in Suite Sales **********Microsoft still dominates in this market, holding about 75 percent of the $1.3 billion business. But in the last year, Lotus has come on strongly in suite sales. And Microsoft offers no product that is a direct competitor to Lotus Notes. **********""The differentiator in this deal is that Notes is being included with the desktop suite,"" Mr. Quinn said. ""The addition of Notes to any competitive evaluation changes the landscape. It's not just Lotus's suite against Microsoft's suite, but it's Lotus's suite and Notes against Microsoft's suite. **********""It moves them into a field of consideration that Microsoft doesn't bring to the party."" **********Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., were closed yesterday, and a Microsoft spokesman said company executives were not available for comment. **********Mr. Quinn pointed out that companies like Microsoft had signed megadeals for tens of thousands of copies of application software, but because these packages have become commodities, competitors will slash prices to win contracts. But with Notes, he added, Lotus can count on getting $250 a package even with steep discounting. **********""We got a great deal,"" Ms. Knapp acknowledged. ""Lotus was very eager to make this agreement.""

The consortium financed projects in the mid-80's but has since disbanded. **********The 40-year-old complex opened for condominium sales in 1989. But just 18 units were sold before the recession hit. The original sponsor, which defaulted on its $5 million loan and owed more than $100,000 in property taxes and water payments to the city, filed for bankruptcy. **********Since then, a rental program, managed until the purchase by a court-appointed receiver, has been in place at the complex. The banks foreclosed on the unsold units in 1993. Ravine Gardens, which then had 46 vacant units, sits along Ravine Avenue, overlooking the Hudson River and bordering the fashionable Northwest section of Yonkers, 10 miles north of Manhattan. The Metro-North Glenwood train station is a block away. **********The new owner, the GFC Capital Resources Group, is investing $1 million more into the complex. The work involves upgrading the vacant apartments, including the renovation of kitchens and bathrooms when needed. Plans also call for a playground. **********The owner is putting up half the financing, and the rest is a loan from the Marine Midland Bank. **********GFC has purchased properties in all five boroughs of New York City and has reworked distressed projects for lenders in the metropolitan area. But Ravine Gardens is its first acquisition for its own portfolio in Westchester County and the first time the company's two subsidiaries, its mortgage banking service and management arm, are involved in the same property. **********GFC's president, Allen I. Gross, said of the purchase: ""We feel we are entering the market at the right time and that as the economy improves so will the value of the property."" **********Gerald S. Migdol, executive vice president of GFC Management Services Inc., which is managing and marketing the complex, said another factor was that rental income was sufficient to cover operating costs. Rents are $650 to $850, and $328 to $611 for rent-stabilized units. **********Still, the company decided to keep the complex a condominium -- it was approved by the state in 1988 -- and to revive the offering plan because ""we could provide financing and affordably priced units, for which there is a need,"" Mr. Gross said. **********Reuben Pettiford, president of the Ravine Gardens Condominium Association, said of the new owners: ""Our goals, to improve and make the condominium viable, are aligned. And that can only help."" **********Though he doesn't like the lower prices, ""it is important to fill the complex,"" Mr. Pettiford said, adding, ""More work still needs to be done."" **********The same is true of the immediate neighborhood, which Lee J. Ellman, the city's planning director, called a traditional working-class area ""that is seeing a moderate level of private investment."" **********In the month since sales reopened at Ravine Gardens, contracts have been signed on 11 units and 5 more are pending. Introductory prices for the units, with 725 to 925 square feet, are $35,000 to $50,000, 40 to 50 percent lower than those of the original. Monthly charges are $241 to $296. **********Sales to tenants have not begun, but those in rent-stabilized units will get a discount, Mr. Migdol said. **********In the third quarter, the median sales price for existing condos in Westchester County was $168,000, down slightly from a year ago, according to the county's Board of Realtors. During the same period, 280 condominiums were sold, up from 205 last year and 170 in 1992. **********But since so many conversions took place in Yonkers during the 1980's, it is a buyer's market, realtors said. Also banks are giving loans only to buyers at condos or co-ops where at least half the units are sold. **********Harold and Milagros Turner are trading their one-bedroom rental in the Bronx for a two-bedroom unit at Ravine Gardens. ""We fell in love with the unit and the price was right,"" Mrs. Turner said, noting that the monthly cost of owning would be slightly more than their current rent."

As a result, the company said it would take a $103 million charge against its first-quarter earnings. **********Oryx's actions come at a time when crude oil prices remain depressed and many United States oil companies are curtailing spending on domestic oilfields in favor of overseas projects where costs are lower and prospects are more appealing. **********Oryx, based in Dallas, said that by consolidating its holdings and eliminating 300 jobs, it expected to save about $61 million a year. The company currently has 1,500 employees and took a $100 million loss last year on sales of $1.054 billion. **********As part of an earlier effort to reduce costs and debt in 1991, Oryx sold a high-yielding field in Bakersfield, Calif., for $500 million and closed regional offices in Houston and Oklahoma City, eliminating about 1,000 jobs.  ""We are determined to have our cost structure be more in line with current product prices,"" Robert P. Hauptfuhrer, the chairman and chief executive of Oryx, said in a statement. **********Oryx's shares gained 50 cents yesterday, closing at $17.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********By the end of the year, Oryx hopes to find buyers for 150 of its poorest-producing fields, generally in 13 Rocky Mountain states. The fields cumulatively yield about 5,000 barrels of crude oil a day, or 2 percent of Oryx's projected 1994 volume of 82 million barrels. But they account for 5 percent of Oryx's operating costs, John O'Keefe, a company spokesman, said yesterday. **********He declined to estimate the fields' value or the identity of potential bidders, but an oil analyst who asked not to be identified said a smaller independent oil company would probably pay about $60 million for the properties. **********After the planned sale, Oryx would control 150 fields in five Southern states and Michigan. The company, which also owns properties in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Indonesia, drills about 12 major wells a year. **********The analyst said the cutbacks were consistent with the strategy of Oryx to make its bets on fields with good potential for large finds. **********Mr. O'Keefe said the job cuts, some of which would occur this year, would be from the administrative staff and in specialized technical departments, such as those that analyze seismic information and oil samples. The company said it intended to contract out for some of those services."

Lotus noted the changes in a memorandum to employees two weeks ago, shortly after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings.

A $2.7 billion loss in 1992 from Hurricane Andrew in Florida and a $1.3 billion loss from the Los Angeles earthquake early this year have wreaked havoc on Allstate's profits. After a loss of $500 million in 1992, the company saw profits jump to a record $1.3 billion in disaster-free 1993, but earnings have slumped to $320.7 million in the first nine months of this year. **********Despite the company's success in recent years in building up both its property insurance and its life insurance businesses, cutting overhead expenses and maintaining a good record for limiting its ordinary loss claims, the vulnerability to disasters has cast a shadow over its stock price. **********Since June 1993, when Sears, Roebuck & Company, sold nearly 20 percent of Allstate for $2.36 billion -- the largest initial public stock offering of any company -- its stock rose from $27 to a peak of $34.25 in October last year only to slide to yesterday's close of $24.125, down 75 cents. **********Because of Sears's plan to distribute the remaining 360 million Allstate shares to Sears shareholders, some traders expect the stock to come under additional pressure. **********A. Michael Franquilli of Salomon Brothers said before the Sears announcement that Allstate's growth and success in controlling costs and day-to-day claims losses justified a buy recommendation. Others, such as Weston M. Hicks of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, have neutral opinions, partly because of its vulnerability to disasters. **********Mr. Hicks said that the company was not likely to improve on the stellar performance of its automobile insurance business. He reduced his estimate for 1995 earnings yesterday to $3.05 a share from $3.15 because ending the ties with Sears will eliminate some tax benefits. **********Jerry D. Choate, Allstate's chief executive, says reducing the exposure to catastrophe losses was his top priority. But in an interview yesterday, he did not offer much hope for a quick solution. **********By not accepting new customers in California and large parts of Florida -- and declining to renew any customers in three Florida counties, soon to be five -- he said the company was making good progress toward reducing its estimated maximum loss from any single event to $1 billion by 1997. But he added that Allstate had still not purchased reinsurance to reduce its losses from disasters ""because it is too expensive"" and unavailable in the amounts Allstate would need. **********In the meantime, Mr. Choate said he watched the weather channel on TV ""a lot more than I would like."" **********John Snyder, senior vice president at the A. M. Best Company, a rating firm, said that operating without the reinsurance that most other companies buy ""is a viable strategy for Allstate because they are big enough to survive."" But the absence does mean ""that from time to time they will suffer some very big losses and have to pick themselves up."" **********How lucky Allstate will be can only be a guess. But other insurers expect even more costly disasters. Munich Re, a German company and the world's largest reinsurance company, said earlier this week that it planned to reduce its exposure in many parts of the world because climatic changes, including global warming, would lead to more severe storms in areas where population growth and real estate development have sharply increased insurers' risks. ""If I was a betting man, I could offer you a bet that the records of recent years will be beaten by new damage records,"" Wolf Otto Bauer, a director, said in a recent article in The Financial Times of London. **********But even if Allstate continues growing and improving its efficiency and is lucky enough to avoid new disasters, some analysts assume that many Sears shareholders will want to sell the stock, thereby depressing its price. Managers of index funds, for example, are big investors in Sears because of its place in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, but would have no reason to hold Allstate, which is not part of that index. **********Institutions that own both Sears and Allstate may find themselves with more of the insurer than they want. Fidelity Management of Boston, for example, is the largest outside holder of Sears, with 19 million shares at midyear, and also one of the largest holders of Allstate, with 10.7 million shares. Fidelity declined comment."

In the end, with new jobs well below private forecasts, European markets firmed. **********Economists, however, wonder if the markets' concerns are not misplaced. They increasingly express doubt that Europe is as much a hostage to American interest rates as the markets seem to believe. **********""I cannot really see why the markets get so upset every time short-term interest rates in America go up,"" said Nigel Gault, chief European economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in London. **********At the short end, economists stress that interest rates in Europe are set by the Bundesbank, not by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, they insist that there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the German central bank continues to be largely unmoved by events on the far side of the Atlantic. **********""The Bundesbank will go its own way,"" says Ulrich Beckmann, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. **********Having said that, most forecasters advise that they can see little reason for the Bundesbank to begin tightening monetary policy soon. They point to predicted declines in German inflation well into next year and even to Germany's troublesome measure of money supply, M-3, which at last seems headed back into the Bundesbank's target range. **********Where U.S. interest rates do exert a direct and nearly instantaneous impact on Europe is via the price of long-term money. In general, interest rates in Europe have raced upward in tandem with those in America for much of the year. **********""Economic conditions in Europe do not justify interest rates at current levels,"" said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economic advisor at the Bank of America in London. **********Where opinions diverge a bit is over the impact of those made-in-America bond yields on the future course of Europe's recovery. Theoretically, the impact should be greatest in countries like Germany, where fully 80 percent of credits are long-term. Yields on 10-year bonds have soared from 5.5 percent at the beginning of the year to 7.6 percent. **********Nonetheless, Richard Reid, chief economist for UBS in Frankfurt, forecast a steady acceleration of German economic growth, from 2.6 percent this year to 3.2 percent next year. **********In Europe, where the strength of the recovery has surprised most forecasters this year, economists argue that high long-term interest rates imported from America will simply limit the scope for future surprises on the up side. **********""These interest rate rises do make me very suspicious of optimistic forecasts of the pace of growth in the second half of next year,"" said Philippe Brossard, chief economist of Crédit Lyonnais Capital Markets International in Paris. **********Economists warn however, that if long-term rates remain high or rise even further into next year as demand for borrowed funds from corporations begins to pick up, the effect on the recovery could be more pronounced. Most think that the bond markets take far too grim a view on the risk of future inflation even in America, where economic growth is strongest and spare production capacity in shortest supply. **********Mr. Hawkins faults the bond markets for a lack of patience. He says that instead of waiting to see how much steam rising interest rates have taken out of the recovery, they push rates higher at every indication that American output continues to grow. **********""The market continually looks for weaker figures the next month when interest rates normally take at least a year to produce an impact,"" he says. **********Curiously, some European economists argue that at this point the best thing that the Fed could do is to hike short- term interest rates substantially in order to convince the markets once and for all that it is on top of the situation. Convinced that the reins were being pulled tight at the short end, they argue, longer yields could then actually ease."

Daly, the chairman and chief executive at Warner Brothers, said with a laugh today: ""What makes Warner Brothers work isn't just Bob Daly. No way. It's Terry Semel, too."" **********Today, Mr. Daly, who is 57, formalized his business relationship with his second-in-command, Terry S. Semel, 51, by announcing that the two men would share responsibilities and serve as chairmen and co-chief executives at Warner Brothers. They will report jointly to Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc. **********A partnership such as Mr. Daley's and Mr. Semel's is highly unusual among Hollywood studio executives, who jealously guard their turf and rarely yield any power voluntarily. The studio itself has probably been most successful in recent years with hits like the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, ""Batman"" and ""The Fugitive."" **********Although Mr. Semel has recently signed a new contract with Warner Brothers, the New York-born executive was known to be somewhat restless and, over the last year, contemplated buying the Metro-Goldwyn Mayer Company with other investors. Mr. Levin implored him to stay at Warner Brothers, studio sources said. It was unclear if Mr. Semel's promotion was part of his new deal with Warner Brothers. A Shared Partnership **********Mr. Semel, who has been president and chief operating officer at Warner Brothers, has reported to Mr. Daly for more than a decade. But, within the studio and outside, it was clear that the two men have maintained a shared partnership. Decisions about films and investments, newspaper interviews and personnel matters are conducted jointly. **********""This is really a formal acknowledgment of the relationship that Terry and I currently share,"" Mr. Daly observed. ""We have overseen the company together. We often drive to work together. We have a great personal relationship. He was very supportive when I was going through marital problems. We're both going to stay here a long time and we both have a lot of plans about where Warner Brothers will be in five and ten years."" **********Rival studio executives, producers and agents consider Warner Brothers the calmest, most formidable and most powerful studio in town. Staff turnover is rare. Even with an embarrassing big budget failure, such as ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" (1990), the studio doesn't purge executives or engage in public back-stabbing. Risk Takers With Taste **********""They're extraordinary competitors,"" said Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. ""They're risk takers. They've got taste. They consistently turn out eclectic, quality movies and they've done it now for a decade. Nobody else does it like them."" **********Mr. Semel, who has a degree in accounting from Long Island University, began his career as a trainee in the Warner Brothers office in New York and in 1975 was appointed president and general sales manager of Warner Brothers Distributing Company. Three years later he was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of Warner Brothers. **********Mr. Semel, in an interview, acknowledged the unusual nature of the partnership and said there was virtually no tension between the two men. ""We never formally divide responsibilities in any definite way,"" he said. ""It's like a wonderful marriage. I say, 'I'll handle this movie thing,' and he'll say, 'I'll go to the meeting on the fifth network.""' **********Asked how they dealt, as partners, with inevitable disagreements about whether to proceed with a movie or not, Mr. Semel said: ""If either of us has a great deal of passion about any decision. the other one becomes the devil's advocate. We talk through the pros and cons. The one with the most passion wins. Remarkably, we've never had a deadlock."""

Then came the Newton Message Pad from Apple, whose initial handwriting recognition software became the butt of jokes, and which has had total sales of only about 100,000 units after more than a year on the market. **********Now, hoping for better results, the consumer-electronics giant Sony Electronics is introducing the latest attempt at a portable computer-communications device -- with, as it turns out, the help of the AT&T Corporation and Apple Computer Inc. Not to mention Motorola Inc., another partner in this multi-corporate effort, in which the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan and Philips Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands also have roles. **********The $995 product is called the Magic Link PIC 1000 -- PIC stands for Personal Intelligent Communicator -- and goes on sale today at more than 1,000 consumer electronics stores around the United States, like Circuit City and others that already sell computers and Sony products. The device, about the size of a fat paperback book, represents the most ambitious attempt yet by computer and communications companies to pool their resources in hopes of finally creating a market for what the industry calls ""personal digital assistants."" With the Magic Link, an executive on the go is supposed to be able to send and receive electronic mail, make airline reservations, log appointments, check stock quotes and conduct various other sorts of personal business -- without having to learn complicated and arcane computer commands. **********The product has also been designed as the first application for a new nationwide AT&T network, PersonaLink, which makes use of ""intelligent agent"" software that enables a message to find the recipient even if the sender has no address. These agents can also do their master's bidding in other ways, like being able to carry out the command ""Page me, if I receive mail from the boss."" **********Manufactured in Japan by Sony for its American unit, Sony Electronics, the Magic Link is the first commercial product to incorporate a type of operating-system software known as Magic Cap. **********The Magic Cap software has been developed by General Magic Inc., a spinoff of Apple that is also partly owned by Sony, Motorola, AT&T, Matsushita and Philips. General Magic is also the developer of Telescript, the messaging software in AT&T's PersonaLink. **********For AT&T, which dropped production of its EO earlier this year, and stands to benefit if the industry embraces Telescript software and the PersonaLink network, the Sony relationship could prove valuable. But for many of the other partners, the alliance is a marriage of convenience that could eventually give way to a family feud. Magic Link will be a direct competitor to Apple's Newton, and to a personal communicator called Envoy that Motorola hopes to begin shipping by early next year. Matsushita and Phillips are also expected to bring out their own devices. **********And yet, even if the competition proves fierce, all the companies stand to benefit if the market for personal digital assistants grows to produce sales of two million or more units a year by the end of the decade, as some analysts predict. **********""This thing and its eventual cousins from Motorola and others have a chance, if AT&T and General Magic can hang in there for a few more years,"" said Kimball Brown, an analyst with the research house Dataquest Inc. **********Although the Magic Link contains software for note-taking, bill-paying, financial analysis and scheduling, its raison d'etre is messaging. Sony executives see the initial target market as ""mobile executives."" And based on research indicating that such people primarily use portable computers to send and receive electronic mail, Sony and its partners aimed to make that function as painless and ""intelligent"" as possible. **********To gauge just how well they met that goal, all reporting for this article -- following an initial briefing at Sony Electronics headquarters in San Jose, Calif. -- was done via E-mail over AT&T's PersonaLink network, using a Magic Link machine on loan from Sony. Analysts who responded to a reporter's questions by E-mail from Magic Links lent to them gave the product mixed reviews. While most praised the software and general ease of use, nearly all said the Magic Link's screen was too dim and the price too high. **********While the Magic Link, which weighs 1.2 pounds, has a suggested retail price of $995, accessories most buyers will need or want make the real price closer to $1,500. A pager card, for receiving brief text messages wirelessly, adds $250; additional memory costs $220; a carrying case is $80 and a rechargeable lithium ion battery is $70. **********Fully featured notebook computers, though a bit bulkier, sell for much less, meaning potential customers will be expecting the Magic Link to deliver something special. **********Most analysts who had spent time with the device wrote that it does deliver. ""I am very, very impressed,"" wrote Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future, a research firm in Menlo Park, Calif. **********The Magic Cap software can be operated by touch-screen menus that make ample use of pictographic icons representing basic commands. If that sounds a lot like the Apple Macintosh software operating system, it may be because Magic Cap was developed by the same team of Andy Hertzfield and Bill Atkinson that created the Macintosh system when they were still at Apple. **********Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Hertzfield helped found General Magic in May 1990, with Marc Porat, who had begun the software-development effort within Apple, then left to form the new company with Apple's backing. Sony and the other partners came aboard over the next several years. **********As its user interface, General Magic's Magic Cap software employs a rendering of a desk, complete with telephone, rolodex and date book. Less frequently used features can be found in the ""hallway"" (represented by doors) or ""downtown"" (represented by buildings, like one for the PersonaLink messaging center and another for connecting to the America Online information service). While some analysts consider the icons almost too cute, they concede that Magic Cap is easy to learn. **********""This has a lot of utility and it is much easier to use than I thought it would be,"" Denise Caruso, editorial director of Technology & Media, an industry newsletter, scrawled. She offered her remarks by using Magic Link's ""digital ink,"" feature, which records but does not translate handwriting. Whatever is written on the screen with digital ink is captured as an image and can be transmitted, in a manner similar to writing a note on paper and faxing it. **********Unlike Apple's Newton, Magic Link currently has no provision for translating handwriting to computer text, although the Magic Cap software is designed to permit the addition of such technology in the future. To create computer text, users tap on a keyboard that appears on the screen, using either their fingertips or a penlike pointing device included with the machine. For writing long memos, a separate 6-by-10-inch keyboard is offered, but it adds considerably to the Magic Link's bulk. **********Besides posing competition to Apple's Newton, Magic Link invites comparison with the Hewlett-Packard Company's pocket-sized HP 100 LX palmtop computer, which has had sales of more than 300,000 units since its introduction in early 1991. The Hewlett-Packard device, while lacking Magic Link's user-friendly software features, does have a real -- albeit tiny -- keyboard, and does run standard personal computer software programs, like Lotus 1-2-3, that are based on the industry-standard DOS operating system. **********The Magic Link is ""not as good a choice as the HP 100 LX for those who are at ease with DOS communications, but that's a small group,"" Richard Shaffer, publisher of Computer Letter, wrote in an E-mail message. ""I find the cutesy interface a little off-putting, but it is easy to navigate."" **********Perhaps most important to Magic Link's market prospects is its use of the Telescript intelligent-agent technology in AT&T's PersonaLink network, without which the Sony device may be limited in its appeal. **********With Telescript, PersonaLink allows a user to send electronic messages without knowing a recipient's address. It can also be instructed to relay a message to a recipient's fax machine if the electronic mail is not picked up. Users can also write their own rules, like ""Page me if my company's stock hits $50."" **********Sony plans to draw upon AT&T's vast data base of long-distance service users in its marketing plans for Magic Link, which include direct sales to business and sales through selected retail stores. ""The product clearly has appeal to those customers who are heavy users of our services when they're traveling,"" said Bill Fallon, marketing director for AT&T PersonaLink. Only later, perhaps by late 1996, once prices have fallen below $500 or so, will Sony and AT&T aim at the broader consumer market. **********Some question this strategy. **********""Sony's heart and soul cries, 'Sell Magic Link to consumers,' "" said William Bluestein, an analyst with Forrester Research. But after the EO debacle and the slow sales of Newton, the idea of personal digital assistants for a mass market is in ""disrepute,"" Mr. Bluestein said. ""So instead, Sony talks about 'mobile professionals' and 'the whole person,' "" he said. ""Only one problem -- Magic link will appeal to neither."" **********Mr. Bluestein said the price is the biggest obstacle. **********But Mr. Brown of Dataquest contends that if AT&T, Sony and General Magic are willing to stay the course, the market will develop. Priced right, he argues, devices like Magic Link could be widely appealing. ""I am sending this from Japan,"" Mr. Brown commented in his E-mail missive, ""and it's amazing how easy it is to make it work from here."""

Bosnian Croat forces of the so-called Croatian Defense Council massed in western Mostar have not lifted a finger to help the Muslims, with whom they are in principle allied. **********""About 15 American officers will be coming to Sarajevo at the beginning of November with the aim of really establishing a federal army,"" the Croatian Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, said in an interview. ""It is important that America knows who has been sabotaging the federal army -- the Bosnian Government. The Croats would help in Mostar if the attitude of the Muslims was different."" **********A senior United States official confirmed that what he called ""an American military mission"" would soon arrive in Sarajevo, headed by John Galvin, a retired American general who recently stepped down as the supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe. **********The bolstering of the military alliance of Muslims and Croats is important to the United States because of a widely held view in the Administration that only the establishment of a balance of power in Bosnia will create the conditions for peace. **********But the task of the American officers will be arduous. During the last six months, it has become clear that the Bosnian Government Army and the Croatian Defense Council are still a long way from forgetting the brutal fighting between them in central Bosnia last year. **********While President Alija Izetbegovic talks of ""liberating"" Bosnia from nationalist Serb aggressors -- a war that would presumably be long and involve all Bosnian territory -- the Croats favor a rapid compromise with the Serbs that takes account of the fact that Serbs represent a third of the Bosnian population. **********Gen. Ante Rosso, the head of the Croatian Defense Council's military delegation to the federation, rejected those accusations. He said crimes had been committed by all sides in Bosnia and that the real impediment to establishing an effective joint command for a federal army was suspicion about President Izetbegovic's goals. **********""Why should we Croats engage ourselves when we do not know the strategic aim?"" General Rosso asked. ""Izetbegovic talks of liberating Bosnia. But perhaps after freeing the country of Serbs, he will want to free it of Croats, too. We need to know exactly what this so-called liberation means."" **********General Rosso estimated that there were about 60,000 soldiers in the Croatian Defense Council and 120,000 in the Bosnian Army. Integration has scarcely begun. **********The Bosnian Government's misgivings about integrating the armies arise partly from a suspicion that the federation could be just the first step to undermining the Muslims as an independent force. **********The Government fears that if military power really comes to rest with the federation, and the federation enters a confederation with Croatia as planned, the Muslims of Bosnia may find themselves swallowed between that entity and the Serbs. **********""Our military integration has been slowed because there are still many people who cannot abandon ideas linked to the dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" said Kemal Muftic, a senior aide to President Izetbegovic."

They succeeded. **********By prior agreement, Hamas radicals kept their ample supply of guns hidden, and Mr. Arafat's police stayed far away from the soggy soccer field where the rally took place. So the event passed peacefully despite bellicose speeches lashing out at the Palestinian Authority -- and, even more so, its negotiating partner, Israel, which the speakers warned would remain a target of deadly attacks. **********But simply by bringing out so many people, Hamas demonstrated its strength in the battle for public opinion between the authority and Islamic groups opposed to the agreement on Palestinian self-rule reached last year with the Israelis. **********Earlier this week, Mr. Arafat summoned about 10,000 loyalists into Gaza's streets, hundreds of them armed with automatic rifles. **********The crowd mustered by Hamas today was appreciably larger. While guns were kept out of sight, the crisp manner of the rally underlined that the fundamentalist Muslim group is a well-disciplined force capable of mounting a serious challenge to Mr. Arafat. **********The P.L.O. chairman lost considerable popular support when his police opened fire on fellow Palestinians on Nov. 18. At least 12 people died and about 200 others were wounded. The death toll has changed several times; at one point, it was put at 14, but two people listed as dead turned out to be alive. **********The violence aroused fears of a possible civil war in the Gaza Strip, but all major factions have said they would work hard avoid such strife. Nonetheless, the strains that caused the explosion last week are still powerful, and Palestinians say that the best they have achieved thus far is a temporary truce. **********At the rally today, dozens of young men paraded military-style before the crowd, holding aloft copies of the Koran and waving black banners carrying Islamic slogans. As people cheered and cried out, ""God is Great,"" four masked men in fatigue uniforms stood before the raised speakers' platform and burned Israeli and American flags. **********From the stage, Hamas leaders accused the Arafat-led authority of trying to evade responsibility for the recent violence. **********""The Palestinian Authority says that Hamas killed its own people,"" a speaker said. ""Did we do that?"" **********""No!"" the crowd roared back. **********One reason for the rally was to memorialize Imad Akel, a 24-year-old militant who was shot to death by Israeli undercover agents a year ago. Banners carried Mr. Akel's portrait and a quotation attributed to him that said, ""Killing Jews brings us closer to God."" **********The rally was held in one of Gaza City's poorer neighborhoods, which means it is very poor indeed. Mr. Arafat and his aides have begun demanding more insistently since the latest violence that foreign countries follow through -- and soon -- on still-unfulfilled pledges of aid. **********Terje Larsen, the senior United Nations official here, has proposed an immediate infusion of cash for public works projects like road-building. To get to the rally today, people had to step around virtual lakes of muddy water formed by heavy rains the day before, a common sight in Gaza."

The 225-share Nikkei index rose 1,471.24 points, or 7.84 percent, to 20,229.12. It was the biggest single increase since the index rose 13.24 percent in October 1990. **********At the opening this morning, there were so many buy orders that only about half of the 225 stocks in the index could open for trading initially. In addition, the soaring price levels triggered what are known as circuit breakers in the stock index futures market, which shut down futures trading in most contracts without a single trade taking place during the morning session. **********The rise marked the resumption of a nearly two-month old rally that has now lifted the index nearly 20 percent in value. **********It was also the source of hope that, even if the market remained volatile in the short-term -- and some analysts warned today's ebullient charge might reverse soon -- the outlook might be brighter than at any time since the market began its long descent four years ago. **********Analysts said the rally was a tangible sign both of the relief that investors felt, now that it appeared the Government would finally address the deep recession, and of optimism that the reform-minded Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would initiate a program of deregulation. **********""This is much more significant than a one-time pop,"" said Geoffrey Barker, chief of research here for Baring Securities. ""It is saying that there's a reformist Government in power and that it's going to continue in power."" **********He added: ""That's very bullish for the economy and trade, and especially for relations with America. The potential for deregulation, we think, is very good, and that is going to help the economy in the long term."" **********Prices of Government bonds, however, fell, as investors expressed fear that the new measures expected from the Government would be financed by new bond issues, analysts said. **********The Hosokawa Government has said that it wants to undertake a broad program of economic stimulation and restructuring, by increasing spending on public works and altering the tax system. It has also said that it intends to shift the balance of economic policy toward consumers, and thus toward domestic demand, and away from industry and exports. **********But it had held its economic-recovery package hostage to the electoral reform battle for several months. Indeed, Mr. Hosokawa had suggested that he would resign if he failed to enact the reform bills, which are intended to clean up the scandal-tainted electoral and campaign-financing systems. **********A watered-down version of the bills was passed by the Parliament on Saturday after a fight of extraordinary intensity. Investors seemed concerned only to get the issue out of the way, ignoring criticism after its adoption that the final legislation would not be effective. **********This morning, there were reports that the Government would announce within days a program as big as 14 trillion yen -- or slightly more than $140 billion -- of public-works spending projects, land-repurchase programs and income tax cuts. The reports indicated that the tax cuts might be retroactive to January, a move that might quickly lift bleak consumer sentiment. **********That could be particularly good news for the United States, which has been pressing Japan for a year to stimulate its economy vigorously as a way of limiting its rapidly growing trade surplus. A stronger economy would be likely to attract more imports, something the United States has been pressing. Meeting With Clinton **********Mr. Hosokawa is to meet with President Clinton on Feb. 11 in Washington. Talks on opening various Japanese markets have not gone well up to now, so good news on the economic front would be crucial in patching up the two countries' strained trade relationship. And that, analysts said, would cheer the stock market here even further. **********But analysts said that the bulk of the buying in the stock market today was coming from overseas investors, as has been the case for several months. **********Many Japanese are still burdened with huge losses from the four-year-old market slump; the Nikkei index remains down about 50 percent from its peak at the end of 1989. **********""What we're hearing from the Japanese is that they are still looking for chances to sell shares, not buy,"" said Robert Sasaki, an analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities here. **********The shares of banks have been a particular target for such selling, analysts say, since they are ailing from many bad loans."

After serving as the first advertising columnist for The New York Times from 1958 to 1960, Mr. Spielvogel held top positions at four leading firms: McCann-Erickson Worldwide, the Interpublic Group of Companies, Backer & Spielvogel and Bates, previously called Backer Spielvogel Bates. **********""There's a time to stay and a time to go,"" Mr. Spielvogel, 65, said during an interview. ""This is a time to go. Now it's time to do something else."" **********Mr. Spielvogel will serve for two years as a consultant to Bates, which has 185 offices in 65 countries and billings of $5.2 billion from clients including Hyundai Motor America, Mars Inc. and the Miller Brewing Company. **********At McCann and Interpublic, Mr. Spielvogel helped to expand international operations significantly. And by making Backer & Spielvogel one of the hottest shops of the early 1980's, Mr. Spielvogel and Bill Backer, his copywriting colleague from McCann, accelerated the trend, now widespread, of executives from older, larger agencies offering marketers more entrepreneurial, creatively focused alternatives for their advertising. **********""They showed people that if you're good enough, you can handle big business,"" Charles Scott, chief executive at the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, said in a telephone interview from London. Bates is one of Saatchi's three major worldwide agency networks. **********The phrase about pursuing other opportunities in Mr. Spielvogel's surprising announcement is often used by departing executives or their employers to signal disagreements. Yet Mr. Spielvogel, who has had substantive differences in recent years with some Bates and Saatchi executives, said the decision was entirely his and was worked out ""amicably"" with Mr. Scott. **********""I told Charlie I had other plans and wanted to pursue them,"" Mr. Spielvogel said. ""It was a very simple discussion. There's nothing between the lines."" **********Under his current contract with Saatchi, Mr. Spielvogel, who relinquished his position as Bates's chief executive in December to Michael Bungey, Bates's president, was scheduled to hand over the chairman's post to Mr. Bungey at the end of this year. **********Mr. Scott said that Mr. Spielvogel ""just called me up two or three weeks ago to have a chat and said something along the lines of 'I think my job is done; If it's O.K. with you, I'd like to resign in October.' "" **********""I've always had a pretty good relationship with Carl,"" he added. ""We obviously didn't always agree on everything, but we were always able to discuss things in an amicable way."" **********Mr. Spielvogel's disputes with the British executives have involved issues like the role they should -- or shouldn't -- play in Bates's operations. Mr. Spielvogel was also unhappy with the agency name change in June to Bates, which eliminated his name and that of Mr. Backer. **********Mr. Bungey, who previously held top positions at Bates's London agency, said in a telephone interview during a business trip to Barcelona: ""I've known Carl for eight or nine years. We haven't always agreed on everything, but we had terrific times together. He's certainly a person I've enjoyed working with."" **********He added: ""Carl was one of the great personalities in this business. There aren't many left."" Mr. Bungey lauded Mr. Spielvogel's ""incredible amount of energy,"" and said, ""For all I know, he's got a third career lined up."" **********Indeed, Mr. Spielvogel said: ""I had one career in journalism and one in advertising. I'm getting ready to start my third career."" He added that he was considering ""two very interesting entrepreneurial situations"" and would disclose his plans in two weeks. **********And beyond his third career, he said, he was already considering a fourth, in public service. He is a prominent supporter of the Democratic party. **********Mr. Spielvogel's journalism career began in 1950 with a job as a night-shift copyboy at The Times. He became a reporter in the business section in 1955 and three years later began writing the advertising column, which has continued as a weekday feature through eight successive columnists. **********Mr. Spielvogel's advertising career began in 1960 at McCann in New York, where he rose to executive vice president and general manager before joining McCann's parent, Interpublic, in 1972. At Interpublic, he rose to vice chairman and chairman of the executive committee before leaving in 1979 to open Backer & Spielvogel with Mr. Backer, who retired from Bates, where he served as president and executive creative director, in December. **********The early successes of Backer & Spielvogel included landing the Miller Lite beer account from McCann and others from big marketers like Avis Rent-a-Car, the Campbell Soup Company, Hyundai and Wendy's International Inc. Saatchi bought the agency in 1986, for an estimated $100 million, and a year later merged it with another of its American agencies, Ted Bates Worldwide. **********The merged agency, which united Bates's buttoned-down, hard-sell attitudes with Backer & Spielvogel's more freestyle, soft-sell tactics, went though bumpy periods; in 1990 and 1991 there were a skein of account losses including Prudential Insurance, Xerox and Miller Lite. **********In the last year, results have been mixed. There have been account losses like Philips Consumer Electronics and Trans World Airlines, and Bates was removed from the rosters of CPC International and Philip Morris U.S.A. in consolidations. It has also gained accounts like Cunard Line, GFI Industries, Miller's Lite Ice brand and the Warner-Wellcome joint venture of health-care products titans Warner-Lambert and Burroughs Wellcome."

Curiously, yes. While stocks are the standard way to cash in on growth, managers know that debt works, too. **********And the new funds plan to use that tool for a future they see as very bright. ""The world is changing,"" said Simon Nocera, who manages the G. T. Global High-Income A fund, the oldest of the emerging-markets debt funds at just two years. From Argentina to Morocco, emerging economies are opening markets, raising taxes and capping spending. In fact, he said, ""many emerging nations now have better fundamentals than developed ones."" **********Consider Italy and Mexico. Italy, the developed one, has a budget deficit that is nearly 9 percent of gross domestic product. Mexico, the emerging one, has a surplus. The Italian debt is 120 percent of G. D. P. Mexico's is 22 percent. Yet, ""Italy is an AA country,"" Mr. Nocera said, ""while Mexico is still a BB."" **********The funds welcome the double-digit yields that attend low ratings. And no wonder. Global bond funds yield only 5.5 percent, said Amy Arnott of Morningstar, which tracks the fund industry. But the new funds also expect to profit from rising bond values as emerging nations advance and the world sees their lower risk. **********Theory aside, how have these funds fared? In 1993 they soared 51 percent, but, early this year, when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, they sank by nearly 20 percent. Since then, Mexico's election results and bargain hunting have erased half of those losses. **********The funds plead guilty to great volatility -- but with an explanation. When rates rose and prices crashed, highly leveraged hedge funds had to cash in their most profitable bonds, from emerging markets. Thus, solid, long-term plays were ensnared in some short-term razzmatazz. **********""The economic fundamentals were not playing a fundamental role,"" said Susan Gray of the Scudder Emerging Markets Income Fund. With the flap over, the managers argue, the funds can resume their upward march. **********Latin American nations -- Argentina, Mexico and Brazil -- are the funds' favorites. Since 1991, Argentina has reduced inflation from 50 percent to 10 percent and still managed to grow 6 percent a year. **********But many other nations look good, too. ""The Czech reform program really works,"" said Lincoln Anderson, Fidelity's research director. ""It's outperformed Poland, Hungary and the rest of Eastern Europe."" Scudder agrees; its Czech bonds are earning 25 percent a year. **********Morocco, growing nearly 10 percent a year, is G. T. Global's second-largest holding. And 7 percent of the fund's assets are in Poland. Peru has allure, too, Mr. Anderson said, with its rising copper exports. **********Such prospects can only multiply. ""There are 160 emerging countries,"" Ms. Gray said. **********Moreover, the cachet of emerging stocks may mean that bonds are the better buy. And sometimes, debt may be a nation's main game. ""Poland's equity market is not nearly as big as its debt market,"" said Gary Kreps of G. T. Global. **********Yet, unlike their effect in developed nations, bonds may not hedge emerging equities. ""This year and last, emerging stocks and emerging bonds seemed to move in tandem,"" Ms. Arnott said. **********More generally, with emerging bonds, missteps are easy. In 1990, investors flocked to Venezuela. Then came coup attempts, corruption and economic setbacks. Soon, the nation was a fallen angel. **********""My job,"" Mr. Anderson said, ""is to research the heck out of the risk, find the Argentinas and avoid the Venezuelas. That's what gives me a haunted look."" **********But, despite their risks, these debt funds often sidestep some basic investing perils. **********Many emerging nations issue debt in dollars to attract buyers. This means investors can skirt a major danger of foreign investing -- exchange-rate risk. On June 30, 81 percent of the G. T. Global fund was dollar-based; the Fidelity New Markets Income fund, 49 percent. Even when funds buy nondollar bonds, the currencies -- Argentine peso, Thai baht -- are often pegged to the dollar. **********Similarly, to corral interest rates, emerging nations often sell floating-rate bonds. ""We're about 65 percent in floating rates,"" Ms. Gray said. Also, most emerging debt is government bonds -- safer and more liquid than private bonds. At Scudder, 85 percent of assets are public debt. **********And fund variations can affect risk. G. T. Global's high-income fund can invest entirely in emerging markets, but the company's Strategic Income A has a 50 percent cap. **********A glance at 1994's dizzying ups and downs shows that none of these efforts make funds safe.

As television merges with telecommunication, we are entering a multimedia, 500-channel, digital-technology era. Today's broadcasters are looking to assemble a diverse arsenal of classic films, see-it-as-it-happens news shows, major sporting events, home shopping milieus, and diverse information channels in order to compete. **********Two major industry developments of the past year highlight the trend. The Fox network's outbidding of CBS Inc. for broadcast rights to National Football Conference games for the next four years, and the bidding war between Viacom Inc. and QVC Network Inc. for control of Paramount Communications Inc., are prime examples, say analysts, of major players trying to prepare for a higher-tech future in which consumers will have a huge choice of entertainment and information fare that will flow along the now-under-construction electronic superhighway. **********Paramount is currently the belle of the ball, many add, due to its diversity. In addition to its film library, movie studio and television shows, Paramount owns the Simon & Schuster publishing house and two high-profile sports teams in the country's largest media market: the New York Knicks, of the National Basketball Association, and the New York Rangers, of the National Hockey League. **********For investors, the prospects appear mixed. While heavy corporate spending for new technology and new programming can bode well for the future, it can also hurt short-term earnings and share price growth significantly. And the overall U.S. economy, while forecast by many to chug along satisfactorily in 1994, is not expected to generate any windfall in advertising revenues for broadcasters. Analysts say, accordingly, that investors considering exposure to the sector in 1994 will have to pick and choose carefully. Professional opinion varies, moreover, on which companies have the most attractive shares. **********CBS, defeated by Fox for the rights to broadcast NFC games, and later spurned by the National Football League in a last-ditch bid for broadcast rights to American Football Conference games, is getting hot and cold notices from analysts. A central question, naturally, is how much the loss of pro football, which CBS had carried regularly since 1956, will hurt the network. CBS had been losing money on football for years, but the Sunday afternoon games provided a seamless lead-in to the network's Sunday night programming, which included the top-rated news program ""60 minutes."" Fox's bid of $1.58 billion was reported to be about $400 million higher than CBS's offer. **********""CBS was in a no-win situation with the NFC,"" said John G. Nelson, who tracks broadcasting stocks for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""If the other guy is willing to pay an outrageous price, you're out of the game. Fox obviously felt they had to make a big splash, but an offer of that magnitude hints of desperation. How CBS will fare depends on what they replace the football with. For now, I have a neutral rating on CBS shares. "" **********But Melissa Cook of Prudential Securities Research came through with a ""buy"" rating on CBS. ""I don't see the loss of football as having an adverse effect on the Sunday night programs,"" she said. **********Both Miss Cook and Mr. Nelson gave a ""buy"" rating to shares of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which itself will shell out $1.09 billion for the rights to televise Monday night NFL games for the next four years. ""Cap Cities has more momentum in the ratings right now than CBS, and it's more diversified, owning about 80 percent of ESPN and a third of the Arts and Entertainment Network,"" said Mr. Nelson. In late December, five of the top ten rated U.S. television shows were broadcast on ABC. **********Jessica Reif of Oppenheimer & Co. gave a neutral rating to Capital Cities/ABC shares, however. ""They've had good momentum for the past couple of years,"" she said, ""but I think their ratings have peaked."" **********And what of the Fox network, owned by Rupert Murdoch's multimedia giant News Corporation Ltd.? In the wake of the football coup against CBS, Mr. Murdoch was reported to say that broadcasting NFC games would likely be a big money loser for Fox, but that the prestige of the contract would compensate by raising the network's profile and enhancing overall advertising revenues. Some analysts agree with him. **********""Until now, Fox has been a distant fourth network behind ABC, NBC and CBS,"" said Miss Reif. ""Now it has an opportunity to move into the major leagues. Having NFC football provides a golden opportunity to convert people into being regular viewers of Fox."" **********Fox does not have separately-traded shares, but Miss Reif said the recent developments at the network have significantly contributed to her ""buy"" recommendation on the parent company shares, News Corp. For the fiscal year ending in June, Fox should account for about 23 percent of News Corp.'s operating profit, Miss Reif added. **********The NBC network is owned by General Electric Co., but many analysts say that its operations represent too small a slice of GE for it to figure heavily on ratings of GE shares. **********Other than Mr. Murdoch, the broadcasting magnate with the highest international profile may be Ted Turner, owner of the Turner Broadcasting System. TBS's acquisitions since 1991 of resources such as the MGM film library and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon library - the last 50 percent of which was acquired in December - are one reason why some analysts expect TBS shares to outperform the market. Another is Turner's international news network, CNN. **********""Turner owns the underlying rights to so much material,"" said Tom Wolzien, who covers the broadcasting sector for Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. ""With the international sales and marketing infrastructure he already has in place, he can start new channels in new markets relatively cheaply."" **********Viacom Inc., which owns high-profile cable networks such as MTV and Nickelodeon, has been warring with QVC Network Inc., a home shopping network, for control of Paramount since September. Viacom's latest offer of an estimated $9.75 billion in cash and stock, made jointly with its new partner Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., was to be considered by Paramount this week. Regional Baby Bell Nynex Corp. is also a cash backer of Viacom in the deal. QVC's standing bid of an estimated $9.9 billion in cash and stock was extended this week until Jan. 21. **********Analysts say the jury will be out for some time on Viacom and QVC shares, pending the outcome of the battle. Many also question whether Paramount is worth close to $10 billion. **********""The hunt is great, but it may be a little better than the realization of the prize,"" said Dennis McAlpine of Josephthal, Lyon & Ross in New York. ""The acquisition of Paramount for either Viacom or QVC will make a huge difference in the way these companies are run, and it's hard to rationalize the price. If you get it, then you have to figure out how to make it work."""

Supporters of the move said the stations' presence could be an important symbolic American commitment to democracy in Eastern Europe. The proposal came amid turmoil over the future of the stations, which the Administration originally planned to dissolve. **********The move was enthusiastically endorsed by six of the seven members of the stations' board, all of them appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. It was opposed by Mr. Mica, the only Clinton appointee, who is the chairman. **********The executive director of the supervisory board, John McBride, said the body had accepted Mr. Marsh's resignation, effective immediately.

What do we do for people to forget? I think that we can only start by teaching children that we are one people."" **********In several interviews over three days, Mr. Twagiramungu spoke not only of the challenges facing Rwanda, but of his personal travails and his hopes for his country. **********""I was the first on the list to be killed,"" Mr. Twagiramungu said. **********That he was not among the first to die was pure chance. Killers Went to Wrong Address **********""I was saved because these killers mistook my address. They believed that I was living in some other area of Kigali,"" Mr. Twagiramungu said. ""So the delay in arriving at my house was what saved me. **********""When they reached my house they destroyed it. They shot the ceiling.

""All the gentlemen that were with me and started the other political parties were killed. Any person related to me was killed. **********""There may be one or two of my kin here or there, but as far as I know they were all killed except for my immediate family."" **********Before the killings started, Mr. Twagiramungu, a Western-educated economist, was one of Rwanda's leading businessmen, a member of the majority Hutu ethnic group and the leader of the Democratic Forces for Change, the main opposition to the government of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1973. Rocket Attack on Plane **********After Mr. Habyarimana and the president of neighboring Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, were killed in a rocket attack on their airplane on April 6, the mass killings began. **********Mr. Twagiramungu said he was convinced that the massacres were planned and death lists drawn up as long ago as a year by Hutu extremists within the Habyarimana government, a view shared by some diplomats and United Nations officials. **********So far, troops and militiamen have been blamed for up to 500,000 killings. **********It was Mr. Twagiramungu's moderate political views and outspokenness in support of a Government that included members of the minority Tutsi and the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front that put him in danger. **********""I am not a violent person,"" said the 59-year-old Mr. Twagiramungu, who as a student at McGill University in Montreal in the 1960's helped organize protests against the Vietnam War and the apartheid system in South Africa. ""But I was the first person to have stood up and challenged Habyarimana in public. I was the first person to say, 'This man is a dictator and we must fight against him.' "" **********""People thought that I was foolish,"" he said.

No Help From U.S. Embassy **********Mr. Twagiramungu said that when his protector called a consulate officer at the United States Embassy to ask for help, he got this response: ""Tell that Hutu to get out of your house. You are going to be killed if they find him in your house. So it is better that you tell him to get out."" **********The French were even more curt, Mr. Twagiramungu recalled. **********""I said, 'Could you ask the United Nations peacekeepers to send soldiers?' "" he said. ""So, the United Nations sent an armored personnel carrier with 10 Bangladesh troops to pick me up."" **********The United Nations peacekeepers gave Mr. Twagiramungu haven for two weeks until they smuggled him out to Nairobi, where at the orders of President Daniel arap Moi's government, he was held incommunicado at a tourist hotel in Nairobi. **********From Zaire, the Rwandan Patriotic Front arranged for the Prime Minister's family to go to Brussels. **********Mr. Twagiramungu returned from exile on July 14, the day the victorious Patriotic Front leaders declared him prime minister. He now leads a country that was one of the world's poorest, even before the war, and he fear that many of his countryman have abandoned Rwanda and its problems forever. **********""We can solve problems by changing the minds of people, not by killing,"" the Prime Minister said.

General Motors would not discuss how much money would be involved. **********The venture represents a new approach in General Motors' on-again, off-again pursuit of an electric vehicle. Most of its efforts in electric vehicles, including its two-seater Impact model, have used lead-acid batteries. But nickel metal hydride stores more than twice as much energy a pound and can deliver it faster. For that reason, the technology has recently entered the market in batteries for laptop computers and cellular telephones. **********Stanford R.

The cars will be lent to consumers for two weeks at a time, with cooperating utilities installing charging equipment in the consumers' garages or driveways.  Data on Cars' Everyday Use **********The program is supposed to begin in Los Angeles and will come to New York later. General Motors says the purpose is to gather data on how the cars perform in everyday use and how consumers react. The company's position is that the current state of technology, particularly in batteries, does not allow a practical electric vehicle. **********In its announcement yesterday, General Motors said that it was ""encouraged"" by progress in the battery. **********The company also said that Robert C.

In 1977 Mr. Haft backed the idea his son, Robert, had outlined in his thesis at Harvard Business School, and created Crown Books, a bookstore chain. **********When Mrs. Haft sided with Robert Haft as the dispute unfolded, Herbert Haft also ousted her from the board of Dart Group, one of the family's public companies, based in Landover, Md. **********In August, Mrs. Haft asked for a legal separation from her husband, charging him with infidelity, physical abuse and activity designed to lessen her control of the family holdings. Robert Haft and his sister, Linda, sided with their mother. **********Mr. Klein called the settlement ""the beginning of a period of peace, after a year and a month of a lot of turmoil."" He said, ""Hopefully, this peace will be productive professionally and personally."" **********Aside from Dart Group, the family had several privately held companies, including Combined Properties Limited Partnership, Combined Properties Inc. and Capital Resources Limited Parntership."

Harris, a senior deputy comptroller of the currency. **********Derivatives are potentially volatile securities or contracts based on the value of Treasury bonds, stocks or other assets. They have become controversial because some mutual funds and industrial companies have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on derivatives that plunged in value as interest rates rose. **********Examiners will be given different procedures to follow depending on whether a bank is a dealer in derivatives, a large-scale buyer of derivatives or a limited buyer of derivatives, Mr. Harris said in a recent interview. **********The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates 3,300 Federally chartered banks and is part of the Treasury Department, also plans to step up its training of examiners in learning to assess the value and riskiness of the complicated financial instruments, he added. **********The plan for more detailed examinations follows the consensus among Federal regulators that the best way to respond to the expanding role of derivatives in the nation's financial system is not to ban the most volatile derivatives. Deputy Treasury Secretary Frank N. Newman described the consensus at a briefing today, saying that regulators are overseeing instead the processes by which financial institutions determine when they face large risks, so as to avoid surprises. **********Mr. Newman reviewed changes that were made in many areas of financial regulation this year and the theories behind the changes, but he did not discuss the plans for new bank examination guidelines. Previously, Administration officials have said that regulators have adequate authority under existing laws to control derivatives markets and do not need Congress to pass any broad new legislation. **********The Treasury Department's moves coincided with the release of a Federal Reserve report on banks that have provided investment advice to money market funds and have been forced to spend large sums bailing out the funds following large losses on derivatives. The report to the House Banking Committee found seven banks had spent a total of $129.8 million on such bailouts in recent months. **********But the report concluded that, ""there is not an inordinate financial risk associated with mutual fund activities of banking organizations and that none of the specific transactions we reviewed was unsafe or unsound."""

No further details were released. **********Balsam owes 50 German and foreign banks about $900 million, according to the prosecutors. In addition, Balsam's woes have put a severe financial strain on one of Germany's largest factoring companies, Procedo Gesellschaft fur Exportfactoring in Wiesbaden. Largely because of Balsam, its largest client, Procedo owes its creditor banks some $1 billion. **********Balsam is one of the world's largest manufacturers of artificial surfaces for tennis courts, running tracks and artificial-grass playing fields. The company, based in Steinhagen near Bielefeld, has annual sales of $277 million and employs 1,500 people worldwide. **********Balsam's four-man management board was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of committing fraud, tax evasion and forgery by using falsified data to obtain loans and using the money to speculate in foreign currency options. Friedel Balsam, the company's chief executive and biggest shareholder, was among those arrested. **********Jost Schmiedeskamp, chief prosecutor in Bielefeld, said earlier that the arrests were made and Balsam's headquarters searched on the basis of a statement made by the company's chief financial officer, Klaus-Detlev Schlienkamp. **********In the statement, Mr. Schlienkamp said that the company had falsified data about its foreign orders to obtain huge loans, which it used to speculate in financial markets and cover up operating losses at Balsam. The company has been losing money since the early 1980's and has been under investigation since 1992, the chief prosecutor said. **********Balsam dismissed Mr. Schlienkamp on Wednesday. The other board members -- Mr. Balsam, Dietmar Ortlieb and Horst-Bert Schultes -- deny any wrongdoing, prosecutors said. They could not be reached for comment. **********The scandal followed the bankruptcy in April of Jurgen Schneider A.G., Germany's largest real estate development group, after its owner, Jurgen Schneider, absconded with millions of dollars, leaving the company with $3 billion of bank debt. Mr. Schneider is being sought by German police. **********Metallgesellschaft A.G., a Frankfurt-based metals and engineering conglomerate that was 14th-largest company in Germany, narrowly avoided bankruptcy in January after its oil-trading operations lost $1.33 billion on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Blow to Deutsche Bank **********Although the fraud allegations surrounding Balsam are unrelated to the misfortunes of the other two companies, all three were blows to Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's largest commercial bank. It was financially involved in the Schneider and Metallgesellschaft affairs and holds a 15 percent stake in Balsam. **********Employees at Balsam's Bielefeld operations were stunned by today's bankruptcy filing. ""The decision was a complete surprise,"" Marianne Grabolle, the chairwoman of the workers' council at Balsam told Germany's DPA news agency. ""We all hope the new regime will continue with business as soon as possible."" **********A senior executive at a large German bank in Frankfurt who requested anonymity said the scandal had upset the entire banking community."

Citizens, based in Stamford, Conn., currently offers telecommunications services in all but two of those states, Nevada and New Mexico. Each access line connects a home or a business to a telecommunications provider. **********Citizens will also take over cable television systems serving 7,000 subscribers. **********Under the agreement, Citizens will pay an undisclosed amount of cash, assume $32 million of debt related to the acquired properties, and transfer 3,600 of its telephone access lines in Pennsylvania to Alltel. Those properties are contiguous to Alltel's existing Pennsylvania telephone service areas. **********Alltel, a Little Rock, Ark., telecommunications and information services company, will use the cash proceeds from the deal to reduce debt. **********On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, class A shares of Citizens fell 12.5 cents, to $13.125, while Alltel shares gained 37.5 cents, to $28.75. **********The transaction is the latest example of telecommunications companies leaving markets in which they have a small presence and face higher costs than competitors. **********""Companies like Citizens are taking advantage of the consolidation that is going on"" in the telecommunications industry, said Theodore Moreau, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. Smaller markets, he said, requires more management effort ""but companies like Citizens can run the business very efficiently, and often at lower rates."" **********The transaction, coupled with an exchange of telephone access lines with the GTE Corporation last year, will leave Alltel with 1.5 million access lines in 14 states. **********For Citizens, the acquisition is the second for its fast-growing telecommunications unit.

The other half comes from natural gas, electric, water and wastewater treatment services to customers in 17 states, from Vermont to Hawaii. The services are provided in small but growing suburban and rural areas. **********The company's diversification of products and its far-flung areas of operation, Brigid Smith, a Citizens spokeswoman, said, has enabled it ""to avoid the regulatory ups and downs of the various businesses and the economic ups and downs in different regions."""

The stock, which closed yesterday at 38 3/8, unchanged, was among the top-performing issues on the American Stock Exchange last year. Even with that growth, several Wall Street professionals remain bullish on the prospects of the business and the stock. **********The company's stable includes 30 radio and 8 television stations, mostly in the South. Revenues are derived from the sale of advertising time and Clear Channel has made it a point of building strong relationships with local advertisers. For instance, from 1989 to 1992 the company's net broadcast radio revenue increased at a compound annual rate of 9.7 percent, while the industry as a whole was growing at just a 1.6 percent rate, according to a recent Lehman Brothers research report. **********Changes in programming have been another element of the company's strategy with shifts to country, soft rock or all news to fit demand. **********On the television side of its operations, the picture looks even brighter. Of its eight television stations, seven are Fox affiliates, which next fall will be broadcasting National Football League games and makes Clear Channel ""a relatively pure play on that network,"" said Michael Kupinski, an analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. **********Some analysts give a high grade to the company's financial management, citing performance-based compensation for station managers and a conservative policy of pricing acquisitions. Management kept corporate expenses to a 3.4 percent increase last year. **********""Clear Channel's management is one of its greatest assets, enabling the company to continually deliver strong financial results,"" said Harry J. DeMott 3d, an analyst with CS First Boston. **********Because the Federal Communications Commission sets ownership limits for broadcasting companies, investors need to consider Clear Channel's future prospects within the scope of current regulations. The F.C.C. has been relaxing rules, permitting broadcasters to own as many as four radio stations (two AM, two FM) in a market. **********These so-called duopolies provide companies with operating leverage, since the market is familiar to Clear Channel, and cost efficiencies spread expenses over a larger operating base. **********When it completes the acquisition of Metroplex Communications Inc., a Cleveland-based radio broadcaster with seven stations in four markets, Clear Channel will have six duopolies. **********Clear Channel is trying to avoid the F.C.C.'s ownership limit of 18 FM and 18 AM stations by tucking 11 stations (6 AM, 5 FM) into an affiliated company, Snowden Broadcasting, in which it has an 80 percent financial interest but no voting power. The remaining 20 percent position is owned by Jim Snowden, a minority broadcaster. The 18-station limit will be increased to 20 in September. **********But Clear Channel still consolidates the revenues and cash flows from these 11 stations into its financial statements. Analysts are watching to see whether the F.C.C. approves the Snowden maneuver to underscore its expressed policy of promoting minority ownership or vetoes it as a veiled attempt to circumvent ownership limits. **********Some professional investors are betting the F.C.C. will approve the deal, citing precedents for broadcasters using nonvoting interests in affiliated companies to avert ownership restrictions. **********Edmund H. Nicklin Jr., president of the Evergreen Value Timing Fund, bought Clear Channel in 1986 and says he is still happy, noting that the stock's value has increased about tenfold. **********But although he still sees more upside for the stock, he's a realist. ""Clear Channel is not small anymore and has diversified into television, and the larger you get the more difficult it is to maintain a strong rate of growth,"" he said."

""If there is going to be a free market for agricultural products, then why not have a free market for industrial products as well?"" **********The announcement comes less than a month after the Government opened up markets around the country for the sale of fruits, vegetables and other farm products at prices determined by supply and demand. **********Government officials said that the move met with some resistance within the Communist Party, in part because it represented a reversal of Mr. Castro's decision in 1986 to end a six-year experiment in so-called free farmers' markets. At that time, party officials were especially critical of the fact that some farmers and middlemen were becoming relatively wealthy, threatening the ideal of a society in which all citizens were supposed to be more or less equal in their standards of living. **********Yet in the face of food shortages that have grown severe since the Cuban economy was plunged into crisis five years ago by the collapse of its Soviet-bloc trading partnerships, the rules governing the new agricultural markets are in fact more liberal than those of the 1980's. **********A deputy agriculture minister, Eduardo M. Chao Trujillo, said on Tuesday that 80 percent of the food being distributed in the Havana area continued to move through state stores in which products are rationed. But he described the new markets as a success, saying that prices had been stable, taxes paid to the state had been significant, and more farmers were abandoning the once-thriving black market. **********""We have begun to stimulate producers to increase their output,"" he said. And predicting greater results ahead, he added: ""We have not even begun to crawl yet."" **********For the Cubans who make handicrafts like toys and furniture, the new markets will represent another outlet alongside street fairs that have been authorized for months now in Havana and other cities. **********But the change is potentially more important for the trade in surplus products and raw materials from semi-autonomous state companies, smaller manufacturing plants and production centers controlled by the state. In those cases, anything from stockpiled appliances to old plywood might be sold, making it easier for some tradesmen and manufacturers to get around tightly enforced laws."

Employing the Lessons of War to Make Better Clothes"," **********THE guidance technology once used by American jet fighters to recognize Iraqi military targets has been adapted to check the pattern accuracy of printed textiles. **********And powerful laser technology used to separate uranium isotopes in secret government laboratories is being converted to perform high-speed cutting of intricate pieces of fabric for the clothing industry. **********The two exotic technologies are not just flashy demonstrations of a distant future for apparel makers, but part of a massive effort to save billions of dollars by streamlining one of the world's least efficient industries. **********Little has changed in the garment business, according to experts, since the introduction of the electric sewing machine. And virtually nothing has improved since 1985 when a study of the industry found that 83 percent of the time used to transform raw fiber into a completed retail garment sale is wasted sitting in inventory. **********The study by Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting firm based in Atlanta, showed that the industry requires 66 weeks to produce and sell a garment, but 55 weeks of that is wasted in storage and inventory along the apparel pipeline. The idle time costs the industry an estimated $25 billion annually. **********Put another way, raw fiber like cotton or polyester, which costs about 72 cents a pound, sells at retail for about $40 a pound after its trip through the textile-apparel manufacturing process. **********""In the typical garment, only 10 percent of the cost is in value-added labor. There's almost three times as much cost -- about 27 percent -- wasted in non-value-added handling,"" according to Joseph W. A. Off, managing director of the Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation. **********""Individual sectors of the industry -- the fiber producers, textile makers, retailers -- have made significant strides in becoming more efficient, but the pipeline, as a whole, still is inefficient,"" said Richard K. Quisenberry, executive director of the American Textile Partnership. **********The Technology/Clothing Technology Corporation and the American Textile Partnership are two of several groups working to remove the kinks from the apparel pipeline. American Textile estimates that it can use new or existing technologies to shave at least 28 weeks and $12 billion in waste out of the apparel manufacturing process. **********To that end, American Textile has enlisted the aid of the Department of Energy's 11 national laboratories. The laboratories, working on textile industry projects for about two years, have modified exotic weapons technology for use in the textile and apparel industries. **********""With the changing role of the national laboratories and the decline of the need for nuclear weapons research, we have been looking at redeployment or redirection of this tremendous resource for the benefit of the economy and U.S. competitiveness,"" said Douglas K. Lemon, American Textile's laboratory program manager at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland, Wash. **********In September, American Textile demonstrated the initial fruits of its partnership during the industry's annual trade show, the Bobbin Show, in Atlanta. The first of the technologies, the Computer-Aided Fabric Evaluation Project, is set to be tested in a textile plant next November, according to Glenn Allgood, the project's program manager at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. **********The fabric evaluation project grew out of a longstanding quality control problem faced by textile makers. The process has been almost exclusively a manual task performed by hundreds of relatively low-paid workers who inspect fabric. **********""It involves a huge number of people sitting at inspection tables doing their very, very best in a dreary job that we would love to have automated,"" said Tom Malone, president and chief operating officer of Milliken & Company, a major textile producer based in Spartanburg, S.C. **********""Statistically, the best you can expect is that they will catch 70 to 80 percent of the defects. Many of the defects make it all the way through the apparel manufacturing process into a finished garment that the consumer ends up returning,"" Mr. Malone said. **********But the process has been automated using the same computer pattern-recognition technology employed by American military pilots to pick out target terrain patterns and to distinguish military installations from other structures. **********At the Bobbin Show, American Textile officials organized a demonstration in which computers were able to pick out alignment errors on printed fabrics passing by a camera at a speed of 30 yards a minute. So far, the technology has demonstrated 98 percent accuracy, according to American Textile officials, and they predict the machine can work at speeds of 100 yards a minute. The industry has yet to determine how many workers would be displaced by such technology. **********A second demonstration showed that the Electronic Embedded Fingerprints system, which was developed to tag nuclear missiles subject to control under international treaties, could be adapted to tag a garment with the history of its journey through the manufacturing pipeline. **********Finished garments spinning by a scanner were matched with their electronic fingerprints, and a computer displayed every statistic about the individual garment -- from color, size, price and style numbers, down to manufacturer's suggested care instructions. Copper wires are imbedded into the fabric as it is woven and then encoded with the garment's history, from raw fiber to finished product. In case of a defect in the garment, this allows manufacturers and retailers to track the problem to its source. **********The most ambitious project, the Demand-Activated Manufacturing Architecture Project, attempts to use battlefield planning and simulation software to create a model of the entire textile/apparel manufacturing pipeline. The goal, American Textile officials say, is to remove inefficiencies that slow the manufacturing process and simplify the business relationships involved in the estimated 15.5 billion transactions that occur annually in the industry. **********The American Textile projects are funded, in part, by individual companies in the textile and garment industry, but the technology developed by the government-owned national laboratories will be broadly licensed throughout the industry. **********Mr. Malone said Milliken is not disturbed that the results of projects funded in part by the company will be shared with Milliken's competitors. ""The fundamental belief -- and I don't know of any other industry that has embraced this idea as fully -- is that if we are going to excel as companies, our industry has to excel,"" he said. **********Success has come, he said, because teams have focused on process technologies rather than product research and because the chief executives of participating companies, like Burlington Industries of Greensboro, N.C., and E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company of Wilmington, Del., have been involved. **********Mr. Malone said the projects are not simply blue-sky demonstrations. ""Every single one of them is applicable in our company, either for ourselves or our customers, and I don't mean in 10 or 15 years,"" he said. **********Nevertheless, the road to automation still has potholes. At the Bobbin Show, a massive demonstration project designed to produce actual finished, custom-ordered garments in six hours broke down on the first day of the show. By the next afternoon, the project had worked successfully, but industry experts said the experience was typical of the lurching steps that the industry has made in technology. **********""I think some of the tools are there, but it's not a quick-fix problem,"" said Jack S. Pickler, first vice president and textile analyst with Prudential Securities Research. ""The companies I'm familiar with who adopted these technologies have had excruciatingly long start-ups with significant difficulties. It's a little bit like the Denver airport -- a big leap ahead in technology, but a lot of problems."" **********Richard Yardley, director of technical services for the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, said, ""The pieces are there, but it is an achingly slow process to put it all together."" **********Mr. Yardley noted that most of the association's 230 member companies have highly sophisticated manufacturing systems that produce nearly 75 percent of America's clothing. Nevertheless, he said, there are about 10,000 viable clothing makers, most of whom use little automation. **********But even small manufacturers will be forced to adopt new technology. Roger Wilson, vice chairman of a tiny company making ski hats and accessories in Durango, Colo., said his company has installed sophisticated computer-generated apparel printing and cutting capabilities. ""If we can do it in our little shop in the back of a converted bowling alley, anybody can do it. And anybody who wants to survive will do it."""

That is correct, yes."" **********Mr. Perry's comments, which he made on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" reflect the hesitancy and sometimes outright opposition within the Pentagon about using threats of military action to toughen the Administration's diplomacy. **********Pentagon officials said that the Secretary's comments reflected Administration policy and that his intention was to define the limits of what the Administration was willing to do militarily in Bosnia. **********Although the Pentagon has expressed willingness to protect United Nations peacekeepers with air support and took part in the NATO ultimatum that forced the Serbs to remove heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, it has been reluctant to extend the threat of air strikes to protect Muslim enclaves elsewhere. **********""We need to be clear about our capabilities to NATO, to the United Nations and to the American people,"" a Pentagon official said. ""If we stayed vague to not give away our hand, we would create false expectations."" **********But the explicit manner in which Mr. Perry excluded using military power is likely to heighten the debate over the use of force in the post-cold-war world. **********Some former officials said they were surprised by the public renunciation of military action to protect civilians in Gorazde. The concern is that Mr. Perry's comments might be taken by the Serbian forces as a green light to continue their artillery and infantry attacks in eastern Bosnia. **********""My instinct is that the Serbs may not believe we will do anything about it anyway, but I do not see any purpose in confirming it for them,"" said Morton I. Abramowitz, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former head of the State Department's intelligence office. Violence Intensifies **********Serbian forces have stepped up their attacks on Gorazde as part of a broad offensive to seize Muslim territory in eastern Bosnia. Not only could the seizure of the town lead to civilian death; it could also add to the tide of refugees who have been displaced by Serbian ""ethnic cleansing."" **********Concern about Gorazde was fueled by Serbian attacks last week against the northwestern town of Prijedor, which United Nations spokesman have described as a campaign of murder and arson. The United Nations has decided to evacuate thousands of Muslims and Croats from Prijedor to save them from attacks by nationalist Serbs. **********Mr. Perry also said the Administration had rejected, for now, a pre-emptive attack on North Korea's nuclear sites because it might prompt retaliation against South Korea. **********And in a departure from past administrations' statements, Mr. Perry said that if the North Korean Army attacked the 37,000 United States troops in South Korea, he could not envision that Washington would use nuclear weapons to protect them. 'The Wrong Direction' **********Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to President Bush, said such comments undercut diplomatic pressure on North Korea to comply with United Nations demands for inspections of its nuclear sites. **********By publicly ruling out a pre-emptive strike, he argued, Washington left North Korea with the impression that it may back off its demands if North Korea threatens war. **********""Psychologically, it was the wrong direction to go,"" Mr. Scowcroft said. ""As long as they think the worst outcome for us is hostilities, then that is the direction they will try to push us to get us to back down."" **********Mr. Perry's comments were the latest twist in the long and tortured Administration debate about the use of force in Bosnia. **********Mr. Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argued publicly last month that air strikes would not be effective in protecting most enclaves because some Serbian artillery was difficult to locate and some fighting involved attacks at close quarters with small arms. **********But Air Force officers and military specialists outside the Government argue that Washington could still launch reprisal raids by bombing Serbian command centers, ammunition dumps and installations in rear areas, much as it attacked targets deep in Iraq during the Persian Gulf war. The Pentagon's concerns, the critics argued, had more to do with its longstanding fear of being drawn into open-ended conflicts than with strictly military considerations. **********The success of NATO's ultimatum in silencing the artillery around Sarajevo initially led top Administration officials to consider expanding the threat of air strikes to protect other enclaves. But faced with the Pentagon's concerns and objections from Moscow, the Administration has backed away from this idea. **********The United Nations has not deployed peacekeeping troops in Gorazde, but it does have observers there who have monitored the bloody attacks. According to reports from Bosnia, 47 people have been killed in the six-day Serbian offensive. **********""We made Sarajevo real nice, but the rest of the place is going to pot,"" said one Western official."

But is the cost of convenience too high?.A recent report published by the Dutch consumers association, Consumenten...",6835,,International Herald Tribune,Your Money,,article,"Cards are Convenient, but Hidden Charges Can Hit Users : The Pitfalls of Paying with Plastic","Cards are Convenient, but Hidden Charges Can Hit Users : The Pitfalls of Paying with Plastic"," **********PLASTIC, in the form of credit, debit and charge cards, is a relatively safe and handy means of accessing and spending money abroad. But is the cost of convenience too high? **********A recent report published by the Dutch consumers association, ConsumentenHL bond, notes that it is not always easy to work out card charges and commissions on payments and cash withdrawals because of ""a lack of transparency in the field of cross-border payment systems."" **********Pieter Walraven, author of the report, commented: ""A priori information given to consumers applying for a card, about the various commissions and rates, is too often incomplete and incorrect. Although the European Commission has stressed the need for greater cost transparency, the issuing banks seem unwilling to rectify the situation."" **********The British consumer's association is also critical of the vague and imprecise nature of card charges. A spokesman for the association commented: ""The cardholder cannot be sure of the final charge until the statement arrives, and even then he is not given full details of how that charge is calculated - just the amount in foreign currency and the amount owed in sterling."" **********There are certain charges attached to the use of payment cards abroad that do not occur in the case of domestic use. For example, card issuers fix conversion rates for payments and cash withdrawals made abroad. A payment from the consumer to the card issuer is included in the exchange rate - a form of hidden commission fee, calculated as a percentage. This hidden commission can be as high as 4 percent, although 1.5 to 2.0 percent is fairly standard amongst European issuers. **********On top of the exchange-rate load, a stated commission is charged for using cash dispensers and withdrawing cash at the counter. The amount varies depending on the card, the issuer and the country of issue. The commission can be expressed as a percentage or a fixed sum. If it is the latter, as is often the case in France and the U.S., withdrawals of small amounts can turn out to be relatively expensive. **********Some issuers apply a combined commission fee, charging a commission in terms of a percentage and a minimum charge expressed as a fixed sum. Barclaycard U.K., which is linked to both Visa and Mastercard, charges customers 1.5 percent of the transaction amount, with a minimum charge of £1.50 ($2.25). **********""Where issuers apply combined commission fees, card users are in a no-win situation,"" said Mr. Walraven. ""It is both expensive to withdraw small sums because of the fixed sum commission, and expensive to withdraw large sums as a percentage fee will then apply."" **********Unlike the travel and entertainment cards issued by American Express and Diners Club, Visa and Mastercard issuers do not generally charge a commission on card payments apart from the load in the exchange rate. However, there may be other indirect charges attached to making payments with plastic that consumers are not always aware of. **********Retail outlets or card acceptors have to pay a commission to the card issuer every time a card is used to pay for goods or services. In the industry, this commission is known as the merchant discount rate. Mr. Walraven notes that this cut in profit margins often encourages retail outlets to either refuse a card or increase the price of goods purchased with a card. **********In a number of countries, notably Switzerland and Italy, cards are not accepted as a means of paying for articles sold at a reduced price,"" he said. ""In Germany, petrol is often subject to a price increase of 50 pfennig (31 cents) when paid for with a Diners' Club card, and in the Netherlands, special offers for footwear and clothing can be subject to an increase of 5 percent where plastic is the payment mechanism."" **********Credit card users should also be aware of the high cost of borrowing money on cards. It used to be that card issuers would only start charging interest on transactions from the statement date. Nowadays, it is quite common for issuers to charge interest from the date payments are debited to the account. **********An alternative is trading your credit card for a debit card in order to avoid interest payments completely. Visa's Electron card and Mastercard's EDC/ Maestro operate as debit cards, but according to Richard Martin, editor of Cards International, a Dublin-based trade magazine, ""debit cards are generally not as widely accepted abroad as credit and charge cards."" **********Plastic may not be the cheapest cross- border payment mechanism around, but it is thought to be safer than cash and generally a better value than travelers checks. **********""Credit card companies deal in vast sums of foreign currency so they are able to barter for very attractive exchange rates on the wholesale markets,"" said Liz Phillips, director of the Credit Card Research Group in London. ""Although charges are subsequently incorporated into the exchange rate and commissions are levied for cash withdrawals, payment cards still tend to work out to be less expensive than travelers checks."" **********As well as paying a commission of around 1 percent on the amount of travelers checks purchased, customers sometimes have to pay a cashing fee of up to additional 2 percent. Some banks in Portugal, for example, charge a flat fee equivalent to about $12 per transaction. **********Vacationers are generally advised to avoid relying on just one cross-border payment method. Travelers checks are not always easy to replace once lost or stolen, despite fervent advertising campaigns that promise reliability, and credit cards have a nasty habit of being swallowed by cash dispensers when you least expect it. **********If you are taking plastic abroad, verify that payment cards are widely used in the destination country. Levels of acceptance vary significantly between countries. There is a high degree of card acceptance in France, Belgium, Spain and Britain, for example, where even small sums can be paid for with bank cards. In Denmark and Germany, however, the level of acceptance is much less prevalent. **********Outside Europe, Asia is thought to be the fastest-growing region in terms of cards issued. Cash dispensers and card- accepting merchants are plentiful in Japan, and acceptance locations continue to increase in Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and of course, Hong Kong. **********Card markets are also developing in Eastern Europe. A spokesman for Visa U.K. said that the number of card acceptance locations and banking offices are spreading quickly throughout Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics. Visa has made significant inroads in Estonia and Uzbekistan, while Eurocard/Mastercard holders can use their cards to access cash in Moscow, due to an agreement between Europay International, Credit-Moscow Bank, Moscow Savings Bank and Most Bank."

China's Main Complaints **********After the United States proposed a resolution warning North Korea to comply or face possible sanctions, China, which has the power to veto Council measures, objected. **********A senior Clinton Administration official said that the Chinese have two main complaints. One is that they object to the language in the resolution drafted by the United States saying that the Council will consider further action if North Korea does not relent on the issue of inspections. That is an indirect reference to economic sanctions. **********The second objection centers on the need for a Security Council resolution. China prefers a weaker measure: a statement issued by the Council President urging North Korea to allow the inspections. **********Although Chinese diplomats did not specifically threaten to veto a resolution in tonight's deliberations, the strength of their objection left the fate of the measure unclear. ""They made it clear they cannot accept a resolution,"" an Administration official said. ""They do not specifically say what they are going to do."" U.S. Surprised by Response **********The vigor of China's response this evening caught the Clinton Administration and its allies by surprise. Earlier today, American and French diplomats said that their plan was to seek a Council vote on Thursday. Beijing, they said, would abstain when the measure was put to a vote. **********""I think it's highly unlikely the Chinese would veto a resolution of the kind that we are working on right now,"" Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo of South Korea told reporters this morning after meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. ""At a minimum I think they will abstain,"" he added. **********United States officials noted the original draft of the resolution had been modified to make it less objectionable to Beijing. **********The original draft of the resolution asked Hans Blix, the Director General of the atomic energy agency, to report to the Council within one month of the adoption of the resolution. This would set the stage for consideration of economic sanctions if the North Koreans failed to comply with the inspections. **********But after the Chinese complained that the measure could be interpreted as an ultimatum, United States diplomats rewrote the measure. No Specific Deadline Set **********As rewritten, the measure does not set a specific deadline for Mr. Blix to report to the Council on North Korea's compliance with international controls on its nuclear program. Rather, it asks the agency head to address the question of North Korea's compliance during his next scheduled report to the Council. That report is to be made after the agency's next regular inspection of North Korean sites, which is planned for early May. Administration officials say the change in language is more a matter of tone than of substance. **********A senior Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said earlier today that while Washington strongly favors a resolution, it may accept a statement, which would have the virtue of being unanimous, if China agrees to toughen the language in the measure. But China is unlikely to agree to a statement that makes an allusion to sanctions. **********The Administration has informed the North Korean mission in New York that it is still willing to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang and to suspend its military exercises with South Korea if the North will meet two conditions: allow the inspections to proceed and exchange envoys with South Korea."

Moreover, while the few students who came to England during the Communist years tended to be the sons and daughters of government officials, today's are the offspring of successful entrepreneurs. **********John Towey, head of ISIS's international branch, said he is aware of about 40 such students who matriculated to U.K. schools last month, adding that there are bound to be more. But why bother sending children to a school so far away? **********""It is a mixture of things,"" said Brian Underwood, headmaster of Sussex-based Newlands Manor, whose tuition is a hefty £10,185 ($16,250) a year, and which currently has more than 10 students from the East. ""Safety, security, health, and of course the English language and the British public-school system's reputation for a rigorous intellectual education. **********Mr. Underwood added: ""I have one boy whose parents own what is probably Moscow's best restaurant. He cannot go out for fear of being kidnapped. Others are sent here to get away from the pollution in places like Kiev in the Ukraine, which is close to Chernobyl."" **********According to Mr. Towey, the first Eastern Europeans started turning up in his London office two years ago. Initially, he said,they came in person while on business trips. More recently, they have tended to inquire by fax or phone. **********To meet growing demand, a number of agencies have started up, which, for a fee, will research and recommend U.K. schools for foreign parents looking to place their children. Mr. Towey said he is reluctant to endorse any of these, however, as some do not cover a comprehensive range of schools. **********Citizens of the former Soviet Union seem more able to afford British school fees than those from the rest of Eastern Europe. Indeed, say experts, there are few fee-paying students from countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic attending school in England. There are, however, a number of sixth-form students, or those about 16 to 18 years of age, who have been granted free places. **********The Headmasters' Conference East European Initiative, a privately-funded program aimed at bringing Eastern European students to British schools, has given 76 full scholarship places to pupils this year, having given 55 in the 1992/1993 school year, the first in which it operated. The program grants places to teenagers of outstanding academic ability and unspecified personal qualities. **********Robin Schlich, the European liaison officer at the £12,210-a-year Uppingham School in Leicestershire, which has a number of scholarship pupils, says that the ""personal qualities"" may include all sorts of things. Uppingham, for example, has a ""wonderful violinist from Prague,"" he said. **********""Some of them are obviously outstanding sportsmen, and many of them do all sorts of things like editing student newspapers,"" said Mr. Schlich. ""I think we are really looking for the sort of people who are going to be the leaders of the next generation,"" he added. **********Other British schools often considered by Eastern European parents, say observers, include Holmewood House, a prep school based in Tonbridge Wells, Kent, and Taunton School, in Somerset. In Britain, so-called ""prep"" schools are for 7- to 13-year-olds, while ""public"" schools are for 13- to 18-year-olds. **********While the fees of such schools are evidently within the means of some East European and Russian parents, there are many more, of course, who wish to send their children to Britain but simply can't afford it. Roger Wicks, headmaster of Kent College, a public school in Canterbury whose tuition is £9,627 a year, said he had two students from Lithuania enrolled for this year's fall term. But he received short notes from each set of parents - one the day before the term started and one the day after - saying that the students would not be attending. **********No reason was given, but he said he suspected that tuition costs were the problem. **********There have also been unsurprising hitches with a few children. ""There have been problems with a few Russian children who have turned up unable to cope linguistically or emotionally, in that it is simply a huge culture shock,"" said Mr. Schlich. **********But the benefits of having students from Eastern Europe in Western schools are many, according to those who teach them. Indeed, many teachers enthuse about the benefits to teenagers of meeting others from different cultures and say that such exchanges should draw Western and Eastern Europe closer in the future. **********And as more parents living in the East reach higher levels of affluence, some add, more of their children are likely to attend schools in the West."

Or is it a nifty way to gag a troublemaker who knows too much about the way things work? **********A former senior trader on the bond trading desk in Merrill Lynch & Company's Dallas office says he wound up on the street because management didn't want to hear his tales of malfeasance in the trading room. In the end, he claims, his boss told him if he spilled the beans to company lawyers he risked being blacklisted on Wall Street. **********Merrill says it listened to the trader's allegations, acted on some of them, and laid him off as part of an unrelated corporate slimdown. The former employee's decision to speak publicly about the case before appearing at an arbitration proceeding was inappropriate, said Jim Wiggins, a Merrill spokesman. ""We're not going to get involved in a point-by-point response to his allegations in the press even though we know that there can be a cost to Merrill Lynch in not doing so in this post-O. J. Simpson era where an individual's legal and public relations strategy are one and the same,"" Mr. Wiggins said. **********A panel of arbitrators for the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. will get to decide whether the claims of Raymond C. Quinn, a bond trader now at Barre & Company in Dallas, are true. Mr. Quinn, who was dismissed on Dec. 20, gave his boss a litany of alleged securities violations in the Dallas office during a meeting on Oct. 20. This was the second time he met with a manager to reveal alleged improprieties. **********Among his allegations: that traders were raising the prices of bonds more than five percent before selling them to individual investors -- an excessive hidden commission that violates guidelines of the National Association of Securities Dealers. And that Merrill had held bonds in its own account in order to conceal the fact that an institutional client actually owned the bonds -- a violation of securities laws, if true. **********The management response, according to an arbitration complaint filed by Mr. Quinn on Aug. 5: The boss said that if Mr. Quinn spoke to Merrill's New York attorneys, he ""would never work on the Street again."" And that ""if he did go to the attorneys, he could be sending his deskmates to jail,"" according to the complaint. **********A Merrill spokesman noted that Merrill is a firm that encourages whistle-blowing, even having set up a confidential 800-number for employees to call if they spot dishonest business practices. **********Most companies spout some official line that they will grit their teeth and listen to the grumblings -- petty and serious -- of employees. In the securities industry, though, where investors rely on the lofty promise of ""self-regulation,"" it is particularly important that whistle-blowers have access to managers who are willing to investigate and even change policy in a way that can hurt the bottom line. **********But does self-regulation work? Mr. Quinn said in an interview last week that his managers had given him every signal imaginable that airing Merrill's dirty laundry was a mistake. From then on, the complaint said, ""Quinn became a marked man."" **********Although his trading revenues in 1992 exceeded those of 1991, Merrill cut his bonus for 1992 -- as it happens, just two months after he first went to management with concerns about excessive markups on bonds. By April 6, 1993, Mr. Quinn received a memo from a Merrill boss telling him that he was not a good team player. Mr. Quinn says he was the major producer of revenues in the municipal bond group in Dallas but that claim could not be confirmed because Merrill would not comment on the specifics of the case. **********The complaint says that Mr. Quinn spotted other problems last spring and summer, which he brought to a bosses' attention at the ill-fated ""never work on the street again"" meeting in October. According to the complaint, Joseph A. Moglia, managing director of Merrill's municipal division, ""suggested that Quinn not pursue the matter any further"" when Mr. Quinn passed on information about possible arm-twisting of Merrill employees to make contributions to local politicians. Other alleged violations relayed to Mr. Moglia included: **********That a Merrill colleague had bought bonds from a retail customer five points below the going market price on Wall Street -- a practice known as ""picking off"" a customer. **********That another colleague was keeping a separate set of books with a St. Louis brokerage firm to hide payments to that firm for bringing business to Merrill. **********And that a third colleague may have set aside bonds for himself, wishing to see if they rose in price so that he could make a profit by buying them later at Merrill's cost. **********When all was said and done, according to the complaint, Mr. Moglia told Mr. Quinn that he did not plan to tell management in New York about the allegations. **********In Merrill's view, Mr. Quinn was making a big fuss about little things. These were the kind of minor violations that ""happen 25 times a day up and down the street,"" Mr. Quinn recalls hearing his boss say. And that's about what you would expect on those days that self-regulation is on the blink."

The 142 Woolco stores had sales of $1.5 billion (Canadian) or $1.14 billion (United States), in 1993. **********Although the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Woolworth said it expected to receive about $300 million (United States) in cash from the sale and plans to take a charge of $45 million to cover currency-exchange losses. Retail Stocks Decline **********The stocks of several Canadian retailers declined yesterday after the deal was announced. Shares of the Hudson's Bay Company fell $4.875 (Canadian), to $35, in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Sears Canada closed at $8.75 (Canadian), off 75 cents. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading, Wal-Mart shares rose 12.5 cents, to $25.625. Woolworth stock also closed at $25.625, up 50 cents. **********Woolworth, based in New York, will maintain 1,400 specialty outlets in Canada, including chains like Northern Reflections and Footlocker. Most Woolco Canada outlets were spared in a restructuring plan announced in October that aimed at closing 970 stores, including half of Woolworth's variety stores in the United States. **********Even so, analysts said rumors had persisted that Woolco would be acquired either by Wal-Mart, the largest American retailer, or the Target chain of the Dayton Hudson Corporation. Corporate Orphan **********Woolco, which operates large discount stores similar to Wal-Mart and Kmart outlets, had become a corporate orphan within Woolworth, which has been transforming itself into a specialty store conglomerate. A sister chain, the 326-store Woolco discount department store group in the United States, was closed in 1983. **********In buying an established chain with stores, most of which contain 100,000 square feet or more of floor space, Wal-Mart will avoid a time-consuming hurdle other American retailers face in entering the Canadian market, said Leonard Kubas, a retail marketing consultant in Toronto. ""They come in with the benefit of having locations already selected and favorable leases,"" he said. **********Wal-Mart said it planned to retain all Woolco employees, including R. Bruce West, president and chief operating officer of the Woolco division. The deal does not include 22 Woolco stores that are in downtown locations or were considered too small to acquire, a Wal-Mart spokesman said. Wal-Mart moved into the Mexican market in 1991 in a joint venture with Cifra S.A., Mexico's largest retailer. **********John O. Winter, a retail consultant in Toronto, predicted that Wal-Mart would face several challenges in Canada, including putting its service-oriented stamp on Woolco, repackaging goods in boxes bearing French and English wording, and maintaining its reputation for low prices in the face of some remaining tariffs. **********""There's no question it will invigorate the market,"" he said. Competitors will either ""pull up their socks or fade into the sunset."" **********Zellers, a Hudson's Bay unit that modeled itself after Wal-Mart, has the most to lose, said Nancy Self, a retail analyst for RBC Dominion Securities Inc. ""They've been attempting to prepare for the inevitable move by Wal-Mart for a couple of years,"" she said."

After the Wall fell, he started selling Trabants, too. **********Unification sent demand for East German car parts to new records as East Germans exercised their right to travel to the West. ""My entire stock was gone within three weeks,"" the elder Mr. Schwitzgöbel said. **********Five years later, while most East Germans have ditched their Trabants for Volkswagens, Porsches and Audis, business at the Schwitzgöbels' Little East-West Store 60 kilometers (37 miles) northwest of Frankfurt continues to boom as West Germans snap up Trabis for their novelty value, cheap price at 850 Deutsche marks to 2,000 Deutsche marks ($568 to $1,335) and ease of repair. **********""The Trabant is the only individual car that you can find these days,"" the elder Mr. Schwitzgöbel said. ""There's something about it."" **********The younger Mr. Schwitzgöbel, who recently assumed responsibility for the family business, faces increasing competition from other vendors, which have sprung up in Eastern and Western Germany, but still manages to sell five to six cars a month, while accessories sales are booming. **********In the third quarter this year, business was up 35 percent from the same period last year, the younger Mr. Schwitzgöbel said. **********Although he has started using a computer to keep track of orders, he said he may need to hire an assistant to keep up with rising demand. **********Most of his overall sales of more than 250,000 DM a year come from the sale of spare parts. **********But besides selling the plastic parts that made the first Trabant famous, the Schwitzgöbels have carved themselves a niche by selling sporty automotive accessories. **********How about a molded mahogany gearshift to put your two-stroke Trabi in motion? The Schwitzgöbels sell it, along with sporty Italian steering wheels covered in brightly colored leather, aluminum hubcaps in a variety of snazzy designs and front and rear spoilers in shiny black plastic. ""We're the only one selling the sporty spoilers,"" Frank Schwitzgöbel said. ""I had them made myself."" **********They have even custom-made Trabant convertibles, pickup trucks and a cement truck. **********""We have fun with the business,"" the elder Mr. Schwitzgöbel said. **********What's more significant, every car they ever tinkered with has passed the rigorous emissions inspection at the local motor vehicle office, according to the elder Mr. Schwitzgöbel. **********A lot of new business involves upgrading older-model Trabants with catalytic converters, new shock absorbers and four-cylinder Volkswagen motors. **********In addition to selling locally, the Schwitzgöbels export Trabants and Wartburgs - and parts - as far away as New Zealand and Argentina. **********The elder Mr. Schwitzgöbel, who has been driving a yellow 1984 Trabant for more than 10 years, recently collaborated on a calendar featuring Trabis, Wartburgs and motorcycles made by MZ, a Saxon company that, unlike the automakers, has resumed production under new management. **********For the future, the Schwitzgöbels see nothing but good news as a wave of nostalgia sweeps the East."

Forcing Croatia to Acknowledge Its 'Invisible' Army in Bosnia,U.N. Forcing Croatia to Acknowledge Its 'Invisible' Army in Bosnia," **********Croatia's ambivalence is showing. **********Publicly, Government officials applaud the Western effort to break the siege of Sarajevo and say they hope it will lead to a peace agreement throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********But privately, the Government is watching developments next door anxiously. One fear is that the withdrawal of Serbian heavy weapons will relieve Muslim defenders, who could then fight the Croats farther west. **********Then there is the fear that Serbian forces, once disengaged from Sarajevo, might renew fighting against Croats to strengthen their hold in the Krajina area, a Serb-held enclave in Croatia. **********And finally, on a deeper level, there is the thought that if the threat of international pressure works against the Serbs, it might be used against the Croats, who have already been told that they risk the same types of sanctions that have decimated Serbia's economy. Troops Must Be Out Thursday **********By Thursday, the United Nations has said, Croatia must withdraw its regular troops from Bosnia, where they support the hard-pressed Bosnian Croats in a local militia called the Croatian Defense Council. **********[ The Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, offered on Saturday to withdraw troops from border areas in Bosnia in exchange for United Nations guarantees for Croatian civilians caught in central Bosnia, but he limited the proposal to areas near Mostar. Previously Croatian officials had insisted that there were no regular army troops in Bosnia, only several thousand local volunteers. ] **********Diplomats say that although Croatian troops have long gone back and forth across the porous border, in recent months President Franjo Tudjman has dispatched thousands of regulars to Bosnia to stall Muslim advances. **********Most troop estimates are close to the official United Nations figure of 3,000 to 5,000. The Bosnian Government puts the figure at 20,000, and says it constitutes an all-out invasion. **********On Feb. 3 the Security Council warned President Tudjman to pull out the troops and their artillery by Feb. 17 or face ""serious measures."" An economic embargo was threatened, though the tone of the debate suggested that such a step would not be imposed right away. Still, the Croatian economy's heavy dependence on trade and rapidly declining tourism makes it more vulnerable. **********At the same time, President Tudjman cannot afford to watch the Bosnian Croats go down in defeat, especially since he has already lost one war: About one-third of Croatia is occupied by Serbian forces as a result of fighting between Serbia and Croatia after the Yugoslav federation broke up in 1991. Signs of Croatian Presence **********One indication of the closeness between the Croatian Army and the Bosnian Croat militia is that the militia's commander, Gen. Ante Roso, is a Croatian Army general. **********Another sign of President Tudjman's pervasive influence next door came on Feb. 10 when Mate Boban, the leader of the Bosnian Croats, was forced to resign as president of the self-styled republic there. Western embassies, and in particular the United States Ambassador, Peter W. Galbraith, had pressed Mr. Tudjman to jettison the hard-line Mr. Boban, whose forces blocked aid convoys and placed Muslim civilians in camps under brutal conditions. **********In Bosnia, the Croatian militia is losing ground to the Bosnian Army, which is able to get weapons despite an arms embargo that applies to all sides. **********The Croats are trying to hold the Bosnian Army back in a roughly north-south line that stretches through Prozor, about 35 miles west of Sarajevo. The largely Muslim army also surrounds the Croats in Vitez, farther north, where the object is to seize an explosives factory that could keep the Bosnian Army's war effort going for years. **********Although Sarajevo has been in the headlines, most recent fighting has been between Croats and Muslims, and the Croats have fared poorly, losing 40 percent of the territory they held last April. The losses have clearly alarmed Croatian officials. **********""The Muslims are numerically bigger,"" Brig. Drago Krpina said in his office in the Ministry of Defense in Zagreb. ""They get thousands of volunteers from all over the world and no one is threatening them and telling them to stop."" Wedge Against the Croats **********""The Serbs control 70 percent of Bosnia,"" he said, ""but instead of fighting together with the Croats to regain their land, the Muslims are fighting the Croats because they view the Croats as weaker."" **********Croatian journalists and others who follow developments in Bosnia say events are leading toward a denouement: the Croats, who initially fought the Serbs alongside the Muslims only to spurn that alliance, will someday be forced to petition the Muslims to enter into some sort of new arrangement. **********""The only hope is a new confederation with the Muslims,"" said one journalist. ""But of course, the Croats threw off the alliance before, so now the Muslims won't trust them."""

Smith and John C. Malone, who tried to forge one of the biggest corporate mergers in history. **********But the proposed $33 billion combination of the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., which had once seemed so right, proved a bad match. **********""This deal isn't going to make it, so let's shoot it,"" Mr. Malone recalls telling Mr. Smith. **********How could two of the savviest, most powerful men in the communications industry have so misjudged each other's company as a suitable match? **********In the weeks since the deal collapsed, both executives, in separate, lengthy interviews, took pains to avoid direct recriminations. Chalk it up to a dream born in the heady days of last summer -- when hype over ""convergence,"" ""interactive multimedia"" and ""paradigm shifts"" had an entire industry spinning fevered visions of the future. But over the winter, the dream faded as Mr. Malone, the president and chief executive of T.C.I., and Mr. Smith, the chairman of Bell Atlantic, realized that their business philosophies clashed. **********Mr. Malone, who grew up in a rough-and-tumble industry that views growth as a company's principal mission, disdains traditional corporate goals like reporting earnings and paying dividends as distractions that siphon off money that might otherwise be plowed back into building or acquiring new properties. This ethos was at odds with the by-the-ledger-book traditions revered by Bell Atlantic. **********""Ray,"" Mr. Malone said of Mr. Smith, ""was always dealing with a financial mind-set within his company that focused on near-term reported earnings instead of creating wealth in the long term -- the old phone company mentality."" **********But what Mr. Malone saw as prudishness, Mr. Smith viewed as financial prudence. The Bell Atlantic chairman was unwilling to stake too much of his shareholders' money on the uncertain high-tech dreams of Mr. Malone. As the two companies got to know each other, Bell Atlantic also recognized some unsettling differences between their cultures. **********""There were difficulties with the T.C.I. system, its reputation for service in some places compared with the way we do things, and the level of animosity in some communities,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Those were seen by our people with a certain horror."" **********But even though the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. deal is dead, the forces that fueled it and the issues it raised remain. Private industry, everyone agrees, will have to build what the Clinton Administration has called the information highway -- a marriage of television, communications and computer technology that experts say will someday bring everything from movies to libraries to home screens at the tap of a button. Problems for Others **********And the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. merger was an ambitious attempt by private enterprise to hasten its arrival. But the story of the deal's collapse, based on interviews with Mr. Smith, Mr. Malone, executives and advisers, shows the kinds of challenges that any business partners will need to overcome if they are to blend hybrid technologies -- and disparate industries -- into a home-entertainment and information revolution. **********On Feb. 23, when the deal finally fell apart, the reason given for scuttling the merger was a complex price dispute: how many of its own new shares of stock Bell Atlantic would pay for T.C.I. **********The price when a company is being sold, of course, is merely the arithmetic that reflects assumptions about that company's assets, strategy and expectations for the future. Absent common assumptions, there was no deal. **********""At the end, there were two strong-willed people with very different views of the value of T.C.I.,"" said Mr. Smith of Bell Atlantic. **********On that issue, at least, the other strong-willed person agreed. ""There was a basic difference in philosophy,"" Mr. Malone of T.C.I. said. ""When we had to kill the deal, what the people in our shop felt was mostly relief."" Getting Acquainted  2 'Antagonists,' Attracted **********Mr. Smith, 56 years old, and Mr. Malone, 53, seemed headed in the same direction long before they got together last June at T.C.I.'s headquarters in Englewood, Colo. **********Early in their careers, although at different periods, both had been engineers at A.T.& T.'s Bell Laboratories. But Mr. Smith had stayed in the telephone industry. Mr. Malone, restless under the bureaucracy of the old Bell System, fled. He eventually wound up heading the largest cable television empire in America. **********In the years and then the months leading up to last summer, the phone and cable industries were preparing to invade each other's bailiwicks, as regulations were gradually easing to let phone companies get into the video business and cable companies into phone service. The two industries, though ""natural antagonists,"" in Mr. Smith's phrase, also have complementary strengths to use in building the information highway. Regulatory Diplomats **********The phone companies are seasoned regulatory diplomats; they possess the switching technology needed for two-way interactive networks, and they generate huge quantities of cash. **********The cable companies, especially T.C.I., bring national reach, high-capacity cables able to handle voice and video, and programming expertise. **********After overtures from Bell Atlantic last summer, and meetings between the two sides, the merger was annnounced at a New York news conference on Oct. 13. The agreement put a tentative price on the T.C.I. cable systems and related programming interests at nearly $23 billion, and called for Bell Atlantic to assume about $10 billion of T.C.I.'s debt. **********Yet soon afterward, both sides began to realize how difficult, time-consuming and complicated the merger would actually be. Corporate Tire Kickers **********Bell Atlantic and T.C.I. dispatched inspection teams -- corporate tire kickers -- to each other's empires less than a week after the deal was announced last fall. For each side, the results were revealing. **********T.C.I. is the nation's largest cable-systems operator with 10.4 million subscribers nationwide. But only a modest percentage of its franchises are modern, high-channel-capacity systems in major metropolitan centers, passing at least 100,000 homes. In contrast, Time Warner, Cablevision and Cox, for example, each have sizable metropolitan holdings. **********The difference reflects T.C.I.'s history as largely a collection of smaller, rural systems. But it also means that the investment costs will be considerable for anyone meaning to upgrade the T.C.I. operations for the high-capacity, 500-channel future. After the deal was scuttled, Mr. Smith said, ""T.C.I. is not the premier property in the industry."" **********On the T.C.I. side, there were gnawing doubts about whether Bell Atlantic, which serves a six-state region from New Jersey to Virginia, including Washington, would really abandon its phone-company traditions and become a growth company. **********Although Bell Atlantic is known as the most adventurous of the seven regional Baby Bells created by the antitrust breakup of A.T.&.T in 1984, the scrappy, entrepreneurial types at T.C.I. viewed it as a high-cost, slow-moving bureaucracy. **********A joke that made the rounds in the T.C.I. camp spoke volumes about how the cable people viewed the companies' culture gap: What's gray with a blue-and-gold stripe and sleeps six? A Bell Atlantic repair truck. Unionized Workers **********Bell Atlantic's 73,600-member work force is largely unionized, while T.C.I.'s 22,000 employees are mainly nonunion. Bell Atlantic's per-worker benefits costs, according to one T.C.I. adviser, were estimated an nearly four times the level at T.C.I. **********But the biggest obstacle to the merger was the companies' disparate financial cultures. Bell Atlantic, in the tradition of telephone utilities, reports hefty earnings -- $1.4 billion last year on revenues of $13 billion -- and it pays generous dividends to its shareholders. **********T.C.I., the cable powerhouse, operates by an entirely different financial logic. Although its cash flow -- income before interest payments, depreciation and other charges -- was $1.86 billion last year on revenues of $4.15 billion -- because it borrows heavily to finance aggressive growth and investment, it reports almost no net income, after paying interest on loans, and it pays no dividends. Its shareholders are seeking a stake in a fast-growing pile of assets and betting on the future. **********Mr. Malone speaks of reported profits, the traditional yardstick of corporate performance, with disdain. ""If you start to show reported earnings,"" he said, ""you've probably stopped growing.""  Growing Apart  A Financial Gap Too Wide to Span **********Despite the uncertainties -- compounded by a steady decline in both companies' stock prices -- the two executives were cheered after they met on Jan. 27., at the Marriott Hotel near the airport in Portland, Me., not far from Boothbay, where Mr. Malone has a vacation home. Each man had one adviser present. **********The two sides, the executives and advisers say, went over thorny issues that had cropped up repeatedly during the merger talks. To allay any Bell Atlantic qualms about his post-merger plans, for example, Mr. Malone was willing to agree not to enter into any venture that might compete with the combined company for at least five years. He said that this proviso ""was no big deal."" **********But pricing, as always, was a big deal. And on this, both sides say, real progress was made in Portland.  F.C.C. as Rate Cutter **********Mr. Smith gave Mr. Malone an update on the Federal Communications Commission, which was expected to issue new rules on another round of cable television rate cuts. According to one person at the meeting, Mr. Smith said that Bell Atlantic's people monitoring the agency in Washington had assured him that no drastic cuts were expected -- certainly nothing that would scuttle the merger plan. **********And so the two men roughed out what Mr. Malone later called a ""robust structure"" for the deal -- a set number of Bell Atlantic shares to be paid for T.C.I. Neither side will spell out what that exchange ratio was to have been, citing confidentiality agreements. The two executives left the meeting confident enough to agree that their lawyers could draw up the paperwork for the definitive agreement. **********""By the end of January,"" Mr. Malone recalled, ""both Ray and I thought we had a solution."" **********The details of the ""robust structure"" had progressed far enough over the next two weeks that, by Feb. 11, Mr. Malone and Mr. Smith agreed to meet again soon to wrap things up. **********But the picture had clouded considerably by the time they met on the afternoon of Wednesday, Feb. 23, at the Manhattan offices of Bell Atlantic's legal adviser, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The day before, the F.C.C. had decided to roll back the rates that American consumers pay on basic cable television service by 7 percent. Moreover, any future price increases would be limited to 2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation. **********Thus, it was a wary group of seven who gathered in the 44th-floor conference room: for Bell Atlantic, Mr. Smith and two aides, and for T.C.I., Mr. Malone and three aides. Reduction in Cash Flow **********Mr. Malone, briefing Mr. Smith on the impact of the F.C.C. action, said it would reduce the cash generated from T.C.I.'s cable system subscribers -- $1.86 billion in 1993 -- by roughly $144 million a year. **********This was a problem, Mr. Malone acknowledged, but mainly a short-term one. T.C.I., he predicted, would be able to recoup revenues with new pay-per-view services and other offerings not subject to the rate strictures. The F.C.C. action, in his view, should not alter the pricing formula. After all, he argued, this was a merger for long-term gains. **********But Mr. Smith saw the F.C.C.'s action as altering the whole equation. The Bell Atlantic model for valuing T.C.I. was to multiply its cash flow by 11.75 times, a formula similar to that applied to most cable-systems purchases. So, by Mr. Smith's reckoning, the T.C.I. price should now be cut by about $1.7 billion. ""If T.C.I. was willing to make up much of the $1.7 billion difference,"" Mr. Smith later said, ""we could have still gone ahead."" Diluting Earnings **********But if Bell Atlantic went ahead on the terms favored by Mr. Malone, the combined company's reported earnings would be watered down for an additional two to three years -- beyond the three or four years expected when the merger was announced. And Bell Atlantic, Mr. Smith said, would be paying a full 14 times T.C.I.'s cash flow. **********Mr. Smith stands by his decision to demand better terms. ""The week after we broke off the deal wasn't pleasant,"" he recalled, ""after all the excitement we had stirred up and all the work we had done. But it would have been a horrendous week if I had to justify paying 14 times cash flow to the Bell Atlantic shareholders."" **********On the T.C.I. side, the unbridgeable price gap is regarded as further evidence of the different corporate cultures. ""We were taking a long-term perspective,."" Mr. Malone said. **********But in the end, Mr. Malone was selling more of the future than Mr. Smith was willing to buy. ""It looked like a tremendous deal in October,"" Mr. Smith recalled, ""but it didn't look that way anymore."""

C. Fisher, vowed to take action to improve the financial performance of the giant photographic products company. ""Kodak will not inventory its problems and carry them forward,"" he said in a statement. ""We will emerge from 1994 with a strong balance sheet and a solid benchmark for measuring future performance."" **********Mr. Fisher said that cost reductions would continue through the fourth quarter and might include a restructuring program. **********Kodak's stock was shaken earlier this month after an internal company memo became public, disclosing that Kodak was falling behind on its financial targets and would have to cut costs more sharply. The company, based in Rochester, is already well into a program to eliminate 10,000 jobs. **********The company has also been selling off operations not involved in photography and imaging to raise cash and concentrate on its core businesses. **********In its financial report yesterday, Kodak said it earned $193 million in the third quarter, or 57 cents a share, down from $279 million, or 85 cents a share on an operating basis, from the corresponding period last year. A restructuring charge of $353 million, or $1.08 a share, produced an overall loss for the 1993 period. **********The earnings came in below the expectations of analysts, who had been forecasting 76 cents to 98 cents a share, with a mean figure of 85 cents a share. **********The decline in earnings came despite a 11 percent increase in sales, to $3.53 billion from $3.187 billion. But some of the 1994 growth came the acquisition of Qualex, a photofinisher. Without Qualex, sales grew 8 percent, the company said. **********Part of the decline in earnings was a result of the Qualex acquisition, which cost 6 cents a share, and various write-downs, which cost 12 cents a share in the quarter. Without these charges, the company would have earned 75 cents a share, which would have put it within the range of analysts' projections. **********For much of the summer and fall, Kodak has been successful in divesting operations not related to its photographic and imaging operations. In all, the units have fetched $7.9 billion, well above the $5.1 billion Kodak paid to acquire them in 1988. **********Company officials have said the funds will be used to pay off debt and take advantage of opportunities in electronic imaging. **********Sales in the company's photographic and imaging operations showed increases in the quarter, with domestic and foreign consumer sales increasing 19 percent, to $1.63 million. Worldwide commercial sales increased 6 percent, to $1.96 billion, with overseas sales growing three times as fast as domestic sales."

There are 16 uncompleted reactors in Eastern Europe, as well as more than 50 operating or under construction in Russia, Ukraine and Bulgaria. **********""Nobody is saying we love the project,"" said Kathleen McGinty, director of environmental policy at the White House. ""We like a project that has a chance of being safe rather than a ticking time bomb. We are not going to be a party to looking the other way while another Chernobyl occurs."" **********But some critics say the United States Government could end up paying for an accident at the Czech plant, and environmentalists and the Austrian Government warn that the Russian design may be too flawed to be safe, even with Western technology. An estimated 10 million people live within a 100-mile radius of the Temelin site and Prague, the Czech capital, is 60 miles away. The Austrian capital of Vienna is 120 miles southeast -- and downwind -- of Temelin. **********""An accident at Temelin could result in devastating health, environmental, economic and social consequences for all of Austria's eight million citizens,"" a panel of Austrian scientists warned earlier this year. **********The Temelin reactors, called the VVER-1000, are the most advanced Soviet design. They are not the type that exploded at the Chernobyl plant near Kiev in 1986, causing billions of dollars in damages in the worst accident in the history of nuclear power. **********""These are excellent machines and, with the investments, they should have a very long and productive life,"" said Nathaniel D. Woodson, president of the Westinghouse energy systems business unit in Pittsburgh. ""This work is in our own enlightened self-interest as well as good business."" **********For Westinghouse, which faces a moribund domestic nuclear market, the project represents a chance to get a jump on European competitors in the fight for repair contracts that the World Bank estimates could reach $24 billion. **********But the Czech project and the Administration's broader goals have touched off a high-stakes, behind-the-scenes debate in Congress and the commercial nuclear industry that will help shape the future of nuclear power in Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine. **********Several influential legislators are concerned that the United States Government could end up paying for damages in the case of an accident at the Czech plant, because the Westinghouse work is being financed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. **********""Any possibility that American taxpayers could be liable for a nuclear accident in the Czech Republic as a result of Ex-Im Bank guarantees would be unacceptable,"" said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Reviews Challenged **********In approving the guarantee, the Export-Import Bank said it had relied on its own safety review and assessments of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Environmentalists and congressional investigators have challenged the adequacy of those reviews. **********The bank, which promotes exports of American products, has only one nuclear engineer on its staff and no formal procedure for evaluating environmental concerns, according to Carol F. Lee, the bank's general counsel. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has trained Czech workers but has not performed its own evaluation of the Russian reactor design. **********The International Atomic Energy Agency, in studies of the VVER-1000 reactors at Temelin and elsewhere, found design problems, and the agency has not thoroughly evaluated whether Westinghouse's technology can remedy all the flaws, said David R. Kyd, director of information at the agency's headquarters in Vienna. **********Vice President Al Gore, widely regarded as a strong environmentalist, and his national security adviser, Leon S. Fuerth, were among the leading proponents of the project, according to Administration officials. **********""If Leon and the Vice President had not wanted this to happen, I'm sure it would have sunk beneath the waves,"" said a White House official who worked on the National Security Council report. An Environmental Press **********The issue of Temelin arose at a reception at Mr. Gore's residence on Feb. 24 for environmental leaders and Administration officials involved in environmental policy. The environmentalists were pressing the officials to give a fuller hearing to their concerns about Temelin before the approval of the project by the Export-Import Bank, according to several people who were at the reception. **********""Some of the Administration people pulled the Vice President off to the side and as we were leaving a White House staffer said there would be a review,"" said James N. Barnes, director of the international department at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group. **********But Mr. Barnes and other environmental representatives said they did not get another chance to object. Ms. McGinty of the White House said Temelin was discussed at the reception, but she said it was an informal gathering and the issue was not broached with Mr. Gore. **********Last year, Greenpeace and Czech environmental groups staged a protest at Temelin, but opposition came later in the United States. Not until early this year did the Austrian Government express its concerns to the Administration and members of Congress. Austrian Concern **********So great is the Austrian anxiety that Chancellor Franz Vranitzky told President Clinton last month, during a meeting about Bosnia, that his Government was extremely concerned about the potential for an accident at Temelin and similar reactors in other neighboring countries, Austrian diplomats say. **********The diplomats said they were not optimistic that the Administration would reverse its stand on Temelin, but they said they hoped that work on other plants would be reconsidered. **********Westinghouse is a finalist in the bidding for work on four Russian-designed reactors in Hungary, and the company's officials said part of the contract would involve obtaining Export-Import Bank financing. **********Temelin is viewed as a breakthrough by Westinghouse, which beat European powerhouses like Siemens A. G. of Germany and Framatome S. A. of France to win the $400 million contract. **********Business is bad at home for Westinghouse and others in the industry. Part of the reason is the good supply of electricity and part is the effective opposition by environmental groups. The last license that led to the completion of a nuclear plant in the United States was issued in 1974. **********Despite the concerns in Congress and elsewhere, the Clinton Administration has pushed ahead with the Temelin project and its broader program. Last fall, the National Security Council produced a report for the Export-Import Bank that supported the project. On March 10, the bank's board agreed to guarantee $317 million in commercial loans for the Westinghouse contract. Executives Shaken **********For Temelin, Westinghouse is performing extensive tests and computer modeling to adapt its technology to the nearly completed reactor vessels. From the company's perspective, the profitability will come from replicating the work on other Soviet-designed reactors. **********As a result, the simmering controversy over Temelin has shaken Westinghouse executives and sent them hurrying to enlist lobbyists, people familiar with the company's strategy said. **********Several Congressional committees are examining issues related to Temelin, but the primary investigation is being conducted by the oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan. **********The subcommittee has demanded all documents relied on by the Export-Import Bank to approve the Temelin loan guarantee. The subcommittee also plans to ask the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to conduct an extensive study at the Temelin site to determine the condition of work already completed there on the construction and mechanical systems. **********To deal with the inquiry, Westinghouse has hired former Representative Dennis E. Eckart, Democrat of Ohio, a one-time protege of Representative Dingell, and Michael F. Barrett Jr., a former staff director of the oversight subcommittee. Who Would Pay? **********Mr. Dingell said he was concerned about the safety of the Soviet reactors and the potential liability for United States taxpayers in the event of an accident at a plant with American financing. **********American companies also are worried about who would pay for an accident. Although the Czech Republic has promised to sign international accords that protect contractors from financial liability before the Westinghouse work on Temelin begins, Russia and Ukraine have refused. **********An ad hoc group of nine big United States nuclear companies, including the Bechtel Power Corporation and Combustion Engineering, has told the Clinton Administration that its members will not make safety improvements on Russian-designed reactors until the Government protects them from financial liability. Large European contractors have taken a similar position. **********""Anybody dealing in those countries is dealing in a vacuum as far as liability goes,"" said Leland F. Willis, vice president of Associated Universities Inc., a consortium of universities that operates Brookhaven National Laboratory and leads the United States contractors' group. **********Westinghouse and some other American companies are negotiating with the State Department and the Department of Energy to gain coverage under a law that allows the Government to provide relief to companies in a national emergency or for national security purposes. The law was invoked in the $250 million bailout of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in 1971. **********""They haven't been willing to do it so far,"" Mr. Willis said."

May's shares rose 50 cents, to $39, on the Big Board. **********Mercantile did not say why negotiations had ended. Some analysts speculated that the deal, which was close to completion a couple of weeks ago, broke down over price. Todd Slater, a retail analyst at UBS Securities, said May would probably have been uncomfortable with a price of more than $60 a share. **********But others suggested that the two companies failed to reach agreement over severance issues. Because about 40 percent of Mercantile's shares are held by the Milliken family, which owns the Milliken Company, the giant textile concern, Mercantile's charter lacks detailed provisions about what would happen to key executives in the event of a change in corporate control. **********People familiar with the talks said Mercantile, which operates 101 stores in the Midwest and South under names like Gayfers, Maison Blanche and McAlpin's, was pushing for handsome severance packages for its executives that would have let them leave the company as soon as an acquisition was completed. **********Some analysts were surprised by May's interest in Mercantile, which is based in Fairfield, Ohio. Mercantile's stores last year produced sales per square foot of $168, which is at the low end of the range for department stores, and are in secondary markets. Its operating profits are generally lower than those of its peers, and its sales have stagnated at about $2.8 billion a year. **********But Mercantile's balance sheet is relatively debt-free and it owns much of the real estate where its stores are situated, leaving analysts speculating yesterday that another bidder would soon appear. **********""It's too bad for both companies that this didn't work out,"" Walter F. Loeb, a retailing consultant, said. ""The May Company would obviously like to get bigger, and this was a good fit. But it could fit with others as well."" **********Some said Dillard Department Stores Inc. was a likely suitor for Mercantile. But people familiar with Dillard's strategy said the Arkansas-based chain was more interested in stores in the Southeast that would be sold as R. H. Macy & Company and Federated Department Stores Inc. complete their merger. **********Now May may take an interest in those stores, too, which could lead to a bidding war."

Local 412 in Warren, Mich. The union, he said, objects to the hiring of nonunion companies to do similar work and to having nonunion workers stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with union members at the technical center. **********Nonunion workers earn about the same salaries, Mr. Corless said, ""but the company wants as little as possible to do with pensions, job security pay"" and other benefits for which nonunion workers do not qualify. In the last 20 years, Mr. Corless said, the number of workers represented by the union has shrunk from about 1,650 to the current total of 850 as Chrysler has channeled more contracts to the outside. Tentative Agreement Reached **********Lee Sechler, a Chrysler spokesman, declined to comment on the dispute. **********A second group, of about 400 salaried and some hourly maintenance workers, also employed at Chrysler's technical center in Auburn Hills, Mich., tentatively reached a settlement today. The workers will vote on the proposed contract on Thursday. **********Although the three United States auto makers signed new three-year master contracts last fall covering general terms of pay and benefits, each union local must also reach agreement with plant or workplace managers. Reaching local agreements has sometimes proved troublesome, a result of the industry's current boom. **********The union believes extra help is needed in factories, but auto makers prefer not to give the work to the union since doing so may mean paying job security benefits when the economy slows down. Complaint About Overtime **********The union, on the other hand, complains that workers are working too much overtime and need help to prevent repetitive-stress injuries and other job-related health problems. **********Separately, union negotiators representing 11,500 General Motors Corporation assembly and components workers in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to meet with company representatives to resolve complaints about the speed-up of operations. **********G.M. officials, eager to meet strong vehicle demand by retail customers, wants to increase the line speed at its Buick City assembly plant to 72 or 73 vehicles an hour from 67.

Indeed, one thing became clear the first day the P.L.O, chairman set  foot in what he called ""the first free Palestinian land:"" It will take more than a speech to impress these Palestinians. **********Many of those interviewed said they will need to hear and see more before speaking of ""miracles."" During 27 years of exposure to Israeli society, they have developed a suppressed, but real, admiration for the democratic practices as well as an appetite for debate and a tradition of independent-mindedness. **********Clearly sensing the weight of obligations Gazans attached to his arrival -- he is expected to fix the sewers, create jobs, liberate some 5,000 remaining Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails and impose peace and order before holding free elections -- Mr. Arafat immediately promised to do all this and more. **********He said he would pray in Jerusalem and widen Palestinian autonomy beyond Jericho and Gaza to the whole Israeli-Occupied West Bank. He also said his ultimate goal remains the creation of an independent Palestinian homeland. **********While assuring Gazans, who are widely considered the most militant among Palestinians, that he was acutely aware of their problems, he also told them the key to solving them is to fall in line behind his authority. **********""I want to remind you that we have a big mission ahead of us, a big mission to build this homeland, to build our institutions and to rebuild the institutions that Israeli occupation destroyed,"" Mr. Arafat said in his 25-minute speech delivered in the old Parliament building which, just a few weeks ago, was the Israeli military command center for Gaza. **********""We need national unity. National unity. Unity. Unity. Unity,"" Mr. Arafat stressed. **********While these remarks, particularly those contesting Israel's claim to jurisdiction over a united Jerusalem, are certain to trigger anger among Israelis, they appear in the Palestinian context to be rather conciliatory.  Mr. Arafat said he was committed to continuing to work for peace and that opponents  will have to find nonviolent ways of obstructing it or risk tussling with his police. **********Clearly, as he arrived home, Mr. Arafat had Muslim fundamentalist opponents of his peace agreement with Israel on his mind. The militant Islamic Holy War movement claimed responsibility for wounding four Israelis earlier this week, as ""a present to Arafat."" **********Mr. Arafat placated the fundamentalists today with a promise to liberate their imprisoned spiritual leader, Ahmed Yassin, the Muslim cleric he described  as his ""brother"" in the struggle for Palestinian destiny. **********But this magnanimity was preceded by the palpable success of imposing Palestinian authority over Gaza during the past two months in the form of nearly 7,000 Palestinian police and security forces loyal to Mr. Arafat. **********Several Muslim fundamentalists and other opponents of peace with Israel have  been rounded up, interrogated, and in some cases jailed. Gangs of car thieves and drug dealers, hiding behind political labels with the intention of working to intimidate neighborhoods, have been broken up. **********Knowing that everyone in Gaza knows that too, Mr. Arafat today chose to approach Hamas and his other fundamentalist critics with an olive branch. **********Visibly elated, holding the microphone firmly between his palms, Mr. Arafat saluted another potential source of trouble, those he called the ""children of the stone,"" the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian youths who fueled and kept  alive the uprising against Israeli occupation since 1988. To them the new Arafat regime means freedom, jobs, social services and housing. **********Certainly, the experience was educational for Mr. Arafat too. **********No matter how well informed he was on conditions here during his years of exile, it was striking for many to realize that he was not truly connected to the reality on the ground. **********Today and in the coming three days of his visit to Gaza and Jericho, Mr. Arafat and an entourage of about 100 senior P.L.O. officials who came to the ""homecoming"" with him from Tunis are discovering they will have to yield if they want support here. **********Gazans were more than happy to point out that the P.L.O. chairman had to come here, where a million Palestinians live, first instead of following his original plan just to visit Jericho, a town of about 15,000 Palestinians renowned for its docile political climate. **********As the relationship between the returning Mr. Arafat and the people he is to  govern develops, a new pattern of government will have to emerge, one that is different from the autocratic habits Mr. Arafat developed and refined in his years of exile in Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia. **********Many in Gaza would flock to Mr. Arafat's side if he dealt with their most acute problems, mainly the lamentable state of the local economy, the overcrowded housing, and the gangs operating in the name of the left or the religious right. **********Mr. Arafat's growing police and security force appears able to achieve these  objectives. **********But it is too early to tell whether he and his political advisers can anticipate the fast-changing mood of a population that for years has dedicated itself to fighting tenaciously and relentlessly."

Gold, which traders buy as a hedge against inflation, fell yesterday after prices had been flat for three sessions. **********""This is the classic recession scenario,"" said Tracy Herrick, chief investment strategist for Jefferies & Company in Los Angeles. ""Bonds rally, stocks drop, especially cyclical stocks, and nobody buys gold. The markets are saying that a recession could occur far sooner than anybody thinks."" **********Moreover, the yield curve of bonds is flattening, which means that short-term bonds pay almost as much as bonds with maturities of a decade or more. A wide variety of fixed-income securities are therefore attractive and could coax money into Treasury bills and notes and out of stocks. **********For example, the one-year Treasury bond yesterday paid an interest rate of 7.17 percent, a five-year bond 7.75 percent and a 30-year bond 7.86 percent. **********""The yield curve has had so many contractions that it's about to give birth,"" said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist for C. H. Dean & Associates in Dayton, Ohio. ""And the birth just might be recession.

""The market has been fighting negative news for three days. It was just a buildup and, like a thunderstorm, it just happens."" **********Some stocks rose. AT&T rallied strongly, after falling for nearly a month, to rise 1 3/8, to 48 5/8. Prudential Securities and other brokerage firms raised their assessments of the company. Seneca Foods gained 3 1/4, to 34 1/2, after Grand Metropolitan contracted the processing of its Green Giant vegetables to Seneca. **********Most stocks were down.

CD-ROM's are computer compact disks (CD) with read-only memory (ROM), meaning they are meant to play back information, not create it. **********The market for CD-ROM technology has arrived. About four million CD-ROM players were sold in the United States in 1993, and this year the number of CD-ROM players in use is expected to double, to about 15 million. By 1999, an estimated 8 of every 10 computer users will have CD-ROM players attached to their systems, according to Infotech, a market researcher in Woodstock, Vt. And many of them will be business users. **********Despite all the publicity for consumer CD-ROM titles like ""Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?"" for inquisitive children, and ""Penthouse Interactive"" for prurient adults, most CD-ROM's contain much drier, data-only business fare like ""Paper, Printing & Packaging Database"" and ""Japanese Company Factfinder."" **********Of the more than 8,000 CD-ROM titles, only 500 are low-cost retail programs for entertainment and education, which typically sell for $30 to $100. Most are specialized business data bases for $500 to $5,000. **********For corporate computer users, the big question is how much longer an investment in CD-ROM technology will pay off, in light of the national push to create an on-line, interactive information network, which could jeopardize the value of disks. **********What makes CD-ROM technology compelling is its capacity to store huge amounts of all types of data, including multimedia graphics, video, sound and text. One CD-ROM can hold as much data as 500 floppy disks. **********But for corporate users, relatively mundane, text-only data bases, not fancy multimedia, are the draws. Instead of ""Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?"" a more typical query is where in the world is Carmen Foundations Inc.? (In Chicago, making bras and girdles, according to Standard & Poor's.) **********Such information can be expensive.  An annual subscription to S.& P.'s monthly report, for example, costs $5,000 on CD-ROM, compared with less than $3,000 on paper. **********As with S.& P., many CD-ROM titles purchased by corporations are versions of printed documents. A company might switch entirely to the CD-ROM version, or use it as an index to the printed version. **********But there are other business uses for CD-ROM. The Microsoft Corporation, Novell Inc. and other software companies see CD-ROM as an efficient way to deliver large programs, like Microsoft Office Pro. Because many programs require a dozen or more floppies (Microsoft Office Pro uses 33), shipping on CD-ROM can save problems for software publishers and users. **********In a recent survey of business computer users by Dataquest Inc., a research company in San Jose, Calif., two-thirds of the respondents said they used their CD-ROM drives mainly for software distribution. **********""Today, it's almost hard to buy a new PC without a CD-ROM drive,"" said Barry Richman, vice president and general manager of the CD-ROM division of Dialog Information Services in Palo Alto, Calif., a leading electronic publisher. **********A low-end drive can cost as little as $75 when bought as part of a new computer, while a more advanced double-speed drive can cost only a few hundred dollars. Even as an after-market add-on, double-speed drives cost only about $350. And prices are falling. **********CD-ROM technology is evolving rapidly. While single-speed drives can produce jerkiness on a screen, double-speed CD-ROM drives offer better performance for video and graphics, with transfer rates of 300,000 bytes a second. And quadruple-speed drives are reaching the market, but at about $1,000, they are intended mainly for CD-ROM software developers. **********A new class of CD-ROM titles is aimed at business professionals.  ""Street Atlas U.S.A.,"" for instance, is a $100 program that supplies street maps of the entire country on a single CD-ROM. The program, from the Delorme Mapping Company in Freeport, Me., can be customized, making it an ideal tool for sales people. **********And the $65 ""Official Phonedisc U.S.A.,"" from Digital Directory Assistance Inc. in Bethesda, Md., puts the country's entire telephone white pages on CD-ROM. For $20, American Business Information in Omaha, offers a directory of addresses and phone numbers for 11 million companies in North America. And Microsoft Bookshelf, containing a multimedia dictionary, thesaurus, atlas and other reference tools, is $99. **********But forces in electronic publishing are clouding the outlook for CD-ROM. Will on-line services and the construction of the information network steal customers from CD-ROM? ""It's not an either-or situation,"" said Julie B. Schwerin, Infotech's president. **********Rather, she said, the CD-ROM and on-line markets will reinforce each other because the ""content"" and tools for one will be useful in the other. And the attention paid to on-line services will stimulate the demand for CD-ROM, she added, much the way radio stimulates the demand for audio CD's, and television and movies help sell video tapes. **********Still, CD-ROM could lose many of its advantages, like its sophisticated search engines for navigating data bases, and its predictable pricing. **********Virtually every on-line service -- whether professionally oriented networks like Dialog or Mead Data Central's Lexis-Nexis, or more general services like Compuserve and Dow Jones News Retrieval -- is working on interfaces that are easier to use, made possible by faster data transmission speeds that can handle graphics better. And many services are adopting more palatable and predictable pricing. **********At the same time, ""intelligent agent"" technology -- pieces of software code that scurry through electronic networks seeking information for users -- may pose an additional threat to CD-ROM-based data bases, which don't offer that feature. **********But until these network wonders arrive, some customers say they will remain cautious about their use of on-line services, for budgetary as much as technical reasons. **********At the Chicago office of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, for instance, CD-ROM is preferred for researching data bases like Securities and Exchange Commission filings and company prospectuses. **********""If you're an experienced searcher, on-line is fine,"" said Therese Cotillas, research manager for the office.  But because many professional and consumer on-line services require users to pay as they go, the potential of running up a huge tab is too big. **********But as the benefits associated with CD-ROM make their way onto on-line services, customers and the companies that sell information electronically are rethinking their strategies. **********""There will be a shift toward on-line delivery,"" said Mr. Richman of Dialog. The company sells scores of high-priced CD-ROM data bases, like compilations of The Federal Register for $750 a year and The Journal of Commerce for $795, and offers on-line access to them and hundreds of others on a pay-as-you-go basis. **********But Dialog is focusing on its on-line services and considering simpler pricing, Mr. Richman said. **********Attractive pricing aside, there's one thing the on-line services cannot offer CD-ROM customers: The ability to keep what they buy. **********""There's a very historic precedent for people wanting to own content,"" Ms. Schwerin said. ""We don't see the day when the provision of games and entertainment on-line will have the effect of making physical media obsolete."""

A $2.5 million fine levied by the State Attorney General was announced last week and will be paid by Met Life over two years to various charitable organizations in an unusual agreement with the state. 'We Do Not See the Basis' **********Mary Butler, a spokeswoman for the Acting United States Attorney, Donna Bucella, in Florida, said Federal law prohibited her from confirming or denying the existence of any investigation. Charles Sahner, a spokesman for Met Life, said the company and its employees had not received subpoenas or any other formal notice from Federal officials. ""We do not see the basis for any investigation going forward,"" Mr. Sahner said, adding that the company would cooperate if any investigation was started. **********Met Life is currently offering refunds to an estimated 60,000 customers across the country who were improperly sold insurance policies under the guise of retirement plans. Because not all eligible customers are taking the refund, the company expects that the cost of the refunds could total $40 million to $50 million, or more than half the maximum of $76 million it estimated earlier this year. In Pennsylvania, Met Life is offering to reinstate old policies of customers who were improperly sold new policies to replace the earlier ones. **********If an investigation shows that Met Life used the mails or telephone to conduct a fraud, it could be charged with violations of criminal law that carry a jail term of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count. **********The inquiry by the United States Attorney's office comes as Met Life has been besieged with lawsuits by former customers contending they were misled, and by former agents who say the company wrongfully terminated their employment. **********In one recent suit, a former agent, Robert M. Slade of Happauge, L.I., said the company's unwillingness to distinguish between the misleading sales practices in the Tampa office and tactics of other agents who sold life insurance as a retirement product had opened the door to groundless complaints."

All governments and relevant intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women's health, to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion* as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded improved family planning services. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority, and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion. Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate counseling. Any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process. In circumstances in which abortion is not against the law, such abortion should be safe. In all cases, women should have access to quality services for the management of complications arising from abortion. Post-abortion counseling, education and family-planning services should be offered promptly which  [ would ]  also help to avoid repeat abortions. *********** Unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards or both.

It's time for it to shift at least part of the way back toward Europe. **********Last week's massive media coverage of the D-Day commemoration may have helped to remind Americans of the dangers of turning their backs on the Old World. **********But neglect of Europe is not just dangerous for America's national security. It is a mistake for America's economic interests too. **********The much-cited fact that the United States now trades more with Asia than with Europe is no reason to conclude that the economic relationship with Europe has lost its importance. On the contrary, the links with Europe are in many ways more valuable. **********That message is well argued in a report titled ""Shrinking the Atlantic,"" just published jointly by North Atlantic Research Inc. and the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. **********Rather than entertain notions of ""playing the Asia card against Europe,"" the report urges Washington to form a common front with Europe in tackling the challenges of the global market. **********The report's authors, Robin Gaster and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., say that in the key areas of trade, investment and technology, the relationship between the United States and Europe is far healthier and more profitable for America than its dealings with Asia, which are chiefly characterized by a massive structural trade deficit in manufactured goods. And it's likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future. **********So why are Americans so obsessed with Asia? The simple answer is the region's huge potential as a market for U.S. exports. **********While Asia has been dramatically booming, Europe has been in a dispiriting recession, and the Continent's attempts at political and economic integration have met with a series of humiliating setbacks. **********Trans-Atlantic trade relations have been dogged by high-profile disputes over agriculture, Airbus, telecommunications, steel and other divisive issues. **********But there is more to it than that. President Bill Clinton personifies the coming to power of a generation that did not know World War II. The traditional, Atlanticist establishment is in retreat. **********As other cultures increase their influence, the United States is being gradually but inexorably de-Europeanized, a trend that has been encouraged by the Clinton administration's emphasis on ""diversity"" and accentuated by the assault on ""Eurocentrism"" in the country's educational system. **********The switch of the focus of foreign policy from security to markets also means more attention for Asia. Mr. Gaster argues that because security concerns so long dominated U.S.-European relations, Atlanticists are to be found mainly in the State Department and the Pentagon, while officials dealing with economic issues tend to have Asian backgrounds. **********Equally, as Washington experiments with industrial policy, many experts believe it should look to Asia as an example because European industrial policies have failed. **********What all this overlooks is the commonality of interests and principles between Americans and Europeans. It is the Europeans, the report rightly says, who most strongly share U.S. views about the future of the world economic order - especially on issues like trade law, competition policy and labor law. **********Already, America's embrace of Asia is highlighting differences in values on issues ranging from China's attitudes toward human rights to Japan's view of what constitutes an open market. **********In a world in which, as Mr. Gaster puts it, ""the United States needs friends,"" the Europeans are the most obvious candidates. **********At this point Mr. Gaster and Mr. Prestowitz get a bit carried away. They propose creating an ""economic parallel to NATO,"" which would apparently be part discussion group, part international lobbying organization and part economic bloc. **********What the world does not need is another international economic organization. It would be a great idea for Europeans and Americans to collaborate more closely on the world stage. But that can be done by breathing life into the bones of the trans- Atlantic dialogue that is already meant to be under way between the United States and the European Union. **********While that is being done, Washington should put as much effort into elaborating a coherent international economic policy as it did into defining its national-security strategy in the past. As Mr. Gaster says, ""we need more that a set of ongoing quarrels with everybody."""

""Forget, forget, forget the French example,"" said the executive, Etienne Mourgeotte. ""French regulation is counterproductive."" **********In the same vein, public and commercial stations clashed over how to promote more European productions, while film and TV producers disagreed about how to sell their products across Europe's borders, or indeed whether they ever will. **********But for all the discord, the industry crowd did agree on one thing. It will take money to turn the tables around. Big money. **********""Massive aid must be earmarked at the European level,"" said Aurelio de Laurentiis, with the Italian production company Filmauro. He defined massive as between 1.5 billion and 2.0 billion European currency units ($2 billion to $2.5 billion). **********There was little agreement on how to raise the money. René Bonnell, cinema director at the pay-television channel Canal Plus, suggested a levy on broadcasters patterned after the one the French government has imposed on his company. Others urged a European version of France's fund-raising cocktail of taxes on cinema tickets and blank tapes. **********On the spending side, there was a general aversion for the word subsidy and a consensus that aid should be targeted at building pan-European distribution networks to compete with American operators. The European Broadcasting Union, the lobby group of public TV stations, said the EU could double the percentage of non-national European programs broadcast from today's 8 percent by spending 1 billion Ecus over 5 years on distribution. Filmmakers also honed in on this point. **********""Do the American's make better films?"" Mr. De Laurentiis said. ""Absolutely not. They simply have the merit of believing in a single European market."" **********But the most critical issue facing the industry, and the one that requires a recommendation from the European Commission by October, is the question of quotas. The existing Union directive requires 51 percent of programming to be of European origin. France is pushing for a Union quota closer to its 60 percent, while many countries want to ensure the existing directive is enforced in Britain, which allows quota-busters like BSkyB and Ted Turner's TNT to beam into Europe via satellite. **********The question of extending quotas to new consumer-controlled technologies like pay-per-view is potential dynamite in Europe and the United States. **********Regardless of the desirability of quotas, many EU and industry officials have said they thought governments would lose control over programming as conventional broadcasting gives way to satellite and cable systems with 100 or more choices. But Albert Scharf, head of the broadcasting union, said quotas should be extended in effect by requiring new channels to devote a minimum percentage of their budgets to European programming. **********Any attempt to widen quotas would almost surely reignite the trans-Atlantic film war, said Andres Vincente Gomez, the Spanish producer of ""Belle Epoque,"" which won the award for best foreign film from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."

H. Macy & Company began laboring in earnest on a plan to get the retailer out of bankruptcy court, their goals were  clearly to keep their fabled department store company independent and themselves at the helm. **********They came close to achieving both. But in the end, Macy lost its independence to Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and other regional chains, because its chief executive could not keep his directors in line, particularly Laurence A. Tisch, who was a big investor in Macy before its troubles and played an unusual role in the bankruptcy maneuverings. **********A chief executive's relationship with his board is always a delicate one: the corporate landscape is littered with managers who have been dismissed by demanding directors. In bankruptcy, that relationship is doubly difficult because a corporate chieftain is often forced to try to reconcile the conflicting views of the board and the company's creditors, who often call the shots in a bankruptcy case. **********In February, Myron E. Ullman 3d, the chairman and chief executive of Macy, found himself in the middle of those two opposing camps. And waiting to step into the breach, was Federated, which had made the stunning announcement only weeks before that it wanted to merge with its archrival, Macy. **********Mr. Ullman and his team of negotiators had seemingly straddled the divide. They had been secretly negotiating with Fidelity Investments, one of Macy's largest and most influential creditors, and the GE Capital Corporation, which held two seats on Macy's board by virtue of the more than $90 million it had sunk into the company before the bankruptcy filing. They were working on a proposal that would have brought Macy out of bankruptcy protection, preserved its independence and satisfied its contentious senior creditors. **********But Mr. Tisch, who is chairman and chief executive of CBS Inc. and the Loews  Corporation and who takes an active role on Macy's board, learned of the discussions through Robert M. Miller, the lawyer representing Macy's bondholders, and erupted. In a stormy board meeting, Mr. Tisch accused Mr. Ullman and Macy's legal and financial advisers of a classic squeeze play, according to people who were at the meeting. He contended that Macy's management, in cahoots with Fidelity and GE Capital, was trying quietly to form  a plan that favored them while keeping everyone else in the dark -- and out of the money. **********""Tisch sort of took it upon himself to act as an informal creditors' committee for the equity holders,"" said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the senior managing  director of Rothschild Inc. and a fixture in many high-stake bankruptcy cases. ""One of the most unusual things about this case was having a director on the board taking a fairly public stand as to what he thought the value of Macy's was."" **********Mr. Tisch's objections started a process that ultimately took Mr. Ullman's company away from him. Several other directors sided with Mr. Tisch, and for the first time since Macy filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 27, 1992, it was clear that Mr. Ullman was not the master of Macy's destiny. **********Indeed, within five months, a bitter Mr. Ullman was forced to surrender to a  merger with Federated and abandon his dream of leading Macy out of bankruptcy and its history of red ink. ""When Tisch began putting up barriers against Ullman, it was basically the beginning of the end for Macy,"" said a lawyer who represented a group of Macy's senior creditors. **********Tisch and Allies Rebel Questions Raised On Valuation **********In the end, the Macy bankruptcy may go down as a case that was the surprising exception to a recent trend in large bankruptcies. Frequently, investors who specialize in buying the senior debt of bankrupt companies conspire to keep values low so that when a company emerges from bankruptcy proceedings, they get most of its value, including its stock. If the company has been undervalued, the market will send its shares soaring -- and they make out like bandits. **********Mr. Ullman has repeatedly said all Macy directors received a memo disclosing  the talks with Fidelity and GE Capital. But Mr. Tisch and other directors contend they knew nothing of the meetings. **********The uproar resulted in a powerful alliance among Mr. Tisch and three other Macy directors: Harold M. Williams, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Louis Page, executive director of a Hong Kong conglomerate, and A. Alfred Taubman, the shopping mall developer. They demanded that the board's finance committee hold its own discussions to determine what Macy was worth. **********Many people involved in the case questioned Mr. Tisch's motives. He and the directors who sided with him are affiliated with companies that own some Macy bonds, which would have been almost worthless had they not insisted on what the  company was worth. That Mr. Tisch found out about the negotiations with Fidelity and GE Capital from Mr. Miller, the lawyer representing Macy's bondholders, helped bolster their argument. **********But Mr. Tisch has repeatedly said that he was interested in raising the value because getting the highest price possible was his responsibility as a board member. And while bondholders are now slated to receive much more than expected, Loews will make back only a fraction of its original $80 million investment in Macy. **********An Extraordinary Scene **********The finance committee meetings, led by Mr. Tisch, were an extraordinary scene, participants say. One by one, over two days in mid-March, Macy's various  creditor groups aired their cases for how many billions of dollars the Macy name and its 230 stores, including Bullock's and I. Magnin in the West, were worth. Mr. Ullman, a member of the finance committee, and his team of negotiators and advisers sat silently on one side of the room ""looking like spanked children,"" according to one creditor. **********When the meetings were over, one crucial thing was clear: Mr. Tisch and his allies were not going to settle for any reorganization plan that valued Macy at  less than $4 billion, far more than the $3.3 billion valuation Fidelity and GE Capital had been discussing with Macy's management. **********""We had gone a long way toward a deal with the company,"" said Daniel Harmetz, who manages Fidelity's investment in Macy. ""That direction was changing. We knew walking out of there that we were not going to have the type of valuation of the plan we had been talking about."" **********But finding $4 billion worth of stock, cash and other securities to satisfy Macy's creditors was virtually impossible for the company on its own. Mr. Ullman's negotiating team had started with a $3.3 billion value, although company executives said their strategy was to first get the most powerful creditors on board and then nudge the valuation upward. **********Deep Pockets Needed **********And when Macy did present a rough draft of a plan, it had found $3.5 billion to dole out to creditors. But without a significant contribution from a deep-pocketed investor, only Federated or another large retailer able to find cost-saving efficiencies in a merger could afford to pay the price that the dissident directors were demanding. **********Federated entered the scene over the New Year's weekend with an announcement  that it had paid $449.3 million for a slice of Macy's senior debt -- and an influential role in its bankruptcy. **********""You had to scrape me off the ceiling after I heard the news,"" said Judy K. Mencher, Fidelity's lawyer. For nearly a year, she and Mr. Harmetz had talked to retailers, trying to drum up interest in a merger. **********Throughout January, creditors who had been frustrated by Macy's leisurely progression through bankruptcy waited anxiously for Federated to speed it up. But Ronald W. Tysoe, Federated's chief financial officer and negotiator in the Macy deal, played his cards within millimeters of his vest for the next four months, the first of several delays that most creditors believe ultimately cost  Federated at least $300 million extra. When Federated did introduce its first proposal in late April, creditors were disappointed. **********It valued Macy at $3.3 billion, less than Macy's $3.5 billion plan. Particularly concerning to creditors was Federated's stock price, which had slipped to about $21 from almost $25 in mid-March. Federated planned to use its  stock to pay off creditors, and they wanted guarantees against further drops in  its price. Bondholders Elbow In Three Plans Compete in Talks **********The Macy bondholders seemed like sure losers in Macy's and Federated's proposals. They had no collateral for their bonds and therefore had to get in line for a payout behind investors like Fidelity, which had claims secured by Macy stores and other assets. Their junior position gave them little leverage in the negotiations over Macy's future. And Mr. Miller, their lawyer, had used guerrilla tactics in past cases that had made an enemy of Judge Burton R. Lifland, the well-known Federal bankruptcy judge in Manhattan, who presides over the Macy case. **********Worried that both Macy and Federated would try to force the bondholders to accept whatever they wanted to give them, Mr. Miller uncharacteristically took the offensive. Instead of lobbing legal motions aimed at gumming up the proceedings, he offered a $3.3 billion reorganization plan that would fully repay the senior creditors with cash raised through selling bondholders the right to buy Macy stock at a certain price after it emerged from bankruptcy. That would give the bondholders, not senior creditors, the benefits of any later appreciation in Macy shares. **********Although little became of the bondholders' plan, it made them contenders because it called the senior creditors at their own game. **********""They wanted to give the company away at a very cheap value so they could profit later,"" Mr. Miller said. ""So we said, 'Fine, we'll buy it at that value,  but if its value increases, as we think it will, the additional value will go to us.' "" **********The three plans advanced to a two-week long mediation process, jokingly called Camp Mediation by the creditors' army of lawyers and bankers. The mediation was conducted by Cyrus R. Vance, the former Secretary of State whom Judge Lifland had appointed to sort out Macy's issues in late February. Mr. Vance's task was to see if one plan could gain sufficient backing from a consensus of Macy's creditors. **********Federated Makes a Move **********Federated broke out of the pack, raising its valuation to $3.742 billion, establishing a floor for its stock price to protect creditors against declines and offering handsome interest rates on the debt it would issue as part of its plan. The bottom line for senior creditors was: Federated's stock had a price every day on the Big Board, but Macy had no trading history and no one knew what it would be worth. **********""Once Federated decided to win at all costs that made the deal economic to it, Macy couldn't compete,"" said Henry D. Jackson of the Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment banking firm that represented Macy's suppliers, landlords and employees. **********Federated's negotiations during Camp Mediation won over Macy's senior creditors but fell short of enticing Mr. Miller and his clients, the bondholders. An hour before Mr. Vance was scheduled to meet with Judge Lifland to discuss the mediation efforts, Mr. Miller and his assistants assembled at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Mr. Vance's law firm, to seek a better return for his clients. After haggling for some time with Mr. Tysoe of Federated, Mr. Miller pushed a piece of yellow legal paper across the conference table with a number, $475 million, written on it. At the time, Federated valued its offer to the bondholders at $350 million. ""This is a one-day sale,"" Mr. Miller said he told Mr. Tysoe. ""Take it or leave it."" **********Mr. Miller went upstairs to a conference room to wait for Federated's reply.  About an hour later, Mr. Tysoe summoned him back downstairs and passed back a sheet of paper with $425 million written on it. ""Congratulations,"" Mr. Miller told Mr. Tysoe, as he wadded up the paper. ""You've just lost the company."" **********Federated Seeks Deal Restless Creditors Help Produce Sale **********Communication between the bondholders, who were the last creditors holding out for a stand-alone plan, and Federated dried up. On May 31, Allen I. Questrom, the chairman and chief executive of Federated, sought Mr. Tisch's counsel about how to jump-start discussions. Mr. Tisch told him to pay the bondholders. **********Mr. Questrom balked at the idea. He argued that Macy's offer to the bondholders was worth nowhere near the $525 million Mr. Miller contended. Why should Federated try to match it? **********But Macy had new troubles. Senior creditors were getting restless and threatening to go to court to terminate Macy's exclusive right to propose its reorganization plan first. Fidelity and others intended to tell Judge Lifland that they would not support Macy's plan and that, without their support, it would collapse. **********Proposing a Merger **********To head off a motion, Macy reluctantly agreed to meet for the first time with Federated officials to get a comprehensive description of Federated's merger plan. Mr. Ullman and his team raised objections and vowed to proceed with their own plan. **********Federated still had not taken Mr. Tisch's advice to sweeten its offer to the  bondholders. But after the Fourth of July weekend, Mr. Miller had a new client that also happened to be a Federated supporter -- Fidelity. Although its bonds did not give Fidelity enough of a stake in the junior debt to reverse opposition to Federated, they enabled Mr. Harmetz to get Mr. Miller and Mr. Tysoe of Federated talking again. ""We needed to get some movement going,"" Mr. Harmetz said. **********Sure enough, Mr. Tysoe and Mr. Miller buried the hatchet. Just hours before the board meeting on July 8, Thomas C. Shaw and James Kenney, the Macy executives charged with negotiating with creditors, were on the phone with the bondholders' representatives in a fruitless effort to maintain their allegiance  to Macy.  But Federated had hit the magic $475 million benchmark established during Camp Mediation. **********Faced with the prospect of going into court with a plan that no one supported, the directors delayed their vote. Then Mr. Ullman and his team began  hammering out a deal with Federated. And on July 14, the two long-time retailing rivals announced their intention to join together to create the country's largest department store operator."

The victim, An...",871,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Colombian Who Made World Cup Error Is Killed,Colombian Who Made World Cup Error Is Killed," **********A Colombian soccer player who accidentally scored into his own goal in a shocking World Cup loss to the United States team 10 days ago was killed by three unidentified gunmen this morning near the city of Medellin, the police said. **********The victim, Andres Escobar, returned to Colombia last Wednesday after his team, a favorite in the World Cup, was eliminated in the first round of the monthlong tournament being played in the United States. The police say Mr. Escobar was shot 12 times as he left a nightclub. **********Witnesses quoted in radio news reports said one of the gunmen shouted, ""Goal, Goal"" as he fired each shot.  Mr. Escobar, 27, died shortly afterward in a Medellin hospital. **********The police have detained a man in connection with the murder and are looking for others. Tonight, Medellin city officials imposed a 24-hour ban on alcohol consumption, a typical measure taken in Colombia to prevent further outbreaks of violence. **********Mr. Escobar, a defender, accidentally sent the ball into his own goal as he attempted to deflect a pass by a United States attacker during a June 22 match in Pasadena, Calif. The goal gave the Americans a 1-0 lead, and they went on to win, 2-1, for their first victory in the World Cup in 44 years. **********The defeat was stunning for a nation of passionate soccer fans. ""Humiliated by the United States,"" headlined the newspaper La Prensa. Colombia, which had already lost to Romania, ended the first round with a victory over Switzerland, but still became the first team to be eliminated from the 24-team field. **********John Harkes, the United States midfielder who made the crossing pass that Escobar put into his own net, said: ""It's tragic to think that someone's life is at stake in a game. All I can say is, the players are sad, and our hearts and prayers go out to his family and his teammates on the Colombian side."" **********Mr. Escobar's killing was the World Cup's second shock in 48 hours. On Thursday, Diego Maradona, the Argentine superstar, was thrown out of the tournament after testing positive for banned stimulants. **********A moment of silence was observed for Escobar today before today's two second-round games, Germany versus Belgium in Chicago and Mexico versus Switzerland in Washington. **********Joseph S. (Sepp) Blatter, general secretary for FIFA, soccer's governing body, said: ""This is the saddest day I have ever witnessed in football, in a World Cup or any other competition. If something happens by accident, you can say it was the will of God. But when people deliberately shoot and kill somebody because he made a mistake in the game, something is wrong."" **********The day the team played against the United States, the coach, Francisco Maturana, his assistant, Hernan Dario Gomez, and a player, Carlos Jaime Gomez, received death threats against their families in Colombia by fax in California. **********The threats demanded that Jaime Gomez, the brother of the assistant coach, be withdrawn from the team. Hours later, Mr. Gomez was replaced by Herman Gaviria for the loss against the United States. The next day, Mr. Gomez announced his retirement as a player. **********Mr. Maturana, who was visibly shaken by the death threats, later angrily blamed Colombian radio journalists for fostering violence by making inflammatory remarks about the team. The coach forbade the team to grant interviews to three radio journalists. Mr. Maturana resigned after the first round ended. **********At the time of the threats, there was speculation here that drug traffickers in the city of Cali, who had placed large bets on Colombia's success in the World Cup, were unhappy with the team's performance. **********Colombians were shocked and surprised by the news of Mr. Escobar's death. President Cesar Gaviria asked citizens to ""reflect on the necessity of recovering a climate of tolerance and dialogue."" **********Andres Cavelier, a Colombian journalist covering the World Cup for the Bogota daily El Tiempo, said: ""People think we are used to this sort of thing because of all the talk of drug cartels, but we are not. This is such a shock."" **********In the months leading up to the World Cup, Colombia had lost only 1 of the 21 exhibition matches it played. Mr. Escobar, an outspoken and friendly player whose articles on soccer were often published in El Tiempo, wrote shortly before the World Cup began that ""Our success lies in our sense of togetherness."" **********But following its first-round losses, the president of the Colombian soccer federation, Juan Jose Bellini, said that some players were ""conceited"" and ""disdainful"" and were ""not worthy of wearing the national uniform."" **********The accidental goal aside, Mr. Escobar won praise as one of the few members of the team who generally played well during the World Cup and maintained his composure. **********The player's body lay in state in an open coliseum in Medellin today, and Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos called on his citizens to attend the funeral on Sunday as a show of support. The police increased security to protect other team members. **********In one of the last interviews he gave as he returned to Colombia, Mr. Escobar had summed up his team's performance and added: ""There were bad moments, but there persists the satisfaction that one finds support from people, although others do not want to know you."""

Gray 3d, and the announcement that refugee processing centers would be created on ships and in third countries. A few days before, the United States spearheaded a campaign in the Security Council to impose a near-total trade embargo on Haiti that is due to take effect on Saturday. **********But the policy has been slow in getting under way, and critics of the Administration have charged that Mr. Clinton was responding to domestic political pressure in changing the Haiti policy and has no comprehensive plan to restore to power Haiti's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. **********Administration officials stress that it will take some time for the tightened sanctions, which include a ban on noncommercial flights, to be fully carried out and effective. **********""The U.N. sanctions that have been adopted are a strong expression of the international community's commitment to restoring democracy,"" Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser, said in a telephone interview. ""Our envoy, Bill Gray, has hit the ground running. We're moving ahead on changes in our refugee policy as quickly as possible. The President said it would take some weeks. There are no surprises here."" **********Among the indicators of a less than a smooth start, however, is the fact that Mr. Gray, the new special envoy and the former head of the Congressional Black caucus, has yet to meet Father Aristide or even to talk to him on the telephone, although both men were in South Africa last week for the inauguration of Nelson Mandela. **********Mr. Gray said that he first tried to call Father Aristide upon his return. ""He was not in when I tried to call him,"" Mr. Gray said in a telephone interview today. ""No one answered the phone over the weekend. It's nothing but a little telephone tag. We're close to having a meeting set up, hopefully by the end of this week. It will be a courtesy call."" **********Another problem has been the failure of the Clinton Administration to convince any other country to process potential Haitian refugees on their soil or to grant political asylum to more refugees. **********President Clinton telephoned Prime Minister John Major of Britain on Monday to ask that the island group of Turks and Caicos, a British dependent territory, be used for processing refugees. Mr. Major replied politely that in principle he would like to help, but made no commitment, senior White House officials said. **********Similarly, Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative at the United Nations, asked Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien in Ottawa last week whether Canada would be prepared to take more Haitian refugees. ""We noted our interest in cooperating, but gave no commitment or immediate answer,"" a senior Canadian official said of the request. **********There have also been problems in enforcing the economic isolation. Despite embarrassing violations of existing sanctions by the Dominican Republic, through which fuel is routinely smuggled across the border into Haiti, the United States has no intention of threatening its Government with economic sanctions or reducing its sugar quota to the United States. Dominican Disdain **********Joaquin Balaguer, who was narrowly leading today in his bid for re-election as the Dominican President, has made no secret of his disdain for Father Aristide and has been criticized by the Clinton Administration for not cooperating with the sanctions against Haiti. **********Defending the idea of not confronting the Dominican Republic, Mr. Gray said, ""This is not the time to make threats against the Dominican Republic, but the time to work with them to solve some of their problems."" **********Although Mr. Clinton and his top aides have said publicly that the trade embargo is intended to send a message to Haiti's ruling junta that it must step aside, senior officials in the White House, State Department and Pentagon say in private that they doubt the strategy will work. **********Far from quieting Congressional criticism of the Administration's policy, the new initiative has generated more calls for a military invasion of Haiti. Except for English-speaking Caribbean countries and Argentina, however, other governments in the hemisphere have expressed opposition to military action. **********France and Canada also said last week they would not support or participate in an American-led invasion. Speculation on Invasion **********But the difficulties with the Administration's policy have fueled speculation both inside and outside the Administration that the United States is moving inexorably to an invasion of Haiti to oust the junta by force. **********""There is no hope for Haiti without an immediate military intervention,"" said Robert I. Rotberg, president of the World Peace Foundation and author of a book on Haitian history. ""The policy is one of a big voice without a big stick. Teddy Roosevelt must be turning in his grave."" **********As for the delays in permitting some Haitian refugees to enter the United States, senior White House officials said that it will take ""some weeks"" before American immigration authorities can begin shipboard interviews of potential political refugees fleeing Haiti. **********Word of the delay was conveyed by senior White House officials to more than 100 representatives of refugee and human rights organizations in a stormy meeting last Friday. Until the new policy is under way, the Coast Guard will continue to send back Haitians caught trying to flee by sea, as it did with 341 Haitians on Monday. **********The Administration still has not decided how it will conduct shipboard interviews or whether it will allow Haitians to have legal counsel. **********The head of the lobbying group TransAfrica, Randall Robinson, whose hunger strike helped push the Administration into changing its Haiti policy, said that he is organizing scores of lawyers to work on a voluntary basis to help insure that Haitians have private legal counsel. Restrictions on Applications **********For the moment, the Administration will not change the way it allows Haitians to apply for refugee status inside Haiti. Under new restrictions put in place in February, Haitians cannot even gain an interview with an American immigration official until they fill out a written questionnaire and qualify under a specific category. These are the categories: ***********Senior or mid-level officials in Father Aristide's ousted government; ***********Close associates of Father Aristide; ***********Journalists, educators and other political figures who have experienced significant and persistent harassment; ***********Unspecified ""others"" in whom the United States has an interest and who are in immediate danger. **********One problem with such restrictive procedures is that applying for asylum inside Haiti is potentially dangerous for the applicant. In Port-au-Prince, for example, the refugee processing center is housed in an open area of the Rex Theater, where applicants can be seen by passers-by. **********Mr. Gray stressed that the new Administration policy needed time to work and that other changes might be made along the way. **********The person who feels most strongly about not tampering any further with the refugee policy is Secretary of State Warren Christopher, senior Administration officials said. **********It was he who argued -- unsuccessfully and without the support of other national security advisers -- in the weeks before the policy shift that the United States should do nothing to change its policy of forcibly repatriating Haitians fleeing by boat. He warned that it would trigger a new flood of refugees, many of whom might die at sea."

Gray 3d, the Administration's special envoy to Haiti, told the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros-Boutros Ghali, on Wednesday that the United States had so far obtained only agreements in principle -- and no formal commitments -- from other countries to provide 2,000 to 3,000 people, senior Administration and United Nations officials said. **********The peacekeeping force the Administration envisioned has been scaled back in recent days to about 9,000 to 12,000 military and civilian personnel from the original 12,000 to 14,000, and the United States is counting on at least half coming from other countries, the officials said. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali wants the United States contribution to be no more than one-third, because Haiti falls within the unwritten rule of ""sphere of influence peacekeeping,"" which requires the dominant power in the region to play a less than dominant role in peacekeeping. **********A joint State and Defense Department team is currently on a private mission to well over a dozen countries in the hemisphere, trying to drum up support for the force. But countries are reluctant because the United States will not say whether it intends to oust the Haitian military government by force. **********The Administration renewed efforts to arrange safe haven for 10,000 Haitians in Panama, a plan that Panama tentatively embraced, then publicly rejected on Thursday. **********Sol M. Linowitz, the Washington lawyer and a negotiator of the Panama Canal Treaty, will meet this weekend with President Guillermo Endara of Panama in an effort to persuade him to change his mind, a senior Administration official said. **********The official said that Michael Kozak, a veteran foreign officer with experience in Panamanian affairs, may also be sent to Panama to press the case. **********Panama's decision to withdraw the offer of safe havens has worsened a refugee policy in which the United States seemed to be lurching from one short-term solution to another, creating new problems that in turn require new quick fixes. **********In Port-au-Prince, the United States Embassy spokesman, Stanley Schrager, said today that Coast Guard cutters and Navy warships have no place to put many of the Haitians who have poured out of the country since Monday and cannot take others who may be in distress. System Overload **********""Clearly the system is overloaded,"" Mr. Schrager said. ""There are tremendous strains on the system. We have an obligation to provide save haven for these people. I can't say when the system cracks."" **********A Coast Guard statement called the last four days ""the busiest period in Coast Guard history."" **********The recent refugee crisis began about three weeks ago when a new program began to guarantee Haitian asylum-seekers hearings at offshore processing centers. **********Since July 1, more than 12,300 Haitians have been picked up from boats, 1,066 of them today. **********Stunned by the high number, the Administration announced on Tuesday that only Haitians who apply for asylum at one of three United States processing centers inside Haiti will have a chance to resettle in the United States, and that those intercepted at sea would be sent to third countries if they feared retaliation if they are returned. **********Representative Kweisi Mfume, the Maryland Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, characterized the Clinton approach to Haiti as a ""policy of anarchy"" that was moving the United States to an invasion of Haiti. ""With each new failure we move closer to direct military intervention,"" he said at a news conference. ""The worst kind of military intervention is the one that was avoidable."" **********Meanwhile, Gen. John Shalikasvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefly visited the United States Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba today after a decision to increase its capacity for housing Haitian boat people to 20,000 or more.  Getting It in Writing **********To avoid a repetition of the Panama debacle, officials flew today to the Caribbean to press Grenada, Antigua and Dominica to sign agreements to use their territories as safe havens, senior Administration officials said.  Another team will head to Costa Rica to press its Government to create a safe area there. **********The American announcement that the United States will no longer allow Haitians to resettle on American territory also has caused confusion among some allies. **********Britain asked the State Department for clarification earlier this week of an agreement Washington signed with the British territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands for the use of Grand Turk Island. Beginning next week, the island was supposed to be used as a reprocessing center for Haitians who would eventually be allowed to settle in the United States, which is no longer possible. **********The British are not inclined to change the terms of the agreement and make the island a safe haven, but the State Department has not responded, British officials said. Placing the Blame **********Senior Pentagon officials today were blaming the White House and State Department for failing to arrive at a formal refugee agreement with Panama before making it public. **********Other senior officials have complained that the policy is less than smooth because Mr. Gray has other professional commitments. He is president of the United Negro College Fund. **********In Naples, where he is attending the annual summit meeting of the seven leading industrial nations, President Clinton repeatedly sidestepped questions about a possible invasion, saying only that ""my position has not changed."" **********He added, ""I think the conduct of the military leaders will have more than anything else to do with what options are considered, and their conduct has not been good."" **********The ad hoc nature of the Haiti policy was captured in a statement by a senior Defense Department official today: ""Nothing happens until the President gets back from Europe."" **********The official added that by increasing the capacity of Guantanamo, ""We'll be good through the middle of next week. But is this a sustainable policy? No."""

But if nothing else, the $3 million campaign by Romann & Tannenholz Advertising of New York at least acknowledges that flying is, more often than not, annoying. **********That is somewhat unusual, given the more common who's-kidding-whom feel of many airline advertisements, like a recent American Airlines print ad showing an empty Adirondack chair overlooking a still lake -- just like a typical contemplative flight -- and those ubiquitous ads that trumpet low fares in large print, noting elsewhere that these are one-way fares based on round-trip purchase. **********""Flying itself has become a hassle, and whenever you want a low fare, there are so many restrictions,"" Gad Romann, creative director for Romann & Tannenholz, said. **********This common complaint about flying became the core idea behind the three print and two television ads that broke late last year for Ultrair, which flies from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale for $129 one way. **********In each execution, the ads try to strike an empathetic but playful chord with travelers, suggesting that Ultrair understands that its customers would generally rather be doing something else than flying. **********To be sure, this is not the first airline or transportation company to take this tack. In fact, similar attempts by Continental and Thrifty Rent-A-Car make this theme a veritable trend-in-training. **********When Thrifty started trying to carbonate its corporate culture more than a year ago, it introduced gimmicks like Smile Day, challenging its franchisees to make sure every customer smiled at least once. They tried buttons that read, ""Smile. Isn't Traveling Fun?"" On Tax Day, they wore T-shirts that said, ""I love the I.R.S. like I love slamming my finger in the car door."" **********Continental Airlines started a new ""Peanuts Fares"" service in October that combines high-frequency service and low fares in 20 cities. The largest letters in many print ads boast of ""No Restrictions,"" as if readers will heave a sigh of relief over this rare simplicity. **********In its ads, Ultrair goes a full step further with such lines as ""No advance purchase (what soon-to-be-tossed-out bureaucrat ever thought of that?)"" **********And this: ""We don't like airline food any more than you do. So we're not serving any. Airline food, that is. You see, most other airlines think they're gourmet restaurants in the sky. Who are they kidding? Not even a chef with Einstein brains can correct airline food."" **********In one television spot, an Ultrair ticket flies out of a bird cage to drive home the point that the carrier has freed its tickets of restrictions. **********At first blush, Ultrair's promise of offering service that won't annoy passengers seems bold and a little unwise. After all, there are many factors beyond an airline's control, like delays, that make passengers fume. **********Not to worry, Mr. Romann said. ""I believe that consumers make a very clear distinction between what is the airline's fault and what is not the airline's fault,"" he said. **********But wait just a second. What's this asterisk next to the ads' claim that the carrier is ""virtually free of all restrictions*""? Follow that down to the bottom of the poster, and we see . . . Aha! Potentially annoying fine print. Charges for changing tickets, charges for refunds, immediate ticket purchase required, and other charges and surcharges where applicable. **********But these, too, are apparently beyond the control of the airline, and Ultrair figures that passengers will understand that such details are the work of lawyers. And besides, Ultrair never said it would eliminate all annoyances, just that it would be the least annoying airline."

But gross margins fell in the quarter, and Mr. Meredith said he expected that there would likely be some pressure on gross margins in the third quarter. **********Dell, based in Austin, Tex., typically has strong sales to Government customers in the third quarter, in which the Federal fiscal year begins, but those sales have lower profit margins than sales to commercial customers. **********Revenues doubled for the notebook computer line in the most recent quarter. Earlier this month, Dell began shipping two new company-designed notebook computers, marking its re-entry into the laptop category nearly a year after withdrawing from the market. **********Dell, which has been trying to gain an early lead in the market for computers based on Intel's fast Pentium microprocessor, also said that sales of Pentium-based systems represented 24 percent of its systems revenues during the quarter.

The most prominent of these could be the Federal Reserve Board - whose credibility as a vigilante against inflation may be sorely tested. **********The main problem for the Fed is timing. The bankruptcy comes at an awkward period: The preparation of end-year accounts always leads to a rundown in activity, draining liquidity from markets and therefore creating conditions for highly volatile price movements. **********U.S. bond and stock prices ended a jittery week on a calm note, but fears are high that this could be the false calm before a storm. **********The immediate threat is this week's report on November inflation, with the producer price index to be announced Tuesday and the consumer price index the following day. **********""The numbers are likely to be on the high side,"" says Walter M. Cadette at J.P. Morgan. The expected 0.6 percent rise in the core producer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, will not be much of a shock following a 0.5 percent drop a month ago, he says. But he anticipates that the price for intermediate goods, which has been rising at an annual rate of 6.25 percent over the past six months, will register another sharp gain. In addition, the expected 0.4 percent rise in core consumer prices ""could well raise eyebrows."" **********The view at Morgan is that while the level of inflation may not be troubling, the direction is alarming. ""With economic growth likely to remain rapid and operating rates headed higher, pressures on prices should build."" **********Assuming the estimates are correct, the question then is whether the Fed raises interest rates again in December after the unexpectedly large 3/4-percentage-point rise last month or whether it decides to postpone the move until the end of January. **********A December rise, in thin markets, might lead to a sell-off in the bond market, adding to the distress of others like Orange County who speculated on interest rate movements in the derivatives market. But a delay until next year, if an increase is warranted, could undermine confidence in the Fed. **********The betting at Morgan is that the Fed will probably refrain from acting Dec. 20, when the policy-making Open Market Committee next meets, ""partly in recognition of the thinness of the markets at the end of the year."" **********But European analysts fear that a delay in the Fed's response to unfavorable inflation data could damage its credibility and create a tumult in financial markets that it was trying to avert. **********Both the currency and the U.S. bond markets are at risk from any sign that the Fed is becoming more circumspect in restraining inflation, warn bankers at S.G. Warburg in London and BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. **********The official view, as expressed in a report prepared by central bankers from the Group of Ten and released last week by the Bank for International Settlements, is that: **********""At times there may be a short-term conflict between the policy requirements of maintaining low inflation and the policy stance that might seem appropriate in the light of asset price considerations. However, there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by allowing monetary policy to deviate from a course consistent with price stability."" **********Another focus of international interest is what the Japanese are up to. The dollar remains above 100 yen, confirming its recent recovery, and data for October showed a $10-billion increase in foreign bond purchases, suggesting that capital has again started to flow out of Japan. **********But Jim O'Neill at Swiss Bank Corp. in London, warns that the report is ""highly misleading"" because it includes Japanese purchases of Euroyen bonds. ""Japanese investors remain remarkably loath to take any foreign exchange risk,"" he insists. **********Even Japanese bankers, who were lead managers in $850 million of the $2.3 billion worth of fixed-coupon Eurodollar bonds issued last week, acknowledge that it is premature to suggest Japanese investors are looking at foreign currency bonds. **********Argentina, which just raised 15 billion yen, is scheduled this week to make its maiden entry into the Eurofranc market with the sale of 1 billion French francs of three-year notes. **********South Africa, which last week reentered the dollar market with a global offering of $750 million of five-year notes, is expected early next year to issue securities in Japan to raise 50 billion yen."

Then came President Carlos Saul Menem, who since his election in 1989 has stabilized the economy and sold off most state-owned utilities and services. **********Mr. Menem believed that privatization would improve life in this city. But the experiences of a visiting banking executive from England belie this confidence. **********When he arrived here recently, Stephen Price, a vice president for an international banking company, said he looked at the stately French architecture, broad avenues, elegant restaurants, serene parks and stylish residents and said he was impressed with ""how urbane, how first-world"" this city seemed. **********But after he lost important data twice on his laptop computer during power failures and missed two meetings because telephone lines were not working, he was complaining instead about the city's dilapidated infrastructure and poor services. **********Power failures are still common; the telephone system often shuts down during rainstorms; checks are routinely stolen from the mail, and mail is frequently delivered months late or not at all. **********Sidewalks and streets are filthy and seem to be in an eternal state of disrepair. People do not think twice about throwing trash into the street, and they do not curb their dogs. **********Carlos E. Zanero Fidalgo, an engineering professor at the University of Belgrano here, said that the infrastructure has been overwhelmed by the large-scale migration of people from the countryside over the last 40 years into the Buenos Aires area, where about one-third of Argentina's 33.5 million people live. The city has not kept pace with the need, he said, and state-owned utilities are not responsive to consumer complaints. **********While almost everyone agrees that the telephone system has improved since privatization four years ago, it remains unreliable. When it rains, many telephone lines go out of order for hours or even days, with no explanation from the phone company except that the system is old. **********Rain also knocks out underground power lines. Fed up with frequent power blackouts in their neighborhood, residents of the fashionable Recoleta section recently hung a banner at a major intersection that read: ""Segba: Return. We Forgive You,"" referring to the old state power company that has been privatized. **********The postal service is so unreliable that most businesses use expensive courier and private mail services for local deliveries. Sending a letter across town by courier costs about $3.50, compared with 70 cents through the public system. **********""Argentina has first-world tendencies and goals, and that's one way of defining a first-world country,"" said Felipe Noguera, a noted political consultant and pollster here. ""But what's clear when you arrive here is that some of these goals have been achieved and others not. The question is whether Argentines will be complacent and explain away their faults or do something about them."" **********With privatization, Mr. Zanero says he is optimistic that things will soon improve. ""It's a lot easier to destroy than it is to build,"" he said. ""But I believe the average Argentine is starting to expect more and demand more, and hopefully will get more."""

Albright, said on Sunday that although the United States had urged other countries to support the tribunal's efforts, response ""has been spotty"" so far. **********The Netherlands has been very forthcoming, she said, agreeing to pay security and other costs. But Ms. Albright said ""other governments have held back,"" refusing to hand over information or to allow investigators to interview refugees. **********Antonio Cassese of Italy, the president of the tribunal, said in an interview that he planned to start trials in June or July, three months after the chief prosecutor, Ramon Escovar-Salom, a former Attorney General of Venezuela, begins assembling evidence. **********The United Nations has cut back the tribunal's requested budget for the next two years to $22 million, from $33 million, because it did not think trials could start before mid-1995. ""But we disagree,"" Judge Cassese said. ""We plan to start in June or July this year."" **********The judge, a former professor of international law at Florence University, said potential war criminals and witnesses to testify against them could be found among the hundreds of thousands who have fled what was Yugoslavia. ""There is plenty of evidence to be collected outside Yugoslavia,"" he said. **********But he warned that his hopes of starting work this summer could be frustrated by the budget cuts because he may not have enough money to engage lawyers to defend the accused. **********Much skepticism greeted the Security Council's decision to set up a Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal last year, with critics saying it would never try anybody because it must rely on having governments arrest suspects. **********Ms. Albright said Washington had declassified more than 1,000 pages of evidence collected since last June and would shortly give the documents to prosecutors. **********The first batch of evidence, which relates to atrocities reportedly committed in several Serb-run camps and in one Bosnian-run camp in the Prijedor and Brcko areas, includes a diagram of the staff at Omarska, a Serb-run camp where hundreds of Bosnians are believed to have perished. **********The documents identify the camp commandant and his assistants, the interrogators and the three teams of guards.

That 15-year-old protest group showed its considerable power last year by sparking a national protest that caused the Government to suspend the levying of examination fees on students. **********More worrisome measures of the galvanized young include roles as armed vigilantes protecting the black squatter camps and segregated townships long written off by the apartheid Government. **********Even more problematic, student groups across years of liberation struggle have taken control of many schools in the black communities, compounding the education challenge in post-apartheid South Africa. **********With close to half of the population under 18, the youth issue is such a key to the nation's future that Nelson Mandela, the liberation patriarch expected to be the first black President, has promised to a create a Cabinet-level ministry for youth and to seek a lowering of the voting age to 16 early in the new administration. **********""Schools have become power blocs,"" said S.D. Pilane, principal of Tebo High School in Soweto, the historic cradle of the black student movement, where youths first died in standing up to apartheid. ""Students realize the role they have played. A future government will not be able to sideline them."" **********But he said he found the students' usurpation of his role a healthy thing, on balance, in bringing ""discipline and efficiency"" to a school that long suffered academically as Government resources were earmarked for white schools. Compromise on Voting Age **********Wary in the face of the many political prodigies used to massing in his behalf outside the classroom, Mr. Mandela nevertheless accepted 18 as the voting age as part of a package of transition compromises. **********He did so even though he and other liberation fighters thought the ballot age should have been set as low as 14 because of the power, frustrations and hard-earned maturity of this huge swath of the population. **********""This is a big worry for us,"" conceded Parks Mankhalana, an executive of the African National Congress Youth League, the heart of the teen-age cadre that generated so much pressure in behalf of Mr. Mandela's cause and now must reshape its role at a time of great expectations, alarming social violence and low school attendance. **********""The lack of character in the learning process these days -- students not showing up, teachers on strike and all,"" Mr. Mankhalana said. ""There's disintegration of the social fabric, the violence, the squalor in the squatter camps. It doesn't take the young long to protest about real problems and disrupt anything when they want to."" **********At the same time, he said, most of the youth leaders have been accepting the transition to the new, non-disruptive politics of compromise. Social statistics show a majority of youth hoping for progress and stability and hardly playing the dominant role in violent protest. **********But youth-group feuds that shut schools and lead to beatings and homicides are a staple of anxious news stories about the future. Considering such embarrassing abuses of freedom, some veterans of the cause sound almost nostalgic about the showdown days in the streets when students focused on demanding ""liberation before education.""  'They Don't Understand Why' **********""Before, they were politically clear and ideologically ripe,"" said Phillip Matsebe, political education officer with the Pan African Congress. ""Now they just go with the wind. They don't understand why they are doing it."" **********Similar concern is voiced by Zakes Molotsi, a veteran of the armed wing of Mr. Mandela's African National Congress. ""Those under 18 now have a different level of involvement,"" he said. ""Now they just react, throw stones. Before, they had political education, maturity."" **********These generalities are challenged by young people themselves who are active by the tens of thousands in a spectrum of political and student organizations. **********""We are angry about the voting age,"" said Peter Mphikeleli, 15, a member of the youth wing of the Pan African Congress. ""But young people know we must be patient. A majority of us are militant in some way, but we must take a back seat right now to see whether all those election promises of reform can be met."" **********A colleague, Mlamle Mothe, 16, said the nation's youth could easily return to high-disruption ways, but would do so based on issues, not emotions and restlessness. ""Without land reform, we can't start out fresh,"" he said by way of example. ""And that is what the youth are watching for, the issue our forefathers struggled for in the three centuries since the land was first taken from us."" More Pessimism Than Rage **********As the vote approaches, there is much talk about the young as a ""lost"" generation threatening civil order. But David Everatt, a social scientist who conducted a lengthy study of 2,200 younger South Africans of all ethnic groups, has measured a more complex and profound alienation. **********A tendency toward pessimism, not violence, among those 16 to 30 is the main problem Mr. Mandela will have to reverse, the study, conducted by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry, concluded. It found the outlook particularly bleak among young blacks. Only 3 in 20 have primary educations; almost 3 in 5 are unemployed, and only 1 in 5 rate themselves as fully engaged with society. **********Thabiso Mohluko, 20, a black youth worker who was first arrested at 13 as a Soweto school protester, said the new politics, like the old, would be driven by the severity of life's conditions and the responsiveness of government, whether black or white."

Has the West won for good? Four and a half years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is becoming fashionable in American academic circles - though not yet political circles - to critique the West's strengths and weaknesses in the aftermath of its Cold War victory. **********The agonizing over American decline that marked the late 1980s has long gone. So has the ""end-of-history"" triumphalism of the early 1990s. Now the more sober question is whether Western free-market democracy is in good enough shape to establish itself more or less worldwide, under American leadership. **********Will the West split into warring camps now that there is no common external threat from communism, and nationalism appears to be on the rise? **********Will Western free-market principles govern the global economy, or will they be eclipsed by new philosophies, perhaps based in Asia? What does the West need to do to ensure that its interests will prevail? **********A debate conducted in the New York-based World Policy Journal is producing spirited exchanges between optimists and pessimists about the West's future. **********On the optimistic side, Daniel Deudney and C. John Ikenberry, both of the University of Pennsylvania, argue for the resilience of the West's common values, backed up by international institutions ranging from NATO to the International Monetary Fund. **********At the other extreme, Bruce Cumings of the University of Chicago says there is a risk that ""the West becomes a beleaguered island in a non-Western sea, and hopes for an era of peace collapse."" **********This is the kind of debate that ought to have happened when President George Bush announced a New World Order without doing anything to make it come about. Now at least some members of President Bill Clinton's administration are asking the questions, even if they have only partial answers. **********One such is the proposal by the national security adviser, W. Anthony Lake, that the Cold War strategy of containment be replaced by one of enlargement of the community of free-market democracies. **********That community, of course, is not monolithic. The brands of capitalism practiced by, say, the United States, France and Japan, the West's only honorary Asian member, are quite different - and the differences look sharper now that communism has been defeated. **********Germany and Japan are increasingly flexing their muscles to assert their own interests over those of their partners. **********There is a growing recognition, even inside the U.S. administration, that Asian values will play a greater role in the management of the global economy - although that role is as yet undefined. **********It is obvious that the balance of world economic power is shifting against the West, and other countries are demonstrating that Western-style democracy is not always a prerequisite for economy success. **********As Mr. Cumings points out, in the past 25 years capitalism has flourished under East Asian regimes that have been highly authoritarian. **********Meanwhile, much of the democratic West is bogged down with slow growth and, especially in Europe, heavy and debilitating unemployment. The United States, while growing faster, faces horrific social problems, to which its economic and political system is still far from producing answers. **********But the West is nevertheless trying to expand, through the North American Free Trade Area in North, Central and soon South America, and, in Europe, through the incorporation of Central and Eastern Europe into the Western fold. The first developing country, Mexico, is about to be admitted into one of the West's most exclusive clubs, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. **********The optimists argue that despite its apparent divisions the West, including Japan, is in fact becoming more homogeneous as its economies and political systems intertwine, and more firmly fixed on the path of peace. Even if three major economic blocs emerge in America, Europe and Asia, they do not necessarily have to fight one another. **********Mr. Lake's enlargement doctrine is at least a start, even if it is unclear how it changes an ything in practice. Much more thought needs to be given to its implementation. The world is not yet safe for capitalism or democracy. **********In the words of Sir Michael Howard, formerly of Yale and Oxford universities, ""the failure of rival creeds does not mean that our own is bound to succeed, only that it has been given another chance."""

It has not turned out that way. **********In the aftermath of Monday's announcement that BMW would buy 80 percent of Rover, Honda Motor Co., which owns the other 20 percent of the British company's car operations, is left with the embarrassing task of scrambling to pick up the pieces of its European strategy. Honda is not alone. **********Nissan Motor Co., the Japanese car company with the biggest investment in Europe, had a loss of £200 million ($300 million) in its Spanish operations last year and may yet post a small loss for the year in its far larger plant in Britain. Instead of taking the European market by storm from its state-of-the-art manufacturing base in Sunderland, Nissan has had to scale back its production schedules. **********Nissan turned out 246,000 cars last year, below its target of 270,000. A spokesman said that this year output could fall to as little as 200,000 units. **********Suddenly the Japanese are looking vulnerable. Specialists long accustomed to talking in reverential tones of the world's most efficient auto manufacturers are suddenly finding myriad reasons to fault their strategies. **********""They all aimed at the same segment of the market,"" said Garel Rhys, an auto industry expert at Cardiff Business School. He also noted that the Europeans who still dominate that segment for upper mid-sized cars, ""are doing anything but rolling over and dying."" **********Into that crowded European market niche, the Japanese are pouring Honda Accords, Toyota Carinas and Nissan Primeras to compete with such strong indigenous offerings as the Citroën Xantia, Ford Mondeo and Volkswagen Passat. **********Just as the Japanese have geared up their assault, the European market has hit its worst sales slump since World War II. While the Japanese companies as a whole outperformed the market by posting a 13 percent slide in sales last year, compared with 15 percent for the overall industry in Europemarket as a whole, that slide comes on a low base, one upon which the Japanese had expected to rapidly expand. **********""It is certainly a huge disappointment for them,"" said Karl E. Ludvigsen, a former Ford Motor Co. executive who runs an auto industry consultancy. ""They have taken all the trouble to put plants in Europe and they have now stumbled badly."" **********Analysts say a large part of the problem arises from events in Japan and the United States. In Japan, car sales have been falling for two years; in America, the Japanese market share, after years of rapid growth, is now in decline in the face of strong competition from the American Big Three producers. **********""The Japanese are under huge pressure to price their cars here as high as possible to be able to send profits back home,"" Mr. Ludvigsen said. **********That desperation has deprived the Japanese of the tool of new market entrants everywhere - aggressively undercutting the entrenched players on price in order to build up market share. **********Pointing to the depressed state of the European auto market and predictions of more to come, a Nissan spokesman, Daniel Ward, conceded: ""Our plan to achieve production in Britain of 300,000 cars has been put back a year or two."" **********For Honda, which makes 50,000 cars a year at its British plant, and Toyota, which makes 100,000 units annually in Britain, the needed economies of scale are even further off. John Lawson, an auto analyst at DRI/McGraw Hill, estimated that manufacturers need to turn out close to 200,000 cars to begin to hit maximum efficiencies. **********A Honda spokesman, Graeme Holt, noted that his company had benefited from its close collaboration with Rover, whose 200 and 600 models differ from the Honda Concerto and Accord, respectively, only in their external styling. Those models have combined sales of roughly 300,000. Mr. Holt expressed pessimism about the future of that relationship, however, despite its essential economies of scale. ""We do not want to have a collaborative agreement with BMW,"" he said. **********The relatively puny production runs of the Japanese manufacturers in Europe also make it costly for them to introduce new engines or styling to freshen up a model's image - and sales - midway through its normal four- or five-year life span. **********Mr. Lawson said the Japanese also erred by underestimating the political obstacles they faced in Europe. ""They had assumed free access to European markets for cars made in the U.K.,"" he noted. While the agreement limiting Japanese auto imports to the European Union until the turn of the century does not cover those European-built cars, the reality is that in France and Italy the Japanese have been forced to tread very carefully."

Should the start-up succeed, Japan's biggest computer company will consider acquiring the shares at a huge mark-up, making the founder very rich. If the venture fails, all bets are off. **********The idea is that new ventures are more likely to succeed if the entrepreneur works outside the parent organization, pursuing a high-risk strategy in hopes of high returns. Similar tactics have been tried by U.S. companies, most notably Apple Computer Inc., whose employees spawned General Magic, the California concern whose software is expected to play a major role in multimedia applications. Apple itself began as a start-up, going from a two-man show to a Fortune 500 company in just six years. **********But the move is unusual for a big Japanese company such as Fujitsu, which each year over the past decades has recruited hundreds of Japan's best, in part because it offers secure lifetime employment. In asking the most entrepreneurial to go it alone, Fujitsu is acknowledging that an organizational hierarchy designed to foster discipline and loyalty, highly effective when Japan was playing catch-up with the West, has its limitations now that the country must compete through innovation and speed. **********""In terms of technology and human resources, Fujitsu's a super company, but they need radical organizational innovation,"" said Seiichiro Yonekura, an associate professor at Hitotsubashi University's Institute of Business Research. ""This is a good first step, but only the first step."" **********Next month, when the plan begins, Fujitsu hopes to approve five to 10 projects, most likely in areas related to multimedia. Already, more than 200 of Fujitsu's 68,000 employees have shown interest in the program, which was announced Monday, the 59th anniversary of the company's founding. **********Other Japanese companies, equally deep in talented but stifled employees and advanced but unexploited technologies, may emulate Fujitsu's approach. But not until Japan undertakes deeper deregulation of its capital markets and corporate laws will the world's biggest creditor country be able to exploit venture capitalism to the extent seen in the United States. **********The biggest obstacle is strict Finance Ministry criteria for listing shares on Japan's stock markets. Designed to protect investors from losses, the regulations mean that it often takes nearly two decades before a new venture can go public, depriving potential investors of quick returns and a big incentive to risk capital. **********The result is that investments in start-up companies in Japan are dominated by a handful of big companies, themselves controlled by large, conservative concerns mainly in banking, insurance and securities. Start-ups often struggle for years before capital becomes available. ""Large banks and securities companies have money, but they don't know how to foster the entrepreneurial mindset,"" Mr. Yonekura said. **********Another problem is the prohibition on the set-up of joint-stock holding companies, dating back to 1947, which businesses are lobbying to have overturned."

""With a stand-alone computer you can limit access in physical ways, putting it in a locked room guarded by people with guns, if you want. You can't do that on a global network."" **********But there are technologies that can greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the types of break-ins that have occurred on the Internet in recent months, security advisers say. Data encryption, one-time password generators, ""fire- walls"" and a user-authentification system called Kerberos are all cited as effective ways to decrease the risk of password theft. **********Last week, a Mountain View, Calif., computer company posted its version of the Kerberos program on an Internet ""server"" computer, making it available without charge to any American or Canadian network that wants it. The company, Cygnus Support, hopes to recoup its investment by selling support services to companies that use the program. **********Used alone or in combination, Kerberos and the other techniques make it harder to steal passwords, or can render them useless if they fall into the wrong hands or can virtually eliminate their use on the network. **********Security experts say that once a break-in is discovered it is relatively simple to expunge password-grabbers from affected computers. At that point, it's a matter of changing passwords and patching the hole in network security that allowed the intruders to enter the system. **********But those steps alone are not enough to reduce the risk of damage from such password pilfering in the future, the experts say. For example, one small company that was an early victim of the Internet bandits cleaned its system and ordered everyone to change passwords. A short time later, technicians discovered that the intruders had planted another hidden program that was designed to recognize the ""change password"" request and steal the new one. **********Passwords are ""the biggest single source of security problems on any networked environment, not just the Internet,"" said William Yundt, a director of Barrnet in Stanford, Calif., one of the first commercial Internet service networks to be attacked in the latest wave of break-ins. **********Here are some proposed solutions: Data Encryption **********Data encryption is the high-tech equivalent of the secret decoder rings one used to find in cereal boxes. It is used primarily to hide the contents of sensitive information files, such as those containing financial data, medical records and classified material. **********A data file or password is scrambled using a special ""key,"" or set of instructions, and it is difficult to unscramble unless the recipient has the same key. **********Encryption works well between two people who arrange ahead of time to use a common key, but it becomes cumbersome on an open network where there are millions of users and thousands of different types of computers. So the Government and various groups are proposing an encryption standard for use throughout the network. **********In fact, a strenuous debate is under way over which data encryption standard to support. The Clinton Administration wants one called Clipper, which is technically sophisticated but has a ""trap door"" designed into it that the Government contends it needs for national security and law-enforcement purposes. Groups concerned about potential invasion of privacy oppose the Clipper standard, arguing that the Government would hold the key needed to read everyone's electronic mail.  One-Time Password Generators **********Hardware solutions include electronic ""tokens"" that generate new passwords every minute. There are also ""challenge response"" systems that require a user to provide a unique code generated by a device similar to a pocket calculator. **********The advantage is that such systems generate one-time-only passwords that change every 60 seconds or so, and thus become invalid at the end of the user's session. **********The drawbacks, which must be weighed against potential benefits, are that such systems add complexity and cost. The password generators typically cost $35 to $100 or more depending on features, and some sort of synchronized password-authentification software is required on the ""host"" computer. **********The most popular such device in use today is the Secur ID, made by Security Dynamics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.  Firewalls **********For higher levels of security, some organizations install ""firewalls,"" typically a highly secure computer that acts as a buffer between the Internet and all the other computers within a company. The firewall system is effective because it presents only a single point of attack to be monitored and defended. Many companies place their firewall computers in a physically secure room. **********Firewalls are not widely used because the firewall barrier works both ways, limiting access to the outside world while blocking intruders from coming inside.  Kerberos **********Several computer security experts cited the Kerberos system as the most effective way to prevent passwords from being ""snarfed"" by network eavesdroppers (to use the digerati's term of art for snatching passwords). The Kerberos architecture eliminates the need for clear, unencrypted text passwords to be passed over the network. **********The process, described in the accompanying chart, appears complex, experts concede. But so does the inside of a door lock, and people still lock their doors. In practice, using Kerberos adds a single step to the computer network log-on process, and it insures much greater security. **********Will the Internet, or other networks, ever be completely secure? **********""It's a difficult thing to accomplish,"" said Mr. Yundt, who supervises the networks at Stanford University. ""You can create an effective technology, but to embed it in every platform and application, in a way that it is globally used, takes a matter of years."" SOME PASSWORD DO'S -- AND DON'TS **********PASSWORDS are effective only to the extent that they remain secret. And security experts say they rarely stay secret for long, because most people fail to heed sensible password rules. **********The rules apply not only to passwords used on computer networks, but also to those used with most other networked systems, like the personal identification numbers used with automatic teller machines and the calling-card numbers used for charging long-distance phone calls. **********Here are ways to avoid being ""snarfed"": **********1. Don't choose words that can be found in a dictionary, English or otherwise. Computer crackers often use ""brute force,"" employing automated programs that test every word at lightning speed. **********2. If possible, use at least eight characters. The longer the password, the harder it is to guess. **********3. Use a mix of letters and numbers, and include special characters if possible. On systems that are ""case sensitive,"" mix upper and lower case letters. The password ""K2jw&#69"" is harder to guess than ""loverboy."" **********4. Don't use obvious, guessable passwords. License plate numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, pet names, sports teams and other familiar terms may be easy to remember, but they are also easy to guess. **********5. It may seem obvious, but don't write your password anywhere people can find it. Don't keep it in your wallet or purse with your bank card, or in the desk drawer next to your computer. **********6. Change passwords frequently, the more often the better. The best systems require a new password each time a user signs on. **********7. Watch out for people looking over your shoulder. Professionals use telescopes in airports and near public phones. **********8. Never ""lend"" your password to someone else, for any reason. **********9. Never tell your password to anyone over the phone. Thieves posing as computer administrators say it's surprising how many people are willing to divulge their passwords to strangers. **********10. Report any unusual ""log on"" experiences immediately to the system administrator. If you feel your password may have been compromised, tell the administrator right away. PETER H. LEWIS A PASSWORD PILGRIM'S PROGRESS **********The Kerberos system uses multiple ""keys"" to protect computer networks on the Internet without exposing users' passwords to possible interception. Here's how it can work: Step 1 Our hero -- call him Pete -- contacts the Acme network service company and gets a special password called a ""secret key."" Step 2 Later, when he wants to use Acme as a gateway to the Internet, Pete sends a message to Acme's authentication computer. Step 3 The computer sends Pete an encrypted response -- an electronic package of information that can be read only with Pete's ""secret key.""  Step 4 The response contains a temporary key good for this session only and an encrypted ticket that will expire if he doesn't use it soon.  Step 5 Pete sends two things back to the Acme computer: the ticket, as evidence that Pete is Pete, and an encrypted message coded with the temporary key, as further evidence that Pete is indeed Pete. Step 6 Our hero receives a second encrypted ticket and decodes it with his temporary key. Step 7 And here's the ticket! Pete sends it over the Internet to, say, NASA's computer data base of satellite maps, requesting access. The NASA computer queries Acme to verify that Pete has a valid ticket. Acme confirms that Pete is authorized to use the network, and NASA opens its gates. At no time does Pete's ""secret key"" go over the network to risk interception."

That would in turn lead the United Nations to ease the crippling trade embargo imposed two years ago against Yugoslavia to punish Serbia, its dominant republic, for its military support of the Bosnian Serbs. **********In the last few weeks, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia has abruptly posed a direct challenge to Dr. Karadzic by opening branches in Serbian-controlled cities in Bosnia including Banja Luka and Pale. **********The new offices carry photographs of Mr. Milosevic but none of Dr. Karadzic, whose Serbian Democratic Party had virtually monopolized the political scene in Serbian-held areas of Bosnia. **********At the same time, Dr. Karadzic has disappeared from state-controlled television in Belgrade, the single most powerful vehicle of Mr. Milosevic's authority and long a trumpeter of Dr. Karadzic's accounts of the military victories of the Bosnian Serbs. **********""I don't know how long Karadzic will endure,"" said Milorad Ekmecic, a Serbian historian who used to teach at Sarajevo University. ""It seems that Milosevic now wants him out."" **********Aside from seeking an end to the trade sanctions, Mr. Milosevic seems to be trying to distance himself from Serbian war crimes committed in Bosnia early in the war by directing blame at others. Gesture of Contempt **********When Dr. Karadzic returned to Belgrade on Wednesday from Geneva, where the United States, Russia and the European Union gave him and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government until July 19 to decide on a proposed settlement, his news conference was not televised and Mr. Milosevic declined to receive him. **********The proposed settlement, ringingly endorsed today by the Group of Seven industrialized democracies and Russia at a summit meeting in Naples, offers 51 percent of Bosnia to a federation of Muslims and Croats there and 49 percent to the Serbs. **********Although Dr. Karadzic has publicly described the map as a humiliation to the Serbs, who now hold 70 percent of Bosnia, most analysts here predict that he will sign the settlement. **********Rather than report Dr. Karadzic's views on the proposal when he returned to Belgrade, state television and other media organizations close to Mr. Milosevic moved into high gear, depicting Dr. Karadzic's self-styled government as a venal and oligarchic regime bent on thievery and warmongering. **********Dr. Karadzic's notorious gambling, his purchase of villas for his family in Belgrade and the theft by Bosnian Serbs of thousands of Volkswagen Golfs from a factory near Sarajevo have all become news, though they were once taboo subjects for most of the Serbian media. **********Hadzi-Dragan Antic, the director of Politika, a newspaper close to Mr. Milosevic, scathingly criticized Dr. Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb politicians in an article last week.  War Profiteering Charged **********""There are those who wish to continue the war at any cost,"" he wrote, ""because, among other things, it is their only opportunity to continue getting rich and living by war profiteering or maybe in order to cover up war crimes that might land them in court."" **********As those reports appeared, Mico Stanisic, an interior minister of the self-styled Serbian republic in Bosnia, accused the Bosnian Serbs' prime minister, Vladimir Lukic, of embezzling 3.5 million German marks, or about $2.3 million. Mr. Stanisic is known to be close to Mr. Milosevic, while Mr. Lukic is one of the politicians closest to Dr. Karadzic. **********""The message seems clear,"" one Western diplomat said. ""Milosevic now wants peace and sanctions lifted, and he wants Karadzic as a fall guy for what the Serbs did in Bosnia."" **********Even though most analysts here expect that Dr. Karadzic will sign the settlement, it is not yet clear that Mr. Milosevic will get his way. Important forces in Serbia -- including the Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seslj and the Orthodox Church -- have encouraged Dr. Karadzic to resist. **********And since the settlement would require the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from several important Bosnian cities, including Doboj and Jajce, Dr. Karadzic is likely to face strong resistance from his military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and from local commanders. **********Dr. Karadzic has said the latest proposal will be submitted to his self-styled parliament for a vote. In May 1993, the representatives of the Bosnian Serbs threw out an earlier plan prepared by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen despite Mr. Milosevic's exhortation to accept it. **********In that instance, the Serbian President's stand proved substantially hollow. Mr. Milosevic quickly resumed the active logistical and financial support that is essential to the Bosnian Serbs. Even now, analysts say it may be politically impossible for him to abandon his fellow Serbs in Bosnia if they reject the latest plan. **********But there is an important difference today. A year ago, Dr. Karadzic had the strong support of the Bosnian Serbs. But their support is waning as they weary of war and progressive impoverishment. Mr. Milosevic, a deft politician, knows that this time he has a receptive audience."

The two companies' computer and telecommunications expertise form a powerful combination, and they can deliver considerable research prowess. **********Perhaps, but E.D.S., a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, is the pioneer and the leader in the business of handling data processing for other companies as an outside contractor. ""These bid competitions are high-risk affairs that aren't decided until the very end,"" Susan Scrupski, editor of the Integrator, a newsletter on the computer services industry, said yesterday. A Growing Segment **********Companies are increasingly farming out computer operations to outside contractors, making this practice, known as ""outsourcing,"" one of the fastest-growing fields in the information technology industry. For several months, the high-stakes corporate beauty contest at Xerox has been closely watched and handicapped in the computer business. A decision could be made as early as this week, industry consultants say. **********The Xerox contract, expected to span 10 years, has been estimated by analysts at more than $4 billion, which would make it the largest such deal to date. **********In the last few years, many large corporations, including General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Sears and Bethlehem Steel, have hired computer service specialists to handle their payroll, accounting, inventory control and other data-processing chores. The companies hope to save money and focus more on their basic businesses. The largest outsourcing deals, typically for 10 years, have totaled more than $3 billion. **********On Friday, the Computer Sciences Corporation, a large outsourcing contractor, said it had been told by Xerox that it was out of the running. Computer Sciences, of El Segundo, Calif., had linked up with Andersen Consulting to bid for the Xerox contract. **********Reflecting the size and significance of the deal, the bad news came to Computer Sciences' chairman, William R. Hoover, in a phone call Friday morning from Paul A. Allaire, the chairman of Xerox. **********Shares of Computer Sciences fell on Friday after the announcement, closing down $1.25 for the day, at $39, on the New York Stock Exchange.  Crucial for I.B.M. **********For the International Business Machines Corporation, in particular, winning big service contracts like the Xerox deal is a crucial part of its recovery plans. I.B.M. must become more of a supplier of computer services and software if it hopes to turn around its fortunes. The company's hardware business, making machines from mainframe computers to laptops, has become increasingly a low-margin commodity-type business, which will not pay for I.B.M.'s research and overhead costs. **********So I.B.M.'s outsourcing unit, the Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, is a vital part of the company's transition. ""I.S.S.C. is a big player in the future of I.B.M.,"" Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., said. **********To try to win the business, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who became chairman of I.B.M. in April, has visited the Xerox headquarters in Stamford, Conn., twice in recent months, while Robert E. Allen, the chairman of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, has been there once, industry consultants said. **********Neither I.B.M. nor E.D.S. would comment on their bids for the Xerox business. **********A spokesman for Xerox stressed that no decision had yet been made. In fact, he added that while the company had been weighing a major outsourcing decision for a long time, it could eventually choose not to contract its data processing out or farm out just a small part of its computing operations. **********A person familiar with the Xerox deliberations said that while no decision had been made, it would be a ""landmark"" case. Some consultants said a decision could be made as early as this week. But the person familiar with the deliberations said that while a decision would come soon, the exact timing was not yet set."

The countries in question had been spending beyond their means. Their deficits were unsustainable. Their import levels were likewise unsustainable, having been financed by a rundown of international reserves or by foreign borrowing that was rapidly drying up. They had to reduce their imports. There was no money left to continue buying -- from the United States or anywhere else. And without significant reforms, no one was going to lend these countries any more money. **********Anyone whose economic knowledge is sophisticated enough to understand that things cost money can see the problem with Mr. Cavanagh and Ms. Anderson's analysis. **********As to their arithmetic, one flaw is that Mr. Cavanagh and Ms. Anderson have left Mexico and Argentina out of their calculations. Both have been recipients of World Bank and I.M.F. adjustment loans, and both are significant markets for American exports. Recalculating, using their method but including Mexico and Argentina, shows that World Bank-I.M.F. adjustment lending increased United States exports by $8 billion a year and provided 162,000 new jobs in the United States. **********It is easy to see then how the writers reached their conclusion: they fudged the economics and they fudged the arithmetic. **********In the last decade, about a quarter of the World Bank's loans have been adjustment loans. Several decades of success in Southeast Asia and a decade of success in Latin America attest to the economic sense of such adjustments. Because of such success, adjustment lending is declining -- it was 12 percent of World Bank lending in fiscal 1994. **********Though increasing the exports of donor countries is not the primary objective of World Bank lending, it should be obvious that prosperous countries will import more than stagnating ones. In fiscal 1994, United States companies earned $970 million from contracts from World Bank-financed projects. Over the 50-year history of the bank, United States companies have received back $1.10 for each $1 of paid-in capital and International Development Agency contributions that Washington has invested in the World Bank.

The Homart Development Company plans to build a 1.1-million-square-foot mall. And the Rouse Company recently announced plans for a yet-unnamed mall that will have 1.2 million square feet of space. **********Although the Orlando area has experienced tremendous population and retail growth in the last decade, construction of large regional malls has trailed. **********""We are all pretty satisfied that the growth is there,"" Jim Grant, vice president of Homart Development, said. ""It's been almost uniform around Orlando."" **********The first mall to open, Seminole Towne Center, is expected to be completed in September 1995, said Tom Schneider, vice president for retail development at Simon Property. The mall will be anchored by Burdines, Dillard, Parisians, J. C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck. William Graves of Dallas is the architect. **********Simon Property, based in Indianapolis, has built 70 regional malls nationwide. Seminole Towne Center is the company's second mall in Florida. **********""Construction of the Homart project is expected to begin late this year and be completed in the fall of 1996,"" Mr. Grant said. Homart is negotiating with five leading department store chains to anchor the project, although no leases have been signed yet. T.V.S. Architects of Atlanta designed the project. **********Homart, a Chicago-based subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company, operates 36 malls in the United States. The company has two projects in Florida. **********Construction on the Rouse Company mall is expected to begin early next year and be completed in 1997, said Cathy A. Lickteig, Rouse's director of corporate affairs. The project will have five anchor tenants, though only three, Burdines, Dillard and Gayfers, have committed to the project so far. **********Rouse, based in Columbia, Md., operates 54 regional malls in 16 specialty marketplaces nationwide. Five of the projects are in Florida. **********Though the malls are scheduled to open within three years of each other, observers are confident that each will be successful, largely because of Orlando's tremendous growth. Metropolitan Orlando's population grew from 800,000 in 1980 to 1.3 million this year. **********Nationwide, construction of large regional malls, which generally have 150 to 200 stores, has slowed in recent years. Lenders have tightened credit requirements and several department store chains have suffered from financial problems. Most malls now require three to five major department stores as anchor tenants before they can begin construction. **********Dan Baker, senior associate with C. B. Commercial in Orlando, said there was a pent-up demand for new malls in Orlando for several years. He said at least one new project would probably have been built sooner if not for the tight lending market. **********Working in favor of the malls is that each is being built in different parts of metropolitan Orlando and their trade areas will overlap little, if any. Developers believe a regional mall needs a trade area of at least 200,000 people to be successful. **********Seminole Towne Center is being built in Orlando's northern suburbs near the town of Sanford. The Homart mall is on the western side of the city and the Rouse Company mall will be built in eastern Orlando, near the town of Oviedo. **********Homart is more concerned about competition from an existing mall, Orlando Fashion Square, than any of the new projects planned, Mr. Grant said. Likewise, Seminole Towne Center is being built just a few miles from an existing mall. Still, Seminole's trade area includes 400,000 people, Mr. Schneider said. **********Both Seminole Towne Center and the Rouse project are adjacent or near the Central Florida Greeneway, a 56-mile beltway around the east side of Orlando. Because of a lack of money, the beltway remains stalled in western Orlando where the Homart mall is being built. Each mall is also expected to spur additional commercial development around them, including smaller shopping centers and free-standing stores, Mr. Baker said. All of the developers have set aside land they want to either develop or sell to others. **********For example, the Rouse project is part of a 500-acre development known as Oviedo Crossing. The Viera Company, a subsidiary of agriculture conglomerate A. Duda & Sons Inc. is marking the property for retail office and residential development. **********An apartment complex has already been built at Oviedo Crossing. Future commercial development is expected nearby."

But below the surface the issue is whether the union, which is backed by the Government, acts as a Government censor. ***********The editor of a small monthly news magazine called Forum is being sued for libel by the Mexican Army. He published an article by a Mexican general who outlined human rights abuses in the army. ***********In the last week in June a Mexican journalist was slain. Within a month, two other journalists were killed. **********There are no formal Government censors in Mexico, and technically anyone can print or broadcast almost anything. Coverage this year of the Indian uprising in Chiapas state and of the assassinations of two leading politicians was at times tough enough to break new journalistic ground. **********In practice though, much goes unreported because of more sophisticated but less obvious press prohibitions. **********""There is liberty of expression in Mexico, but with restrictions,"" said Eduardo Ibarra Aguirre, the editor of Forum magazine, who is being sued by the army. ""We have a Mexico of the speeches, and another that fights every day for its constitutional rights."" **********William A. Orme Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which is based in New York, said Mexico's system of censorship was voluntary and therefore all the more difficult to fight. **********""The Mexican press agrees to be subjugated by the system,"" he said, ""in return for financial support and other privileges."" **********""I'm really loath to give the administration any credit for opening press freedom,"" he said. ""For everything under their direct control, like radio and television, they've made every effort to keep as much control as ever."" **********Starting with his campaign for the presidency in 1988, Mr. Salinas has called a free press essential to democracy. He formally banned the old practice of monthly Government handouts to reporters who cover executive branch ministries, and he ended the Government's monopoly on newsprint, which had been used to punish newspapers that were overly critical. **********One of the newspapers whose newsprint supply was cut off was El Norte, published in Monterrey and owned by the Junco family. The Juncos, now in their fourth generation of newspaper ownership, shook up things in Mexico City last year when they began Reforma on Nov. 20, the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution and one of five legal holidays in Mexico. Reforma had the streets to itself because no other paper publishes on that day. But the union would not work, and Reforma's editors and reporters gave away the paper on street corners. **********""Dealing with the union was one of the most feared aspects of our project,"" said Alejandro Junco, director general of Reforma. In the year that it has published, Reforma's circulation has grown to about 75,000, 35,000 in home delivery and the rest on newsstands and a few large stores. **********The union has always loudly and publicly supported the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed for 65 years. In exchange, the Government prohibits newspaper vending machines, forbids small stores from selling papers and gives the union the sole right to use the public sidewalks to sell newspapers. **********""For seven decades, this union has been a source of control for the Government, which has had a chilling effect over the print media,"" Mr. Junco said. ""Very frequently, the union will say your headline did not sell very well today, which means they didn't like the headline."" **********The secretary general of the 20,000-member union, Manuel Ramos, called the charge that his members had tried to censor Reforma or any other publication ""a lie."" **********""This really is not a problem of freedom of the press, although they would like foreigners to think that it is,"" Mr. Ramos said. He called the union ""apolitical"" and said the Juncos' real intent was to break the union and set up their own distribution system. **********Since the boycott began, Mr. Junco and most of Reforma's editors and reporters have started most days out on the street selling copies of their paper. Reforma has a plan to establish 4,000 independent outlets around Mexico City to circumvent the union. **********Mr. Junco said readers have the right to see a newspaper every day. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a letter to President Salinas that the union's action ""sets a dangerous precedent for the future of a free press in Mexico."" **********In the defamation suit against Forum magazine, a small monthly that sells little more than 5,000 copies a month, the army has gone after the editor after having imprisoned the author of the offending article, Brig. Gen. Jose Francisco Gallardo. **********General Gallardo wrote an article on the need for a human rights ombudsman in the army, discussing openly a subject that had only been hinted at. After Forum published the article in its October 1993 issue, the general was charged with defamation. He was jailed, and the army then resurrected old charges against him of misuse of funds and abuse of authority. **********The army has dropped the defamation charges against the general but keeps him imprisoned on the others. In October the military filed a civil suit against the Forum editor, Ibarra Aguirre. **********""It's an act of revenge,"" he said. ""They're trying to set a precedent by going after a journalist with a civil law suit, and thereby sending a message to all Mexican journalists."""

His voice takes on a rich, deep tone as he describes the coffee, bananas and mangoes he used to grow. **********Then rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola came and he fled along with thousands of his neighbors. And what does he have now? He smiled ashamedly and touched the hem of his shirt and the patched leg of his trousers. The crowd around, all in the same boat, laughed. **********Africa is in the throes of a crisis over the forced movement of huge numbers of people -- traditional refugees who have crossed international borders and those who have moved to safety within their countries, ""internally displaced persons"" in United Nations jargon. Wars and Banditry **********Riven by wars, ethnic violence, political turmoil and just plain banditry, the continent now leads the world in both categories, for the first time surpassing South Asia, North Africa and the Middle East put together. **********Below the Sahara, where 600 million people live, there are 6,025,000 refugees, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates, including 300,000 who have fled tribal massacres in Rwanda into Tanzania over the past month. The ""internally displaced persons"" total about 16 million, or three-fifths of the world total. **********""The biggest crisis of internally displaced is by far in Africa,"" said Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees in London. ""There is so much turmoil it is forcing us to expand our mandate. Now, more and more often, we try to get closer to where the people are instead of waiting for them to cross a border. Their problems and needs are all the same."" **********One factor that contributes to mass migrations is that the conflicts in Africa now go hand in hand with drought, cattle raids and crop destruction, throwing into the depths of starvation whole areas where people had eked out a marginal existence. **********This is true in the Horn of Africa, especially in Somalia. Clan fighting there after the overthrow of President Mohammed Siad Barre saw gun-toting bands of young men raiding warehouses for emergency aid and using food as a bargaining chip and a weapon. It is also true in the Sudan, where an 11-year civil war between the Islamic north and the Christian and animist south has killed more than 500,000 and shows no signs of easing. Three million people have been uprooted. At the same time, Sudan is host to a million foreign refugees, mostly from Eritrea and Ethiopia. **********Whether people are fleeing the fighting or fleeing because there is no food is difficult to determine. It often comes down to the same thing. **********International relief workers are disturbed by another development. Before, they say, civilian casualties were byproducts of the fighting. Now civilians are often the targets. Increasingly, rebel armies have adapted slash-and-burn techniques, creating more refugees.  'Young Kids With Guns' **********""Look at what's happening in Rwanda,"" said Michael MacDonagh, a worker with Concern, an Irish aid group. ""Or look at Liberia four years ago: 600 people locked in a church and killed. Things like that didn't used to happen."" **********They were, he said, the emblems of a new kind of warfare, something close to ""gangsterism perpetrated by a lot of young kids with guns."" **********Mercedes Sayagues, of the United Nations World Food Program, said civilians were now targets. ""Before, they were conventional wars, army against army, and they kept the civilians out of it,"" she said. ""Now that's changed."" **********She said a change in the kinds of places mines are placed illustrated the new mentality. ""The mines are planted in nonstrategic areas, in urban centers, in fields where crops are planted,"" she said. ""I've even seen them put around mango trees where children go to pick the fruit."" **********A major expansion in the burden of refugees in Africa occurred in 1989 and 1990. In those years several new conflagrations drove people to flee: 175,000 went to the Ivory Coast from Liberia, 547,000 went to Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone and 120,000 went to northern Kenya from Somalia. The next year another 400,000 Somalis fled across the border.  Refugees Pack City Slums **********The flood of internally displaced people has filled the slums of cities from Khartoum to Lagos to Luanda. **********""The whole coast of Angola is overloaded with displaced people,"" said Bill Yates, the Oxfam representative here. ""I don't see how it could support 10 more people. In Cubal, people are living on the streets, inside a movie theater, everywhere. In Benguela, there's an old abandoned slaughterhouse near the beach, and two families live in each of the bloodstained stalls."" **********What concerns aid workers is not just the despondency of living a displaced existence, but the dependency it brings. Life becomes nothing more than survival and hope for betterment rapidly gives way to an incapacitating fatalism. **********Returning refugees to their towns and villages is difficult and expensive. People have to be convinced that it is safe to return and then given enough tools, seeds and construction material to start over. **********There are also setbacks. After a peace accord in 1991 and 1992, some 90,000 Angolans among 300,000 in Zaire and Zambia decided to return, only to be trapped when fighting resumed in January 1993. Resignation and Despair **********The most ambitious repatriation program in Africa is under way in Mozambique, a three-year effort aimed at bringing back 1.5 million Mozambicans from six southern African countries. It is expected to cost over $200 million. **********In Caxito, Mr. da Cruz expressed doubts that he would ever see his farm in Nambuangongo again. ""Here we have nothing, absolutely nothing,"" he said, gesturing toward his 10-foot long hut with a dirt floor and walls of bamboo, reeds and corn husks. Inside were some sacks of grain, a bit of oil, pots of cornmeal and a pair of flip-flops -- nothing more. **********All around him the camp, called Boa Esperanca, is a sprawl of similar huts, extending past the horizon of rolling hills in what was once a Portuguese banana plantation. The camp, an hour's drive north of Luanda, holds 46,000 people in three sites near the Loge River. **********Even this little is at risk. On a recent evening, Mr. da Cruz's 11-year-old daughter started a fire to prepare dinner. The fire got out of control, spreading rapidly to the other grass huts. Within minutes, 250 families were homeless. **********The essential needs of the inhabitants are supplied by a bewildering array of organizations, each with its own acronym. Food is supplied by a German outfit, A.A.A. Health is taken care of by C.I.C.S., an Italian medical group. Sanitation is looked after by A.D.P.P., of Denmark. Unicef handles the drinking water and medicine. **********One section of the camp is nicknamed the French Quarter. It was built 20 years ago for refugees from the fighting in Shaba Province in Zaire. Six hundred of them are still here. **********""I'd like to go back, sure,"" said Mukanda Albert, a man of about 40 who came to the camp in 1977. ""But we've been here so long."" He looked around at the dirt tracks, the grass huts, the familiar tents of the foreign workers. ""If we go back, who is to guarantee we'll be able to start over?"""

A popular ploy is a teaser rate, a very low initial rate that may rise markedly after a short period. **********A New York woman recently received a letter from a unit of the Banc One Corporation offering a pre-approved Visa card at an annual rate of just 5.9 percent. Only by studying the fine print on a small enclosed card did she discover that this rate would soar after her August billing period to the prime rate, now 6 percent, plus 9.9 percentage points, for a total of 15.9 percent, slightly above the national average. **********""This is very confusing for consumers,"" said Gerri E. Detweiler, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America. ""It is one of those cases where consumers have to read every word."" **********John W. Fisher, Banc One's marketing manager, defended the practice. ""We say in several locations in the letter that it is a low introductory rate,"" he said. **********Federal law requires all applications and solicitations for credit cards to state somewhere what the annual percentage rate is, whether it is variable and how it is determined. Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill last April to require additional disclosure. ""I'd like to see the actual interest rate be clear as a bell to the consumer,"" he said. **********Consolidating holiday bills on a low-rate card could make sense, especially if consumers pay off the balance before the rate rises. Issuers, of course, expect few people to cut up their cards. ""I don't think any credit card issuer wants a short-term relationship,"" said Mr. Fisher of Banc One."

Mr. Morris has been the industry favorite for the past eight years, according to surveys by Institutional Investor magazine. **********Another factor, according to Stefan Jentzsch, the Goldman director in charge of the Telekom project, was the company's high profile in Germany. **********""We've been involved as a sounding board since the start of this project three to four years ago,"" he said. ""In the near future we think the telecoms industry will play the role that the car industry has played in the past few decades, becoming the biggest single contributor to gross domestic product."" **********Goldman paved the way for its selection by testifying at numerous German government hearings and pumping resources into the Frankfurt financial market, where its staff now numbers more than 200. **********Between 50 percent and 60 percent of Deutsche Telekom issue is expected to be subscribed by German investors. As much as 300 million DM, or 20 percent of the tranche, is expected to be placed in the United States. **********Although there are no official regional quotas, Deutsche Telekom said about 10 percent of the offering would probably be placed in Britain. **********""We want a lot of the shares to stay in Germany, but we're also interested in getting international investors because the German capital market simply isn't big enough,"" Mr. Bötsch said. **********The first tranche of the privatization alone will be roughly as large as the stock market capitalization of Volkswagen AG, Kaufhof AG and Lufthansa AG combined. Its size will propel Telekom from stock market obscurity to membership in the DAX, Germany's 30-share blue-chip index. **********Mr. Bötsch said the Telekom rights issue would strengthen the company's capital base, increase its ability to compete, liberalize the European market for telecommunication services and make an ""important contribution"" to the development of German financial markets. **********Proceeds from the initial public offering will be used to retire debt. The German government will not profit from the actual sale of its own Telekom shares until after the year 2000."

Smith, the chairman of Bell, and John C. Malone, the entrepreneur who pushed his cable company into 49 states, tried to renegotiate the deal and failed. **********One Bell executive likened Mr. Malone to someone who had put his house up for sale, saying, ""If the value suddenly drops, you take it off the market and wait for better times."" **********Both blamed the breakdown on Tuesday's long-expected decision by the Federal Communications Commission to cut rates of all local cable television monopolies by about 7 percent. **********How much the FCC was to blame was a matter of angry contention - all the cable companies accused it of robbing them of revenue with which to invest for future growth - but it certainly changed the arithmetic of the deal. **********The merger was predicated on pricing TCI stock at $35 a share, which meant Bell Atlantic would be paying about 11.75 times the cable company's cash flow. TCI sank steadily from its Oct. 14 peak of $32.875 to $25.125 last Friday, at which time, a Bell executive said, ""We crunched new numbers and they just didn't add up."" **********On Thursday, after the deal unwound, Bell Atlantic stock rose $1.75 to $54.50 and TCI fell $1.875 to $22.375. Stocks in phone-equipment companies fell, and the end of the euphoria about the industry helped drive down prices on Wall Street.

During the past year, he calculated, cable companies' cash flow had declined from 12 percent to 10 percent or even 8 percent because of tightened regulation and competition from other sources. **********John Waller, a cable broker in New York, said he had no doubt that eventually there would be ""four or five big companies offering cable television, movies and interactive communications across boundaries, which is what we mean by the information superhighway."" The latest developments, he said, represented a ""bump in the road."" **********Mergers will be suspended, he said, until all sides can calculate the cash-flow effects of federal regulations on individual companies. **********Robert B. Wilkes of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., foresaw less pressure on Congress to pass legislation dismantling some of the barriers between the cable and telephone business, leaving ""less likelihood that all these industries will come together."" **********Another reason for delay is that the cable companies now are less attractive buys for the phone companies, who have nowhere else to obtain programming for their own wires and lack the ability to develop it themselves. **********TCI has a stake in CNN and a number of the other successful cable channels it carries, and the question for Bell was how much it was willing to pay to tap into them all at once, as other regional companies had been accused of paying too much in smaller deals. Mr. Cullen said Bell Atlantic would ""now look for smaller alliances, and it will take longer."""

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/03/business/world-markets-coffee-and-oil-feed-boom-in-colombia.html,James Brooke,1994-07-03,,891,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,World Markets; Coffee and Oil Feed Boom in Colombia,World Markets; Coffee and Oil Feed Boom in Colombia," **********WORLD attention swiveled to Colombia last week after a freeze damaged coffee crops in Brazil and sent coffee prices spiking up to eight-year highs. But the world's second-largest producer of coffee is riding more than a bean bonanza. **********For the first half of 1994, Colombia had one of the best performing stock markets in the world. Bucking a slump in emerging markets, Colombia's stock market index jumped to 1019.7, or 30.6 percent in dollar terms, this year, behind only Japan's market, which has risen 34.6 percent this year. Other top performing markets include Chile, at 21.7 percent, and Peru, at 15.4 percent. **********In the first half of this year, volumes on Colombia's three exchanges -- in Bogota, Medellin and Occidente -- totaled $1.7 billion, nearly double the volume last year. **********""The future outlook is good; the coffee price increase and the Cusiana bonanza are good news,"" said Hernan Valdivieso, general manager of Casa de Bolsa, a leading brokerage firm here. He referred to the enormous Cusiana oil fields that will start producing next year in eastern Colombia. ""If we did not have the drug and violence problem,"" he said, ""we could be another Hong Kong or Taiwan."" **********In recent years, Colombia's illicit cocaine trade harmed the country's image as an appropriate market for investment. But this seems to be changing after Colombian police shot and killed Pablo Escobar, the country's most notorious cocaine trafficker, last December. ""When Escobar died, foreign investors started to look at the country in a more favorable light,"" said Alden Brewster, a New York trader in emerging markets. **********Despite the relatively small size of Colombia's markets, foreign interest is now soaring. In the last 18 months, the number of foreign funds investing in Colombia's markets increased to 85 from 22. And the portfolio of foreign-held stocks in Colombia has more than quadrupled in the last year, to $400 million at the end of May. **********Bogota's exchange, the largest in the Andean region, ranks as Latin America's fifth largest -- after the exchanges in Mexico City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile, and Buenos Aires. **********Bogota's boom stems from myriad factors, starting with the healthy economy of Colombia, South America's most populous nation after Brazil. Colombia has the only large economy in the region to record positive growth rates for the last 20 years. Its economic growth of 5.3 percent last year may be repeated this year. Its corporate profits are expected to jump 22 percent this year. **********To encourage investors, the Government has freed rates on brokerage commissions and has abolished local taxes on dividends and capital gains. At the same time, high interest rates have forced many Colombian companies to raise cash by issuing stock or by selling bonds. In the last year, the number of Colombian companies issuing stock jumped to 120 from 30. **********Depository receipts have been issued in United States in the last year by four Colombian blue chip companies: two financial institutions, Banco Ganadero and Corporacion Financiera del Valle; a cement company, Cementos Diamante, and a supermarket chain, Carulla y Compania. **********Fueling a thirst for investment credits, President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo slashed import tariffs, throwing obsolete industries into direct competition with efficient foreign companies. Ernesto Samper Pizano, who is to be inaugurated as the new President on Aug. 7, is expected to maintain roughly the same free market policies. **********Further adding to stock trading volumes, the Government privatized several state banks this year, including Banco de Colombia, the nation's second-largest bank. Stock demand is expected to increase next year as private pension funds enter the markets. **********""The majority of the pension fund money will go into fixed-rate funds, but we expect that 15 to 20 percent will go into stocks,"" predicted Luis Fernando Lopez, superintendent of the agency that regulates Colombia's stock market. Last year, only 7 percent of trading activity in Colombia's markets was in stocks. The rest was in bonds. So far this year, the portion of trading in stocks has increased to 17 percent. **********After a leading group of equity funds crashed in the 1980's, Colombian investors became leery of stocks, preferring bonds or real estate. But with tightened oversight and the passage of time, the nation's investors are gradually returning to stocks. **********In many Latin American markets, downturns came as portfolio managers in the United States called their money home to take advantage of higher interest rates. Yet in Colombia, foreign influence over the markets has been small. Last year, foreigners accounted for only 11 percent of stock trades in Bogota's market. **********For investors, Cynthia Rosenberg, president of Baring's new office here, recommended the stocks of Banco de Ganadero, Banco de Bogota, Curulla, construction companies and cement companies. Her company is avoiding textiles, a sector that has failed to compete against foreign imports. **********Stocks of such cement companies as Cementos Caribe and Cementos del Valle are bound to thrive on news that construction permits doubled in the first four months of this year and that the new Government plans to spend billions of oil revenues on public works projects. Colombia's annual per capita consumption of cement is already 453 pounds, just short of the 493-pound level for the United States."

Serving as the Reader's Digest of the alternative press, it has brought attention to the best writing from little-known publications like Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy, Posse Comitatus and Disability Rag and Resource. **********Recently, however, Eric Utne, the founding editor and president, began to ask himself what on earth alternative means these days. He also found himself increasingly irritated by ""the co-optation"" of the word as a marketing device. **********""Newt Gingrich is calling his Contract With America alternative; the largest section in music stores is labeled alternative,"" Mr. Utne said in a recent interview at the magazine's headquarters in Minneapolis. ""And now I see articles in Time and Newsweek that used to be associated with the alternative press."" **********As a result, Utne Reader is rethinking and redesigning itself, beginning with the January-February issue, which comes out at the end of the week. The magazine will continue to include excerpts, but they will be from the mainstream as well as the so-called alternative press. An article in the new issue, for instance, first appeared in GQ, a Conde Nast magazine with a circulation of 672,000 whose advertisers include Gucci and Ralph Lauren. **********The new focus of the magazine will be ""vision and activism,"" Mr. Utne said. **********""I think you will see a lot more advocacy on our part,"" he added, ""discussing and debating and more citizen participation."" **********Utne Reader will present original articles from ""leading thinkers and visionaries of the emerging culture,"" he said. The cover story in the new issue, ""100 Visionaries Who Could Change Your Life,"" includes people Utne editors consider to have ""liveliness, richness and clarity of vision."" **********Some of the choices, however, may surprise in this once-New Age magazine. One, for instance, is William J. Bennett, the former Secretary of Education and anti-drug czar, who is an impassioned advocate of traditional conservative values. **********""These people represent a range of question-asking and solution-offering that needs to be reckoned with,"" Mr. Utne said. ""They enlarge the debate and that is what we think is important now. We will also be looking at newsletters from the defense establishment, the business press and the radical right."" **********Utne is adding a new section, called Good Works, to alert readers to ventures that they might want to give money to or volunteer for. Another section, Currents, serves as an Op-Ed forum. There will also be a new section devoted to photography. **********The magazine, which Mr. Utne said had been making a profit for four years, has doubled its circulation and ad pages in the last five years. The circulation was 307,000 for the first six months of the year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. **********The magazine, which costs $4.95, usually has about 50 ad pages in each issue. New advertisers this year include Toyota, Levi Strauss and Volkswagen. **********Early next year, Utne Reader will establish an on-line presence on the Internet, which will give the magazine a timeliness that it does not enjoy as a publication that comes out every other month. The service will present original editorial material for discussion in on-line forums. **********Another project in the works is a publishing venture, whose products will include discussion guides, anthologies and nonfiction books. Mr. Utne said Utne's owner, Lens Publishing, planned to publish 3 titles next year and about 12 titles a year beginning in 1996. **********The first book will be about literary salons, a project Utne has been involved in since 1992. There are now about 500 salons or discussion groups scattered around the country that were started under the auspices of Utne. **********Another book due next year will have reviews of notable CD-ROM products, on-line services, videos, books and magazines. **********The total investment to start these projects, Mr. Utne said, will be about $1 million. This includes the cost of setting up new discussion groups in libraries and bookstores around the country. **********Lawrence Teherani-ami, media supervisor at Wieden & Kennedy, an advertising agency in Portland, Ore., praised the magazine for its strong connection to its readers. **********""They have great circulation growth and it is a well-produced magazine,"" he said. ""We like it because it's a neat magazine and because it is providing good editorial that no one else is providing out there."" **********Tinkering with a magazine that has as strong an identity as Utne Reader can be treacherous, however, and it remains to be seen how the changes will be accepted by readers and advertisers."

(CPB,N)","COMPANY REPORTS; CAMPBELL SOUP CO. (CPB,N)"," **********The Campbell Soup Company reported yesterday that its earnings rose more than 13 percent in its fiscal third quarter, but the gain was less than analysts' expectations and some lowered their investment ratings on the company's stock. **********Campbell Soup, based in Camden, N.J., said its net income in the period ended May 1 totaled $119 million, or 47 cents a share. The results were a penny shy of the 48-cent mean estimate from 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. **********Campbell's sales fell 3.9 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier, to nearly $1.57 billion. The company blamed its Campbell U.S.A. division, which includes soup sales, for the decline. The division's sales fell 8 percent, to $913.3 million. **********Pacing the decline was wholesale soup volume, which fell 15 percent as the company focused its marketing strategy toward consumer advertising, shifting from promotions to restaurants and food-service companies. **********""We are making a concerted effort this year to refocus marketing spending on the retail consumer,"" said F. Martin Thrasher, president of Campbell's U.S. soup division. ""This will eliminate undesirable peaks in our business cycle."" **********Analysts, however, said that the new strategy could hurt sales in the next two quarters and that Campbell's stock price could fall as well.

Mullins Jr., 47, said he was resigning Feb. 14 to become an investment manager in a new billion-dollar investment fund run by former employees of Salomon Brothers Inc. Mr. Mullins, who came onto the board in May 1990, joins Wayne D. Angell, whose term ends next week, in leaving it. **********The immediate effect on monetary policy of Mr. Mullins's departure almost two years before the expiration of his term was unclear but probably not decisive. For the long term, the board will probably be dominated by the same kinds of mainstream economists, but with more of a tilt toward promoting economic growth. **********One of leading candidates to replace Mr. Mullins is George Perry of the Brookings Institution in Washington. Mr. Perry recently described himself as concerned about price stability but not, for example, with the ""tunnel vision"" of the Bundesbank. As a young economist he worked in the Kennedy White House, and one of his academic specialties has been the effects of inflation on the economy. **********Robert E. Rubin, chief White House economic coordinator, said Tuesday that Mr. Clinton was ""committed to the traditional independence of the Fed's role as the protector of price stability and the currency."" The president, Mr. Rubin said, is seeking to appoint Fed governors ""who will apply this with reasonableness."" **********Mr. Clinton said the administration wants to manage the economy ""with real discipline - that is, we don't want to have one of these roller-coaster things."" **********Among those mentioned for Fed governorships in addition to Mr. Perry are Alan Blinder, a former Princeton University professor who is now a member of the Council of Economic Advisers; Peter Kenen, a Princeton specialist in international monetary matters, and Van Doorn Ooms, a former Congressional economist now with the Committee for Economic Development, a business group. **********A Republican appointee and former professor at Harvard Business School, Mr. Mullins was responsible for the day-to-day administration of the central bank and generally voted with Mr. Greenspan on the seven-member board. **********He is joining Long Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut, which is run by John Meriwether.Mr. Meriwether left Salomon in August 1991, later agreeing to pay a $50,000 fine and accept a three- month suspension to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he failed to supervise employees working for him. Within Salomon Brothers, however, he was widely viewed as having done little or nothing wrong. **********Neither Mr. Mullins nor Mr. Angell, an inflation hawk, will participate in the Federal Open Market Committee meeting Thursday and Friday that will start to shape this year's policy and help decide when interest rates again start to rise; the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, promised Congress on Monday that rates would would go up this year as the economy strengthens."

The company, Catapult Entertainment Inc., was founded earlier this year by former executives of Sony Pictures, General Magic and Apple Computer. It plans to begin offering the service in some cities before Christmas. Renewing Interest **********Adam Grosser, the president of Catapult, noted that the most popular games run on the current generation of 16-bit machines and have millions of users each. The phone service is seen as a way of raising interest in a maturing technology until the arrival of 32-bit games in 1995. **********""It's a really interesting way to introduce new life into old 16-bit technology,"" said Denise Caruso, editorial director of Technology & Media, a computer industry newsletter in San Francisco. ""There's market demand for interesting ways to play games."" **********In the rush to new interactive media, multiplayer games are seen as one of the most promising avenues for digital cable services and personal computer networks. **********The Catapult service is based on a low-speed modem that is inserted between the game machine and the video game cartridge. Mr. Grosser said Catapult, based in Cupertino, Calif., expected to generate its revenue primarily from the service part of its business, not the sale of the modem cartridge, which will probably be priced at $50 to $60. **********Another start-up company, P. F. Magic, has received backing from the AT&T Corporation and others for a modem cartridge called the Edge, which would also allow games to be played over phone lines. But the company has not announced plans to support existing video games or a service for finding partners. **********Users of the Catapult system will pay $5 to $10 a month for the service, depending on usage. To play a game, a user will dial a centralized computer, which will match the player against another player in his or her local area. The computer will automatically dial the other person. **********""We're really a dating service,"" Mr. Grosser said. ""The reason kids play games is for the challenge and the competition. We think we've satisfied that need."" **********The company would not disclose its initial investment in the service, but Mr. Grosser said that it would be able to support its activities for several years. Catapult's investors also include Davis Video Enterprises, founded by John and Marvin Davis. **********Blockbuster Entertainment has been looking at the video game market as a new growth area. Last week, Newleaf Entertainment and Sega of America said that they would test-market a new electronic delivery system for video games in several Blockbuster Video stores this summer. **********The new Catapult service has a potential obstacle: Parents may be concerned that the games could dominate their home's only telephone line.  But Mr. Grosser noted that if the line had a ""call waiting"" feature, the system would be automatically alerted to incoming calls. If the player wanted to answer the call, the game would disconnect. **********Players will not be able to speak to each other over the phone line, but they can send each other a variety of pre-programmed electronic messages. ""This takes a solitary activity and socializes it,"" Mr. Grosser said. **********The Catapult system works by synchronizing the two video games and than capturing information from the video game controllers in each home. Initially, the system will support the 10 most popular games offered by Sega and Nintendo. **********Catapult plans to start the service in November in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, and later in Dallas and Atlanta. The company plans tournaments to generate interest. **********While the service will be offered 24 hours a day, the company expects the peak hours to be 3 to 11 P.M. During those hours, Catapult plans to be able to match players within one minute of an inquiry."

High Stakes for Both Sides **********""We are at the beginning of a very serious process that involves high stakes for both countries,"" he said. ""My job is to try to make sure that we understand each other as well as possible and not leave uncertainties."" **********American officials said Mr. Assad had presented a comprehensive counterproposal that covered issues like normalization, timing, security arrangements and Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 war. **********Mr. Christopher met late tonight in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to discuss Mr. Assad's response. The Syrian radio reported today that Mr. Christopher would return to Damascus this week, but American officials said no such decision had been made final. **********Israeli officials said today that Syria appeared to be signaling slightly more flexibility in the peace talks. They pointed to an article today in Al Hayat, a London-based Arabic newspaper, which laid out a five-part Syrian formula to step up the peace talks. **********Citing Syrian officials, the newspaper said Syria wanted Israel to cancel its annexation of the Golan Heights and recognize Syrian sovereignty over that area. The plan also said that Israel should voice its readiness to withdraw from the Golan in the future and that Syria and Israel should discuss security arrangements on both sides of the border. **********Lastly, Syria would show a willingness to discuss other questions involving relations, including normalization, embassies and trade. **********There remains a major difference over Syria's call for a total and rapid Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. Prime Minister Rabin has indicated a willingness to close many Israeli settlements there, but he continues to oppose full withdrawal. In addition, Israel proposed a phased withdrawal over several years. No Breakthrough Seen **********A senior American official said the talks were ""not on the brink of a breakthrough."" He said Syria and Israel had no plans to resume direct peace talks, which broke off in late February. Mr. Christopher's work as a mediator ""will give more of a push to the direct negotiations when they resume,"" he said. **********Coinciding with Mr. Christopher's visit to Damascus, The Syria Times, an official newspaper, ran an article saying that most American newspapers were under Jewish influence, that Jews often distorted facts to mislead the public and that Jews unduly intervened in American education, research and culture. As evidence of Jewish influence, the newspaper said that ""30 percent of Protestant bishops in the United States are Jews who did not quit Judaism."" **********Mr. Christopher asked the American Ambassador in Damascus, Christopher Ross, to complain to Syrian officials about the article. **********American and Israeli officials said other articles in the Syrian press had been more positive. Tishrin, an official Syrian paper, suggested on Sunday that Damascus would accept Israeli withdrawal from the Golan over a ""reasonable and acceptable"" time period. Israeli officials said that signaled a change from Syria's usual demand for immediate withdrawal."

Response to Clinton Letter **********Mr. Richardson said that during today's meeting, he received her response to a letter from President Clinton that he delivered on Monday. **********The American Congressman also met twice on Monday with Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of Burmese military intelligence, and said that he had urged the general, who is regarded by many diplomats as the nation's new strongman, to deal with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi directly. **********While Mr. Richardson would not characterize the general's response to the proposal, American officials said they believed that General Khin Nyunt was leaning toward direct negotiations, but that he would not be able to commit himself until he had the approval of other junta members. **********Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi (pronounced awng san sue chee) has had no direct contact with high-level Burmese Government officials. A lieutentant colonel who visits her occasionally has served as her liaison with the Government. **********During her meeting with the delegation on Monday, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said she had always been willing to negotiate with the junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, on all issues except the question of whether she would remain in Myanmar. The military has said she may go free if she promised to leave the country. Congressman Awaits Response **********Representative Richardson, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who has been active in human rights issues, said today that he would return to Washington and would await a response from General Khin Nyunt. **********He said he had concluded that Burmese concern about the Clinton Administration and its policies toward Myanmar was the reason officials had allowed an American-led delegation to be the first to see Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. **********In her remarks Monday, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi expressed her thanks to the Clinton Administration, which has repeatedly called for her release, but she also said that she hoped to see from the United States a ""more clear-cut policy in favor of the movement for democracy."" **********While the United States cut off all Government aid to Myanmar in 1988, it maintains trade links and limited diplomatic ties, despite the military leadership's abysmal human rights record. Several large American corporations do business in Myanmar. Question of Sanctions **********Asked whether the United States and other nations should consider economic sanctions against Myanmar to protest its human rights policies, she said that foreign governments should consider whether their trade with Myanmar is ""really helping the people or is it simply helping the Government to dig in its heels. This is the question to be asked."" **********Too many nations, she suggested, use economic carrots, and not sticks, to encourage improvements in Myanmar's human rights record. She asked her guests to remember that ""you can stuff a mule to death with carrots."" **********While Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi appeared to be in generally good health despite her years of isolation, Western diplomats said that they were trying to determine, on the basis of her comments on Monday, whether she is receiving adequate medical care. **********Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said that her Burmese doctors had told her that she was suffering from spondylosis, a degenerative joint disease that results in a hardening and stiffening of the spinal column. ""I can't sew any more because it gets at the shoulders,"" she said. ""It's a bit of discomfort all the time.""                    --------------------       U.S. Urges 'Dialogue' **********WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States urged Myanmar's military leaders today to ""build on this small step"" of Representative Richardson's meeting by ""beginning a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and moving toward genuine democratic reform."" **********In a statement, the Administration added: ""The President regards the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and all other prisoners of conscience in Burma as unacceptable and renews his call for their immediate and unconditional release."" **********The White House also released a copy of a letter from President Clinton that Mr. Richardson delivered to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday in which Mr. Clinton praised the Burmese for her courage and expressed concern about her welfare."

In recent weeks cars have been torched with firebombs, shots have been fired into a civic complex on the waterfront and at a building housing the radio station, and the hallway outside a pool hall has been bombed. **********The Mayor maintains an open administration, and anyone with a problem is still invited to his office. But he is being more cautious these days. He has stopped taking random walks after receiving death threats that the police are treating as genuine. 50,000 Cartons a Day **********The Ontario Provincial Police estimate that 50,000 cartons of cigarettes are brought into Canada each day near Cornwall. The retail value is $1.5 million, the kind of money that the authorities say has lured organized crime to the area. **********Canadian taxes on cigarettes are five times greater than American taxes. A result is that a carton in Canada costs more than $45, while prices south of the border are in the $15 to $20 range. The contraband cartons now flooding Canada usually sell for about $30. **********According to one estimate, by the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' Marketing Board, one in four cigarettes sold in Canada is illegal. So many outlets promote the contraband that hundreds of corner stores dependent on legal tobacco sales have shut down. **********Mayor Martelle -- a 50-year-old former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who has lived in Cornwall all his life, started a business here and raised a family -- is a target in this new war because of tough measures he took against the smugglers, including organizing a special police task force. **********In its first seven weeks, the task force, drawn from the Mounties and the Ontario provincial and Cornwall police, seized $1.7 million worth of contraband cigarettes. Admitting His Fear **********""They didn't much like that,"" the Mayor said, referring to the gangs that have invaded the community. ""The heat is coming down against them. As this happens, the pressure against myself intensifies. A lot of people would like me to go away, including some of my own citizens, who are buying these cigarettes or who themselves are involved with certain groups."" **********The black pager on the Mayor's desk is emitting static. He switches it off and looks out of his second-floor office in City Hall at a wintry landscape of bare, gnarled trees. **********""I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared,"" he said. ""I don't like the life I'm leading now. I feel extremely sorry for my wife. It's no fun having police come into your house at midnight and haul you out and put you in hiding for a while."" **********Ontario, which faces a deficit in the current fiscal year of more than $10 billion, loses between $150 million and $250 million a year to tax evasion on smuggled cigarettes. In all of Canada, the loss is in excess of $500 million. **********Revenues are being ""stolen,"" said the province's Finance Minister, Floyd Laughren, that would otherwise ""help pay for valuable services such as health care, education, training and other programs."" **********But as long as the wide price gulf exists, most officials concede that little can be done to stem the flow. **********""We could turn the area into a police state, I suppose,"" said Inspector Chris Lewis of the Ontario Provincial Police. ""But nobody wants that."" **********With its picturesque waterfront, busy industrial park, two museums, half a dozen churches, a regional art gallery and a population of 47,000, Cornwall is one of Ontario's oldest settlements, founded in 1784 by British loyalists who moved north after the American Revolution. But the tobacco smuggling has made it a frontier town in the old-fashioned sense. **********""It's like the gold rush,"" said Staff Inspector Stuart McDonald of the Cornwall police. ""When you had the Klondike, it attracted a lot of people with questionable character. Here you have the organized-crime gangs that want to be part of the action."" **********The situation is almost the reverse of what happened in the 1920-33 Prohibition era in the United States, when mobsters like Al Capone amassed fortunes taking Canadian liquor south. **********Much of the illegal trade is conducted through the Akwesasne reserve, which straddles the border and is the home of some 12,000 Mohawks, residents of both countries. Historic agreements support their right to transport tax-free goods across the border. Under the Jay Treaty of 1794, for instance, the British and the Americans formally granted Mohawks the right to pass into their respective territories and carry on trade across the border free of any tax or duty. **********Although Canada's Constitution recognizes Indian treaty rights, the police and the Indians have clashed over questions of sovereignty. **********At least six killings on the reserve have been attributed to smuggling in the last few years. Law enforcement officials say they are worried about links between the Mohawk Warrior Society, a group of militant and often armed supporters of Mohawk sovereignty, and Mafia groups, Chinese triads and biker gangs that control cheap cigarette distribution in big Canadian cities. **********But Mike Mitchell, the Akwesasne Grand Chief, said that ""a lot more people"" were smuggling off the reserve than on it and that his people were as much concerned with the violence as anyone else. **********Chief Mitchell argues that Canada's political leaders are exploiting the emotional issue of smuggling to deny indigenous people their legitimate right to unimpeded cross-border trade. **********""I'm pretty sick and tired,"" he said. ""When we talk border crossing rights, the non-Indian people and the media all say cigarette trade. These are two very separate issues."" Mohawk Police Stay Aloof **********The Mohawk police have refused to take part in the team to fight the smuggling. They fear that it could lead to clashes between Indians and officers. **********The violence, which the police believe is a result of attempted hijackings or other conflicts between the gangs, invariably occurs late at night. **********Inside Mr. C.'s Coffee & Cones, a snack bar on Pitt Street, a few blocks from the water, Myrna McCaig, who works at the school board and has lived in Cornwall for 23 years, said as she sipped coffee: ""I don't like all this violence one bit. It makes you unnerved."" **********""If you reduced the cigarette tax, you'd take away part of the problem,"" she added. ""You wouldn't cure it all, but the market wouldn't be as open."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/04/world/hiroshima-journal-museum-s-a-bomb-message-there-s-more-to-it.html,David Sanger,1994-08-04,,880,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Hiroshima Journal; Museum's A-Bomb Message: There's More to It,Hiroshima Journal; Museum's A-Bomb Message: There's More to It," **********For two generations the millions of Japanese schoolchildren who filed through the grim exhibits of the atomic bomb museum at ground zero here saw history through Hiroshima's distinctive prism, and they could easily be forgiven for thinking that World War II started on Aug. 6, 1945. **********That was the day the bomb was dropped, and the devastation that followed has always been presented in this city's Peace Memorial Museum with only the briefest reference to the politics of the era or Japan's responsibility for starting the war that the bombing ended. **********For 40 years the Hiroshima museum fed Japan's sense of victimization, retelling the heartbreaking stories of ordinary citizens riding trollies or sitting on the steps of a bank when the bomb was dropped, incinerating the city and sending 150,000 people to painful deaths from burns or radiation sickness. **********But now, just as Hiroshima begins to think about how to commemorate the 50th anniversary next year of the world's first atomic bombing, the message is changing just a bit. **********""Some of us believe that when we think about the bomb, we should think about the war, too,"" Hiroshima's Mayor, Takashi Hiraoka, said the other day as he walked through the most vivid symbol of such thinking -- a new museum. **********Connected to the old one by a skywalk, it is meant to fill Hiroshima's historical amnesia about the days before the bombing, describing in uncomfortable detail the city's role in the war effort. ""The world is changing,"" he said, ""and so perhaps should our view of history."" **********Mr. Hiraoka's view and the museum project he pressed after taking office four years ago are not popular with everyone here. Japanese rightists have long opposed mixing the history of the war with the Hiroshima bombing. **********But through a painful chipping away at the consensus, Mr. Hiraoka, a former journalist, began to win supporters. And when the new museum opened in June, residents discovered a city from the time before the bombing that most of them never knew existed. **********It was a city in which factories had been converted to build military hardware and where the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipyard turned out giant warships. There are vivid photographs of the Koreans and Chinese brought from Japan's colonies as forced labor, and the military headquarters in the midst of town. **********While the old museum portrayed the people of Hiroshima as innocents, unaware of the war around them, the new one includes photographs of a lantern parade one night to celebrate the capture of Nanjing. (The Japanese-language captions below the prints carefully skirt the delicate question of how many Chinese were killed by Japanese forces, saying simply that there are ""several theories, ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands."" The English-language caption cites the figure used by the Chinese: 300,000.) **********Some visitors are clearly taken aback. ""I didn't know how deeply Hiroshima was involved in the war,"" said Kimiko Kimoto, a housewife who moved here seven years after the bombing, when it was still in ruins. **********Students coursed through the exhibits, dominated by a three-story reproduction of the famous A-Bomb Dome, the shell of a bombed-out building, which became a memorial to the victims. The middle-school students said they knew so little about the war that they were having a hard time making sense of the exhibits. **********While the new exhibits do not support the American decision to bomb Hiroshima, they do, for the first time, lay out for the Japanese the choices facing President Truman. **********""Your country sometimes says that hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were saved by the bombing,"" Mr. Hiraoka said, ""but I think most of us believe the U.S. wanted to drop the bomb as quickly as possible,"" in part to establish its predominance in the postwar world. **********The upper floors of the new museum are devoted to sequels to the bombing: a 45-year nuclear arms race, atmospheric testing and a cold war that turned Japan into the Pacific's biggest site for electronic intelligence-gathering stations and other American military hardware. **********The argument over how to portray the bombing is spilling across the Pacific. After long negotiations, the city has agreed to lend some of its exhibits to the Smithsonian Institution for an exhibit in Washington next year that will feature the restored Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the bomb. **********When first approached, Mayor Hiraoka said, Hiroshima worried that the Smithsonian planned to ""display the Enola Gay to glorify or justify the A-bomb."" The museum assured officials here that they would give equal weight to the political decision that led to dropping the bomb and to the devastation it caused. **********The Smithsonian has faced another set of protests, from American veterans: they fear that the Smithsonian will fail to treat the bombers as heroes. **********The Air Force Association has said it is concerned that the exhibit will treat ""Japan and the U.S. as if their participation in the war were morally equivalent."" It would be wrong, it says, to pull heartstrings by portraying Hiroshima's devastation. **********""The veterans wanted the exhibit to stop when the doors to the bomb bay opened,"" a Smithsonian official said. ""And that's where the Japanese wanted it to begin."""

Such a withdrawal would pave the way for elections that would legitimize Palestinian rule in the territories that they will be allowed to control. **********In a news conference with Mr. Christopher after their hourlong meeting, Mr. Arafat made clear to those Palestinian militants who carry out terrorist acts that only the political organization that governs in his name is in charge. **********""We are proud of our democracy,"" Mr. Arafat said, speaking in English. ""But everybody has to understand that there is one authority. It is the Palestine National Authority in the Palestinian territories, and everybody has to respect the law."" **********Mr. Arafat essentially acknowledged that he understood that unless Israel felt secure, the troops would not withdraw and the elections would not take place. **********""We are looking to have very quickly the elections,"" Mr. Arafat said. ""But at the same time, we are putting into consideration the needs of security for the Israelis, and we are ready to discuss it in detail with them."" **********Ninety-four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian militants since the agreement was signed in September 1993. **********The atmosphere in today's meeting between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Arafat was dramatically better than when they met at the seat of Palestinian rule in Gaza in July. During that meeting, Mr. Arafat angered the Israelis when he asserted that they had usurped his role by inviting King Hussein of Jordan to Jerusalem, and he frustrated his American visitors by failing to get his financial house in order. **********Today, by contrast, Mr. Christopher praised Mr. Arafat for better fiscal management in recent months, which has convinced donor states to send previously committed funds and pledge even more. **********Eight days ago the United States, Russia and the European Union promised to provide $105 million by the end of March to cover the budget deficit of the Palestinians' fledgling administration and to speed up aid to Israeli-occupied territories. Palestinians have complained that they have reaped few financial benefits from making peace. **********""It was the best meeting I ever had with Chairman Arafat,"" Mr. Christopher told President Ezer Weizman of Israel, an aide to Mr. Christopher quoted him as saying. **********""Excellent! Terrific!"" a State Department official who attended told CBS News. **********Even the ever cautious Mr. Christopher told reporters that he and Mr. Arafat had closed the philosophical divide that has characterized their earlier meetings. **********""I encouraged the chairman today and his colleagues to create a rule of law and other institutions which will give Palestinians an effective government, an accountable government, the kind of government they deserve and need,"" Mr. Christopher said. **********""The chairman also made it clear that he understands the responsibilities and commitments that he has undertaken in the Declaration of Principles and that he intends to carry out those responsibilities against terrorism and violence."" **********The question that Palestinian leaders sometimes pose quietly is this: If the forces of the Israeli Army cannot stop terrorism in the occupied territories how can they? But the Declaration of Principles signed by the Israelis and Palestinians requires Mr. Arafat to curb Palestinian violence. **********Under extraordinarily tight security, Mr. Christopher and his entourage drove in armored vehicles through Israeli and Palestinian checkpoints to Mr. Arafat's modest, one-story headquarters on the Mediterranean. **********The meeting went so well that Mr. Christopher's praise of Mr. Arafat seemed to soften remarks made upon his arrival in Israel Tuesday evening that were widely interpreted as a sign of Washington's mounting frustration with Mr. Arafat for failing to end terrorist attacks by Palestinian groups on Israeli targets. **********But Mr. Christopher suggested again today that Israel cannot be expected to withdraw its army from the occupied West Bank until Palestinian attacks on Israel come to an end. **********""No one who is familiar with Israel's history can reasonably expect Israel to move toward the objective without insuring that their security remains a constant companion of the peace and the efforts to succeed in peace efforts,"" Mr. Christopher told reporters after a meeting this morning with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. **********Contrary to earlier suggestions that Israel might not live up to its agreement to withdraw its troops from the West Bank, Mr. Rabin said at the same news conference, ""I believe that the Government of Israel should continue to stick to its policy, to do whatever we are committed by our agreements with the Palestinians and Jordanians."""

Recession and a costly rash of racism since German unification in 1990 have done their part to make a bad situation worse. **********For the brave few companies that have made the plunge, however, an investment has often paid off handsomely, as Robert Shaw can testify. **********""When people say it's wrong, I think that's the best time to invest because you get a better deal,"" said Mr. Shaw, president and chief executive officer of International Jensen Inc., a Chicago area-based stereo speaker maker that has bought two companies in Germany in the past two years and is hungry for more. **********""I wouldn't close the door on further acquisitions or other forms of relationships,"" he said. ""We're constantly window shopping."" **********International Jensen acquired Magnat Audio, one of Germany's top automotive and home speaker brands, in September 1992 and Mac Audio Electronic, a company that designs and markets car speakers and related electronics, a year later. **********Magnat, which was in bankruptcy proceedings when International Jensen bought it, has been in the black virtually from day one, according to Mr. Shaw, and Mac Audio, a key to the company's future expansion, is also reported to be performing well. **********The company's decisions illustrate the kind of investment Germany is attracting these days. Neither Magnat nor Mac Audio manufactures anything itself. Rather, both companies buy their products from partners in Germany and elsewhere and focus on sales and marketing. **********Since the end of the 1980s, in fact, foreign net investments in German holding companies and financial institutions have totaled 22 billion Deutsche marks ($14 billion), while manufacturing has seen a net divestment of 8.5 billion DM. **********But U.S. and other foreign companies continue to invest in Germany because it remains the world's third largest economy, hosts a growing financial center and is strategically located in a region with good prospects for long-term growth. **********""We see tremendous opportunities in our products in Europe and in an expanded Europe in the decades ahead,"" said Mr. Shaw, a former management consultant and White House official who joined International Jensen in 1984. **********The two biggest recipients of foreign investments among Germany's 16 federal states are North Rhine-Westphalia, which shares a border with Belgium and the Netherlands, and Hesse, which is dominated by the financial center - Frankfurt. **********At the end of 1991, the last year for which statistics were available, more than 85 percent of all foreign investment in Germany was located in no more than 5 federal states, all of which had good transportation facilities or were close to a border. **********In the course of European integration and the opening of eastern Europe, the Continent offers numerous alternatives to Germany, most of which boast lower wages and taxes. **********Many potential foreign investors, particularly Japanese companies, have also balked at growing xenophobic violence that has sullied the country's image abroad and raised questions about its political stability. **********Between 1982 and 1992, foreigners invested $25 billion in Germany overall, compared with $152 billion in Great Britain, $68 billion in France and $63 billion in Spain. In fact, among the world's leading industrialized countries, only Japan fared worse than Germany as a recipient of foreign investment, while the United States fared by far the best, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. **********But while Mr. Shaw said International Jensen would jump at an investment opportunity in Spain, Portugal or Hungary, he is convinced of the importance of consumer loyalty to national brands in the German market, Europe's biggest. **********""Even though Germans were getting more receptive to foreign-made products, a German brand name had immensely more recognition and probably a more favorable image,"" he said, describing the rationale for his company's investments. **********So far, International Jensen has concentrated its efforts in Germany on the so-called automotive after-market, as opposed to the market for pre-installed original equipment, where brand names are considered less important and profit margins considerably narrower. **********International Jensen is also focusing on exports, with Mr. Shaw hoping to increase international sales to 50 percent of the company's revenues in 1996 from about 20 percent in 1993."

Mr. Richardson's comments were printed in full today in both the Burmese and English-language editions of The New Light of Myanmar, the principal Government newspaper. 'Dumbfounded and Delighted' **********A Western diplomat in Myanmar said he was ""dumbfounded and delighted"" to see that in the paper. **********""I think they're laying the ground work for some sort of negotiations between Khin Nyunt and Aung San Suu Kyi,"" the diplomat said, referring to Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of Burmese military intelligence and the man considered by many to be Myanmar's new strongman. ""It would be astounding if they would use their official mouthpiece to put out this much praise for the negotiating process and for Suu Kyi if they didn't intend to negotiate."" **********In the comments printed today in Myanmar, Representative Richardson described Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as ""a woman of towering intellectual ability and strength of conscience."" **********""She is a woman of passion and commitment,"" Mr. Richardson said.

U.S. policy with Burma will improve only if Aung San Suu Kyi is released without condition as well as other political prisoners, and a genuine democratization effort takes place. Aung San Suu Kyi should be let free."" Announcement on Radio **********The Burmese junta clearly wanted to draw the public's attention to Representative Richardson's remarks since the Burmese state radio ran an announcement Thursday night alerting Burmese that the transcript would appear in the newspapers this morning. **********During his visit to Myanmar, Representative Richardson met twice with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi (pronounced awng san sue chee) at her family compound, which has served as her prison for nearly five years, and twice with General Khin Nyunt. **********""The most productive effort that I can undertake is to get Aung San Suu Kyi and General Khin Nyunt together for talks,"" he said in other remarks also republished today. ""Let me stress that I also believe that Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt is a pragmatic individual who is sincere about wanting to resolve the divisions in his country."" **********Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has already agreed to the talks. General Khin Nyunt has not made a reply, although diplomats in Yangon, the capital formerly known as Rangoon, said today that the decision to publish such highly complimentary remarks about the democracy leader in the tightly controlled Burmese press meant that negotiations could now be only a matter of time. A Sign of Policy Change **********""It sounds like they are serious,"" said another Western resident of Yangon. ""It's the kind of thing we want to see. This is the first time we've ever had anything like this in the papers. I think this is as significant a litmus test for a change in the Government's policy than the actual meeting"" between Mr. Richardson and Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. **********Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of a national hero, Aung San. In 1990, despite her detention, her opposition party won a landslide victory in national elections called by the military. The junta then refused to honor the results and arrested many of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's followers. **********She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her nonviolent campaign to bring democracy to her homeland. **********Diplomats offer a variety of opinions why the junta has apparently decided to ease the restrictions on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. Many say that the junta's leaders have come to the belief that Myanmar will never break out of decades of economic stagnation unless the issue of her detention is resolved."

Air France said there were 271 passengers and 12 crew members; the Algerian Interior Ministry put the number of passengers and crew at 232. **********Algerian Government officials said tonight that the gunmen had killed at least two men among the passengers and had announced their intention of forcing the plane to fly to an unknown destination. The gunmen released 57 Algerian passengers, mainly women and children. **********""Their only demand so far is to be able to take off,"" Algeria's Interior Minister, Abderrahmane Meziane-Cherif, said tonight. ""They have not indicated where."" **********[ Six gunshots were heard late Saturday night, after the first reports of casualties, but it was not clear who did the firing, The Associated Press reported from Algiers. Gunfire broke out again early Sunday but reporters, who were kept outside the airport, could not tell who was shooting. ] **********The hijacking focused attention anew on the continuing political turmoil in Algeria, where for three years Islamic fundamentalists have been trying to topple an army-backed Government. At least 10,000 people have been killed. **********The civil war erupted after the Government canceled a second round of parliamentary elections in January 1992 that would probably have brought Islamic fundamentalists to power. Despite efforts to negotiate a peace settlment this year, violence is reported almost daily. **********An Air France spokeswoman said the four gunmen blocked the plane as it headed for the runway. The spokeswoman said the men were wearing ground-crew uniforms and climbed aboard the plane. **********During much of the day, neither the identity nor the motivation of the gunmen was clear, but tonight French television and radio quoted freed passengers as saying the men had recited Muslim prayers and had distributed scarves so women could cover their heads. **********Reports from Algeria said the gunmen were negotiating with the local authorities, but they had not spelled out their demands beyond insisting on clearance to take off. Algeria's Interior Minister said one of the two men killed was an Algerian plainclothes policeman who tried to resist the hijacking. Other unconfirmed reports put the number of dead at three to seven. **********Air France officials said most of the passengers were Algerians, either residents of France or carrying visas to visit close relatives living here. Two French diplomats were also reportedly on board. **********Mr. Cherif, the Algerian Interior Minister, said the passengers include 20 French citizens, a Tunisian, a Chinese and a Vietnamese. **********Earlier in the day, there were hopes that the hijackers were simply Algerians trying to flee the country. Six weeks ago an Air Algerie plane was hijacked to Majorca, Spain, by gunmen who said they wanted to leave Algeria, a reflection of the growing difficulty faced by Algerians in obtaining exit visas. **********But tonight's reports that the gunmen appeared to be Islamic fundamentalists threatened to complicate negotiations. The banned Islamic Salvation Front has strongly criticized France, Algeria's former colonial ruler, for backing the Algerian Government. It has also been angered by a recent crackdown by the French police against suspected supporters of the front among France's three million Muslims. **********A more militant organization, the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, has so far killed 80 foreigners, including 24 French citizens, as part of its campaign to drive foreign workers, aid officials and diplomats out of the country. Since 1992, the number of French citizens in Algeria has fallen from 10,000 to fewer than 1,000. **********Flight 8969 was due to leave Houari Boumedienne Airport at 11:25 A.M. and to land at Orly, outside Paris, at 1:35 P.M. The Algiers airport was closed to all traffic and its terminal cleared of all visitors."

But what arebonds? **********They are bought and sold in their millions, but small investors and readers are constantly asking for basic information on these securities - often after they have already committed capital to them. **********Leaving aside direct investments in bonds, the market in pooled investments through the medium of mutual funds is huge. According to statistics produced by DWS, the mutual fund arm of Deutsche Bank, bond funds, including short-term bond and money market funds, accounted for more than half of the 2.16 trillion Deutsche mark ($1.38 trillion) European mutual fund market at the end of 1993. Bond funds made up more than a third of the U.S. fund market, and nearly 40 percent of the Japanese fund market. **********Clearly, small investors, who are the most common users of mutual funds, like bonds.

They typically offer a stream of income for a period of years. The income is usually set at a fixed level. What varies is the price at which you buy the income stream. Some analysts like to divide the cost of buying the bond by the price and call it the yield. This they compare to interest rates on bank deposit accounts and other investment media competing for our money. **********""Guaranteed"" bonds are usually mutual funds that invest in derivatives contracts, promising that investors' capital will be returned after a number of years. Investor confusion about the difference between a bond and a fund using derivatives calling itself a bond has been heightened by the recent trend for new fund launches to be sold to traditional bond investors. The managers are seeking to tap the liquidity of the huge bond market. **********""High Income"" and other such names are just that - names invented by marketing people to persuade investors that they are buying something that has the relative solidity of a bond. **********Caveat emptor."

Caporali. The letter said that Grumman's board had decided a free and open competitive bidding process was in the best interests of shareholders, customers and suppliers. **********""The board of directors is mindful that the process in which the company is currently engaged does present certain risks,"" Mr. Caporali wrote. ""In order to mitigate those risks, the board of directors believes that the most prudent course of action is to bring this process to a prompt and orderly close."" **********The letter was sent in response to separate letters sent last week by Northrop and Martin Marietta requesting that Grumman establish bidding procedures. **********The letters are the latest, and possibly penultimate, stage in a process that began earlier this month, when Grumman said it had agreed to be acquired by Martin Marietta in a $1.93 billion deal worth $55 a share. Days later, Northrop made a hostile bid to take over Grumman for $60 a share, or $2.04 billion. **********Martin Marietta's offer is scheduled to expire April 4, and Northrop's four days later. A spokesman for Martin Marietta said the company had received the letter, was reviewing its contents and would respond at the appropriate time. **********Northrop's response was more pointed. In a sharply worded two-page letter released late yesterday, Northrop's chairman and chief executive, Kent Kresa, said Grumman's bidding rules were unfair. **********In his letter, Mr. Caporali said the offers must be submitted to Goldman, Sachs & Company, Grumman's financial adviser, no later than 5 P.M. on Thursday, and that the offers would remain confidential until 9 A.M. on April 4. In observance of Good Friday, the New York Stock Exchange will be closed on April 1. **********Byron Callan, a defense and aerospace industry analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, compared Grumman's letter to contract competitions held by the Defense Department. **********""The Defense Department has 'best and final offer' auctions,"" Mr. Callan said.

I think this is Grumman saying they want to get the whole thing done with."" **********Stock traders reacted to the news by bidding up Grumman's shares by $1.625 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $64.875. Martin Marietta's stock rose by 75 cents a share, to $46. But Northrop's share price dropped by $1.375, to $42.75. **********Analysts and stock arbitragers said the drop in Northrop reflected a belief among investors that it was more likely to raise its bid. **********The Los Angeles-based military contractor is perceived as viewing the Grumman acquisition as a necessary step to cement its place in a shrinking weapons industry. According to analysts, Martin Marietta does not face similar pressures. **********Mr. Kresa of Northrop charged that by asking Northrup to submit its highest bid by 5 P.M. Thursday, Grumman was effectively asking Northrop to bid against itself, since its $60-a-share bid has been on the table for two weeks. **********Analysts said Mr. Kresa's letter reflected Northrop's frustration with the bidding process, which Grumman now seems to control. **********""I can't blame Northrop from being frustrated,"" Mr. Callan said. ""But it's a game of poker. The question is, is Martin Marietta holding four aces, or are they going to fold?"" **********Even though Grumman set a Thursday deadline, Mr. Callan and other analysts said the bidding process could easily go beyond then.

Perry, arguing that the instability in Russia could lead to a renewal of the cold war, said today that the Pentagon needed to continue nuclear weapons programs to ""hedge"" against that possibility. **********In a speech at George Washington University two days before he is to leave for a trip to Russia and several Soviet republics, Mr. Perry made a forceful argument for continuing military cooperation with Moscow and providing aid to the former Soviet states to dismantle their weapons of mass destruction. **********But even as he expressed his hopes for a warming of relations, Mr. Perry said the Pentagon was guarding against a possible renewal of the arms race between the superpowers. **********Aides to Mr. Perry portrayed the speech as the policy equivalent of ""tough love."" Much of the speech seemed to be aimed more at a domestic audience than a Russian one, and aides said it was intended to respond to conservative critics, such as former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who have characterized the Administration as naive for believing that it could cooperate with Russia without lowering its guard. **********Such sentiments have resurfaced since the arrest last month of of an American agent on charges that he spied for Moscow. A Push for Military Spending **********Mr. Perry's speech was also intended to buttress the case for a continued high level of military spending. The Pentagon is seeking $264 billion in spending for the 1995 budget year, and Mr. Perry acknowledged in his address that some of the funds the Pentagon is seeking cannot be justified by the threats that currently confront Washington. **********The Defense Secretary's comments contrasted sharply with that of his precedessor, Les Aspin, who said last year that the Russian military threat was going away and was unlikely to be reconstituted. **********In his speech, Mr. Perry defended the Administration's handling of relations with Moscow, saying that there was no contradiction between viewing Moscow as a partner and a rival. Two-Pronged Prediction **********Still, Mr. Perry outlined two very different possibilities. ""Reality number one is that even with the best possible outcome imaginable in Russia today, which is a fully democratic and market-oriented Russia, the new Russia will have interests different from our interests,"" Mr. Perry said. ""Even with allies, like France and Japan, we have rivalry and competition alongside our partnership, and so will it be with Russia."" **********""Reality number two is a worst case outcome is possible, and we must be prepared for it,"" the Defense Secretary added. ""It is possible that Russia will emerge from her turbulence as an authoritarian, militaristic, imperialistic nation, hostile to the West. In such a situation, we could indeed see a renewal of some new version of the old cold war, Russia without the Warsaw Pact but still with a formidable nuclear arsenal."" **********Pentagon officials said that the White House approved the speech and that early drafts contained an even more extensive discussion of the ""hedges"" the Defense Department needed to protect itself against the possibility of a resurgent Russia. **********Outlining some of those measures, Mr. Perry said the United States needed to continue research and development on nuclear weapons. He also said Washington needed to continue producing nuclear-tipped Trident missiles and Seawolf nuclear attack sumarines at a low rate so that it could expand weapons production if Russia and the United States ever got locked into another arms race. Further, he said, the United States needed to upgrade its tanks. **********Pentagon officials also said that Mr. Perry had directed them to develop additional measures in terms of nuclear targeting, strategy and forces. Planting Defense Hedges **********On arms control, Mr. Perry noted that the United States was already dismantling many of the weapons that would be eliminated under the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty as a budgetary measure, even though the agreement is not yet officially in force. **********But as a ""hedge,"" he added, the United States will not make the deep cuts that are called for under the second strategic arms treaty ""until we see comparable reductions being made in Russia."" **********While noting instability in Russia, Mr. Perry made clear that the Pentagon hoped to work with the Russians and did not plan to fight with them. **********""Russia can be both our partner and our rival -- and both at the same time,"" Mr. Perry said. ""We have to realize that our relationship has elements of both."" **********""This seems to be lost on the some critics of the policy of constructive engagement,"" he added. ""They say we have chosen to make Russia a partner when, in fact, we should be making them a rival. And I contend that is a false dichotomy."""

The magazine will offer advice on investment decisions and will include interviews with financial experts. **********Among the newspapers that have signed up so far, according to Lou Eccleston, the Bloomberg official in charge of sales, are The Boston Herald, The Chicago Sun-Times, The Daily News in New York, The Dallas Morning News, The Denver Post and The Houston Chronicle. Bloomberg, which is still negotiating with newspapers in other cities, pledges a circulation base of five million readers for the first issue, tentatively scheduled for Sept. 11. Plans call for four issues as a monthly, with weekly publication beginning early next year. **********The venture will test whether Michael Bloomberg, the founder of the financial news service, can wring another product -- with a new, consumer focus -- from his company's information offerings. **********Mr. Bloomberg's core business is providing financial data to businesses through computer terminals he leases to 39,000 customers. He runs Bloomberg Financial Markets, which provides the computerized financial data, and Bloomberg Business News, a wire service. Other Bloomberg holdings are WBBR-AM, an all-business-news radio station in New York, and Bloomberg Direct, a satellite television service for financial information. **********Newspapers that have agreed to distribute Bloomberg Personal see it as a way to increase Sunday circulation and gain new advertisers. Individual newspapers can sell ads for the magazine that will appear only in their markets. **********""I'm sure there are advertisers who will try it who currently aren't using newspapers,"" said Kirk MacDonald, senior vice president of marketing for The Denver Post.  Because it will be published independently, Bloomberg Personal differs from most Sunday newspaper magazines, which are published by the newspapers. Its focus on a single topic also sets it apart from national Sunday supplements like USA Weekend and Parade. **********Distribution costs will be low for Bloomberg Personal because the newspapers will be inserting and delivering the magazine. **********Mr. Bloomberg said that the magazine would be profitable from the outset and that half its ad pages were already sold for the coming year. **********""Frankly, it's not a big investment for him,"" said Norman Pearlstine, a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, who helped conceive Smart Money, a fast-growing personal-finance magazine. ""He can look at a new service at little or no cost, differently than people doing it on their own."" **********Mr. Bloomberg is offering the magazine to one newspaper for each market. While the newspapers will bear the costs of inserting the magazine, they will receive half of all revenues above production costs. **********""We feel that's very equitable,"" Mr. MacDonald said. ""It gives us an additional element for readers that our competition can't."" The Denver Post has a Sunday circulation of 450,000, while its rival, The Rocky Mountain News, has 458,000. **********Consumer hunger for personal-finance advice has prompted new entries in a magazine field dominated by Money magazine and Kiplinger's Personal Finance. The newcomers include Smart Money, a joint venture of Dow Jones & Company and the Hearst Corporation, and Worth, a publication of Fidelity Investments. **********Bloomberg Personal will not be the only personal-finance magazine inserted in newspapers. Readers in some affluent areas near major cities have been receiving Nest Egg, a monthly publication of Investment Dealers' Digest, in suburban newspapers since February. **********Many daily newspapers have been adding personal-finance features to their business coverage. For Bloomberg's staff to succeed, said Neil Wertheimer, Money section editor of The Orange County Register in Southern California, ""they're going to have to prove themselves with a new genre of business writing."" **********William H. Inman, the managing editor of Bloomberg Personal, says it can be done. ""Lots of people with money don't have financial advisers,"" he said. ""This gives them advice in their living room at no more cost than the local newspaper."" **********Mr. Inman said the editorial content would be new material, not repackaged information from other Bloomberg services. The magazine's articles, however, will be available on the news service on the day of publication in the newspapers. **********The magazine will rely on an editing staff of about 20 people and Bloomberg's current staff of reporters and freelancers."

If the flow of refugees, which has dwindled to a trickle, should pick up again, officials say, Washington may revive the idea of sending Haitians to third countries. **********The lack of urgency on refugees, however, has not altered the pace of planning for a possible invasion of Haiti, the officials said. They said the Administration had begun laying the groundwork with United Nations approval Sunday of a resolution authorizing intervention if sanctions fail to dislodge the Haitian military-backed government. Support for U.S. Invasion **********And they said the White House would continue lining up support among other countries as well as with Congress and the American public, beginning with a prime-time news conference by President Clinton on Wednesday night. These preparations mean that an invasion would not be likely before the end of this month, officials say. **********President Clinton's senior national security advisers met at the White House today to discuss Haiti. The advisers were expected to assess military preparations for an invasion and to discuss whether to set a public deadline for Haiti's generals to leave, one Administration official said. **********Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas, and Representative Benjamin Gilman, Republican of New York, said in separate statements today that Mr. Clinton should seek Congressional approval in addition to the United Nations authorization before committing American forces to Haiti. **********The White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, responded that Mr. Clinton would continue consulting with Congress on Haiti ""but would not support a resolution that would require approval"" because such an effort ""would interfere with his ability to make foreign policy."" Flow of Refugees **********Just a month ago, the Administration's most pressing concern was dealing with the outflow of Haitians from their impoverished homeland. The outpouring forced Mr. Clinton to shift his policy abruptly on July 6 to bar Haitians intercepted at sea from resettling in the United States. Instead, they would be taken to ""safe havens"" in third countries until Haiti's political crisis was resolved. **********About half a dozen countries have agreed to accept refugees, including Suriname, Dominica and St. Lucia, but the Administration's new policy has apparently stemmed the flow of boat people and delayed at least for now the need for more camps. **********The Pentagon has spent $70 million this year to build and operate the sprawling camps at Guantanamo Bay, and $18 million to pitch tents and repair the airfield at a refugee-processing area in the Turks and Caicos Islands that has not yet been used.  The State and Justice Departments also expect to spend up to a total of $70 million on the refugee operations. **********Administration officials say there is little appetite to build more until the need arises. **********""It's much more cost-effective to have one camp with 10,000 people than three camps with 3,000 people each,"" said a Defense Department official. Site for Camps Undecided **********A senior Administration official said no decision had been made yet on when and where to open new camps, explaining that Washington was still considering the location that offered the ""biggest space at the lowest cost."" **********Suriname, which has agreed to take up to 2,500 people, would be the most likely site to accept additional refugees, a State Department official said. **********Refugee relief officials criticized the Administration's go-slow approach on opening new ""safe havens"" as an imprudent effort to cut costs that could backfire if boat people flee again in large numbers. **********""The essential bureaucratic impediment to moving ahead is a budgetary one,"" said Arthur C. Helton, director of migration programs for the Open Society Institute in New York. ""It's a typical short-sighted, short-term approach, because if the refugee flow increases again, it'll be too late. It will be an impossible effort to catch up with an emergency that certainly could have been anticipated."""

Shifting Sands **********For a time last year, it was the Americans who threatened air strikes to back up a plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims, who dominate the Government, and it was the French, among others, who opposed them. But at the NATO summit meeting two weeks ago, the United States agreed only reluctantly to France's call for a renewed commitment to air strikes to support the delivery of aid to Bosnia. **********Since then, the French position seems to have shifted again, from a military strategy that could involve air strikes against Bosnian Serbs, to a diplomatic strategy that would pressure the three factions, in particular the Muslims, to accept the Europeans' latest peace plan. The Bosnian Government has rejected the plan. **********In the interview, in English, Mr. Juppe insisted that Washington was content to let the 21-month war drag on and did not realize the consequences of its refusal to play an active diplomatic role in helping to end it. He said he had laid out a dire scenario for Mr. Christopher: the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers and the spread of war to the entire region. The peacekeeping mandate runs out in the spring. **********""I told the Secretary that the humanitarian track is not enough,"" Mr. Juppe said. ""The only way we can reach a political settlement is to join efforts -- the Europeans, the Americans and the Russians -- and put pressure on all three parties to sign an agreement, even if it is not exactly what the Europeans have proposed. **********""If the Americans do not convince the Bosnian Muslims that they must stop fighting and that there is no chance that the United States would come to their rescue, then the United States will give them incentives to pursue the fighting on the ground. **********""It would be a catastrophe. And we say to our American friends that they will be responsible for this.""  U.S. Points at the Serbs **********But in Washington, President Clinton rejected the French idea, telling reporters, ""I don't think that the international community has the capacity to stop people within that nation from their civil war until they decide to do it."" **********Mr. Clinton conceded that the Bosnian Muslims ""appear to be the most reluctant to sign a peace agreement at this time,"" because in recent months they have made some gains on the battlefield and feel that continued military pressure will bear fruit at the negotiating table. **********Washington takes the position that imposing peace would unfairly punish the Muslim-led Government. A senior Administration official, briefing reporters today on the condition that he not be identified, said Mr. Christopher ""made clear that we understand the main culprit is obviously the Serbs."" **********The real issue to be resolved is to convince the Serbs to make more territorial concessions, the official said. **********The official asserted that the French approach would also require the deployment of American ground troops, which the United States has refused to do until there is a workable peace settlement in place. **********Mr. Juppe (pronounced zhew-PAY) said he was not asking for American troops. He also said he had begun to drum up support for his proposal among the other 11 members of the European Union. ""If the French ask the Americans, the answer is no,"" he said. ""If the 12 express the same claim, perhaps the Americans will agree."" **********Mr. Juppe reflected Paris's frustration that its 6,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, the largest contingent in the 26,000-member United Nations force, are increasingly vulnerable to attack and may withdraw in failure next spring. **********Less than two weeks ago, France insisted at the summit meeting that the 16 NATO allies call for urgent action, including air strikes, to open Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia for relief flights and to open a corridor to Srebrenica, in eastern Bosnia. **********Tonight, Mr. Juppe dismissed the NATO move as a failure, saying it had no political support among the allies or with the United Nations leadership. No More 'Wait and See' **********""Warren Christopher told me today that there were six children killed in Sarajevo, and at the same time he told me everything was going well with the NATO initiative in New York,"" he said. ""He said, just wait and see. Well, a wait-and-see policy is no longer possible for moral and political reasons."" **********In remarks at a brief news conference with Mr. Juppe, Mr. Christopher reaffirmed Washington's commitment at the NATO talks to use air strikes if necessary, but he also repeated opposition to putting ground troops into Bosnia ""in order to resolve or impose a solution to the conflict there."" **********In Washington, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that after the NATO talks, consensus for air strikes eroded, saying, ""As soon as the meeting was over, it was unclear how strongly or firmly some of them felt about that."" He added that the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, also opposes air strikes, despite Mr. Boutros-Ghali's protestations that he does not oppose them. **********Mr. Christopher came to Paris to discuss human rights and other divisive issues with China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, and the two sides made some modest progress, senior Administration officials said. But Mr. Christopher found his day dominated by meetings with President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who called for more intense negotiations on Bosnia. **********Although Mr. Juppe expressed deep frustration with the Administration's determination to remain on the sidelines, his proposal also highlights the inability of his divided Government to forge a consistent policy on Bosnia, and a willingness to press for a peace plan that essentially rewards Serbian aggression. **********Last November, the European Union agreed to gradually ease sanctions against the Serbs if Bosnia's Muslims got a bit more land. At the NATO talks, the United States, which had never supported the plan, watered down language in the final communique that would have embraced it."

Mr. Damiani, who left I.B.M. to join Digital Europe on Jan. 1, was quoted in the press in February as anticipating cutting as many as 5,000 to 6,000 workers from Digital's European work force of 29,000 employees. **********The struggling computer giant does 64 percent of its business outside the United States. Digital's European operation accounted for nearly half of the company's $14 billion in revenues in 1993 and European employment peaked in 1991 with 41,000 employees. **********In an interview with Reuters in February, Mr. Damiani said he was examining the ""right size"" for Digital Europe as part of a plan for reviving revenue growth and cutting costs. ""My fundamental mind-set is in determining how many people we need rather than how many people we need to cut,"" he said. Cuts From the Bottom Up **********Nikki Richardson, a spokeswoman for the parent company, said the cutbacks were part of Digital's continuing program of staff reductions and that the European cuts would come from the bottom up, as is being done in the company's United States operations. **********With two large European acquisitions in the early 1990's, Digital added nearly 11,000 employees just as it began to reduce the rest of its work force. The company, based in Maynard, Mass., currently has 92,300 employees worldwide. **********William M. Steul, Digital's chief financial officer, estimated in January that the company would end the fiscal year with approximately 85,000 employees. Mr. Steul said the European market, particularly in Germany, France, Britain and Italy, had been weak for two years. **********Mr. Steul noted that the dollar's strength against European currencies continued to hurt Digital's revenues. But he said he expected to see a recovery in the company's European business later this year and next as the economy there turns around. **********Digital surprised analysts with a net loss of $72 million in its fiscal second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, 1993. That loss, along with a 12 percent revenue decline, signaled that the company's turnaround efforts were moving more slowly than anticipated. **********Digital's stock rose 50 cents yesterday, to $31.375, on the New York Stock Exchange."

Their clients report that demands for more collateral are routine, and the financial paper they trade is consequently being valued at less by their bankers. **********""After the volatile markets we've had, everybody is looking carefully at all highly leveraged funds,"" said the officer who signs off on credit lines for funds and traders at major New York commercial bank. ""I don't really know what a hedge fund is, but by my definition it means leverage, and that's what everyone is looking at to make sure they are fully secured."" **********So far no failures have been reported, and few, if any, are expected. The funds of the financier George Soros are known to be big enough to swallow the $600 million loss he acknowledged last month after the yen shifted against the dollar. **********Bankers Trust was reported to have lost as much as $100 million trading foreign bonds. J.P. Morgan's highly profitable emerging-markets division is believed to have been hit hard when Latin American bonds dropped after the Fed started raising U.S. interest rates. **********""Of course, that's after the hundreds of millions Morgan made last year in the same market,"" said the chief of a European bank in New York. ""If you are in Latin America for the long term like us, business is still good. When you trade, you are hurting - at least for now."" **********That means some bank traders will be temporarily sidelined in what they call ""the penalty box,"" because they have lost money up to the limits set by their employers for a specific period. That kind of policy lowers the bank's risk and thus becomes a self-correcting force in the market as a whole by slowing down traders. **********Nicholas Sargen of Prudential Global Fixed Income Advisers said that despite losses in the values of bonds he manages for pension funds, he was not badly hurt because his clients bought to earn income and ""long-term holders like us are O.K."" **********Central banks, including the Fed, gave short- term traders no explicit instructions for a turn toward prudence. But last month, regulators told banks to examine their involvement in risky derivatives, such as bond futures and currency options. **********This was underlined Friday when a Federal Reserve System governor, Susan Phillips, told a bond dealers' conference that the Fed would be doing more work on ""reporting, accounting, and disclosure"" in the derivatives market in conjunction with other central banks. **********But at the micro level, small operators are preceding with prudence, like C.P. Baker & Co. in Boston, which runs a venture-capital fund and a hedge fund. ""When people get sloppy, the bank makes you mark to market, and who knows what some of these things really are worth in the market,"" said Christopher Baker, C.P. Baker managing partner. **********He explained that if a future or an option was traded at prices between 100 and 110, his bank may decide to value it more prudently, at the lower end, instead of at the mid-point of 105. His credit line would be clipped by 5 percent. When multiplied by the estimated 1,300 hedge funds in the United States, with assets estimated at $60 billion, this kind of conservative valuation can have a significant effect on the markets. **********""In banker-talk, they tell you the market is more volatile, so they have to value at the lower price,"" he said. **********Roy Smith, a professor of finance at New York University and a former Goldman, Sachs & Co. partner, found this change in bank formulas normal and healthy. ""We were in the final quarter of the game and that's just when people start getting into it who ought not to,"" he said. ""Too much money was available to too few skilled people. Now the market is adjusting in a rational and calm way, and that's the way it's supposed to work."""

An unusually cold summer stunted their crops and late rains nearly washed them away. Now the frosts are only a few weeks off, and if they come any sooner the nation will suffer its worst harvest in three decades. **********""A lot in our country depends on the weather this autumn,"" Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin told a German television reporter recently, voicing the common concern that a particularly poor harvest will hasten the effects of an already visible farm crisis. ""What happens in the fields also has its effect on the political climate."" **********That has been true here for hundreds of years, of course. Almost nothing means more to Russians than bread, and debates about the annual grain harvest always herald the fall political season. **********As a practical matter, Russia's anemic harvest -- estimates suggest that it will be less than 85 million tons, not nearly enough to feed the people -- will hurt only the nation's pride and its pocketbook. The United States has already agreed to ship some of its surplus to Russia again this year. Nobody will go hungry. **********But despite the frenetic pace of the fall harvests, production of meat, milk, grain and vegetables has slipped each year since 1989. Clearly, weather is not the only problem confronting Russia's troubled farmers. Suspended between the lumbering world of a collective farm system that ran solely on the whims of the state and the brutal necessities of the free market, no section of the struggling economy has foundered as badly as agriculture. **********A year after President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a historic decree guaranteeing Russians the right to buy and sell private land, fewer than 5 percent of the nation's 10 million agricultural workers own anything that could be described as a farm. **********Government officials estimate that by the end of 1994 at least 30 percent of the farmers in Russia, big and small, will be bankrupt, although in today's Russia bankrupt industries and farms carry on like phantoms. Huge segments of society simply live by barter or in debt. **********Private farmers have fared worse than the others. In 1992, 4 out of every 100 farmers who went out on their own were driven to bankruptcy. Last year the figure rose to 14 percent, and in the first half of this year to 70 percent. **********By the end of the year, only a smattering of the farmers upon whom President Yeltsin once placed ""all the main hopes for a fundamental transformation of the agrarian economy"" will remain solvent. **********""The facts are sad but simple,"" said Aleksandr A. Nikonov, president of the Agrarian Institute, a branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. ""The transition to a free market has hurt farmers more than any other sector of this economy. The old system was irrational, but it has been replaced by no system. There are no supports, no credits, no loans or guidance. It is as if the Government said, 'You are free now; do it by yourself.' "" Farm Crisis Spreads To Rest of Economy **********The farm crisis has rippled through the economy with amazing speed. Tractor manufacturers -- once the glory of Soviet industry -- have virtually gone out of business from one end of the country to the other: nobody can afford their merchandise. Miners are threatening to strike, saying farmers are charging too much for grain, destroying their incomes. **********The results have embittered private farmers as well as employees of state kolkhozes, or cooperatives, whose average salary in May was 88,000 rubles (then worth about $46) -- lower than those for workers in any industrial segment of the economy. And they have postponed the day when Russia, one of the world's agricultural giants, will be able to feed itself. **********The politics of the farm crisis -- and of private land in this new democracy -- are complex, but the math is simple. Five years ago a pound of wheat bought twice its weight in diesel fuel. This season, farmers here need to trade nine pounds of wheat for two of fuel. **********In 1991 grain cost twice as much as fertilizer. Today, with much of the grain and livestock industry near collapse, fertilizer cost eight times as much as grain. **********Most economists say it will take years to turn the huge collective farms into competitive enterprises. **********""We should be proud that there is no hunger,"" said Viktor F. Lishchenko, director of agricultural business studies at the Academy of the National Economy of Russia. ""That itself is an achievement. You couldn't invent a more difficult task than turning this command farm economy into a free one."" Supply System Falls Into Chaos **********Clearly nobody could have expected the revolution to be finished in a day. But there are still almost no cooperative banks here. The supply system vital to food processing has been sundered. **********As a result, as much as 40 percent of all vegetables rot before they can be taken from the fields. Without money, new farm machinery is impossible to buy, and old machinery is hard to maintain. The State Agriculture Ministry says 68 percent of the farm machinery used in Russia today is more than 21 years old. **********Everyone agrees reforms are needed, but to the men and women who toil in the fields, much as they have since before the serfs were freed in 1861, reforms are only words. And the Russian peasant has never had a great regard for words from Moscow. **********""I was prepared to try it,"" said Vasily A. Starodubtsev, former head of the Soviet collective farm union and a member of the group that attempted a coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev in August 1991. He is still head of the Lenin Collective Farm not far from here. **********""I was prepared to try reforms and see what it would bring us,"" he said. ""What it has brought is the most well-developed disaster in 50 years. Even under bad Communism we lived fairly well. We were the masters of our own lives. We had hope. What he have now is nothing."" **********As head of the region's largest collective, he long ago decided that the new way was a bad way. The picture of Mr. Gorbachev attached to his wall five years ago is gone. Lenin is back above his desk now -- and so, apparently, are the principles he stood for. Though a Leninist, An Innovative C.E.O. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Starodubstev has earned a reputation as an innovator and a creative, if autocratic, leader among the 1,500 farmers who live and work there. Grain yields at the Lenin Collective are higher than at any other farm in the region. **********What is more, people live decently here. The bread is great and there is plenty of it. Workers put in 18- to 20-hour days this season, but there are always three meals, and there is always a bus to take them home when the day is finally done. When they get some free time, the farmhands can relax in the enormous sauna or swim in the indoor pool. **********""I can't say this is the best system in the world,"" said Mikhail G. Baklanov, 40, a tractor driver who, like his father and grandfathers, was born on a kolkhoz. ""But it is steady work. And I really don't see a path to anything better. I have friends who are on their own. They are trying to plow a field with three people. It's crazy."" **********Mr. Starodubtsev does all he can to hold on to his ""comrades,"" as he still calls them. **********When he realized that the Government would no longer buy his potatoes, he flew to Vienna and contracted to buy the finest potato chip maker he could find. Next year he plans to become one of the country's biggest chip manufacturers. The ovens in the Lenin bakery are all from Italy. The milking process is as automated and sophisticated as that on a technically advanced Wisconsin dairy farm. **********But the farm's profits have fallen in each of the last five years. This year it expects the first loss in a decade.  Greater Suffering For Private Farmers **********""Everyone is now trying to portray the farming crisis as the battle of the old-time farm collectives against the entrepreneurs,"" said Viktor I. Pashinin, a farmer from Tambov who is vice chairman of the Association of Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia. ""That is simplistic. When the Government yanked out the rug from beneath this industry they ruined all of us together."" **********Mr. Pashinin represents the new class of private farmer, a class that the Government has repeatedly sworn is vital to reform. **********But the private enterprise that comes from these farms is weak because the Government is afraid to support them, and starting fresh with no capital is almost impossible. In the past farmers would demand that the state buy their property. These days, that no longer works. **********""In Russia we always say how times are tough on the farm, but I know they have gotten worse,"" said Aleksandr G. Yefremov, Deputy Agriculture Minister. ""We don't have any real cooperative movement in this country the way America does. Nobody talks about going back on reform. What we do talk about is how fast to go forward."" **********Even those who did break up their kolkhozes have sad stories to tell. Unlike the trend in the United States, where every year most Americans get their food from bigger and more automated farms and where farm produce is heavily subsidized by the Government, what has been happening here is often the opposite. Land to the Tiller, Cows to the Milker **********Economists say the best way to break up a collective farm is to divvy it up like a New York City condominium apartment -- you don't own the actual place, just a portion of the building equivalent to the space you occupy. **********But most Russian farms have been split into irrational duchies. Milkmaids got cows and a plot of land. Mechanics got tractors. **********""We used to live on one big farm,"" said Raisa A. Sokovlkov, 53, a former head of the town council in Studenets. ""Now we live on 300. I am a milkmaid. I was given two cows. If you worked with chickens, you were given chickens. But I can't plow the 50 acres of land with a cow. And what if we could get it all out of the ground? Where would we sell it?"" **********It is a common complaint, particularly because criminal gangs tightly restrict access to big cities like Moscow. As a result, dozens of farmers stand all day long on the exit ramps of highways surrounding the city, selling produce the only way they can: out of the back of a truck. **********""We never lived well here,"" Mrs. Sokovlkov said. ""But aren't reforms supposed to make you live better?"""

""We can do it best by strengthening our ties. Over and over I heard that from the finance ministers."" Bentsen Moves With Caution **********For now, though, Mr. Bentsen is proceeding cautiously. The Asians, led by China, Japan and Malaysia, are wary of being part of an American-dominated economic alliance that might force them to follow Washington's dictates on human rights or trade. **********And while these countries increasingly need to coordinate their finances, they are widely divided on security issues -- most notably on North Korea, with no consensus on how to deal with the nuclear threat. **********Nevertheless, American officials could not help commenting on the contrast between the Group of Seven jobs conference they played host to in Detroit on Monday and this weekend's session of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC. **********In Detroit, the mood was somber and the discussion was about unemployment that was reaching critical proportions among the exclusively Atlantic members of the Group of Seven (Britain, France, Germany and Italy) but not in the Pacific ones (Japan, Canada and the United States). **********At this meeting, with such economic powerhouses as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Chile present, the mood was upbeat. **********As Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia remarked: ""We couldn't have been invited to Detroit. Our problem is a labor shortage."" Looking to the Future **********American officials do not want to say it out loud, but the conclusion is obvious: the Group of Seven increasingly seems like a relic of the cold war. The Asia Pacific group reflects the transformation of its region into the economic center of the world. It is about the future. **********Dressed mostly in blue blazers and casual slacks for a ""class photo,"" framed by palm trees and a deep blue Pacific, the ministers had a jaunty air about them -- 18 men who control more than half of the world's economy. **********It was clear from their final statement here that the financial integration already under way in the region was forcing these economies to coordinate more, despite their initial hesitations. They have $1 trillion a year in intra-regional trade alone, and economies now so intertwined that runaway inflation or unemployment in one major country can spill over into all the others. **********Their communique endorsed plans to double the capital of the Asian Development Bank. It asked the International Monetary Fund to study cross-border private investments into and within the region, to better understand how money is being raised, and it called on the Asian Development Bank to arrange a symposium on the problems of financing roads, bridges and power-plant projects. **********The ministers agreed to meet in Indonesia next year, and their heads of state have already scheduled a summit meeting for the Indonesian island of Bali this November.  Contrasts With Europe **********The Group of Seven began the same way in the mid-1970's. But turning the Asia Pacific group into a more permanent alliance will not be easy. The contrasts with Europe could not be more stark, said Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii. European regional integration took place under a single dominant power, the United States, in the face of an external threat, the Soviet Union. In Asia there is no dominant power and no external threat to drive the countries together. **********In Europe, Mr. Oksenberg added, it was the governments that led the drive to regional cooperation. In Asia the private sector and the financiers are leading the way. Finally, he said, in Europe nationalism had become something of a dirty word, given its links with protectionism and the two World Wars. In Asia nationalism is still seen positively, linked with independence from colonial masters and healthy economic competition. **********Maybe the biggest problem for the United States in trying to build a significant regional association is the tension in Washington's relations with Asia's two biggest powers -- Japan and China. **********Still, despite these cross currents, there are strong incentives for greater cooperation.

Aide Reproves U.S. on Somalia Pullout," **********The head of United Nations peacekeeping operations has bitterly reproached the Clinton Administration for its plans to withdraw United States forces from Somalia by late March, saying it failed to prepare Congress and the public for the possibility that the troops would suffer casualties. **********As a result of Clinton Administration policy, ""the impression has been created that the easiest way to disrupt a peacekeeping operation is to kill Americans,"" Kofi Annan, the Under Secretary General in charge of peacekeeping, said Friday night at a New York University Law School conference. **********Mr. Annan underlined his point by citing the Clinton Administration's abrupt withdrawal of a ship carrying American and Canadian soldiers to Port-au-Prince last October because of a threatening dockside demonstration by Haitians opposing Haiti's elected President. The campaign of intimidation derailed an agreement for the peaceful return of the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had been overthrown in 1991 by the military. **********The Clinton Administration decided on the phased withdrawal from Somalia last October after a disastrous raid against an armed Somali faction in which 18 Americans were killed and 75 were wounded. Frustration With the U.S. **********Mr. Annan made the remarks in a question-and-answer session after an address in which he criticized members of the 15-nation Security Council for a lack of steadfastness in pursuing their stated goals. His comments particularly reflect a growing frustration among senior United Nations officials with the Clinton Administration, which came to office vowing support for the United Nations but has since turned into one of its leading critics. **********The violence in Haiti and Somalia led the Clinton Administration to rethink its plans to use American peacekeepers as a buffer force in trouble spots around the world. After initially promising a foreign policy based on ""assertive multilateralism"" and saying the United Nations should be equipped with a small ""rapid deployment force"" to undertake hazardous missions, the Clinton Administration has refused to become more deeply involved in peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia, despite angry protests by France and some other Western governments. **********The United States will pull its forces out of Somalia unilaterally by March 31 and is discussing narrow guidelines for future American involvement in peacekeeping operations with Congress. **********The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has openly expressed irritation with the United States for repeatedly criticizing his organization when the Clinton Administration is withholding support for his efforts to resolve crises ranging from the former Soviet republic of Georgia to the tiny African nation of Burundi. **********In his address, Mr. Annan said that civil wars account for 9 of the 17 current United Nations peacekeeping missions. He said the Security Council, of which the United States is a permanent member, rushed to involve the United Nations in such conflicts but that such decisions were ""not always sufficiently backed by popular or legislative support."""

Number in party? Smoking, nonsmoking or modem-ready?"" **********Welcome to the cafe of the Dallas Infomart, a convention and sales center known as a high-technology showcase for the latest in computer products and networking. Within the permanent showrooms that many companies maintain at the Infomart, and at the 55 trade shows and 1,100 seminars and conferences being held there this year, high-tech business people can gather to talk shop and show their wares.  Coffee, Tea or Cables **********Now, at the newly opened High Tech Cafe, business can literally continue over lunch, as customers at selected tables can download their food and their Internet mail at the same time -- taking bytes between bites, as it were. **********""Hi, I'm Tim, and I'll be your client-server this afternoon,"" the waiter announced recently to a party of four at one of the restaurant's modem-ready tables. (It was sort of funny, if you're a computer geek.) ""May I get you a drink? An appetizer? An RJ-11 cable?"" **********Power lunchers at the Four Seasons in New York have long had telephones at their tables, and in California the chirps of cellular phones and beepers mingle with the tinkling of ice cubes and silverware. For years, delicatessens in Manhattan have taken orders by facsimile. **********But at the Infomart, a striking glass building at downtown's edge patterned after London's 19th-century Crystal Palace, the goal is to wine, dine and be on line. **********In a digital-age variation on the old ""stone soup"" fable, dozens of resident computer, networking and telecommunications companies that maintain sales showrooms in the Infomart are asked to contribute ideas and technology to make their local luncheon spot the hard-disk equivalent of the Hard Rock Cafe. **********""We never thought too much about budget, since we didn't have one,"" said Kevin N. Bennett, the Infomart's architect, referring to the restaurant's renovation. **********The restaurant had been around for nearly 10 years as High Tech Mex. But regulars in the information business decided that it wasn't in keeping with the technological nature of the building and proposed an overhaul. **********After two weeks of renovation by volunteers from Infomart's staff, the restaurant reopened on Aug. 19 as the High Tech Cafe. Telephone lines and power sources for laptop computers were strung beneath the central bank of tables. Broken computers from dusty storerooms were cannibalized -- perhaps the wrong choice of words under the circumstances -- for spare parts to decorate the restaurant. The Style: Early Computer **********""We basically had a big room full of junk,"" Mr. Bennett said. ""We redistributed our assets."" **********One tenant of the Infomart is the Center for Computer Assistance for the Disabled, a nonprofit group that finds productive uses for old or donated computer equipment. The junk computers were scavenged for the restaurant only if they could not be used by the group. **********Armed with screwdrivers, the volunteers went to work creating the restaurant's new decor. The overhead lights are encased in shells of old computer monitors. The green, leafy ""ferns"" in the corner are made from green circuit boards and cables. Screens between the dining area and the bar -- the Spacebar, to be exact -- are made of motherboards from defunct computers and calculators. **********Instead of flowers on each table, there are vases filled with computer key caps gouged from outdated keyboards. **********""When you don't have to put it back together, it's fun,"" said Jeff Anderson, the communications director of the Infomart, who is resigning to work for Electronic Data Systems, which has an Infomart showroom. Programming a Menu **********Mr. Anderson said the idea for the high-technology theme came during a lunch he had several months ago with Alan Weinkrantz, a public relations executive from San Antonio who often visited the Infomart carrying an I.B.M. notebook computer, a portable phone and other telecommunications devices. **********They enlisted the aid of Mr. Bennett and Michael Mudrone, an award-winning chef who now has the title of chief programmer. Showing an appetite for high-technology puns, Mr. Mudrone tailored his lunch menu -- which is printed on spreadsheet paper -- to the new theme. **********A diner can start with WYSIWYG -- geekspeak for ""what you see is what you get"" -- soup, onion token rings or a multimedia salad. Perhaps a computer club sandwich, or CD ROM-ano chicken? Mr. Mudrone's signature desserts include the LAN Mine, the Overload and the Crash. At happy hour, patrons of the Spacebar can order drinks like Fatal Error, a Memory Problem and Virus Protection. **********""I'm a computer-gadget kind of guy,"" Mr. Mudrone said, ""but I kind of feel a step behind the room now."" He appears almost as animated about the technology as he is about his food. RecordingListening to Today's Specials **********Instead of wheeling around a dessert cart, Mr. Mudrone said, he would like to wheel out a multimedia laptop that shows the desserts on a high-resolution color screen. He is experimenting with voice recorders that would play his spoken descriptions of each daily special to customers, and allow customers to relay their menu selections either by voice or touch-screen computers. **********""We thought about using Newtons for the waiters,"" Mr. Anderson said, referring to the hand-held computers that can beam files by infrared link to a computer in the kitchen. **********But, perhaps because of the Newton's much-publicized problems with handwriting recognition, the idea died, half-baked. ""The problem is, the waiter could write 'hamburger' and the order could come back 'overshoes,' "" Mr. Anderson explained. **********While the clientele of the restaurant is drawn almost exclusively from the business and computer communities, restaurant managers hope the new decor and menu will attract a broader base of customers. But competition is intense in Dallas, which, according to its Chamber of Commerce, has more restaurants per capita than New York City. The cafe's staff is aflutter as rumors circulate that Waltrina Stovall, the restaurant critic of The Dallas Morning News, plans a visit next week. Games and Showcases **********What's ahead for the cafe? Plans include a Doom Room, where individuals or groups can play Doom, a networked computer game that is phenomenally popular among the Internet's cognoscenti. **********Infomart officials and food-service managers are also discussing ""sponsored"" tables complete with computers, where diners would be able to explore various on-line services like Compuserve, Prodigy and America Online. For now, however, it is strictly B.Y.O.P. -- bring your own portable. **********And the staff hopes to transform the restaurant's empty wall space into a showcase for computer memorabilia, much the way the Hard Rock Cafe chain displays rock-and-roll artifacts. The first treasure to go on display: a bottle of toner particles, vintage 1959, from the original Xerox copier machine."

But in the short run, said David Munro of High Frequency Economics, ""It's amazing how flexible people are and how they manage when the temperature drops or the earth shakes."" **********The freeze will have a greater impact on national statistics because of its wider geographical reach, analysts said. Allen Sinai, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, said the sharpness of the cold snap could shave one- quarter to one-half a percentage point off growth in the first quarter, but this probably will be submerged by the wave of consumption spilling over from the end of last year that still could produce growth at a rate between 2.5 and 4 percent from January through March. (Latest indications from U.S. government officials are that growth in gross domestic product might have been as high as 6 percent in the final quarter of 1993.) **********No major economic forecaster has announced any change in the outlook for 1994 of about 3 percent growth nationwide. **********So far the cold wave and heavy snow have lasted a week to 10 days, and relief is forecast by the weekend. Although this has disrupted business, and cut housing starts and sales of all sorts, most economists say the result is likely to be a shift in spending patterns that will even out over time. **********For example, restaurants and shopping malls lose but utilities and oil companies gain. ""People don't go out to dinner and they stay home and turn up the furnace,"" said Cynthia Latta of DRI/McGraw Hill. **********Mr. Munro pointed out that in the medium term even the extra profits to the utilities will balance out elsewhere in the economy. This, he said, is the case because ""when the higher bills come in, they act as an excise tax and slow personal spending."" **********Chris Varveris of Laurence Meyer & Associates in St. Louis, Missouri, pointed out that U.S. national accounting methods could reduce corporate profits in the first quarter at an annual rate of $20 billion on paper because of California property losses and insurance company payouts, but the next quarter would show a snapback. Real production losses in California might be $500 million, and that is a drop in the national bucket. **********Only about 40 percent of the private homes in Los Angeles were insured against earthquakes, and many policies have high deductibles. Rebuilding of private homes is likely to proceed slowly, in part because assessing earthquake damage is highly problematical. **********""After an earthquake it usually takes a long time before money is disbursed for rebuilding, because most of it is on infrastructure like highways and major capital construction,"" said Sean Mooney, economist for the Insurance Information Institute. **********President Bill Clinton has made disbursement of federal money a priority. In an effort to obtain maximum federal help, Governor Pete Wilson passed on a damage estimate of $15 billion to $30 billion compiled from economic models - not from examination on the ground - by a San Francisco engineering consultancy under contract to the state. One federal economist said that as as rule of thumb, he starts by cutting such estimates in half. **********The artificiality of these calculations, or at least their distance from real life, is underlined by the posted cost of sending home Washington's government workers this week to relieve the overloaded local power grid - a loss of $60 million a day to taxpayers in wages paid for work not performed. But this calculation implies they will not be able to make up their work like others in such service jobs as bank clerks or even insurance adjusters. Alternatively, Mr. Munro remarked playfully, if free market purists are right, the economy should boom by losing the dead hand of government for two days. **********Part of the problem is that the national economic accounts measure production, not wealth. Federal Reserve economists in Chicago reckon that repair work on the Midwest summer floods may have actually increased the gross domestic product even when set against crop and other output losses. Good news for contractors, they said, but try to tell that to the farmers, businessmen, and towns whose houses, barns, factories, roads and sewer systems were swept away."

Frank J. Schmieder, the Greyhound chief executive, said they would have to make more transfers, in many cases to other bus lines. **********""We're not abandoning the long-haul market,"" he said in an interview. ""But we're not going to focus on it and we're not going to market it.' **********And while the company plans some feeder service from smaller cities into its hubs, many places will lose their Greyhound stops altogether. The company hopes that smaller bus companies will fill the gaps. **********Though Greyhound served 15 million riders last year, discount air fares had left fewer passengers willing to endure a bus trip of more than eight hours, Mr. Schmieder said, while low gasoline prices have more travelers relying on their cars. **********The company announced that it had lost more than $45 million in the second quarter, compared with $5.6 million in the quarter a year earlier -- making it almost impossible for Greyhound to earn a profit for this year, Mr. Schmieder said. **********Over all, the company plans to cut 100 to 200 buses from a fleet of 1,800. Other economies will include closing or consolidating some terminals, no longer keeping about 60 others open from midnight to 5 A.M. and eliminating free checked baggage. **********Greyhound, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1991, remains in a vulnerable financial condition.

Nonetheless, he said, the Administration planned to keep up the pressure to open other relatively closed sectors. **********""I am talking about opening up Japan's highly regulated financial markets and financial services industry,"" Mr. Kantor said. ""We also have to continue to work to open Japan's markets for computers, wood products and paper. We will follow the same negotiating pattern as these last agreements."" **********But Mr. Kantor emphasized: ""We understand that the Japanese Government may have to react rhetorically to what has happened here over the weekend, and they are not going to want to sit down in the next two weeks and start a new round of negotiations. They have their own domestic politics and we understand that, but in the next three or four months we intend to begin a dialogue on these other problem areas."" **********Indeed, an editorial in the mass circulation Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun said today, ""A U.S.-Japan breakdown has been avoided, but the seeds of friction are not lacking."" **********Nevertheless, Mr. Kantor said he believed that in the aftermath of the Japanese Government's agreement over the weekend to open its markets in insurance, telecommunications, glass and medical equipment to more imports, ""you might see the Japanese doing a lot more in other areas on their own -- especially if they see these openings lowering prices for their consumers, raising living standards and lessening the level of tension between Japan and other countries."" **********Because the two sides failed to reach an agreement Saturday to open further Japan's huge market in automobiles and auto parts, President Clinton decided to intitiate sanctions proceedings against Tokyo. The United States will start an investigation into Japan's market for replacement car parts under section 301 of the Trade Act. The inquiry could lead to punitive tariffs on selected Japanese automotive exports to the United States in 12 to 18 months if future negotations prove fruitless. **********But there was some indication from Tokyo today that Japan may be ready to move in the car sector before sanctions become necessary. **********""In fact, Japan's automotive imports are increasing,"" the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Kozo Igarashi, said on a television talk show. ""We cannot ignore the question of safety, but we can do a lot in the area of deregulation, so I think we will definitely be able to obtain American understanding."" **********Mr. Kantor said he thought there was another secondary benefit of Saturday's trade agreements with Japan: the psychological signal they send to American business. **********""American business has been so discouraged about getting into Japan that they won't even try to break into some of the markets over there,"" Mr. Kantor said. ""I think these agreements will give business leaders more confidence that we will stand behind them and work with them and that the Japanese Government will even work with them."" **********Mr. Kantor contended that the combination of the agreements reached on Saturday and the President's decision to initiate sanctions proceedings should create a political atmosphere that would make it much easier for Congress to approve the global trade agreement now awaiting a vote. **********That accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, lowers import tariffs in 123 countries by an average of 30 percent. While solid majorities in the Senate and House appear to favor the agreement, vocal minorities have been fighting a rear-guard action to scuttle it. The critics contend that it will permit too many low-wage manufacturing jobs to move abroad. **********""We made this framework agreement with Japan work, finally, because the President hung in there,"" Mr. Kantor said. ""But also, in the one area where we could not reach agreement -- autos -- we put a shot across their bow. **********""Sure, there will be some around who criticize us, but they will respect us. I think all of this is good for GATT, because it sends a signal to the Congress and the American people that while we pursue this agenda of expanding trade around the world, we are going to stand up for American interests and not be pushed around."" **********He said there was no way to maintain a political consensus in the United States for free trade with Mexico and Canada, or for lower tariff barriers around the world, if the public perceives that other big economies are not playing by the rules -- or if the public believes the President can be outmaneuvered in negotiations. **********""We have suffered for decades because the American people have not been convinced that Washington will stand up for their interests, especially in trade,"" Mr. Kantor said. ""And, fairly or unfairly, Japan has become the test case for that view."" **********He added, ""It is critical that we develop the trust of the American people that what we are doing in pushing for freer trade and more open markets is in their economic interests."""

Or, put another way, will Microsoft's software hegemony be supplanted by Sonic the Hedgehog software? **********Questions of that sort are troubling some computer designers and executives, who are wondering whether the personal computer industry may be ripe for a fall -- soon to be overtaken by $250 video-game players and computerized boxes for the television set-top. Consumer devices that Nintendo, Sega and Sony plan to introduce over the next year will outstrip the processing power of the fastest desktop computers from Apple and I.B.M., and the speediest personal-computer chips from Intel and Motorola. **********Most personal computer makers scoff at the notion that they could be unseated by such consumer gadgets. **********'The personal computer industry isn't going to slow down any time soon,' said Bob Metcalfe, publisher of Infoworld, a personal computer newspaper. 'They're all in the business of slitting each others' throats while performance skyrockets.' **********But some industry experts recall the hubris of the big mainframe computer companies 15 years ago. In those days, most mainframe giants dismissed the PC as a hacker's toy unsuitable for business use -- only to watch brash new personal computer makers win the hearts and desktops of Corporate America and a college dropout from Seattle named Bill Gates ascend to the industry summit. **********Most mainframe makers have since failed or withdrawn from the field, and the remaining leader, the International Business Machines Corporation, is making money from its PC's while trying to wring profits from a mainframe business that seems to be drying up quickly. But now, personal computer makers may be no more able to take advantage of the fastest computing technologies than were mainframe computer vendors a decade ago. **********'I'm struck by the quandary personal computer makers are in,' said Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America. His company plans next year to offer its $250 Project Reality video-game player, which will surpass the computing performance of even the most powerful personal computers. Besides games with interactive, TV-quality video and sound, the Project Reality player will also act as a communications device, over cable television networks. **********And in terms of its ability to manipulate large amounts of data, the Project Reality player will be able to operate more powerfully than the original Cray 1 supercomputer, which astounded the computing world with its speed in 1976. **********'If you put something this powerful and this cheap in the market,' Mr. Lincoln said, 'what happens to everybody else?' Applications Raised Demand **********Demand in the personal computer industry was heightened by the creation of new applications -- spreadsheets, word processing, electronic mail; it did not simply take over old mainframe functions like payroll processing and customer billing. And now consumer electronics companies, which have already sold millions of video-game machines, are developing systems that they hope will soon offer a broad range of consumer applications for which personal computers hold no particular edge. And this home market is potentially much larger than the $66 billion annual market for personal computers. **********'This is the last frontier,' said Jim Clark, the former chairman of Silicon Graphics Inc., a leading maker of powerful computer-graphics work stations that can cost $10,000 or more. Mr. Clark recently left Silicon Graphics to form his own company, which is seeking alliances with consumer electronics companies to make computerized devices that would sell for a few hundred dollars. 'We're talking about creating true consumer computers,' he said. **********These new consumer machines go beyond being faster and cheaper to represent a much more fundamental transformation. **********'The trend is for the fastest to also be the smallest and cheapest,' said John Moussouris, cofounder of Microunity, Inc., a Silicon Valley chip maker. 'This will continue to disrupt the computer industry to a greater degree than the auto disrupted the horse and buggy, or the calculator disrupted the slide rule.' **********Personal computer executives deny that the new class of video-game machines and set-top 'interactive TV' players will be a threat, contending that they are highly specialized machines without the flexibility of the personal computers and without the range of software applications that suits PC's for a variety of professional, home-office and leisure activities. **********But the new technology renegades say that increasingly, like its mainframe predecessor, the personal computer industry is too bound to its huge installed base of products to make radical shifts toward new technology. Indeed, today's personal computer industry is even more wedded to a narrow set of 'architectures' than was the mainframe business. **********There were seven competitors to I.B.M. in the 1960's and 1970's; today there are only two basic personal computer designs: machines based on Intel chips and Microsoft operating systems, and machines based on Apple Computer designs. **********Today's consumer-oriented computing devices, by contrast, are free to follow where computing technology wants to lead. In the past computers were used almost exclusively for calculation and control. Now a new wave of computing is shifting the focus to communications. Supercomputing power is being harnessed to make home machines simple to use and to make it easier for people to communicate with each other through video, sound and data. Long Learning Curve **********That will represent a departure from the personal computer, which despite great strides toward 'user friendliness,' still requires considerable time and effort to learn to use. **********'The conventional computer industry is going to be the funky, behind-the-times part of the business,' said Charles Ferguson, a consultant based in Cambridge, Mass. **********He predicts that the transition will present a new opportunity for Asian electronics giants. 'The design and software will be overwhelmingly America,' he said. 'But it's also going to be the Japanese and Koreans who will manufacture this stuff.' **********Also helping drive computing into the consumer-products realm is the inexorable trend in chip technology. For more than three decades, the number of transistors squeezed onto a single silicon chip has doubled approximately every 18 months. In the 1970's the world's fastest computers had more than 100,000 chips; by the end of the 1990's the fastest machine will be on a single chip. **********All of this can make for strange chip fellows. Several years ago, when designers at Kendall Square Research, the supercomputer maker, set about manufacturing their newest processor chip, they chose the same Sharp Electronics factory line in Japan that produces the control chips for the Sharp Wizard 'personal organizer' which sells for less than $500. **********And currently, looking to stay at the top of the supercomputer race, Cray Research has secretly turned to Microunity to provide microprocessors for its fastest massively parallel supercomputers. But Cray will have to share the chips with makers of television set-top boxes and videophones. Microunity's superchip is planned to execute a billion operations a second, more than 10 times Intel's fastest Pentium processor. **********On the software side, economics seems to be pulling toward the consumer market. In 1993 Sonic the Hedgehog II, the standard bearer for Sega's line of home video games was a $400 million software best seller, dwarfing almost all of the most popular business software titles for personal computers. **********Does this mean that the likes of NBA Jam will be the 'killer application' of the 90's, as Lotus 1-2-3 was for personal computing in the 80's? It is too early to say. **********But certainly, big money-makers like these are providing the financial wherewithal for creating a new industry, said Bruce Lupatkin, a financial analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco-based investment firm. **********'The next 10 years in computing,' Mr. Lupatkin said, 'are going to be driven by automating the consumer experience.'"

That offer had been made conditional on greater market openings by Japan. **********Separately, a Japanese official sought to fend off talk of U.S. trade retaliation because of the breakdown in bilateral talks. **********Koichiro Matsuura, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, said such action by Washington would be unjustified because ""there is no breach of agreement, no violation of international rules"" by Japan. He also said U.S. retaliation would by ""contrary to the spirit"" of the Uruguay Round agreement, which aims to do away with unilateral trade sanctions by establishing a powerful World Trade Organization to regulate disputes. Mr. Matsuura was in Brussels to brief EU officials on the talks. **********Those officials said they were disappointed at the lack of any market-opening action by Japan but pleased that Tokyo had resisted U.S. pressure to set numerical targets for imports. Europe has long feared that U.S. deals with Japan would tend to favor of American companies rather than helping non-Japanese companies generally. **********The failure to achieve big tariff reductions does not damage the heart of the Uruguay Round accord, which remains the biggest package of tariff cuts ever concluded, David Woods, spokesman for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, said. Tariffs will come down by an average of about one- third globally, by more than 40 percent in trade between the United States and Japan and by as much as 50 percent in trade between the United States and the EU. **********But U.S. and EU officials still expressed disappointment, as the additional cuts they had sought were in areas where their industries are considered competitive but where Japanese tariffs pose significant barriers. **********Tokyo's tariff on wood will come down from as high as 20 percent to around 6 percent, but that is still high for a natural resource where trading margins are thin, Mr. Schmidt said. Japan's tariff on white spirits will be a little more than 15 percent, he added. **********Japan did offer one concession, indicating it would about halve its tariff on copper, to around 3 percent, a level that Mr. Schmidt called ""acceptable."" **********Although GATT members can still improve on their tariff offers until shortly before the scheduled April 15 signing of the Uruguay Round deal, Monday's meeting effectively finalized the offers of the quadrilateral group, barring unexpected changes by Japan, officials said. **********The group hopes to submit tariff schedules to GATT by the end of the week, with other countries expected to do the same soon afterward. That will be slightly behind the target date of Tuesday set by GATT's director-general, Peter Sutherland, but should still leave enough time to complete the verification and printing of schedules in time for the signing in Marrakesh. **********With the matter of tariffs essentially settled, GATT diplomats will focus on clarifying the agenda for environmental trade issues, an area that is given high priority in the West but is suspected in the Third World of being a front for protectionism."

Nationsbank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., is the third-largest bank in the United States, providing retail banking in nine states. It said its results benefited from the purchase last year of MNC Financial Inc., a Baltimore-based banking company; Chicago Research and Trading Ltd., a firm specializing in currency and bond trading, and Corpus Christi National Bank. Gain in Interest Income **********Interest income rose 19 percent, to $1.3 billion, while noninterest revenue, which includes the trading by Chicago Research and Trading, climbed 41 percent, to $680 million. **********The impact of the acquisitions was also apparent in Nationsbank's net loans and leases, which rose 25 percent, to $91.6 billion; total assets, up 36 percent to $165.1 billion, and the bank's full-time payroll, which increased 12 percent, to 58,122 people. **********Nationsbank said it had lowered its provision for bad loans to $100 million, from $120 million in the first quarter of 1993. **********Shares of Nationsbank rose 12.5 cents, to $52.25. **********Chase Manhattan, the nation's sixth-largest banking company, said its profit for the first quarter was $364 million, or $1.80 a share, compared with $153 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. That was well beyond analysts' expectations; the consensus was that Chase would have earnings of $1.14 a share. **********Chase shares closed at $34.375, up 62.5 cents, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 41 points. Provision for Bad Loans **********Chase said its provision in the first quarter for bad loans was $160 million, less than half the $360 million it set aside a year ago. **********The bank reported that noninterest revenue rose 30 percent, to $853 million, largely because fees and commissions rose 22 percent, to $446 million. **********Total trading revenue, which includes foreign-exchange income and trading account income, rose 2 percent, to $179 million from $175 million. Foreign-exchange revenue dropped to $85 million from $103 million, but trading account revenue rose to $94 million from $72 million, and the bank said its income from investment securities gains rose to $79 million, from $6 million a year earlier."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/12/business/patents-heating-element-airplane-coating-could-prevent-ice-forming-wings.html,Sabra Chartrand,1994-09-12,,875,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Patents; A Heating Element In an Airplane Coating Could Prevent Ice From Forming on the Wings,Patents; A Heating Element In an Airplane Coating Could Prevent Ice From Forming on the Wings," **********FOR many travelers, few experiences are more unnerving than sitting in an airplane in winter, watching airport crews spray de-icing agents on frigid plane wings. **********Even a thin film of ice on the wings can interfere with a plane's ability to take off or fly. And de-icing agents are only temporary. A jet that had been de-iced at National Airport in Washington in January 1983 subsequently idled on a runway for nearly an hour. Snow and ice accumulated on its wings and engines. Seconds after takeoff it crashed into a bridge spanning the Potomac River, killing 78 people. **********Seeking to eliminate de-icers, Otis H. Hastings and his son, Otis M. Hastings, have patented a laminate coating that conducts electricity to keep wings warm or melt ice once it forms. **********""It's a very simple application of a heating element within a nickel-coated graphite scrim that is very, very thin,"" explained the senior Mr. Hastings. ""It doesn't distort the aerodynamics of the wing and is impregnated directly into the paint so you don't even see it."" **********The heating element is powered by the plane itself, or from a ground plug on the tarmac. Sensors detect when the temperature of the plane's skin drops to freezing, causing the heating elements to come on automatically. **********""The entire fuselage could be infused with this material, so that when it's snowing at the gate and the system is on ground power, it could keep the entire aircraft de-iced,"" said Mr. Hastings, an inventor in Mahwah, N.J. ""Then when the plane goes to takeoff and the system is on the plane's power, it can warm parts of the plane essential to aerodynamics like wing edges and vertical stabilizers."" **********The Hastingses have licensed their invention to Aerospace Safety Technologies, a Nevada supplier to aircraft manufacturers. Their patent is 5,344,696. Software to Identify Written Symbols **********AT&T Bell Laboratories likes to say it has a patent for every day of its existence. Well, almost. The company was founded 25,075 days ago (in 1925), and this summer it received its 25,000th patent. **********It was also Gordon Wilfong's first patent. A theoretician with Bell Labs' Interactive Systems Research Department, Mr. Wilfong and a partner, Frank Sinden, patented software that recognizes handwritten symbols. AT&T says it will use the invention for a new pen-based laptop computer. **********Mr. Wilfong said his system differed from other handwriting-recognition methods because it does not use a pre-programmed alphabet and because it can identify characters regardless of their size or orientation. **********""It has a user-defined alphabet,"" he explained. Consumers program the system with letters, numbers or symbols by writing an example and its definition on a digitized pad. The symbols can later be changed or reconfigured. **********Mr. Wilfong said his program was not ""a neural network or fuzzy logic,"" adding, ""It's just a strict mathematical distance definer that checks for the nearest model."" **********In other words, the software uses a mathematical formula to look at a handwritten symbol and choose the nearest match stored in its memory. And Mr. Wilfong says it can do that from any angle. **********""You can allow any rotation or scaling of the characters,"" he explained. ""You can write very small or very big. You can put the tablet upside down or stand on your head and it will recognize what you write."" **********That is quite a leap from the ""clamping and supporting device"" that earned Bell Laboratories its first patent in 1925. Since then, employees have patented transistors, lasers, solar cells, communications satellites, digital switching and cellular mobile telephones. **********Mr. Wilfong and Mr. Sinden won patent 5,333,209. Restaurant Games To Occupy Infants **********With five children, Susan Sengezer has used all sorts of things over the years -- including crackers, ice cubes and spoons -- to keep babies occupied in restaurants. While her children may have exasperated her, they also inspired her to invent a high-chair tray with built-in electronic games. **********A part-time nurse in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Ms. Sengezer borrowed money to patent the game, which she calls ""Ittle Bits Eat-N-Play Tray."" **********""I thought that a game that lit up, made noise and had characters that moved about electronically would occupy a child,"" Ms. Sengezer said. The game is embedded in a high-chair tray and covered with air-tight, moisture-proof plastic. Since the trays are removable, Ms. Sengezer also designed a wing-nut bolt that allows the game tray to be attached to a child's car seat. **********""There's a pinball version, with two inlets for balls and pull knobs,"" Ms. Sengezer explained. ""An older infant or toddler could pull the knob himself, while a baby could be occupied by its mother pushing the button and setting the ball into play."" **********Other versions have screens that light up, moving characters, fun-house mirrors or wind-up toys. Some games have music or sound effects like dogs barking. Since the game tray can be designed around any theme, Ms. Sengezer hopes to license it to restaurant chains or toy companies. **********""Ideally, chain restaurants like McDonald's could manufacture the tray with McDonaldland characters,"" she suggested. Ms. Sengezer received patent 5,294,172."

Replacing a Policy May Be a Bad Idea"," **********ARNOLD PEARLMAN, a retired bookkeeper, knows how hard it is to choose a life insurance policy. He bought a policy as an investment in 1986, but began to have second thoughts last year. So he traded in his old policy for a new one. Now he's having second thoughts about that decision. **********A close examination shows that he paid a raft of costs for a replacement policy that may not provide a bigger payout to his beneficiary, depending on how long he lives. Switching policies is full of such pitfalls, and Mr. Pearlman's story offers some valuable lessons to all who are tempted to do this. **********Mr. Pearlman's first policy was single-premium life insurance, an investment vehicle that was popular in the mid-1980's because it allowed tax-free withdrawals, tax-free loans and tax-free death benefits. **********To get the most bang for the buck, a policyholder put in the largest possible premium for the smallest death benefit. That put the bulk of the money in the investment portion rather than in the insurance portion. **********""You wanted to have the maximum cash value and just enough of a death benefit so it would qualify as life insurance,"" said R. Marshall Jones, a lawyer and insurance consultant in Palm Beach, Fla. The policies were designed for people who would eventually take the money out, not for those who wanted the maximum death benefit. **********When he was 70, Mr. Pearlman invested $325,000 in a single-premium policy with a death benefit of just less than $600,000. The policy was from Evlico, a subsidiary of Equitable, in New York. Although Congress stripped the tax-free status of withdrawals and loans from these policies in 1988, existing holders were allowed to keep those benefits. **********At 76, Mr. Pearlman, who moved from New York to Deerfield Beach, Fla., started to wonder about his policy. Upon reflection, it seemed he had paid a great deal of money for a death benefit of just $600,000. He wanted his wife to have $1 million when he died. So after seeing an ad, he contacted Karen Tharp, an insurance agent, and her company, Financial Profiles Inc. in Coral Springs, Fla. **********Mr. Pearlman asked Ms. Tharp if she could get him a policy with a bigger death benefit. She could. In fact, Ms. Tharp offered him three choices: $775,000, $900,000 or $1 million, each structured differently but costing the same. Not surprisingly, Mr. Pearlman chose $1 million. **********Ms. Tharp arranged for a tax-free policy exchange, which allowed Mr. Pearlman to keep his old policy's tax benefits. The $503,000 accumulated cash value of the Evlico whole-life policy was transferred to a $1 million universal-life policy from Security Life of Denver. **********In January, Mr. Pearlman read in this column that replacing an investment-type life policy is rarely a good idea, chiefly because of heavy up-front costs, including commissions. He wrote: ""I love my wife and want to see her well provided for. To me, the death benefit is the important thing. Isn't $1 million better than $600,000?"" **********Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant who is the author of ""The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Insurance Products,"" gave an unequivocal no. Mr. Pearlman spent a chunk of his investment on up-front costs for the second policy, Mr. Daily said. **********Furthermore, the Evlico policy was a whole-life policy with a guaranteed death benefit of at least $600,000. As the policy's cash value rose, so would the death benefit. Last year, the policy's cash value was $500,000, but it would have surpassed $600,000 soon and kept growing. **********Meanwhile, the new universal-life policy has no guaranteed death benefit. If Mr. Pearlman dies soon, his wife will get $1 million. But each year, the cost of the insurance portion of the contract will be subtracted from the policy's cash value. As Mr. Pearlman gets older, his insurance costs will rise. At some point, if the cash value is depleted, the policy could collapse. **********Here's what he paid for this switch: a $3,250 surrender fee to Evlico; commission on the new policy that Mr. Daily estimated at $40,000, which Security Life did not dispute, and unspecified up-front costs to Security Life. ""He paid somewhere between $40,000 and $80,000 for the service of being put into a riskier situation,"" Mr. Daily said. **********Ms. Tharp and executives at Security Life maintain that Mr. Pearlman was well served. ""Generally speaking, it may not be in a policyholder's best interest to replace a policy,"" said Jean Gallagher, a vice president at Security Life. ""But there are all sorts of different factors involved."" Mr. Pearlman wanted a bigger death benefit, and Security Life provided it, she said. **********""If he dies in the next couple of years, it's a great value,"" said Don Watson, an insurance analyst at Standard & Poor's. ""But if he lives to be 93, it won't be."" **********Before replacing any policy, consumers should seek advice from someone who does not collect commissions. NICO (P.O. Box 15492, Alexandria, Va., 22309) will analyze two policies for $70. **********Mr. Daily advises people who have already made an exchange and are dissatisfied to ask these questions: Did the agent comply with the state's replacement law, which requires notification of the former company? Is the company licensed to do business in the state? Is the policy approved in the state? ""Look for something the agent has done wrong, and you can probably get your money back,"" he said. **********By all accounts, Security Life handled Mr. Pearlman's exchange properly. As for Mr. Pearlman, he is left to wonder whether he did the right thing.RETAINING OLD INSURANCE BENEFITS **********WHENEVER the law is changed on life insurance, the industry usually succeeds in having the change limited to new policies. In this way, policyholders are able to retain tax benefits or other features that may have sold them on a policy. **********Consider the 1988 law that killed certain tax benefits of single-premium life policies, but left the benefits intact for existing policyholders. **********Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant in New York, said unscrupulous insurers may take advantage of the situation, knowing that consumers want to hold on to those existing policies no matter what. ""I wondered when that law was passed whether insurance companies would not lower the interest rate on those policies,"" Mr. Daily said. **********It appears some have. Mr. Daily said he recently saw a single-premium policy issued in 1987 whose interest rate is just 4.5 percent, the guaranteed minimum. **********For policyholders who encounter such problems, there is one recourse: a policy can be exchanged for another, keeping the grandfathered rights, as long as no new money is put into the contract, said Don Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service."

Financial markets rallied strongly on this signal that the so-called core rate of inflation might still be under control. Lower inflation puts less pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again soon. **********The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 17.81 to close at 3,768.71, while the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds dropped to 7.50 percent from 7.65 percent.  [ Pages 38 and 46. ] Doesn't Clear the Air **********Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the Council of Economic Advisers, played down the overall rise in the Consumer Price Index. ""You instead see signs, if you take out the volatile food and energy prices, that the core inflation rate remains subdued,"" she said in a telephone interview. **********Wall Street analysts said that today's economic indicators did little to clear up the general confusion about the economy's health, and would not push Federal Reserve officials noticeably in favor or against higher interest rates at a meeting on Tuesday of the central bank's interest-rate-policy committee. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said repeatedly that the central bank is worried about possible future inflation and is not trying to set policy based on price increases that have already occurred. **********Inventories of manufacturers, wholesale distributors and retailers rose four-tenths of a percent in June, led by a 1.4 percent increase in retail inventories, the Commerce Department said. The overall increase was twice as large as analysts had expected, even given the department's estimate on July 29 that inventories grew more in the second quarter than at any time since the end of 1987. Slow Growth Is Seen **********Some Wall Street analysts said the extra inventories meant that growth was more likely to slow in the coming months as stores cut back on new orders until consumers cleared their shelves. ""The economy is decelerating and inflation remains subdued,"" said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. **********The increase in inventories particularly surprised analysts because the Commerce Department said on Thursday that retail sales, excluding cars and light trucks, had grown four-tenths of a percent, also more than many analysts had expected. **********Darwin Beck, an economist at First Boston in New York, said that the only way sales and inventories can both increase by unexpectedly large amounts is if the American economy produced even more goods in the second quarter than anyone had previously thought. The Commerce Department estimated on July 29 that the economy grew at an annual pace of 3.7 percent in the second quarter; it is scheduled to refine that estimate on Aug. 26. **********""We will have higher growth in the second quarter than previously estimated,"" Mr. Beck predicted. **********But Ms. Tyson at the Council of Economic Advisers said such speculation was premature. ""I don't think there's any reason to draw that conclusion yet,"" she said in a telephone interview today. Optimism in Southeast **********In one possible sign that growth will not slow later this year, manufacturers in the Southeast expressed optimism about future sales in a monthly survey released today by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The bank's regional indexes of output, shipments and new and unfilled orders all increased. **********But the Atlanta Fed also said that a sharply rising share of Southeastern manufacturers reported paying higher prices for materials and charging higher prices for their products. **********Consumer prices rose particularly fast in July for coffee, up 22.4 percent; fresh fruit and vegetables, up 3.4 percent; gasoline, up 3.5 percent, and airline fares, up 1.3 percent. The overall price increase was held down by falling prices for beef, down 1.2 percent, and clothing, down four-tenths of a percent. **********Many products rose in price roughly in line with the overall Consumer Price Index, including car prices, up four-tenths of a percent; medical care costs, also up four-tenths of a percent, and housing, up a tenth of a percent. **********Remarks by Fed Governor **********While today's economic indicators may have provided no clear clues to the Federal Reserve's intentions, off-the-cuff remarks this morning by John P. LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, convinced some analysts that another quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates on Tuesday was even more likely than it already seemed. **********Reuters reported that Mr. LaWare said he expected the economy to grow at a pace of 3.25 to 3.5 percent this year, and by 2.7 percent to 3 percent next year. He spoke in Randolph, Mass., before the South Shore Chamber of Commerce. **********In contrast, the Fed officially estimated at its July meeting that the economy would grow 3 to 3.25 percent this year and 2.5 to 2.75 percent next year. **********An upward revision of those estimates could mean that the Federal Reserve is more worried that the economy may overheat and feed inflation, said Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm.

Just Personal Advice **********In an interview today, Mr. Ogai said the book did not state an official party position, merely his personal advice to candidates in these ""chaotic"" times that they could learn some tactics from Hitler. He said, however, that he had cleared the book beforehand with the secretary general of the Tokyo branch. **********The book drew immediate condemnation from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, which has long criticized the rather frequent publication in Japan of books warning about a ""Jewish conspiracy."" **********""It is almost beyond belief that such a work would be released as the civilized world pauses on the 50th anniversary of D-Day to reflect on the horrors which Hitler's Germany and her allies inflicted on the world,"" Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the center's associate dean, said in a statement. ""The notion that any element of an important political party in any democracy would sanction and promote Nazi tactics poses a fundamental threat to that very democracy."" No Comment by Party **********Sadao Okushima, an aide to Yoshiro Mori, the secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, said Mr. Ogai was not a high-ranking party official. ""We have one million party members, and one of them happens to have written the book,"" he said. He would not comment further, saying he had not read the book. **********Mr. Ogai said the book does not deal at all with Hitler's policies toward the Jews, only with his tactics for influencing public opinion. **********""I think the racial issue is completely separate,"" said Mr. Ogai, 45, who said he had been reading books about Hitler since high school. He expressed puzzlement why anyone would consider the book controversial. ""I just don't understand your concern,"" he said. **********The book does not appear to deal with the Holocaust or even with the fact that Hitler was a dictator. The preface merely says that those aspects of Hitler's legacy should be left for others to evaluate. The Swastika and the Actress **********The hard cover of the book is imprinted with a swastika and the book's jacket features a picture of Hitler. An advertising blurb wrapped around the cover features a photograph of Masumi Miyazaki, who starred in a movie about a parliamentary campaign. ""If you read this book, election campaigns will surely become enjoyable,"" she says. **********Each chapter of the 167-page book begins with a quotation from Hitler's autobiography, ""Mein Kampf,"" or from some work about Hitler. But the book does not talk much about Hitler, only about election strategy. **********One chapter begins with a quotation noting that Hitler's strategy was to ""wipe out enemies with emergency measures."" For candidates, the book advises that to ""wipe out does not mean to kill"" one's political opponents. ""It means to take measures to stop their political activities."" **********Other techniques used by Hitler that are considered useful include use of a unifying symbol like the swastika and propaganda. **********The book has not attracted much attention in Japan. The publisher, Chiyoda Nagata Shoba, said no more than 3,000 copies had been sold since the book went on sale in May."

The meeting had been called to draw up recommendations for the President. **********Defense Secretary William J. Perry opposed a recommendation that would set a deadline for an invasion if the Haitian military leaders did not leave, the officials said. Mr. Perry and much of the United States military want to avoid an invasion and are willing to explore ways to induce Haiti's leaders to leave for comfortable lives in exile. **********But Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who has emerged as the State Department's chief policy maker on Haiti, argued that offering incentives was morally repugnant, senior officials said. Mr. Talbott is said to favor an early invasion. **********In a sharp exchange, Mr. Perry countered instead that Mr. Talbott represented a strange morality: He argued that it would be immoral for the United States not to do whatever it could to avoid the deaths of American soldiers and the spending of taxpayers' money, officials said. **********At a news conference tonight, President Clinton laid out the ""fundamental interests"" that he said would justify an invasion, and said he was keeping his options open. **********""We have kept force on the table,"" he said. ""We have continued to move it up as an option as the dictators there have been more obstinate. But it is premature in my judgment to go beyond that now."" **********He also said that while he welcomed Congressional support for a decision to invade, lack of it would not prevent him from acting. The Senate today passed a non-binding resolution requiring Congressional approval before an invasion. **********""I would welcome the support of the Congress and I hope that I will have that,"" Mr. Clinton said. ""But like my predecessors in both parties, I have not agreed that I was constitutionally mandated to get it. **********In elaborating on United States interests in Haiti, Mr. Clinton noted that thousands of Americans live and work there and that a million Haitians in the United States have friends and relatives in Haiti. **********Furthermore, he said, it is in the national interest to promote democracy abroad and stabilize democracies throughout the hemisphere. **********""Our security is caught up with whether people in the hemisphere are moving toward democracy,"" he said. ""When one country has an election, a leader is voted and that leader is opposed by people who murder, kill, rape and maim, it seems to me that if you look at the possible ramifications of that on other countries in Latin and Central America, that is where our security interest is."" **********A number of participants at the meeting on Tuesday agreed with Mr. Perry's reluctance to pursue an invasion as the best way to remove the military leadership in Haiti, senior officials said today. **********The views of Mr. Perry and Mr. Talbott reflect the extremes of the Administration's thinking on how best to restore Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. **********Mr. Talbott is said by his colleagues to favor an invasion soon, within the next several weeks; Mr. Perry, while not opposed totally to the use of force, wants to exhaust all other steps first, even if that means promising Haiti's top three military officials that they would not be punished for their repression. Reluctance May Run Deep **********There is little consensus within the Administration on whether Haiti's leaders will accept any offer to depart. Many senior State Department and intelligence officials, as well as William L. Swing, the United States Ambassador to Port-au-Prince, do not believe the military men will leave, but they add that the Administration must exhaust every possibility before an invasion. **********Mr. Perry declined to comment on Tuesday's meeting, saying through a spokesman, Dennis R. Boxx, ""We're not going to get into a discussion of the conversations at principals' meetings."" **********In a brief telephone conversation, Mr. Talbott also declined comment. **********At Tuesday's meeting, Mr. Perry argued most strongly against a deadline for invasion, saying that would artificially constrain the Administration's room for maneuver. ""Perry felt that it put the United States into a box,"" said one senior Administration official. ""And the Pentagon doesn't like boxes."" **********But even Gen. John M. D. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was said by Pentagon officials to be resigned to the fact that an invasion was becoming more likely. **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher also attended Tuesday's meeting, but he allowed Mr. Talbott to take the lead for the State Department in the discussions, a senior official said. First, Try Gentle Threats **********Although the officials were unable to come up with a single plan, analysts are refining different possible tactics. One is to induce the peaceful departure of the military leaders -- Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the leader of the ruling junta; Col. Michel Joseph Francois, the police commander, and Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff. **********According to one idea, the Administration would send an envoy to warn the three men that if they did not leave voluntarily within a specified time, an American-led coalition would remove them, senior officials said. **********Under that plan, the men would be told that Washington would arrange their departure, providing transportation, visas, safe havens in third countries and assistance in withdrawing their assets from frozen bank accounts. The men and their families would be given guarantees that they would not be prosecuted either in Haiti or in the country that agreed to take them.  Then, Try Harsher Threats **********According to a second plan, the United States envoy would simply inform the three officials that they had to leave or risk an invasion. If the officials agreed but asked for help, a meeting would be arranged to discuss arrangements for their departure. **********One senior official said the Administration planners had not ruled out a pay-off to get the men to leave, but other senior officials insisted that the Administration had rejected any such bribe. If the Administration decided to use secret United States funds to induce the men to leave, it would require a formal Presidential ""finding"" in advance. **********Such a finding, a formal statement of the national security justification for a covert activity, is required before the Central Intelligence Agency can pay for it. The Administration is also required by law to inform Congress of any such finding. **********One official said the Administration could not even discuss financial inducements without a finding. Looking for a Mediator **********A third plan would encourage the United Nations or another country or countries to take the lead in easing the departures of the three men, senior officials said. **********Venezuela and some other Latin American countries, uncomfortable with the idea of a United States invasion of Haiti, are discussing sending a mission to Haiti to urge the military leaders to leave. **********[ An announcement late Wednesday on the state-run television in Port-au-Prince said General Cedras had agreed to meet representatives from Venezuela and other nations, Reuters reported from Haiti. The Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas, is seeking such a meeting. ] **********A complication may have arisen in the case of the Dominican Republic. Although President Joaquin Balaguer opposed the return of Father Aristide to Haiti, he was pressed by the Administration to close his border with Haiti and accept military help in monitoring the border to prevent shipments of gasoline and other embargoed products. **********Mr. Balaguer was re-elected in May, but the results were disputed. On Tuesday, Dominican election officials finally declared him the winner, but Washington has charged that the election was tainted by fraud and has called for new elections. **********A State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, today predicted a deterioration in relations with the Dominican Republic. ""Those who are calling for new elections seem to us to have a very good and strong argument,"" he said, adding that the decision to certify the election would be a ""detrimental factor"" in ties between the two countries. **********But Mr. McCurry said the Administration did not link the election dispute to the Dominicans' cooperation in sealing the border, and other officials said the Dominican Republic could provide a safe haven for one or more of the Haitian leaders."

But this action was not enough to prevent losses for the day in both stocks and bonds. A weak dollar increases the possibility of higher inflation and discourages investment from abroad. **********The selling in stocks and bonds increased after the Fed published its ""beige book,"" a survey from the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. The report pointed to strong economic growth in some regions, reviving fears of an acceleration in inflation and higher interest rates. The bond market sagged, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction from price, advancing to 8.09 percent, from 8.06 percent on Tuesday. ""There is still serious concern about the ability of the economy to continue to roll along,"" said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Reich & Company. ""The more economic activity expands, the more fear that higher interest rates and higher inflation are ahead."" **********The Dow Jones industrial average closed near its bottom for the day, losing 26.24 points, to 3,837.13, the lowest level since Oct. 10. Other market indicators also dropped, with the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks falling 1.91 points, to 466.51, and the Nasdaq composite index easing 0.37 point, to 771.82. **********Declining stocks topped advancing issues by 1,275 to 943 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading on the Big Board was active at 333.2 million shares, compared with 315 million shares on Tuesday. **********Transportation and utility stocks were weaker, with the Dow transportation average down 3.96 points, to 1,518.84, and the Dow utility average down 0.33 point, to 179.15. Analysts noted that the tone of the market was defensive, pending any action by the Fed at or before the next meeting of its rate-setting open market committee on Nov. 15. **********Despite the generally weak market, some technology companies managed to close the session on the upside. Among them, Microsoft rose 1/4, to 63; Intel was up 1 1/8, to 62 1/2, and Cisco Systems advanced 1, to 31 5/8. **********Some special situations also finished higher. For example, Kmart sold a majority stake in its office-products retailer, Officemax. The initial public offering was a success, with Officemax shares rising 5 1/2 from the offering price, to 24 1/2. Kmart rose 1/4, to 16 1/4. **********DSC Communications, which reached an agreement to sell some of its switching devices, was up 5/8, to 31 1/4; the Salem Corporation, which said it was considering an unsolicited takeover offer, was up 2 5/8, to 16 1/4, and Quantum Health Resources, which reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, was up 2 1/4, to 38 3/8."

A small computer in the trunk, making calculations like a surveyor, triangulates between the signals to find the car's location. A gyroscope and the odometer also feed information to the computer, allowing dead-reckoning.  Data Stored on Turning **********The computer knows the names of most streets, which streets are one way, where left turns are legal, and when a turn is a 90-degree angle or when it is sharper or more gentle. **********But, driver be warned: It knows very little about U-turns. Last year it told a tester in Chicago to make one, and he did, and got a ticket, B. L. Porterfield, an Oldsmobile engineer, recalled. The system was designed and first tested in California, he said, and ""U-turns are popular there, apparently, and legal."" **********The system is not completely new; some Japanese auto makers offer similar ones for use in Japan, and some after-market systems are available in this country. But the Olds system is the first to be offered by a car maker here. It combines the features of an atlas, a computer and the yellow pages. Display Attached to Dash **********The information appears on a liquid-crystal-display screen that measures 4 inches diagonally, attached to the center of the dashboard on an arm like the one that supports a rear-view mirror. Lest future generations of urban cars have to carry signs pleading ""No Navigation Computer,"" this one is easily removable. **********Avis has been testing a handful of the cars in San Jose, Calif., according to Mr. Porterfield, who called rental cars ""the acid test,"" because drivers were usually rushed and in unfamiliar territory. Over the last two years 700 people have used the cars, he said, so successfully that 100 will be added in the next few months, he said. **********About two-tenths of a mile in advance of each turn, a voice that sounds like it was borrowed from a child's video game says ""turn left"" or ""turn right."" Software engineers are still developing a data base to cover the whole country, but it will soon know the way almost everywhere, including all the streets in major cities, and thoroughfares down to the county road in less populous areas. **********And it never says ""You can't get there from here.""

Hi-ho! Shinpai nai utai tsuzukeyo!"" **********If home is where the cash registers ring loudest, it would be hard to imagine Mickey Mouse and his friends ensconced more comfortably anyplace other than this bustling plot of landfill on the shores of Tokyo Bay, at Tokyo Disneyland. **********With 16 million visitors last year, each spending on average about $85, the park, less than 10 miles from downtown Tokyo, has surpassed the original Magic Kingdoms in the United States in attendance. **********Indeed, the way the Dwarfs' song has been translated into Japanese is apt -- ""Don't worry about a thing, let's continue singing!"" **********What a contrast with the financial train wreck outside Paris known as Euro Disneyland, where the only thing park officials are singing these days is the blues. **********Euro Disneyland, which opened in the spring of 1992 with soaring expectations, reported a $905 million loss for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, and it lost $94 million more in the three months after that. Its parent, the Walt Disney Company in California, took a $350 million charge last year as a result. **********Back in Japan, a market that Disney entered a decade ago with misgivings, it is a different story entirely. **********The Oriental Land Company, the owner of Tokyo Disneyland, enjoyed a pretax profit of $202 million in the fiscal year that ended last March 31. And that was in the middle of the worst recession here since the end of World War II. Translating American Icons **********A look at these two overseas parks offers some harsh lessons in the vexing uncertainty of translating American icons into other cultures, and in how important timing can be for such overseas moves. As much as it has been overshadowed by the European disaster, and as different as Japan is from the West, the 11-year-old Tokyo theme park is an enormous success. Increasingly, it is drawing affluent young people from all over Asia. **********No, Cinderella does not wear a kimono here, and Winnie the Pooh has not forsaken his beloved honey for sushi. In fact, except for some subtle but telling changes, Tokyo Disneyland is a near replica of the American original. **********Almost all the signs are in English, with occasional lines of Japanese and, now that other Asians are coming here, Chinese. The white-and-red Japanese flag is never flown, but various versions of the Stars and Stripes flutter from atop reproductions of American-style buildings. **********It is so sanitized and precise in its depiction of an unthreatening, fantasy America that, in an odd sort of way, the park has become totally Japanese. And that, of course, is just the way the Japanese want it. Indeed, the park is reminiscent of the traditional Japanese garden, which reproduces a tightly confined version of nature that is supposed to be more satisfying and perfect than the real thing. Enjoying the 'Japanese Dream' **********When Japanese come to Tokyo Disneyland, said Masako Notoji, a professor at Tokyo University who has written extensively on the peculiar hold Tokyo Disneyland exercises over people here, ""they are enjoying not the American Dream, but their own Japanese Dream."" **********Some here even suggest that the managers of this park pull off the Disney ideal better than their American mentors. **********""This might be the most perfect Disneyland in the world,"" Sanshiro Kobayashi, a spokesman for the theme park, said. ""Because of the Japanese character, our park is probably a little cleaner."" **********If this contrast between the fortunes of the European and Japanese theme parks seems confusing, you have plenty of company. The Walt Disney Company studied the Japanese and European sites extensively, and yet it still failed to anticipate the enthusiasm here and the difficulties in France. That has cost it dearly. **********""I used to say that cultures have no boundaries,"" said Noboru Kamisawa, executive vice president of Oriental Land. ""But look at Euro Disneyland. Now I think that there may be cases where Disney is not accepted so readily."" A Hard Sell at First **********In fact, things began here on a shaky note. When Oriental Land first brought the idea of building a Magic Kingdom in Japan to Disney executives two decades ago, it was a hard sell, according to Mr. Kamisawa. **********At that time, Oriental Land was a struggling developer, trying to figure out how to make some money from a large tract of landfill it owned just a few miles outside of central Tokyo. The privately held company was formed by the Mitsui Real Estate Development Company and the Keisei Electric Railway Company, who remain its principal owners. **********Because of a deal with a local township, Oriental Land was obliged to use the plot for a public leisure activity, but it had failed to come up with any workable plans. Mr. Kamisawa said the company had gone to Disney in California, desperate for help in running a big theme park. **********After some persuading, a competition with another site near Mount Fuji and several years of delays, Disney finally decided to go ahead with the project here. But it took a cautious course and rejected a chance to buy an interest in the park. That decision has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars. **********""I think Disney regretted that they refused our offer,"" Mr. Kamisawa said with more than a touch of understatement. ""I think they had this in mind when they decided to take an interest in Euro Disneyland."" **********Disney has control over many aspects of the Tokyo park's design and operations, but it only collects royalties from the park's intake -- about 10 percent of the revenue from admission and rides, and 5 percent on the sale of food, drinks and souvenirs. **********To make things worse, Disney also hurt itself by cashing in early on anticipated future royalties. In 1988, it arranged a complex financial transaction, selling its rights to the park's future royalties. It received $700 million up front for 20 years worth of royalties. **********The company refuses to comment on the transaction, but reports at the time said the deal had locked it into an exchange rate of 124 yen to the dollar. The dollar has since declined sharply, below 105 yen recently. **********That movement would have sharply increased the dollar-denominated profits Disney would have earned. But because of the transaction, it appears to have forgone such gains. **********Oriental Land remains a privately held company, but its principal owners have reportedly agreed to raise fresh capital and list its shares publicly next year to finance a large addition. The company is planning to expand the site by constructing a large marine park, also in cooperation with Disney. **********Who would have thought a people whose history is a tapestry of samurai warriors, rice farmers and Buddhism would have taken so quickly to Mark Twain, the Old West and Peter Pan? And who would have thought that Europeans would be so much less enamored of the Disney retinue? **********Ms. Notoji explains. ""To Japanese, the fakeness of Disneyland is not evident because they only had fantasy images of these things before,"" she said. ""Europeans see the fakeness because they have their own real castles, and many of the Disney characters come from European folk tales."" **********Even Oriental Land misjudged to some extent. The company built a pavilion here, where it shows a movie on how contact with foreign cultures has influenced Japan over the centuries. The show is nearly deserted much of the time. Superb Timing **********But a few yards away, another Tokyo Disneyland feature is usually packed -- a shop filled with souvenirs from the other Magic Kingdoms, catering to the Japanese traveler's passion for purchasing mementos to give away as gifts at home. **********Tokyo Disneyland has also benefited from superb timing -- one of the reasons, analysts say, that Euro Disneyland has done so poorly. While the European Magic Kingdom opened in the midst of a deep recession, the Tokyo park opened in 1983, early in one of the most economically vibrant decades in recent Japanese history. **********""The 1980's was a decade of great economic affluence and an era when Japanese society started to feel a part of world culture,"" Ms. Notoji of Tokyo University said. ""Tokyo Disneyland really became a symbol for many people of Japan's entry into world culture."" **********Mr. Kamisawa of Oriental Land added: ""When people looked for a model of an affluent society at that time, they looked to the United States. It was as natural for us to enjoy Disneyland as it was for Japanese to go to McDonald's."" **********As it happened, McDonald's was establishing itself around the same time as Japan's largest fast-food chain. **********""It was like we were buying Disneyland,"" Ms. Notoji said. ""We took the foreignness out of it and digested it. It came out as something with an American character, but for the Japanese it is Japanese.""                    --------------------       Euro Disney Debt Talks **********PARIS, March 6 (Reuters) -- Banks that are creditors to Euro Disney said last week that there had been progress in talks aimed at reaching a rescue package for the debt-burdened theme park outside Paris. The park's debt amounts to $3.61 billion.   A report by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick found recent business and management measures taken by Euro Disney were on the right track, the banks said.   Euro Disney recently adopted measures to shore up business, like cutting the entry price to visitors in the off-peak period. It laid off some 950 workers late last year to reduce costs."

Polls showed him to be far more popular than his main rightist challenger, Jacques Chirac, the leader of his own Gaullist party. And, on the left, the Socialist Party was a shadow of the force that twice elected Mr. Mitterrand. **********But what came to be known as the Balladur magic has suddenly begun to fade. Last week, he was deeply embarrassed when one of his former ministers was jailed on corruption charges and another was forced to resign because he, too, was under investigation for possible corruption. **********Open warfare has erupted within the coalition Government -- even within its inner circle, the Cabinet -- between supporters of Mr. Balladur and those loyal to Mr. Chirac. **********Alarmed, the Prime Minister plans to call a meeting of the entire Cabinet this week in the hope of restoring order. **********Such is the disarray on the right that an expected shoo-in for conservatives in the presidential election next spring may now be in doubt. In 1981 and 1988, a split on the right lifted Mr. Mitterrand to victory. Political experts say in-fighting could again lead the right to defeat. **********The Socialists, who were drubbed in parliamentary elections last year, are already feeling more cheerful. In contrast to the right, they seem to be united behind the candidacy of Jacques Delors, who steps down in January as head of the European Union's executive commission. **********Mr. Delors has refused to be drafted until he leaves his current job in Brussels, but polls now say he would defeat Mr. Chirac in the second round of the presidential election. They also show that he is gradually eroding Mr. Balladur's lead. **********""This is suicide,"" one Gaullist legislator, Patrick Devedjian, said of the divisions weakening the conservative coalition. ""The right is rolling out the red carpet for Delors."" **********The same kind of corruption scandals that contributed to the Socialists' defeat last year are now plaguing Mr. Balladur's Government. Conservatives who were praising the independence of the judiciary two years ago now complain that judges are acting politically. **********Last week, Alain Carignon, the Mayor of Grenoble, who stepped down as Communications Minister this summer, was jailed pending his trial on charges of illegal campaign financing. And Gerard Longuet, the Industry Minister who is under investigation for possible conflict of interest, resigned. **********Further, Mr. Longuet's small Republican Party, which is backing Mr. Balladur's presidential candidacy, is itself under investigation for receiving illegal funds. The Defense Minister, Francois Leotard, and the Economic Development Minister, Alain Madelin, are also targets of the investigation. **********Adding to Mr. Balladur's troubles is public sniping at his performance from pro-Chirac sectors of the Gaullist party. It has created tensions within the Cabinet, where the Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, has emerged as Mr. Chirac's unofficial campaign manager. **********For the moment, like Mr. Balladur and Mr. Delors, Mr. Chirac had said he will not decide whether to run until early next year. But, in practice, he is already campaigning against Mr. Balladur, albeit with questionable results. Polls say his popularity, as well as that of Mr. Balladur, has fallen in recent weeks."

""Or is it that much has happened, and nothing has changed?"" **********The audience loved it. The joke echoed the discussions that fill kitchens and courtyards, the commentaries in the papers, the debates that resound from many distant foreign capitals. **********Extraordinary changes have come to Russia, things that no one would have dreamed of a few years ago. Commercialism and Criticism **********Bright kiosks and private shops packed with every conceivable goody line the streets. The papers freely bash Lenin, Boris N. Yeltsin and anyone else. Foreigners travel unrestricted through once-secret cities. Olympic coverage is interrupted for Volvo commercials. **********But old ways have proven tenacious. No sooner had President Yeltsin crushed one hostile legislature than Russians elected another dominated by chauvinists and Communists, and the new deputies began by voting themselves cars, Moscow apartments and salaries matching those of Cabinet ministers. **********After a brief parade of reformers, the Cabinet under Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has reverted to what the economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky describes as ""typically Soviet"" -- a coalition of industrial interest groups scrambling to secure inflationary credits, backed by a bloated bureaucracy and shady businessmen who have made millions speculating on inflation. 'Let It Go as It's Going' **********Their only discernible strategy, says Yegor T. Gaidar, the sidelined pioneer of radical reform, is ""let it go as it's going."" **********Nine years after Mikhail S. Gorbachev proclaimed the process of perestroika, or restructuring, and two years after Mr. Yeltsin broke up the Soviet Union, many Russians wonder whether Russia has entered irreversibly on a path of Western-style development, or whether it is only passing through another of its short-lived lurches. The Failures  Rampant Crime And Insecurity **********Mulling Russia's plight, a babushka at the farmers' market reached for old folk wisdom: the Russian, she declared, won't budge until the roasted rooster pecks him in the rear. **********The theme has many variants among the endless proverbs and snatches of verse with which many Russians shape their worldview. These days, it is invoked so often that it takes on the quality of a self-fulfilling prophesy, as if it is a given that all Russia's endeavors are doomed to founder in some congenital Russian inertia. **********Indeed, it is hard not to wonder why reform is such a mess in Russia. **********True, Russia has won extensive freedoms, it has changed in many ways, and despite wrenching upheavals, it has so far avoided collapse, civil war and revival of dictatorship. The subways still run, Moscow streets are clogged with cars, and there has been no mass hunger or cold. **********But the failures are glaring. The gap with the West has not been closed, as Mr. Gorbachev promised back in 1985, and economists wonder how the country will make it through spring. **********This month, the main producer of vodka -- seemingly the one industry that could not fail -- suspended production under an avalanche of taxes. **********Instead of shaping a new middle class, the weakening of state control has fostered pervasive crime. A report recently prepared for Mr. Yeltsin said that up to 80 percent of all private enterprises in Russia were paying heavy tribute to the ""mafia,"" the generic name for the armies of racketeers and bandits that have sprouted across Russia. **********Streets that once knew no crime have become dangerous. An orderly at Moscow's First City Hospital reported an average of 40 serious mugging victims daily. About 10,000 hoods are said to operate full time in St. Petersburg. Eight leading bankers have been slain over the last year. **********Haphazard credit and export policies have enabled a handful of businessmen to amass huge fortunes, which they flaunt in the finest tradition of the old Russian merchants, scattering pedestrians as they race through Moscow in their exotic sedans with heavily armed bodyguards. **********While foreigners look on the gaudy kiosks as signs of prosperity and plenty, many Russians view them as humiliating reminders of eroding values and growing poverty. Except for a small fraction that has found support abroad, the intellectual elite of the Soviet Union -- scientists, professors and writers -- feels increasingly forsaken and alienated. **********Optimists have justified this as an unattractive but necessary process of ""primary capital accumulation."" But little of that capital has stayed in Russia; the Government estimates that $25 billion has gone in the last two years to Switzerland, Austria, Cyprus, North America and other distant havens. **********Life expectancy, low in the old Soviet Union, has sunk even further with deteriorating health care. According to new figures, the life expectancy for men dropped from 62 in 1992 to 59 in 1993, while infant mortality rose from 17.8 per 1,000 to 19.3. Trauma deaths -- accidents, suicides, murders, military casualties, poisonings -- rose last year from the fifth to the third leading cause of death. **********To many Russians, the December election was disheartening not only because of the large vote for the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, but also because barely 50 percent of the electorate bothered to vote at all. There were lingering suspicions that the real turnout was even smaller than officially reported, which would mean that the new Constitution offered by Mr. Yeltsin did not really pass. **********The vote has been extensively dissected here and abroad. All agree that those who stayed away and those who voted for Mr. Zhirinovsky did so above all to register anger at the impoverishment, insecurity, crime and mismanagement that have marked recent years. **********As many of the states emerging from Communist dictatorships have learned, only when people have enough to eat do they really embrace democracy. **********It is this apparent alienation, this waning of faith in the prospects of reform, that has prompted so many Russians to wonder whether in fact they are forever doomed to cycles of lurches and stagnation. **********A growing number of Russians have come to realize that seven decades of systematically suppressing initiative and demonizing enterprise have left a mind-set that will take at least a generation to alter. **********Middle-aged Russians whose children go into private business still acknowledge a tinge of shame that their progeny are working ""for money,"" just as it is still considered humiliating for an academic institute to rent office space to a ""commercial structure."" The History  Russians Battered By the State **********Their history is not one to give Russians solace. **********For centuries, czars, commissars, ministers and presidents have taken turns trying to wrench Russia, violently or peaceably, into the ranks of technologically, militarily, socially and economically developed nations, where they knew their land belonged by virtue of its great expanse, its natural wealth and its talents. **********Peter the Great and Lenin, Alexander II and Peter Stolypin, Stalin and Mr. Gorbachev all confronted the same historical challenge, Mr. Gaidar wrote in Izvestia after he left Mr. Yeltsin's Government for the second time. **********The drama of Russia's development, he said, was that reformers, always forced to catch up, would seize on what seemed the most expeditious means: pump up the muscle of the state until it can impose its will on the recalcitrant nation and drive it forward. **********Peter the Great shaved the beards off his boyar aristocrats and ordered a new capital on the swamps of the Neva delta to ""hew a window into Europe."" Lenin smashed an entire society, Stalin killed 10 million of his own, Mr. Gorbachev destroyed the Communist party, Mr. Yeltsin broke up the Soviet Union -- all in the name of making Russia strong and modern, all in the conviction that once Russia caught up, the coercion would become unnecessary. **********The results were often awesome: the greatest land empire, the largest army, the most megatons, men permanently in space, garlands of Olympic medals. **********The problem was that in the struggle to match the outside world in might, Moscow always ended up at war with its own society, repressing its creative forces and distorting its social and economic development. **********Battered and wrung out by the state, the people quietly turned away. The pattern reached its apex of absurdity under Leonid I. Brezhnev's 18-year rule, an era now known as the Period of Stagnation. **********""You pretend you pay -- I pretend I work,"" become the governing slogan. Under a ceaseless drone of triumphalistic propaganda, virtually everything creative in the society went underground -- political dissidents, artists and writers, the entrepreneurs of the ""shadow economy."" **********""Russia is not an 'underdeveloped' or a 'developing' country,"" a Western businessman mused. ""It's a misdeveloped country."" **********The evidence is everywhere. Russian cosmonauts soar over primitive villages listing in mud, their gnarled men wasted by vodka. Russian athletes reap Olympic gold while Siberian coal miners in quilted cotton parkas die in Dickensian hell-holes. **********The new rich shed sheaves of $100 notes at brash new discotheques and casinos, while old women huddle in peeling tenements wondering where to raise the $200 that the cheapest burial now costs. **********These extremes of extraordinary achievement and oppressive backwardness, this image of an outside world perpetually leaving Russia behind, have fed the widespread conviction among Russians that they are different, that they stand apart from Europe or Asia, with a destiny of their own. The notion of ""Holy Russia"" runs deep, of a people lacking the German's industriousness or the American's entrepreneurship, but endowed with unique spirituality and mission. **********One fateful variation on that tenet was the Bolsheviks' conviction that Russia was destined to pave the way to a new order. The contemporary version is the argument among nationalists and Communists that the way of the West is not for Russia, that it must follow its own course, taking into account its ""collectivist"" traditions and spiritual values. **********To reformers, such talk is simply an excuse not to accept hard economic facts and a justification for the old bureaucracy to retain its stifling control. The Reform  Efforts to Curb The State Falter **********The bold ambition of the first team of reformers assembled by Mr. Yeltsin -- young, Western-oriented economists led by Mr. Gaidar, then 35 -- was to break the ancient cycle. Instead of trying to restore the powers of the fallen Soviet state and attempting another reform by diktat, they tried something new -- to curb the state. **********When Mr. Gaidar freed prices on Jan. 1, 1992, he surrendered one of the Government's most powerful economic levers. The subsequent program to distribute ""privatization vouchers"" was in part an attempt to convince Russians that each of them had a tangible share in their state. Finally the reformers tried to choke socialism into submission by clamping controls on credits and money printing. **********The reformers breached the defenses, but then stalled. Within several months the political opposition hardened. Military and industrial lobbies, backed by Parliament and the Central Bank, forced the reformers to fight a rear-guard battle against inflation instead of moving on structural reforms. None of the internal or foreign investment that might have generated progress materialized. **********Mr. Yeltsin became increasingly embroiled in a fight with Parliament, surrendering one reformist ally after another. Mr. Gaidar fell in December 1992, barely a year after he had come to office. When the President finally swept out the recalcitrant Parliament last October, the nation was sick and tired. **********The resignations of Mr. Gaidar and the stern young Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, concluded the first phase of Russian reform. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin vowed that reform would continue, but what he meant seemed more a neo-Soviet reform from on high than the withdrawal of the state that Mr. Gaidar tried. The Future  Success, Disaster Or In Between? **********And so once again the question is whether Russia can still escape its history, or whether the nation will continue in fits and starts. **********If Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Chernomyrdin and the new Federal Assembly find the wisdom and ability to create stability and curb crime, which they have all pledged to do, the vast capital accumulated abroad could start finding its way back to Russia, followed by foreign money. **********That, in turn, would finally foster a constituency for real reform, political parties would form, military conversion would pick up momentum, and Russia's vast natural wealth would be harnessed. **********A debacle also remains possible. In an interview published Saturday with the New Daily Gazette, Mr. Gorbachev warned: ""If reforms continue driving people into a dead end, into a corner, discontent could spring loose, and extremism would come in demand. And then, to halt the lawlessness, the military will step in."" **********But the future will most probably vacillate somewhere in between. The main forces of the state -- the President, the Prime Minister, and the lower house of Parliament -- are likely to follow the Russian tradition of seeking to accumulate powers, arguing that these are vital to overcome resistance. **********Mr. Yeltsin has already gathered considerable formal power through his Constitution, which in effect enables him to pick the government and override the legislature, and his growing presidential staff looks more and more like the old Central Committee apparat. **********But Mr. Chernomyrdin has a potent lobby behind him, both in the wealthy gas and oil industry from which he hales and in the industrial and military managers who have put their hopes in him. And the lower house of the Parliament has made clear it intends to play a serious role. **********That in itself makes it unlikely that any one branch will gather enough power to impose its will on the others or on the nation. What is more important is that even if the entire government agreed on reimposing price controls, state orders and iron discipline, it would not succeed for long. **********Too many processes have been set loose, too many levers have been released, too many old state industries have become comatose for any chance of a return to old-style state control. Whatever its ideological tint, Russia's government will have no choice but to continue trying to reform. **********The question is how fast and at what price. If the nine years since perestroika began are a guide, the pace will be slow and uneven, beset with setbacks, obstacles and occasional violence. **********Russia's chronic chaos is both its burden and its strength. Few nations could have endured what Russia has gone through in the last decade without a total breakdown. **********But Russians have persevered.  There will be no miracle, but with any luck Russia may one day dig into that roasted rooster without waiting for him to peck."

Said to Be Close to Truce To End Violent Ulster Campaign,I.R.A. Said to Be Close to Truce To End Violent Ulster Campaign," **********The Irish Republican Army was widely reported today to be ready to announce a cease-fire in a move that might end its violent 25-year campaign to expel British troops from Northern Ireland. **********Reports of the I.R.A.'s likely move came from people close to the outlawed organization and from officials in the Irish Government, which has been pressing a peace initiative in the North. **********Expectations of a breakthrough in the conflict have been fueled by a string of events during the last few days, including hopeful statements by Gerry Adams, who as head of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political arm, is generally recognized as its representative. **********In another sign that movement was afoot in a nine-month-old peace initiative, the United States Government has granted a visa to Joe Cahill, a leading figure in the I.R.A., to visit Noraid, an I.R.A. support group. Mr. Cahill has been on a list of people excluded because of his association with an organization that Washington has listed as terrorist. **********In a joint statement Sunday night with John Hume, head of Ulster's most powerful mainstream Catholic party and a man who has been pressing for peace talks for 16 months, Mr. Adams said the ""essential ingredients"" for peace were now at hand. He called on the British Government to respond favorably to any move by the I.R.A. **********Then Mr. Adams indicated on Monday that he had recommended to the I.R.A. leadership that it move toward a peaceful settlement and that he expected a ""speedy response."" The fact that Mr. Adams went public with such a statement was taken as a sign that he felt that hard-liners on the organization's army council, or top leadership body, were willing to follow the course toward peace. **********He declared: ""The potential now exists to move the situation toward a democratic and peaceful settlement. I am satisfied that Irish nationalism, if properly mobilized and focused at home and abroad, now has sufficient political confidence, weight and support to bring about the changes which are essential to a just and lasting peace."" **********""This is the considered position I put to the I.R.A.,"" he added. **********Analysts who have followed the outlawed Irish organization for a decade or more said it appeared that it was on the brink of a historic shift -- ending its 25-year campaign to expel British troops from Ulster by force and relying instead on political developments to achieve its ultimate objective of union with the Irish republic to the south. **********Sectarian violence began a quarter of a century ago when Catholics, who are in the minority in Northern Ireland, maintained that they were persecuted and without full civil rights. With Protestants and Catholics fighting pitched street battles, British troops entered on Aug. 14, 1969, and rapidly became embroiled in the conflict themselves. Calming the Protestants **********Demographics still favor Protestants, but by a dwindling margin: of the North's 1.6 million people, 57 percent are now Protestant and 43 percent Catholic. The Protestants would be instantly tranformed into a minority if the North should join with overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland. **********Today the British Government sought to calm the fears of Protestant loyalists -- who favor continued union with Britain -- by having unidentified spokesmen reassert that no concessions were given to the I.R.A. to extract an agreement and that there had been no change in policy toward Northern Ireland. The cornerstone of that policy is still that there can be no change in the status of Ulster without the consent of those who live there, the spokesmen said. **********But the reassurances did not sit easily with some Protestant leaders, who asserted that they were being sold out. Among them was the fiery Rev. Ian Paisley, who accused the Government of ""caving in"" to Sinn Fein and said an agreement taken against the ""democratic wish"" of the people of Northern Ireland was ""a recipe for civil war"" there. A Visit to the U.S. **********A militant, illegal loyalist group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, which has been assassinating Catholics, warned on Monday night that it would not ""sit back and allow ourselves to be coerced and persuaded into an all-Ireland."" **********One reliable report today said that a delay in announcing the cease-fire had come about because a special American visa had to be arranged for Mr. Cahill, who was charged with illegal entry into the United States in 1984, when he used an Irish passport belonging to someone else. His mission this time is to explain the situation giving rise to a cease-fire to supporters of Noraid, or the Northern Aid Committee, in the United States. The visa was granted to him today. **********[ Mr. Cahill arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Tuesday. ] **********Mr. Cahill, who is 74 years old, is believed to be a founder of the provisional I.R.A. and of Noraid, whose members in the United States had previously disavowed a connection to the I.R.A. and maintained that their money had gone only to help families of imprisoned I.R.A. members. In 1973, Mr. Cahill was convicted of gunrunning in Ireland and belonging to the outlawed provisional I.R.A. In 1981, the letterhead on Noraid stationery included Mr. Cahill's name. **********Today speculation that a break-through was close was heard everywhere, from people close to the I.R.A. in Belfast, in the corridors of Whitehall in London and in Dublin, where the Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, held a Cabinet meeting, to discuss details of the intiative. 'Entirely New Beginning' **********Afterward the Irish Prime Minister said, ""I believe we are poised for peace and in a very short time we will be able to make an entirely new beginning on this island."" **********On Sunday the Irish Prime Minister declared that this opportunity for peace was the best one ""since partititon"" seven decades ago. **********Much of today's speculation centered on the critical question of not just whether a cease-fire would be announced but also for how long it would be proclaimed. Some commentators went so far as to suggest that the I.R.A. might publicly call a halt to the violence, which has taken 3,168 lives during the last 25 years. **********In a joint declaration to try to get peace talks going in December, the British and Irish Governments pledged that Sinn Fein would have a place at the negotiating table if it publicly renounced violence. Afterward, Prime Minister John Major said that a cease-fire of three months would be sufficient to begin talks. I.R.A. Truces in the Past **********In that context, a strong I.R.A. statement giving up violence would put considerable pressure on the British Government to come forward with a dramatic countermove, like reducing British troops or cutting back on the ubiquitous street patrols in Belfast and other areas. There are now 17,500 British troops, backed up by 13,000 police officers. **********The I.R.A. has tried truces before but for the most part they have been limited to the Christmas period, lasting 72 hours. The last lengthy cease-fire occured in 1975, when a Christmas truce from the previous year was extended into the middle of January, called off and then resumed in February. But killings continued and the cease-fire dissolved by the middle of the year. **********An earlier cease-fire was declared in June 1972, but it fell apart after 13 days. In July, 95 people were killed, the highest toll for a single month in the last 25 years. **********Unlike the earlier cease-fires, however, this one, should it materialize, would happen at a time when the Irish Government has joined in the search for peace and there is a specific initiative under way in the form of the declaration of principles agreed to by Britain and Ireland.                    --------------------       Split in U.S. Policy **********WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 (Special to The New York Times) -- The decision to grant a visa to the I.R.A. figure Joe Cahill called attention once again today to a split in American policy. **********The White House ordered that the visa be issued, overruling objections from the State Department, Administration officials said. **********A White House official accompanying President Clinton in Martha's Vineyard said today that the President approved Mr. Cahill's visa Monday night so that he could ""build support in the United States for an end to violence in Northern Ireland."" **********The division was similar to what occurred when Mr. Adams was given a visa to visit the United States in February after having been denied one for many years on the ground that he was a terrorist. **********At that time, Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, recommended that the Adams visa be granted. He also recommended Mr. Cahill's visa, the official said. **********The White House official said that the Administration would consider providing more money to the International Fund for Ireland, a multinational organization that administers development aid to both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. **********The United States currently gives $20 million a year to the fund. The official would not say how much more the United States might contribute."

But as a recent incident involving New York City regulators shows, it makes sense to be a bit wary of the watchdogs, too. **********Last month, the city's lawyers took the unusual step of disavowing criticisms that the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs had leveled last year at ads run by the College Savings Bank in Princeton, N.J. Paul A. Crotty, New York's corporation counsel, told the bank that ""the issue should have been more thoroughly and accurately analyzed."" **********Oops. **********As Americans have become increasingly concerned about saving for retirement and college -- indeed, about investing in general -- financial plans have attracted the attention of do-gooders at every level, from Congress down to local consumer groups. While cynics see some political grandstanding, they concede that many of the new watchdogs are really trying to help average Americans. The problem is that some groups are straying into unfamiliar territory, where ignorance or naivete can breed trouble. As usual, New York City offers an early and extreme example of what could turn up elsewhere. **********The tale of New York City and College Savings Bank is a tangled one involving lawsuits and a heavy dose of politics. It might seem like an aberration -- except that it echoes a rumpus from last summer, when the city decided to get into the business of policing mutual funds. At an August news conference, the department accused three fund companies of running deceptive ads and issued a brochure of advice on how to buy funds. **********In that case, fund industry executives chose to settle rather than fight. The Dreyfus Corporation, however, eventually got the city to agree that its ads were truthful and not intended to deceive consumers. Behind the scenes, many fund executives asserted that city regulators did not have a firm grasp of how funds worked and might have been misleading consumers who relied on their advice. But even lawyers who prepared critiques of the department's guide to mutual funds did not want to make their complaints public, fearing, they said, that they would appear unsympathetic to consumers and that they would rile regulators into retaliating. **********Peter A. Roberts, the chairman of College Savings Bank, shares that last concern, but he is not one to take criticism lying down. In the early 80's, he noticed that college tuitions were rising much faster than inflation, and came up with the College Sure certificate of deposit, which pays interest pegged to an index of college costs. The C.D.'s interest rate lags behind the index by 1 to 1.5 percentage points a year, so parents would have to put in more than the cost of college today to be sure of covering their children's future tuition expenses; the C.D.'s now yield 4.5 to 5 percent a year, more than three-month Treasury bills but less than one-year government securities. **********Since the bank started selling these C.D.'s back in 1987, Mr. Roberts has promoted them heavily while moving aggressively against competitors. One of his favorite targets is the zero-coupon municipal bond, which is a bond that does not pay interest every year; instead, the interest accrues for a large sum at maturity. The bond's supporters note that the bonds won't raise parents' tax bills; Mr. Roberts argues that the fixed rate of interest could fail to keep up with college costs. **********Mr. Roberts's attacks annoyed Zane B. Mann, who publishes the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a small newsletter in Palm Springs, Calif. After the newsletter called College Savings Bank's ads and literature ""bogus,"" among other things, Mr. Roberts sued Mr. Mann for libel. **********How did the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs get involved? While working on his defense last summer, Mr. Mann and his associates started checking with regulators across the country, trying to find if they had taken any actions against the bank. After reading about the city's mutual fund complaints, they phoned the consumer affairs department, which then requested information about the bank. **********On Sept. 1, Jennifer Kohn, the consumer advocate who had written the mutual funds report, said in a letter to Mr. Mann that ""the use of the term 'guaranteed' in the College Sure C.D. is misleading to consumers."" **********The College Sure ad stated that the C.D. ""is the only savings product guaranteed to pay college costs no matter how high they climb."" But under truly extreme conditions, this would not be so. ""A guarantee that does not hold in a worst-case scenario is not a guarantee,"" she wrote. **********Oddly, the city did not publicize the letter or take enforcement action against the bank. Mr. Mann did not use it at his trial, which he won last November, but did use an excerpt in his newsletter. **********Mr. Roberts was furious, not least because, he said, Ms. Kohn had never contacted the bank. Ms. Kohn, who now works for Mark Green, the former head of the consumer affairs department who was elected Public Advocate last November, did not return telephone calls this week. **********Early this year, Mr. Roberts complained to the city's new Republican administration. ""Obviously, there is nothing in this world that is 100 percent positive irrespective of unforeseeable future events,"" he wrote. **********When Mr. Roberts failed to get satisfaction, his lawyers threatened to sue. On May 6, the city backed down. **********Was the problem with the letter's content or with the process? ""All that and then some,"" said Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law division of the city Law Department. **********Under its new commissioner, Alfred C. Cerullo, the Department of Consumer Affairs seems to be retreating from its efforts to regulate securities advertising, something already handled by the New York State Attorney General. Mark Wurzel, Mr. Cerullo's chief of staff, said that in the face of limited resources, the department was trying to avoid duplicating other agencies' efforts. **********For now, the department is concentrating on more traditional consumer issues, such as protecting tourists from scam artists and publishing brochures of helpful wedding hints."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/05/business/investing-credit-card-goodies-with-lower-interest.html,Saul Hansell,1994-03-05,,798,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"Credit Card Goodies, With Lower Interest","INVESTING; Credit Card Goodies, With Lower Interest"," **********MANY credit cards now offer goodies, from frequent-flier miles to discounts on cars and candy bars. Tempting as they may be, these cards are not always great deals. **********That's because the cards with the perks often carry higher interest rates than those without. Some people, of course, pay their bills every month and lap up the bonuses. But most people -- even those who say they pay their bills -- occasionally borrow money on their cards. **********For them, the Chase Manhattan Bank is offering an alternative. A card holder can charge all he wants on his favorite card, earning miles or points or whatever. Then if he doesn't have the cash to pay the entire balance, he writes a check from Chase's Reward Consolidator account, a credit line with a variable interest rate, now at 10.9 percent. **********Since Chase's credit line carries no fee, and the rate is significantly less than the 15 to 17 percent on most cards with giveaways, the product could be a real money saver. **********""This is a way for someone to have their cake and eat it too,"" said Robert McKinley, president of RAM research, a Frederick, Md., newsletter publisher. ""If you are a consumer who has the commitment to charge groceries, gas, taxis and pizza to your airline card or General Motors card and pay it off using a credit line like Chase's, you will get the benefits without paying through the nose."" **********Moreover, by paying the card bill in full each month, the card holder won't pay any interest until the check clears at Chase. This means an average of 45 days without interest. While most credit cards offer a grace period if the bill is paid in full, they charge interest from the date of purchase for a partial payment. **********By having two accounts, one for spending and one for borrowing, consumers may get a better view of their finances. The down side is that juggling two accounts will be more complex. And for borrowers who lack financial discipline, more credit could be a temptation to get too deeply in debt. **********Of course, the two-account strategy does not have to include Chase. Many banks offer credit lines with access by checks, and many credit card accounts offer checks. (Watch out for fees here: Some credit cards charge fees of up to 2 percent on these checks, while others waive the fee for transferring balances from other cards.) **********One credit card without a fee for check use is the Bank of New York Mastercard for members of unions in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The interest is the prime rate, now 6 percent, plus five percentage points, and there is no annual fee. (This account is less useful as a credit card because it does not have a grace period on purchases before interest begins accruing.) **********Another option is the Preferred Credit Line offered by the Republic National Bank of New York, with access by checks at no fee and has an interest rate of prime plus 7.9 percentage points, or 13.9 percent. **********Shopping for the best borrowing deal is easier than finding the best reward program. After the early success of the General Motors credit card, virtually every large retailer and manufacturer is at least considering a credit card program with a bank. **********The ground rule is to pick a card affiliated with something you plan to use. It doesn't help to get a discount on a General Motors car if you buy a BMW. But for people who want their cars, General Motors and Ford probably have the best credit card deals around, offering auto rebates of 5 percent on card purchases. **********The cards linked with the airline frequent-flier programs are also a good deal, if you spend more than $5,000 or so on your card each year. An airline mile is probably worth about 2 cents, so the airline programs offer roughly a 2 percent rebate. Pick the program of the airline you fly most. **********For more moderate spenders, the Shell Oil card from Chemical Bank offers a 2 percent rebate on all purchases and 3 percent on Shell gas. Another choice would be the GE Rewards card, which offers a 2 percent rebate good at several stores, including Kmart and Toys ""R"" Us. **********Even the corner store is getting into the credit card game. Harvest Foods, based in Little Rock, Ark., offers a card with rebates of up to 2 percent on purchases at its 54 grocery stores. So for the modern coupon clipper, a wallet full of cards from different merchants may make sense. Just be sure to shop for the best loan deal separately."

In making his decision, Mr. Heseltine rejected a request from a rival bidder, Anthony F. J. O'Reilly, the chairman of H. J. Heinz & Company of Pittsburgh and the owner of Ireland's largest newspaper publisher, that the deal be subjected to an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A Case of 'Urgency' **********""I am satisfied that The Independent and The Independent on Sunday titles are not economic as going concerns and as separate newspapers and that if the papers are to continue, the case is one of urgency,"" Mr. Heseltine said. **********The decision leaves control of The Independent's parent company, Newspaper Publishing P.L.C., in the hands of a consortium that includes Mirror Group Newspapers and The Independent's founding editor, Andreas Whittam Smith. Also included in the group are the owners of two European newspapers, La Repubblica of Italy and El Pais of Spain. Their complex deal for control of the closely held company is valued at about $112 million. **********After several rounds of bids and counterbids, Mr. O'Reilly emerged with a stake of 29.99 percent in Newspaper Publishing. Mr. O'Reilly and his publishing company, Independent Newspapers of Ireland, had sought an antitrust hearing in an effort to delay the rival consortium's bid long enough that The Independent would have had to turn to him to insure its survival. **********Newspaper Publishing's bank credit expires at the end of the month, and it was unclear how much longer the paper could have continued publishing without new financing. **********The Independent's fight for survival split its staff and led to widespread fears both within the paper and outside that it was sacrificing the principle upon which it was founded -- that of independence from any political party or press baron. Many journalists at the paper also say they fear the deal will bring extensive layoffs. **********In forging a deal with Mirror Group, Mr. Whittam Smith, the founding editor, found a partner who could provide financial support and help cut costs by printing The Independent on its presses. But he was also linking The Independent to a paper, The Daily Mirror, with a long tradition of backing Britain's left-leaning Labor Party. Until his death in 1991, the financier Robert Maxwell controlled Mirror Group. **********Under the deal, Mirror Group and its chief executive, David Montgomery, have made pledges of editorial independence for The Independent. **********The Independent was founded in 1986 and quickly established a reputation for innovation, strong writing and attractive graphics. It grew steadily into the late 1980's, but floundered in recent years as the recession ate into advertising revenues and competition increased."

Mutual fund investors pump in the money.,Market Place; What selloff? Mutual fund investors pump in the money.," **********A LOT of mutual fund investors were frightened by the stock market turbulence in March and April. But even more thought it provided a buying opportunity. **********""It's a positive sign that the first-quarter selloff has not hurt investor confidence about wanting to be in mutual funds,"" said Bruce Speca, a spokesman for the New England group of funds, who reported that new accounts invested 50 percent more money in April than in the comparable month last year. **********Nowhere was that clearer than in aggressive growth mutual funds -- supposedly the riskiest of the lot, and an area that one might think investors would avoid in times of turbulence. But gross sales of such funds came to $7 billion in March, the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported yesterday, breaking the old record of $5.6 billion, set in January, just as the market was peaking. **********""The shakeout in the market hasn't really dented investor confidence,"" said Christian W. Thwaites, a vice president of Aetna mutual funds, who added that if he had been out of touch, with only his fund group's sales figures as a guideline, ""I wouldn't have known there was any sort of correction."" **********At the same time, it is clear that many investors are concerned. As new investors flocked in recently, some of the older ones got out. The net cash flow into aggressive growth funds, after deducting redemptions and net transfers into other types of funds, was a relatively modest $1.6 billion. **********Over all, the minority of investors who try to time markets by moving money from one fund to another showed a distinct concern in March. They transferred $3.7 billion more out of stock funds than they transferred in, the heaviest outflow since $6.3 billion came out in October 1987, the month of the stock market crash. But because of the new money coming in, stock funds as a group had a net cash inflow of $6.7 billion in March. **********In bond funds, which have suffered from rising interest rates, there seemed to be less ambiguity of investor response. There many investors have decided to bail out, and new investors have not leaped in to take up the slack. The net withdrawals from bond funds last month came to $7.7 billion, the heaviest since the $8.7 billion in October 1987. **********That may have slowed down this month. At T. Rowe Price, domestic bond funds saw net redemptions in April, but not at the rate of March. Fidelity Investments also reported money flowing out of bond funds, but some other groups said they had small inflows. **********The stock fund figures, and the reports yesterday from managers who reported more money going into stock funds in April than in March, reflect a confidence that the stock market can withstand the shock of higher interest rates and recover all its lost ground. That belief clearly is held by the professionals who run the stock funds as well as the investors who buy fund shares. **********The managers of aggressive growth funds bought a net $5.2 billion of stock in March, far more than was available from investors, and as a result cut down the cash portion of such funds to 6.5 percent of assets, the same level as in January 1992, just before the small-stock market stumbled. **********But in bond funds, there is no such optimism. Such funds typically carry far less cash than do stock funds, in part because cash flows are less volatile and in part because short-term investments carry far lower interest rates than longer term ones. But at the end of March the cash position in domestic bond funds was 6.4 percent, the highest figure since May 1990, when they were keeping 7 percent of their assets in cash."

France, which rejected the idea last year, has apparently become a convert to military action, despite the risk of Serbian retaliation against its 6,000 troops serving with the United Nations in Bosnia and Croatia. **********On Monday, the 12-nation European Union threatened yet again to use ""all the means necessary, including the use of air power"" unless the siege of Sarajevo ended. Britain Is Cautious **********Britain, somewhat more reluctantly, seems to be moving closer to the French view, though British officials caution that the bombs should not start falling until NATO military officials have carefully thought out plans to protect the United Nations forces. **********But Greece, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, and Canada, which has 2,000 troops with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Croatia, remain reluctant to go ahead with air strikes, though they have repeatedly agreed to threaten them. The Greeks believe that the Serbs have been unfairly blamed for the violence, and the Canadians fear for the safety of their troops. **********Germany, which has no troops in Bosnia, says air strikes should not be ruled out, but will be cautious about urging action on its allies. It appears that the catalyst, if there is to be one, will be the United States. **********For nearly two years, the European allies have tried to bring about a negotiated settlement to the war, and they have also rejected the idea that one could be imposed by outside military force. The reluctance to cross the Rubicon remains strong, unless the bombing has carefully spelled-out, limited objectives like removing the artillery from the hills around Sarajevo. **********""You can't ask the Europeans whether they think you should bomb, because the Europeans are not united,"" said an official in Europe who sympathizes with the President's plight. ""You have to tell them what you want them to do and tell them you are prepared to do it without their backing if necessary."" U.S. Rebuffed Last Spring **********The Europeans rebuffed the Clinton Administration last spring when Mr. Christopher proposed lifting the arms embargo on all of former Yugoslavia to give the Bosnian Muslims a chance to arm themselves, and bombing Serbian artillery positions and supply lines unless the Serbs agreed to peace. **********Frustration over past failures has created a climate of extreme caution and even distrust among the allies.  Some officials here suspect that one reason the French had changed their minds was that they were looking for a way to make the United States seem responsible if they decided to pull their peacekeeping forces out of Bosnia. **********French officials dismiss this concern as baseless, but Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said repeatedly that France was wondering whether there was any point in keeping its troops in Bosnia if none of the combatants wanted peace. Britain, moreover, plans to reconsider its deployment after this winter. **********European and American officials here agree that the only way to impose peace in Bosnia now would be by sending in a large international force -- and that the costs and risks of doing that are unacceptably high. **********A limited bombing campaign against Serbian military targets could also embolden Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government to fight on with even greater determination and thus prolong the war, some officials fear. U.S. Refused to Press Muslims **********The French tried last month to get the Clinton Administration to put pressure on the Bosnian Government to accept a European Union peace plan that would partition the country among its three main ethnic groups, but the United States refused because it believed that the Muslims should not be forced to accept a deal legitimizing Serbian and Croatian conquests. **********A French foreign policy analyst, Dominique Moisi, said, ""France believes the fighting is intensifying because the Muslims think they have more to gain by continuing to fight than by making peace."" **********Mr. Moisi said France was also worried about the potential for a militant Muslim republic in the Balkans. Those fears are shared in Bonn. **********If air strikes do begin, they could take the alliance down the slippery slope of an open-ended military involvement like the Vietnam War. **********""Like everything else in Bosnia,"" a European diplomat said today, ""the choice is between bad, very bad and awful."""

In a fairly successful auction yesterday, the Treasury sold $17.25 billion in new two-year notes in addition to the regular weekly sale of three-month and six-month bills, which has been totaling $27.2 billion for weeks. The two-year note sold at the high price to yield 7.30 percent, up sharply from last month and the highest since December 1990, when it was 7.32 percent at auction. **********Today's auction of five-year notes, however, is expected to be a more difficult sale. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 7.82 percent, up a basis point from Friday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********The demand at auction suggested that some traders and investors were not willing to buy securities with longer maturities amid worries about inflation.

It wants to offer sing-along on demand. **********The Itochu Corporation, one of Japan's largest trading companies, is planning a cable karaoke service for America. **********Karaoke refers to singing along to background music, often with the words and some appropriate scenery shown on a nearby television screen. It is extremely popular in Japanese bars, where inebriated businessmen, overcoming the usual societal inhibition about calling attention to oneself, stand in front of the room and belt out old Japanese ballads or Elvis love songs. **********""Now it's time to introduce some Japanese culture to the United States,"" Ted Matsumoto, vice president of Itochu's aerospace and electronics division, said to reporters Thursday night. Since there are few karaoke bars in the United States, he said, the best way to deliver karaoke would be to the home. **********Actually, karaoke, while not yet mainstream entertainment, has been gaining popularity in the United States. **********Mr. Matsumoto said viewers would select from a menu of songs presented on the television screen. The music and the text of the words would then be transmitted to their television sets or to a small storage device. **********The executive said that Itochu had not made a final decision on whether to go ahead with the plan. It would enter the business with Time Warner Inc., the big cable operator with which it has a financial relationship.

Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina. Blaming opposition from some regional Bell companies, which argued that the legislation was stacked against them, Senator Hollings said he would not have been able to push his bill through before this session of Congress ends next month. **********The defeat could permanently doom what would have been a top-to-bottom overhaul of the nation's 60-year-old communications law. The bill's primary goal was to promote competition and investment in innovative information networks by eliminating regulatory barriers that divide the industry into protected fiefs for local telephone, long-distance and cable television service. **********Despite numerous efforts over the last decade, Congress had never come as close as it did this year to passing a broad communications bill. Reassembling the necessary coalitions and restitching the necessary compromises next year would be difficult at best. **********The impact on the communications industry -- and on consumers -- remains unclear. Industry experts say that Congress was merely reacting to changes already blurring the boundaries between the telephone and cable television industries. Phone companies are beginning to experiment with video services, cable companies are dabbling in telephone service and both industries are looking to bring new computerized ""interactive"" communications services to their networks. **********Those changes, driven by technology and market forces, will continue, the experts say. But without a rewriting of the Federal communications rules, the evolution is likely to be slower and the changes introduced in a more piecemeal fashion around the country. **********""What Congress was trying to do was ratify the reality,"" said Eli Noam, director of Columbia University's Institute for Tele-Information. ""The reality is still going to reassert itself."" **********Even without Congress, moreover, the courts have already begun breaking down barriers. Just today, for example, a Federal court in Alabama ruled that the BellSouth Corporation should be allowed to offer cable television service immediately in its region. Bell Atlantic and U S West had already secured similar court rulings in their regions. **********Today's legislative defeat came despite strong bipartisan support in Congress and a broad consensus that the current law should be modernized to rely far less on protected monopolies and traditional rate regulation and more on open competition and prices set by the marketplace. The House had passed a similar bill by overwhelming margins in June, and the Administration strongly favored the bill's passage. **********The collapse stemmed from resistance from some of the Bell companies, which contended that they would be forced to face direct competition from cable companies and long-distance carriers much sooner than they would be allowed to respond in kind. **********But there were also arcane disputes over the precise details of the legislation, with several Bell companies insisting that the bill be revised to dictate changes in state regulation of telephone rates and to set up procedures for a future review of telecommunications regulations. **********""Only one sector of the industry continues to oppose the bill -- the telephone companies,"" Senator Hollings said today. ""They're very powerful."" **********In particular, he cited last-minute objections raised by BellSouth and the Ameritech Corporation. **********But some experts were less willing to assign blame, saying the bill had become freighted with too much baggage in an attempt to placate too many entrenched industry groups.  The last several months have produced a bitter if predictable battle for political advantage between each of the rival industries and even within individual camps. **********The final showdown took place Thursday night in a private meeting between Senator Hollings and the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. Senator Dole presented a list of changes, most of them favored by the Bell companies, that he said were not negotiable. Senator Hollings refused to go along and decided to call off the legislative effort to pass the bill. **********The Senate bill, like the one passed in the House, sought to overhaul a variety of Federal rules governing telecommunications. **********Under the antitrust consent decree that broke up the old Bell System in 1984, the seven regional Baby Bells were prohibited from entering the long-distance market and from manufacturing telecommunications equipment. The restrictions were imposed out of a fear that the local telephone companies would use their virtual monopolies over local telephone service to squelch competitors in other fields. **********In addition, all big local telephone companies -- including independent ones like those operated by the GTE Corporation -- are prohibited from owning cable systems in their local markets, under a separate law, the Cable Television Act of 1984. It is this restriction that some Bell companies have already successfully appealed before Federal courts. **********Both the House and Senate bills would have relaxed these various restrictions, while requiring all local telephone companies to make room for competition in their own markets by opening their networks to new rivals. Thus, in what amounted to a grand bargain, the phone companies had in principle accepted a host of requirements that made it easy for competitors to connect with the Bell companies' networks. **********But the Senate bill was far more restrictive on the Bells than the one passed unanimously by the House. As originally drafted, the Senate bill would not have freed the Bells to offer long-distance or cable television until they proved that they faced ""actual and demonstrable competition"" in their markets. **********After weeks of wrangling this summer, Senator Hollings worked out a compromise with the Bell companies over the long-distance issue. But local telephone companies remained unhappy about other features, including provisions that they said would delay their entry into cable television. **********The Bell issues aside, some industry experts said the Senate bill had become increasingly complicated as its sponsors tried to shore up support. The original draft swelled from 104 pages to nearly 200. **********Despite the complications, the various sides had seemed to be smoothing out their disputes, and only a few weeks ago prospects for final passage seemed good. **********BellSouth officials refused to comment, relying on a formal statement issued by the Bell companies as a group. Stating that the companies had ""agreed to major compromises"" with many industry groups, the statement said it would ""continue to seek a constructive partnership to pass legislation."" **********Administration officials were dismayed by the events. ""This was a bill whose time had come, and had support on both sides of the aisle,"" said Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce in charge of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. A BILL DERAILED **********The Senate bill to overhaul telecommunications rules would have created increased competition in local telephone markets, in long-distance telephone services and among local cable operations. While most companies wanted access to markets currently barred to them, many opposed the specific provisions in the bill to open their own markets to competitors. Here are the goals of the bill and those provisions that helped to derail it.  Basic Goals of Telecommunications Reform Bill *Allows regional Bell companies to provide long-distance service and enter the cable television industries if the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission rule that the Bell companies would not stifle competition. *In exchange, forces local telephone companies to accept competition in their own market by requiring them to open their networks and let rivals interconnect on non-discriminatory terms. *Instructs the Federal Communications Commission to develop a ""universal service fund"" that preserve low prices for basic telephone service, placing the internal subsidies now channelled through local telephone monopolies with a fund underwritten by all competitors in the local market.  Key Stumbling Blocks: *Bell companies complained they would be denied entry into cable television as quickly as cable television companies are permitted to enter telephone market.  *BellSouth Corporation and Ameritech wanted to include language requiring state regulators to adopt ""price cap"" approach to rate regulation, which would have freed them to keep profits from becoming more efficient.  *Some Bell companies insisted on language to create a joint review board of federal and state regulators that would have had the power to any eliminate telecommunications regulation that it deemed out of date."

However, he said that the outlook for the machinery market and for Case's earnings this year remained strong. He and other Tenneco executives were in New York preparing an international road show to sell investors on Case stock. **********Since the offering was announced on April 26, shares of Tenneco and other heavy-machinery companies have been depressed by concerns about rising interest rates. Tenneco shares closed today on the New York Stock Exchange at $48, up 12.5 cents, but down from $51.75 on the day of the announcement. **********Analysts said that Tenneco was prudent in revising the Case sale and waiting for a stronger market. **********""Better valuations lie ahead"" for Case, said Donato J.

Six people were reported wounded. **********The spectacle of open confrontation between the magistrates and the Government renewed doubts about political stability here, and financial markets registered sharp losses, with the Italian lira, Government bonds and shares all falling. **********Attention was also focused on what has become a central riddle of public life here: Are the magistrates who became heroes for unmasking decades of corruption now pursuing their own political witch hunt, as the Government insists they are, or simply doing their job, which has now taken them to investigating fraud in the national tax police, the Guardia di Finanza, and at Fininvest? **********""The magistrates must do their duty, which is to prosecute crimes that come to their notice, not to get involved in politics or try to overthrow the Government through newspaper interviews: this is shameful,"" Mr. Ferrara said. **********By contrast, Mr. Borrelli said in the interview with Corriere Della Sera in Milan that the magistrates themselves were the target of ""an initiative to discredit us"" as their inquiries progressed with ""new and significant evidence."" **********At issue, investigators said, are bribes of some $17,000 -- relatively minor amounts in Italy's million-dollar corruption scandals -- paid to the Guardia di Finanza to halt inquiries into the ownership of Telepiu, a pay-television station offering mainly sports and movies. Fininvest acknowledges a 10 percent stake in the station but magistrates are seeking to discover whether it controls a bigger share through nominee companies. **********Additionally, magistrates are trying to work out whether a decree issued on Aug. 28 by the Government effectively legitimized Mr. Berlusconi's ownership of a wide range of television and publishing outlets once supposed to be limited by antitrust laws. **********While Mr. Borrelli said the investigation into Telepiu was only one of many being conducted by the Milan magistrates, he told Corriere della Sera, ""What has appeared in the newspapers about the Telepiu problem shows clearly enough that there is a risk of reaching very high levels in the world of politics and finance."""

Today they were still counting, and wondering if they will ever fully calculate what they have lost. **********In the aquamarine waters of the Bay of Jacmel, bodies continued to surface, mostly women and children borne downstream by three rivers that converge here. On the outskirts of town, a concrete bridge has been washed away, severing the only overland link to the capital, Port-au-Prince. Relief workers were able to reach the region only by sea or air. **********Reports of casualties have been slow and fragmentary, but Government and Red Cross officials estimate that more than 500 Haitians perished, mostly residents of flimsy dwellings in urban shantytowns or mountainside villages. **********For people throughout Haiti, but nowhere more than in the south, the storm was a disaster that interrupted a time of national celebration and reconstruction. After three years of harsh military dictatorship and international sanctions, Haitians had hoped for a respite with the return last month of their elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. **********Instead the storm has emphasized the precariousness of the Haitians' situation and the weakness of the Government apparatus at President Aristide's disposal. **********""First the dictatorship, then the embargo, and now this,"" lamented Guyvard Simonis, a student in this town of 25,000. ""We have no jobs, and many people have died or lost their homes or clothing. Really, there is no luck for the people of Haiti."" **********Officials in Jacmel say they believe that many more died in remote villages in the mountains north of here that have no telephone or radio links with the outside world even in normal times. But until the roads reopen, they can only count the bodies wash downstream. **********With the corpses and contaminated water posing the risk of epidemics, the most urgent need is for vaccines and medicine, Government officials say. But stocks of vaccine are virtually nonexistent; there is no plastic sheeting, all-terrain vehicles, flashlights and other supplies normally stockpiled by a country vulnerable to storms and hurricanes. **********The shortfall is generally not due to the economic embargo, from which relief supplies were exempted. The military officers who ran the country until President Aristide's return looted as much money, equipment, supplies and vehicles as they could make away with, so the new civilian authorities are starting with virtually nothing. **********Even in touring the disaster area, President Aristide had to rely on a United States Army helicopter. **********The disaster has also tested the 13,700 American troops who have been in Haiti since September to assure President Aristide's peaceful return. Sent here on a mission that was supposed to be mainly military, they now find themselves playing limited relief and nation-building roles. **********Making use of the same army helicopters that have been ferrying donated relief supplies, American military teams have fanned out across the country with Government officials to assess damage in the hardest-hit towns, mostly in coastal areas of Haiti's southern claw. **********But because their mission is to end early next next year, the Americans will not be able to rebuild the roads, communications systems, electrical power grids and Government buildings that were destroyed. Those tasks will fall to President Aristide's struggling Government and a United Nations force that is to follow the Americans. **********Individual American units have jumped in to help. At the height of the storm in Jacmel, for instance, a Special Forces unit navigated the flooded streets in a rubber boat and rescued 39 people stranded in trees and on rooftops of houses that were crumbling even before the storm. **********""The collaboration with the American military has been very good,"" said Yves Saintphar, one of the young people who have been working in disaster relief here. ""They have helped relieve our misery."" **********Lieut. Jeff Gordon, an American military spokesman in Port-au-Prince, said the American military was preparing recommendations on specific needs that would be passed on to the United States Agency for International Development and to international relief and development groups working here. **********But the American forces have not systematically shared their own stocks of food, medicine, blankets and clothing with victims of the storm. American military officials say that would defeat the purpose of their mission here. **********""If we do everything, then we're not really building the Government itself or helping create a stable environment,"" said Maj. Regina M. Largent, an American military spokeswoman in Port-au-Prince. ""We're trying to let the Haitians and the United Nations do as much as they can."" **********With no bulldozers or big trucks to haul away rubble and bring in building materials, many residents have taken matters into their own hands, cleaning up their towns and scouting places to ford streams or build makeshift crossings **********The damage done by the storm has also underlined the vast extent of the environmental degradation that Haiti has suffered and which the Government must repair if the country is to flourish. For decades peasants have chopped down trees for firewood and stripped away vegetation in a search for charcoal. **********A helicopter ride over the southern area this afternoon disclosed numerous mudslides on mountains that had been stripped by peasants and by grazing animals. Huge deposits of silt remained at the mouths of rivers. **********Even compiling an accurate death toll has proved difficult. In Jacmel itself, Haitian and American officials estimate the deaths at 200 or more, even though only 36 bodies have been recovered thus far, many from villages farther upstream. **********""I'm sure a lot of those villages upstream no longer exist,"" said Warrant Officer Edward Jones, part of the American military detachment here, which has been pressed into duty to assist Haitians in the cleanup. ""We've been up there before and seen the houses built by the edge of the rivers, and we know they could not have withstood the kind of flash flooding we've seen."""

""The general feeling is that there is a pre-emptive attack coming."" **********Despite repeated denials by the Belgrade Government, it has long been suspected that the rump Yugoslav federation, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, has been giving direct support to the Serbian nationalists fighting the Muslim-dominated Government in Bosnia. It was in an effort to pressure Belgrade into halting such assistance that the United Nations Security Council imposed a trade embargo on Yugoslavia in 1992. **********But until now the evidence to support these accusations has not been conclusive. **********The Yugoslav troops operating in Bosnia include special forces commandos from the 63d Airborne Brigade, according to the United Nations officials and Yugoslav journalists. Some report having seen convoys moving on the roads, as well as antiaircraft guns, artillery, tanks and specialized units like underwater demolition teams. **********In addition to the direct military involvement, Yugoslav officials are rounding up Bosnian Serb refugees in Belgrade and other areas and handing them over to the Bosnian Serb army to be drafted, the officials and journalists say. Advances by Muslims **********The propping up of the Bosnian Serbs' army comes as the Bosnian Government, having strengthened its once-makeshift army, has scored advances in the three-way war, primarily against Croatian forces in central Bosnia. Success against the Croats could allow the Government to mount a new effort against the Serbs. The Bosnian Army has numerical superiority over its rivals but it is equipped mainly with light infantry arms and has very little heavy equipment. **********Last week Serbia and Croatia, bitter enemies when the old Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, signed a recognition agreement clearly aimed at uniting against their joint Muslim enemy and reflecting a growing rapprochement between President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. **********Milos Vasic, defense analyst of the respected independent weekly Vreme, which has been investigating the increasing direct involvement of Yugoslav Government troops, said he believed Mr. Milosevic was risking the troop movements in hope of forcing the Muslims to agree to an international settlement. Such a settlement could lead to the end of the sanctions that have crippled Yugoslavia. Backbone of Serbs' Army **********Soon after fighting broke out in Bosnia in April 1992, the Yugoslav Army formally discharged 80,000 ethnically Serbian troops who lived in Bosnia and were garrisoned there. These troops, who were allowed to keep their heavy weapons, formed the backbone of the new army of the Bosnian Serbs. **********The Bosnian Serbs receive food, fuel and weapons from Serbia, and their firepower has been augmented by volunteers from Serbia. The Bosnian Serb militias, organized by militants, are dedicated to a ""Greater Serbia,"" incorporating all Serb-populated areas of Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro. These militias are widely held to be responsible for most of the atrocities in Bosnia. **********Belgrade has made little effort to restrict the militias' operations, and freely allows supplies for Serbian forces to cross into Bosnia. But Belgrade has always maintained that no one now in the service of the Yugoslav Army has been sent to Bosnia. The Death of Capt. Galjak **********One example of Yugoslav Army action that has drawn particular attention here is the case of Capt. Goran Galjak, commander of a special forces unit, whose obituary in the daily Politika on Jan. 18 said that he had been ""killed by the enemy's bullets."" **********The declaration of the cause of Captain Galjak's death was extraordinary. Local journalists say there have been an unusually large number of recent obituaries of soldiers who died in training mishaps or traffic accidents. **********Vreme, in an article documenting the circumstances of Captain Galjak's death, gave a glimpse into the larger Yugoslav military involvement when it quoted a senior military officer as saying what really bothered him was to read of soldiers who ""got killed in a traffic accident when I know they got killed as heroes."" **********According to the accounts published here, Captain Galjak was killed with six other special forces troopers fighting outside Olovo, a small town that is a crucial road junction between the Muslim-held cities of Tuzla and Zenica.  Serbs have been mounting an offensive against Olovo and pounding it with artillery for weeks. **********Captain Galjak's special forces unit, from the 63d Airborne Brigade, based at Nis, was ambushed by Muslims, the published accounts said. Convoys of Cannons **********On Jan. 14 witnesses, including journalists, saw two convoys of 105-millimeter cannons being pulled by vehicles bearing Yugoslav Army markings that had crossed the Drina River in broad daylight from Serbia, traveling toward Tuzla. That same day, a railroad convoy carrying tanks was seen outside Belgrade heading for southestern Bosnia, where Gorazde is a key conflict point between Serbs and Muslims. **********United Nations military observers have also seen large troop movements, some in vehicles without identification, from the Serb-held town of Zvornik, on the Bosnian-Serbian border, toward the mountains surrounding Sarajevo, a United Nations official said. He added that observers had not been able to get near another important river crossing, at Ljubovija, which is believed to be another major military route. **********Yugoslav Army troops are widely believed to have mounted short operations inside Bosnia, often ostensibly while on leave or in uniforms without their identifying patches. What seems different now is that there is no effort to disguise the Yugoslav Army insignia, and that some troops are even carrying their waterproof military identification papers in the special metal locket that is the equivilent of American G.I. ""dog tags."" **********Much of the Yugoslav involvement, a military expert here said, is being directed by the Special Operations Command, which includes the 72d Airborne Brigade as well as the 63d Airborne, and may involve 2,000 or more troops, both career soldiers and conscripts. Refugees Sought for Army **********In another effort to bolster the Bosnian Serbs, the Yugoslav authorities have been summoning refugees into the breakaway army. Men of military age who have fled the fighting to refugee camps here have begun receiving notices to report to local Yugoslav military districts, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which issued a protest after recieving more than 100 complaints. **********At the Yugoslav military offices, they are handed a form, stamped by the Bosnian Serbs' ""ministry of defense,"" headed: ""The Fatherland is calling you."" **********The notice orders the refugee to report to military centers in Serbia for duty in the Bosnian Serb army, adding that service is obligatory and that failure to appear will result in prosecution."

East Jerusalem was seized by Israel from Jordan after the 1967 Middle East war. King Hussein of Jordan lays claim to a protectorate, disputed by other some Arab countries, over Al Aksa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. **********The Vatican, in a statement, said, ""The Holy See and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have decided to take up diplomatic relations with an end to reinforcing the relationship of respect and friendship which already exists between the two sides."" **********The step also appeared to be intended to muffle any negative impact the Vatican-Israeli recognition may have had in Arab countries with Christian minorities. Pope John Paul II has repeatedly said he wants to visit the holy sites of Christianity in the Middle East. Ties With Many Arab Lands **********The Vatican statement said there are about 62,000 Catholics in Jordan, a land of 4 million, including 38,000 of the Latin Rite and 21,000 of the Greek-Melkite Rite. The absence of Vatican ties with Jordan was an anomaly in an area where the Vatican has diplomatic missions in numerous Arab lands. **********The statement praised the work of Catholic clerics in Jordanian hospitals and charitable institutions, particularly at the time of the Persian Gulf war, when Jordan angered much of the Arab world and the West by siding with Iraq. **********Jawad Anani, Jordan's Minister of Information, was quoted in Amman by the Italian news agency ANSA as saying diplomatic ties would foster a Middle East peace and guarantee ""human rights as proposed by the monotheistic religions."" **********That appeared to refer to Jordan's interest in the sites in Jerusalem that are holy to Muslims, but the agency said Jordanian officials refused to comment on the Vatican and Jordanian positions regarding the city's status. In 1980 Israel declared Jerusalem its ""united and eternal capital."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/03/business/low-rates-may-keep-1994-bond-sales-sluggish.html,Jonathan Fuerbringer,1994-01-03,,845,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Low Rates May Keep 1994 Bond Sales Sluggish,Low Rates May Keep 1994 Bond Sales Sluggish," **********Treasuries were everything in 1993, but in 1994 they won't be. And reversals of that stripe will keep heads spinning and returns down in 1994. **********Mortgage-backed securities, which took a beating last year, may be back in vogue, as fewer people refinance higher-rate mortgages. Municipal bonds, underperforming last year because of the oversupply of issues as cities took advantage of low rates, should also shine. And if 1993 was the year of capital gains -- of double-digit total returns -- this will be the year of the coupon -- single-digit payoffs mostly from interest earned. **********The reason: while long-term rates are likely to stay low, they are not favored to dip below 1993's lows. And that steadiness means less chance for the kind of capital gains that, for example, helped bring returns of over 18 percent on the 30-year bond last year. **********""We're trying to lower expectations,"" said A. Keith Brodkin, the chairman of Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston. **********Plunge in Interest Rates **********With a new President and a surprisingly weak economy in the first six months, long-term interest rates plunged, propping up the stock and bond markets and giving investors huge capital gains. This decline, beginning in January, gained force in the summer and fall when it appeared that inflation might end the year lower. With slow growth and declining inflation, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to a 25-year low of 5.78 percent in mid-October. **********The decline in interest rates produced a record $290 billion of new issues in the tax-exempt municipal bond market as state and local governments rushed to pay off older, higher interest rate borrowings. The junk bond market also thrived, setting its own record of $60 billion in new issues as investors set aside credit concerns to seek higher yields in a low-interest environment. **********The scramble for yield will be a prominent theme again this year. With interest rates expected to remain low, picking up higher yields will mean taking on more risk, either by buying securities with longer maturities or by trying corporate or municipal bonds with credit ratings below the top grade or junk bonds below investment grade. **********The 1994 outlook hinges on economic growth and inflation in the United States and the performance of the economies in Europe and Asia that market American exports. **********If the outlook on moderate growth and inflation here and sluggish growth abroad proves correct, long-term interest rates will bounce around in a narrow range between 6 percent and 7 percent. If inflation, with the help of weak oil prices, surprises and winds up at 2 percent instead of 3 percent, long-term rates could fall below last year's 25-year low. The yield on the 30-year bond finished 1993 at 6.34 percent. **********Much of the forecast depends on whether the Federal Reserve raises its short-term interest-rate target, which has been three percent for over a year. Short-term interest rates have already moved higher on this expectation and could continue to rise, depending on the Fed. The six-month Treasury bill finished 1993 with a discount rate of 3.19 percent and a jump of a quarter to half a percentage point is expected. **********If traders and investors think the Fed is not being tough enough in fighting inflation, long-term rates could rise. But, if the Fed is decisive and punctures any burst of inflationary worries, as it did with its subtle shift in monetary policy last May, then long-term rates could fall. **********In either case, rates are likely to remain low. That means that corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than Treasuries, should be more attractive. Junk bonds should be sought out for their yields -- averaging possibly 9 to 11 percent. And steady economic growth with low interest rates will make some of the below investment grade companies selling junk healthier and eligible for credit upgrades -- adding price increases to yields. **********Mortgage-backed securities should rebound this year if long-term interest rates remain stable or inch higher. Last year's rush of home mortgage refinancings, set off by the sharp drop in long-term interest rates, forced the early payoff of many higher interest mortgage-backed securities, undermining their performance. And some refinancing risk will linger this year in the higher yielding mortgage-backed securities because millions of homeowners have yet to take advantage of lower interest rates. So mortgage-backed securities with coupons around 7 percent are safer. **********But municipal bonds may be the most attractive, underappreciated play for investors in 1994, even those who are not in the new top tax bracket, which, with the so-called millionaire's surcharge, is 39.6 percent. **********The reason is that forecasters are predicting a steep decline in new bond issues because stable interest rates will stifle Government refinancing of higher interest rate debt. The record refinancing last year held down prices by swamping investors. But with projected new issues falling almost 40 percent this year that downward pressure on municipal bond prices will disappear."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/03/business/company-news-bankers-trust-denies-rumors-of-europe-loss.html,Saul Hansell,1994-03-03,,781,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bankers Trust Denies Rumors of Europe Loss,COMPANY NEWS; Bankers Trust Denies Rumors of Europe Loss," **********Amid rumors that Bankers Trust had sustained huge losses in European markets, the company's stock did not open for an hour and a half yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, until Bankers Trust denied that it had lost money. **********Shortly before 11 A.M. yesterday, the bank issued a short statement that said that ""its operations thus far for 1994 have been profitable."" At 11:02, Bankers Trust's stock finally opened for trading at $79, down $1.75. Nearly one million Bankers Trust shares traded yesterday, triple the usual volume, mostly at prices below $78, although the stock closed at $78.50, off $2.25 for the day. **********The market was reacting to rumors, mainly in Europe, that Bankers Trust had lost money in the recent sharp and unexpected rise in European interest rates and fall of the dollar against the yen. Bankers Trust takes very large, often aggressive, proprietary positions -- those positions taken for its own account rather than as part of serving customers. Lower Profit Seen **********Indeed, a person familiar with the results of the bank said that its profit from such trading would be significantly lower in the first quarter than in recent quarters. ""It's not going to be a great quarter, far from it, but their are not going to be losses,"" said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********Bankers Trust earned $590 million from trading for its own account last year. The bank is generally considered to be among the leaders in systems to control its trading risk. **********Nonetheless, most analysts expect that trading results for Bankers Trust and other banks will be lower this year than last year's record levels. And it is not unusual for aggressive trading firms to have a bad quarter from time to time. **********""One of the prices one pays with an average return on equity of 20 percent is a certain amount of short-term volatility,"" said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. As measured by its return on equity, Bankers Trust has been among the most profitable American banks. **********Some rumors said that the bank had sustained losses in its dealings in derivatives, complex transactions that have values related to underlying markets, like options on currencies. The person familiar with the bank's results said that its derivatives business was not hurt in the same manner as its proprietary trading. Bankers Trust is a leading dealer in derivatives mainly on behalf of customers. Its proprietary trading is largely holdings of bonds and currencies. Bond Prices Lowered **********In the last two months, many traders and investors have lost money because bond and currency markets have performed the opposite of expectations. Most traders started the year confident that interest rates in Europe would continue to fall and that the dollar would continue to rise. **********When the Federal Reserve moved to raise short-term rates early last month, it caused an unexpected chain reaction around the world raising rates -- and lowering bond prices, which move in the opposite direction -- in other markets. Moreover, the dollar was weakened by fears of a trade war after negotiations between Japan and the United States broke down. **********The market moves were exacerbated, traders said, precisely because so many people had bet in the other direction. Aggressive investors, like hedge funds, who had borrowed on margin to buy European bonds, were forced to sell them as the market declined, leading to a cascading wave of sales. And many institutional investors were moving to liquidate positions as well out of caution, leaving few buyers in the market. **********""Some people are saying they lost a lot of money; others say they were able to duck and get out, but I haven't heard any rumors of people who made a ton of money,"" the head of trading at a large New York bank said. Bid-Ask Spread Widens **********A portfolio manager at a large international bond mutual fund said that bond dealers were far more willing to sell bonds than buy them in recent weeks and that consequently the bid-asked spreads, or the difference between a price a dealer will buy and sell a security, had widened. ""Traders at two firms told us that their managers had ordered them to reduce the size of their positions,"" the portfolio manager said. **********The volatile markets have substantially increased trading volume with customers at many banks and brokerage firms. As a result, those that did not have large proprietary positions may actually have good quarters. **********Because of the rumors, two credit agencies said yesterday that they were affirming their rating of Bankers Trust's debt."

""The West and its institutions have a responsibility now to demonstrate that enough is enough."" **********The diplomat, a central figure in the alliance's planning for the Bosnian war, suggested that an agreement is all but in place for NATO, when it meets here on Wednesday, to set an ultimatum for the lifting of the 22-month siege of the Bosnian capital by the Serbs. **********""The objective is to stop and prevent the shelling of Sarajevo,"" he said. ""We will set requirements on where artillery is permitted to be and make clear what our response would be if these requirements about the positioning and use or artillery are not quickly met. Will and capacity are, I believe, combining to take decisive action."" A Few Days' Notice **********Asked how much time the Serbs would be given to pull back their artillery from the hills around Sarajevo, the diplomat said the deadline would be ""timely."" The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, said this week that any NATO ultimatum should allow a few days at most. **********Conversations today at alliance headquarters here suggested that Canada, Greece and, to a lesser extent Spain and Britain, continue to have reservations about NATO committing itself on a firm course leading to the use of force in Bosnia. These reservations center on strategic considerations and concern over the welfare of soldiers serving in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia. **********But it appears that the balance within the 16-member alliance has tilted, probably decisively, toward using air power as a result of Saturday's mortar attack on the Sarajevo market, which killed 68 people. **********Britain, whose attitude to military action has been persistently cautious and remains so, seems to have moved to a position where it will not stand in the way of air strikes if an ultimatum to the Serbs goes unheeded. ""The balance of risk and rewards has shifted,"" the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd said on Monday. Shift in Spanish Position **********Spain, which has had concerns similar to Britain's over its troops in Bosnia and over the consequences of military action, now seems ready to treat Sarajevo as a separate problem that may require the use of force. **********""We still believe a solution to the war has to be negotiated, but we cannot accept a repetition of what happened in Sarajevo on Saturday,"" a Spanish official said. ""Force may therefore be needed in Sarajevo."" **********Officials of Canada, which has the third largest contingent in the United Nations force in Bosnia, were making no public statements about whether they would oppose the issuing of an ultimatum. **********A Greek spokesman, Evangelos Venizelos, reiterated in Athens today that his Government opposes any armed intervention in the conflict. **********But it appears that the United States and France, long at odds over what to do about Bosnia, have finally found common ground and so given a strong push to NATO planning on Bosnia, which has been plagued for over a year by divisions and dithering. 'Joint Leadership' Cited **********""What has emerged is Franco-American joint leadership,"" the diplomat said, using a phrase unthinkable even two weeks ago. The diplomat added that this partnership was now being broadened into an overall consensus in the 16-nation alliance. **********Last month, the United States and France clashed over Paris's requests to the Clinton Administration to put pressure on the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government to accept a peace settlement based on the carve-up of Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines. **********But a combination of shared outrage in Paris and Washington over the mortar attack and a growing conviction that only concerted action by the Western allies will stop a bad war from getting worse appears to have led to a vigorous reconciliation. **********The effect of a NATO ultimatum would be to put unprecedented pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to reach some kind of agreement, at least over the demilitarization of Sarajevo, when they meet in Geneva on Thursday to resume talks mediated by the European Union and the United Nations Owen Reports Accord **********Lord Owen, the European mediator and a strong opponent of the use of NATO air power, said this week that he had secured an agreement from the Bosnian Serbs to demilitarize Sarajevo. But it was far from clear that the Muslims, who stand to benefit from the use of NATO air power, would agree to give guarantees that they will not attack the Serbs once their heavy guns are withdrawn, or that the Serbs will be true to their word. **********The NATO diplomat conceded that the alliance, originally formed to defend members' territory against the Soviet threat, had been through a painful learning process as it confronted the Bosnian conflict. **********""NATO has never fired a shot in anger and has faced totally new circumstances,"" he said. ""We have been learning by experience what matters, what we can do and what we will do. We're now at the point, I think, where we are ready and able to pass to decisive action."" **********Problems, of course, remain, the same ones that have stalled action for many months: the presence of thousands of United Nations peacekeepers in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia, all potential hostages or targets in the event of an air strike; the potential for an angry reaction from the Russians, who oppose any military action against their Serbian allies; the possibility that attempts to reach a peace settlement will be hindered, not helped, by military action; and the danger that fighting will intensify, which in turn would pose the question of what military follow-up, if any, NATO is prepared to provide on the ground. **********Asked about these issues, the diplomat said: ""There has been a thinking through on a very deliberate basis of all the alternatives. What you see now is the result of months of wrestling with some of the deepest problems ever to face the alliance. But I believe we are now ready to stop and prevent the shelling of Sarajevo."""

Voting Chief Is Satisfied,THE SOUTH AFRICAN VOTE: THE VOTING; Was the Election Fair? Voting Chief Is Satisfied," **********Judge Johann Kriegler casually uses the word ""breakdown"" to describe the election he is running. **********He concedes that many ballots never left the warehouse, that polling places failed to open, that ballot boxes were stuffed ""to a significant degree,"" that voting places often had no impartial monitors and that some election officials were partisan, if not crooked. **********But there is no doubt in South Africa that within a few days he will baptize the new democracy by pronouncing the required four-word benediction -- ""substantially free and fair"" -- over the results. **********""From the outset the commission had no illusions that it could mount a really efficient election,"" the judge said today during an intermission from the crises that still beset the counting of votes. ""It is an Africa-style election. It is not to be measured by European or North American standards. What we're trying to do is put together a credible test of the will of the people."" Perception Is the Key **********In the end, he allowed, it is less important whether the election was really free and fair than whether people accept the outcome as a national verdict on their future. **********Judge Kriegler, 63 years old, is a former trial lawyer and human rights advocate with a reputation for fierce independence, dry wit, flashes of arrogance, and, in his work on the appeals court, a somewhat greater devotion to the spirit of the law than its letter. **********""If it is manifest in a given situation that the rules ought to be stretched because that would do justice, yes, that's my approach,"" he said today in his office at the electoral commission. ""And I've applied it here."" **********To his critics, who have proliferated during the chaos of voting and counting, Mr. Kriegler is an imperious figure and a bad manager, thrust into a job that would have been more appropriate for a high-powered corporate executive. A High Judicial Post? **********The voting confusion has probably not enhanced his prospects for an appointment to the new constitutional court, although lawyers say he remains one of the top candidates. **********The huge and insatiable press corps is annoyed at his testy reaction to questioning and his peremptory decision to ban reporters from polling places (a rule that few local poll officials enforced). **********Foreign observers and some candidates say that in his determination to validate the election he has blinked at irregularities that did not affect the overall outcome but could have cost smaller parties seats in the new Parliament. **********""It was just chaotic from the word go,"" said Tony Leon, a leader of the liberal Democratic Party. **********""The things that could have gone wrong with this election didn't -- violence, murder, mayhem,"" Mr. Leon added. ""But then to be let down by a process that was so Fifth World is a disgrace."" Abuses in KwaZulu/Natal **********Dennis Davis, a law professor who helped draft the new Constitution under which the election is taking place, said he was worried that the commission's failure to prevent rampant abuses in the embattled Zulu province, KwaZulu/Natal, could encourage the losers there to reject the result and resume their 10-year violent partisan conflict. **********Almost everyone concedes that Mr. Kriegler took on one of the most impossible assignments in the history of elections: four months to organize an election in a country where three fourths of the population had never voted, with no voter roll, with any voter free to vote anyplace and with no reliable census to tell the commission where to send ballots. **********""We estimated that we had an electorate of about 22 1/2 million,"" he said. ""Nobody knew. Nobody still knows."" **********To satisfy the national pride -- and the black suspicion of the existing Government -- the commission was forbidden to depend on foreign organizations or on the ministry that handled past elections. **********Many polling places were up unpaved roads in villages without telephones or electricity. Anyone hired to monitor the election was ""likely to be the second cousin of the presiding officer and the son in law of the local chief,"" Mr. Kriegler said. ""The societal pressures are quite considerable."" Change in the Rules **********Halfway into the assignment, the rules were changed to include separate ballots for national and provincial legislatures, requiring that the floor plan of every polling place be redesigned. **********Then a week from the end, after 80 million ballots had been printed, the Inkatha Freedom Party decided to participate, requiring that gummed stickers be added by hand at the end of each ballot. **********The voting became a giant improvisation. When ballot boxes got full because of unexpected turnout, poll officials ripped off the seals, poured the ballots into plastic bags, and reused the boxes. **********When Inkatha stickers failed to arrive, officials let voters write in the name. Rather than risk an Inkatha walkout, Mr. Kriegler authorized the write-ins, and extended voting a day in the Zulu province. **********When counting bogged down, Mr. Kriegler discarded the elaborate procedures designed to account for all ballots. Hard to Affect Outcome **********Cheating, he says, was widespread but probably not enough to distort the outcome seriously. **********""To affect a national seat in Parliament, you need an error of 50,000 votes,"" he said, now an expert in the arithmetic of political larceny. ""And if a ballot box was stuffed, what have you got? At the most 3,000 papers. If it wasn't very skillfully done 2,500, even a little less."" **********The irregularities were troublesome, he said but not nearly enough to make him revoke his post-voting pronouncement that the election had gone ""astoundingly well"" and his wry jest at the paranoia among his fellow whites. **********""The dear little old ladies who were stocking up tinned food are probably feeling silly at the moment and looking for a market,"" he said."

Office in the Same Building **********The investment company and Spectrum, which is a wireless communications company, have their offices in the same building in Manhasset, L.I., where the men were arrested. **********In addition to Mr. Bohrman, 27, those arrested were John Schiavo, 52; John Schoonmaker, 27, and Vincent Muia, 27, all present or former employees of the investment company, and Howard Schor, 46, a Spectrum employee and a former employee of the investment company. They were charged with fraud and conspiracy counts, each punishable by up to five years in prison. **********John F. Kaley, Mr. Schor's lawyer, said the five ""deny the allegations and expect they will be vindicated at a trial."" **********The five men were arraigned at Federal District Court in Brooklyn, whose district includes Long Island. They were released on $50,000 bonds. **********Trading in Spectrum stock was halted by Nasdaq yesterday after the news of the arrests. Trading resumed later in the day, and the stock closed down 56.25 cents, or 18 percent, at $2.50. **********One of the law-enforcement officials said they were also seeking to determine whether Edward W. Maskaly, a Spectrum director whom Mr. Caserta named as Spectrum's chairman and chief executive on Monday, was also involved in the advance-fee scheme or was unwittingly used by those involved. **********Mr. Maskaly has been chief financial officer for the last three years for Jasmine Ltd., a shoe designer and importer, and his record there raises questions about his ability to handle Spectrum's problems.  [ Page D6. ] **********William Campbell, a Spectrum spokesman, said, ""Any suggestion that there is a conspiracy on the part of Ed Maskaly is as absurd as the complaint's allegation that Maskaly is a relative of Mr. Caserta."" **********Mr. Campbell added that Mr. Caserta and Mr. Maskaly would have no comment.  Spectrum Pledges Cooperation **********The company issued a statement that confirmed that one of the men arrested was also an employee of Spectrum. In the statement, Spectrum sought to distance itself from the case, saying, ""No Spectrum officer has been arrested, nor have the premises of Spectrum been searched."" Spectrum said it would cooperate with the Government's investigation. **********In the 27-page complaint filed in the Federal court, an agent with the United States Postal Inspection Service, the law-enforcement arm of the Postal Service, said that after Mr. Sculley joined Spectrum Information Technologies amid national publicity in October, prospective clients of the Caserta Group ""were told that Sculley would be a member"" of the group's board ""and would be taking a financial interest"" in the group. **********But the postal inspector, John E. McDermott, said that when he interviewed Mr. Sculley early this month, Mr. Sculley ""stated that at no time were discussions held regarding Sculley taking any position or financial interest"" in the Caserta group. **********Another investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there was no indication that Mr. Sculley had been involved in the fraud. **********Mr. Sculley left Spectrum on Feb. 7, with as much fanfare as when he arrived four months before, and sued Mr. Caserta, contending that he had been deceived about Spectrum's accounting problems and had not been told that the the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company. Spectrum countersued, but earlier this month both parties agreed to withdraw their suits. **********Sean F. O'Shea, chief of the business and securities fraud unit of the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn, said the fraudulent investment-finding scheme brought in about $2 million a year. He said ""90 to 95 percent"" of the companies that paid advance fees ""didn't get financing."" Mr. McDermott said the advance fees were generally $25,000 to $30,000. **********The criminal complaint describes a scheme in which Richard Schaffert, the head of Louisiana Tannery of Baton Rouge, La., paid $30,000 after being referred to the Caserta Group in late 1990 by a business associate who believed the group ""was a legitimate source for funding."" **********The complaint contends that Mr. Caserta told Mr. Schaffer that his investment company ""had a 90 percent success rate of finding investors"" and that Mr. Caserta ""also mentioned an Edward Maskaly of Jasmine Shoes as an investor interested in the project."" The names of three other potential investors were also provided, the complaint says. **********""Caserta eventually set up a meeting with Maskaly at an attorney's office,"" the complaint says. ""At first, Schaffert was led to believe that Maskaly was going to invest in his company. Eventually, though, calls were not returned and there was no longer any contact."" **********In an April 1991 letter, according to the complaint, ""Caserta wrote that Jasmine Shoes had changed investment priorities and that Schaffert should not depend on"" the Caserta Group ""as their sole financing source."""

You've fetched the last glass of water, arranged the last stuffed animal just so. It's adult quality time. What you crave now, though, is to let loose on the piano. But with those thin walls? Impossible. **********Yamaha, it seems, heard the laments of these silenced poets -- and wants to ride to the rescue. Last week it introduced a piano that, if you wish, is every inch the real thing -- shiny cabinet with keys, hammers, strings, the works. But at the flick of a pedal the piano falls silent -- even as you pound out some ferocious Brahms. Silent, that is, for others; the pianist slips on earphones and is engulfed by a full, rich sound. **********And that's precisely the point. Budding pianists face numerous constraints. Parents can't play when children sleep (one survey shows that a decade ago, just 10 percent of piano students were adults, but that has grown to 35 to 40 percent); apartment dwellers don't want to incite neighbors to pound walls; college students may lack a practice room. In short, Yamaha spies a market. **********Yes, you can rig up various devices to muffle a piano's sound, but that's awfully low-tech -- and it muffles the sound for pianist as well as bystander. And, yes, there are earphone-equipped electronic keyboards -- but they lack the resonance of history. Can you imagine Holly Hunter in the movie ""The Piano"" reaching into a crate -- at sea on her mythic voyage -- to caress a slab of plastic littered with buttons and dials? **********This is ""tradition married to technology,"" Carter Schuld, a Yamaha marketing manager, said of the Silent Series pianos. Among other uses, he foresees schools being able to set up practice labs -- roomfuls of students playing silently -- instead of costly individual rooms. **********Here's how it works: Kick the middle pedal to the left and a device in the piano's innards blocks the hammers just before they hit the strings (the touch on the keys is unaffected). At this point, fiber-optic sensors under the keys take over, measuring the duration and pressure of finger hitting key and creating in the earphones a digital simulation -- a ""sampling,"" Yamaha calls it -- of the sound. And in a sense, the digital sound goes beyond the real thing, for the upright's ""sampled"" sound is that of a concert grand. (Yamaha expects to have silent grand pianos by late fall.) The simulation even picks up any pedal action.  ""The idea is delightful,"" said Anne Farber, a Manhattan piano teacher and a specialist in the Dalcroze teaching method. Looking beyond the obvious advantages, she said, ""When you play, you're in your own private world anyway, and this just reinforces that solitary intimacy."" **********Real traditionalists, of course, would want none of this high-tech gadgetry. And one concert pianist, who asked that he not be named, saw uses for some students but said a serious pianist must hear how the sound is projected into the surrounding space. This pianist practices at all hours, but then again, he has an apartment with walls and floors so thick the neighbors can't hear. **********Others not similarly housed might not mind selling their souls to technology if it means more practice time. But they must also decide it's worth $8,395, compared with roughly $6,000 for an unadorned Yamaha upright. HUBERT B. HERRING"

Also at stake are all 315 seats in the Senate. The campaign has come down to a fight between a left-wing alliance led by the former Communist Achille Occhetto and a right-wing alliance led by the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. **********On the economy, Mr. Berlusconi is promising tax breaks, a million new jobs and rapid privatization to reduce the $100 billion budget deficit, Europe's largest. Mr. Occhetto says the privatization process must not cost jobs. With two million people unemployed -- 11 percent of the labor force -- the issue is critical. Candidates Trade Charges **********After more than two years of scandal that has discredited the postwar political elite, another important issue relates to which candidate will offer a clean break with the past. Mr. Berlusconi says that Mr. Occhetto is an old-style Stalinist under another name. Mr. Occhetto says that Mr. Berlusconi's close ties with the former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, who faces trial on numerous corruption charges, roots him firmly in the old order. **********The new voting system, which was enacted last year by the departing Parliament, was prompted by the involvement of the political parties in the wave of corruption scandals that has swept Italy, and was intended to foster clarity of choice and limit the old fragmentation of the political landscape. **********At the same time, it was supposed to make individual candidates answerable to their constituencies, while curbing the power of party bosses. Under the old system, the bosses were not required to run for office in one-on-one contests, but were assured seats in the legislature that were allotted according to the electoral strength of their parties. **********Fearful of losing power, however, the party leaders in the old legislature pushed through what is in fact a hybrid electoral system. Under its rules, three-fourths of the seats in each house of Parliament -- 475 in the Chamber and 232 in the Senate -- will be decided by the choice of a candidate on the ballot, as in the United States. One-fourth of the seats -- 155 in the Chamber and 83 in the Senate -- will continue to be apportioned to candidates named by the parties according to each party's share of the vote. Three Ballots to Fill Out **********Thus, each voter will have three ballots to fill out in the voting booth. One, to choose a candidate for the Chamber, and the candidate with the most votes will win. The second, to pick one of 15 political parties to determine which share of the proportionally allotted 155 Chamber seats each party will get. Only parties with 4 percent of the vote or more will be eligible for additional seats. **********The third ballot will serve to pick a candidate for the Senate, and as in voting for the Chamber the candidate with the most votes will win. The 83 proportionally allotted Senate seats will be divided among the political parties under a complex formula according to their showing in the direct vote. **********Since candidates running for office in the direct vote for Chamber or Senate may also be put forth by their parties as candidates for proportionally allotted seats, most party leaders are virtually assured of entering the legislature, even if they are defeated in the direct balloting. **********As if this were not enough, the system is further complicated by differences in the voting age, which is 18 for the election to the Chamber but 25 for the Senate. Thus, while 48.4 million Italians are eligible to vote for the lower house, only 41.8 million may elect the Senate."

Then, as United Nations officials looked on, they were bundled onto city buses and taken off to one of the many refugee centers in the Bosnian capital. **********""Serbian soldiers came to my house today and said I was to leave at once,"" said Fatima Potorkevic, aged 75, from the village of Burati, near Rogatica, in Serb-held eastern Bosnia. ""I have no idea where I am going."" **********Sejdalija Mirvic said his village of Satorovici, near Rogatica, was entirely emptied of its remaining Muslims today. The Serbian authorities came to each Muslim household and told the families to prepare to leave. Then they were bundled onto buses to Sarajevo. **********""I had three apartments in my house and a small farm with cattle,"" Mr. Mirvic, 56, said. ""Now all I have left is in these bags."" He pointed to two bundles on the floor of the bus. **********Next to him a woman clutched a sleeping child, a young man stared vacantly into space and an old women wrapped shawls tighter against the gathering cold. The bewilderment on the faces of these uprooted Muslim farmers was that of a rural community thrust suddenly into the harsh lights of an unknown city. **********The scene at the bridge seemed to capture the intractable suffering of the Bosnian war and the apparent powerlessness of international organizations to do anything about it, even after the forced eviction of an estimated 750,000 Muslims from the 70 percent of Bosnia held by the Serbs after 30 months of fighting. **********The eviction of Muslim civilians came as Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, secured an agreement on the reopening of the Sarajevo airport after a two-week shutdown in a meeting with the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. **********Mr. Karadzic had threatened that his forces would shoot down any United Nations flights until the principle of Serbian ownership of the airport was accepted by Mr. Akashi. But the United Nations official said he had made no concessions in gaining Serbian agreement to the reopening. **********Most of the food aid that reaches the city comes through the airport and the prolonged shutdown as winter approaches has caused food stocks to dwindle sharply and food prices to increase. **********Mr. Akashi expressed satisfaction at the fact that a long-delayed prisoner exchange involving 115 Muslim prisoners of war and 160 Serbs had been agreed between the warring parties. Described by United Nations officials as a hopeful breakthrough, the planned exchange was largely overshadowed by the refugees' arrival. **********Many international agencies were represented at the bridge --the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations peacekeepingtroops and the Red Cross. But they had little comment on the Muslim civilians crossing the bridge. **********A local official, Azem Muzan, said 83 Muslims from the Rogatica area crossed into Bosnian Government territory. They have entered a city that is surrounded, short of wood and coal and psychologically exhausted after a 30-month siege."

H. Macy.,Market Place; Weighing the value of an obscure but valuable asset of R. H. Macy.," **********LOST amid the drama of Federated Department Stores' surprise bid to merge with its rival, R. H. Macy & Company, is an obscure accounting issue that would seem to have big implications for a combination of the two retailers. **********Federated's investors, Macy's creditors and Wall Street are wondering what will happen to the more than $1 billion in operating losses accumulated by Macy during its slide into bankruptcy. In the Wonderland of American bankruptcy, those losses have become one of Macy's big assets. **********How a Macy-Federated combination would affect that asset, which represents roughly $350 million in tax savings for Macy, could have an impact on whether Macy emerges from bankruptcy as an independent company or hand-in-hand with Federated as the largest department store business in the country. Macy could lose a portion of those benefits if tax authorities decide a merger with Federated constitutes a change in ownership. **********""We began getting questions about it shortly after Federated announced that it was one of Macy's creditors,"" said Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers. ""Those N.O.L.'s are valuable,"" he added, referring to the accounting term for net operating loss carry-forward, a loss reported for tax purposes that is available to offset future taxable income. **********If a company like Macy loses money in the years before it files for bankruptcy protection, it is allowed to carry those losses forward and use a portion of them to deduct against income when it emerges from bankruptcy. **********On first consideration, some experts predict that Macy's N.O.L.'s will have little role in shaping the company's restructuring. Its ability to use its past operating losses as a shelter is likely to be limited whether Macy emerges from bankruptcy protection alone or as part of a merged company. **********Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a senior managing director at Rothschild Inc., said that under present accounting rules, a tax-loss carry-forward was ultimately worth only five cents on the dollar and usually got used in the reorganization process anyway. **********The question is whether a combination with Federated would limit Macy's use of its losses more than a plan of reorganization that preserved Macy's independence. Federated had substantial N.O.L.'s when it emerged from bankruptcy in 1992, which it used to offset gains resulting from its reorganization. **********Typically, the United States Bankruptcy Code punishes debtors who emerge from its protection with different owners than those with whom they entered bankruptcy by limiting the operating losses they can use as future tax shelters. **********Mr. Willens of Lehman Brothers said a Federated-Macy combination would do no more harm to Macy's $350 million tax shelter than any other scenario under which the retailer would emerge from bankruptcy protection. **********Why? Because Macy is likely to emerge from bankruptcy protection under a reorganization plan that changes ownership by awarding most of its equity to creditors, who are not currently its owners. **********True, but other tax experts said a reorganization that resulted in a stand-alone Macy would have the least negative effect on the tax benefits the company got from its past operating losses. **********""It's not clear what would be more beneficial tax-wise until you see the Federated plan and the internal plan,"" said Richard M. Lipton, a partner at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal in Chicago. ""A reorganization that is self-financed from operations is usually the way to have the least impact on the N.O.L.'s -- usually but not always."" **********Mr. Lipton said a combined Federated and Macy might result in operational efficiencies, which could offset the limitations on the use of Macy's N.O.L.'s that might arise from a combination of the two companies. ""You have to take into account both the tax and business implications,"" he said. **********The bottom line, these experts stress, is that in bankruptcy, where creditors pick over a debtor's balance sheet like vultures cleaning the bones of a carcass, even a seemingly obscure issue like tax-loss carry-forwards can end up having big implications. ""In bankruptcy,"" Mr. Ross said, ""nothing is ever quite as simple as it appears on its face."""

""It remains difficult to specify the timing of a prospective economic recovery, with a battle continuing between positive and negative factors."" **********The cautious assessment, which was echoed by Finance Minister Hiroshi Fujii, contrasts with a recent series of positive economic indicators, including Tuesday's unexpected announcement that the unemployment rate in January had fallen to 2.7 percent from 2.8 percent in December. **********Having consistently underestimated the persistence of what has become Japan's longest postwar recession, and made inadequate policy responses as a result, financial authorities are wary of putting too positive a spin on the data. The cautious outlook also underscores recognition of the frailty of the Japanese economy, which remains vulnerable to setback should the yen rise or trade friction increase. **********""The economy is in a bottoming phase, but basically it is very fragile,"" Kenneth Courtis, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group in Tokyo, told Reuters. ""Anything could go wrong."" **********Economists said the central bank probably would keep interest rates low. But a reduction in the discount rate is unlikely unless the yen surged or the stock market entered a tailspin. The discount rate, the rate the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks, is already at a record low 1.75 percent. **********According to the Bank of Japan's tankan quarterly survey, business sentiment at major manufacturers in February remained at minus 56, the same level as last November and an 18-year low. Sentiment among small manufacturers, however, worsened in February from November, although it improved marginally for nonmanufacturing companies. **********The gauge of business sentiment, known as the diffusion index, compares the percentage of companies expecting business to improve with those expecting it to deteriorate. The survey was conducted on Feb. 10, before the failure of the talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton, which precipitated the yen's surge in mid-February. **********The survey had little impact on the Tokyo stock market, where the Nikkei index rose 219.42 points, or 1 percent, to 20,216.62, due largely to buying by foreign investors. **********The tankan also showed major corporations planned to cut spending on plant and equipment by 9.2 percent in the fiscal year ending this month, down from a 7.5 percent fall seen in November. **********The brightest news Tuesday was the surprising lowering of the jobless rate to 2.7 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December. The ratio of job offers to job seekers also firmed to 0.67 in January from 0.65 in December. **********Economists had predicted a slight worsening of both measures due to corporate downsizing."

Most of the missing information concerns imports. **********In a report to the Council, the commission head, Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, said the monitoring system was at least provisionally functional. But he then listed enough problems to give ammunition to the United States and Britain, which want to hold Iraq accountable not only for technical compliance but also for demonstrations of good intent. **********France, Russia, China and to some degree Spain want to begin releasing President Saddam Hussein from some of the sanctions that have crippled the Iraqi economy and held up payment of foreign debts. **********Diplomats from several countries say it was Bush Administration's policy to build openings into the web of sanctions to allow President Hussein to be rewarded for steps showing cooperation with the Security Council. The Clinton Administration has been taking a harder line. **********Today Russia and France were circulating a draft Security Council statement praising Iraq for its level of compliance while calling for an immediate ""full and transparent accounting of its past programs"" and of its current industrial programs that could have dual civilian and military use. **********During closed-door Council consultations today, the United States and Britain strongly opposed even this step, diplomats said. **********When information on imported components of Iraqi weapons is withheld -- and imports were critical to many programs -- the monitors press foreign governments for details about the sales. Gradually, they are building a dossier with which to confront the Iraqis. **********""The commission has been provided with very important information from governments and also managed to put that information into a systematic and analytical framework,"" Mr. Ekeus said. ""That has given us quite powerful tools and knowledge about Iraq's past programs, which demonstrate that Iraq has been far from open with regard to these programs."" **********Mr. Ekeus also hinted that if Iraq was allowed to sell oil under a resolution adopted in April 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf war, it would take some time to install controls over those sales so that Iraq would be obliged to use at least some earnings in ways defined by the Council. **********In another matter, the United States informed the Security Council sanctions committee on Dec. 7 that it had evidence that Iraq was smuggling oil into the Persian Gulf, passing it off as Iranian. **********Iran called the new allegations ""a funny old story, which has no truth at all."""

Banking Law Is Good, as Far as It Goes"," **********AFTER years of effort under several administrations, Congress has finally passed an interstate banking law, and President Clinton signed it late last month. The measure is undoubtedly a move in the right direction. Its only flaw: it doesn't move far enough. **********In part, the statute is an attempt to inject competition into American banking by allowing banks to establish branches across state lines. But the measure also has an eye on foreign banks. By allowing American banks to grow geographically and to lower costs through economies of scale, the theory goes, the law will make them better able to compete globally. **********True, the measure would put American banks on an equal footing with foreign banks with respect to establishing branches; most overseas banks can set up branches anywhere in their home nations. But there are many other obstacles, both at home and abroad, to American banks. If they are not razed as well, our banks will continue to fight their foreign counterparts on a tilted playing field. **********For starters, look at the powers of overseas financial institutions. Besides conducting traditional lending, many European banks can pursue both securities and insurance business, and do so anywhere within the European Union. With similarly wide powers, Japanese banks often arrange both credit and bond issues for their corporate customers. **********But, under the Glass-Steagall Act, American banks are barred from any such combination of commercial banking and investment banking. And while many foreign banks can be large shareholders in industrial companies, that relationship is also forbidden to banks here. **********Moreover, many public and private banks in Europe, Asia and Latin America get significant government help both in expanding abroad and in protecting themselves from foreign competition at home. In the European Union, for instance, many governments finance banks' initial research into overseas markets. Also common are laws that set ceilings on foreign holdings of bank stocks or reserve government business to domestic institutions. **********Some developing nations help their native banks by routinely flouting the principle of equal treatment of in-country businesses regardless of nationality. In Russia and China, domestic banks are granted sole license to handle domestic currency transactions. Brazil has a constitutional ban on bank openings that, while it facially applies to all banks, primarily affects foreign ones. And India enforces a quota system that limits foreign-run branches there to the number of Indian outlets overseas. **********Unfortunately, there are few checks on this bias in favor of native banks. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, signed by 123 nations in April, does not address these practices. Nations using them successfully argued that financial services deserve special government involvement and so should be outside the treaty. **********And while Congress has been considering a bill to permit economic retaliation if American banks are barred from foreign markets, the measure has been delayed. Thus, the only current efforts to correct matters are bilateral talks between America and other nations; those negotiations will cease when multilateral discussions resume next year. **********How do the broad powers and protectionist advantages of foreign banks emerge on the bottom line? While America's 8,000 banks are now enjoying record profits, few of those dollars come from overseas. Foreign banks, on the other hand, own 20 percent of the assets of the American banking industry and 30 percent of its commercial loans. And Asian and Latin American banks -- among the strongest proponents of keeping banks out of GATT -- are planning to increase their American presence. **********To undo the tilt in favor of foreign banks, we must take action both at home and abroad. Here, Washington must let banks into securities, insurance and other businesses open to foreign banks. Also, the Government must extend technical and financial support to smaller banks for setting up international operations; eventually, the costs would be offset by the benefits to the nation of a stronger banking industry. **********Globally, the United States must work hard for uniform rules for bank regulation and bank competition -- perhaps through a special financial services forum that will consolidate the currently scattered efforts. **********Banking is going global fast. And while the recently enacted interstate banking bill is a nice move, it is just a small step. Bolder initiatives will be required."

The files, started 40 years ago in much simpler form, now hold information on an astounding 100 million households worldwide. **********Although the venerable 72-year-old Reader's Digest magazine gives the company its identity, the data base is its lifeblood. Virtually all the company's operations are connected to it. And the company, protecting the secrecy of the data base, neither rents nor sells its lists of names. Source of New Names **********James P. Schadt, the president and chief operating officer of the company, who will succeed George V. Grune as chief executive on Aug. 1, said the data base would continue to drive the company's operations. And Reader's Digest magazine, with its monthly global circulation of 28 million -- 15 million of it in the United States -- will continue to be the main source of names for the data base. **********Mr. Schadt also wants to expand the company's operations abroad; a Polish version of Reader's Digest will become the magazine's 44th international edition next year. **********The company had revenues of $2.9 billion in 1993, almost all of it generated through mail orders and subscriptions. Books accounted for 49 percent of total revenue; Reader's Digest magazine, 25 percent; compact disks and cassettes, 14 percent; videos, 5 percent, and special-interest magazines, 3 percent. **********""We believe we can grow at a very good rate without changing the nature of our business,"" Mr. Schadt said over lunch at the company's 127-acre complex. ""The most important thing still is getting long-term customers."" **********There have been bumps along the way in the development of the data base, however, and the company has learned that a marketer's dream can turn into a nightmare. **********A couple of years ago, the stream of special offers of various company products began to flow out of control because of a lack of coordination among the company's divisions. **********A Reader's Digest subscriber with an interest in travel, for instance, might receive offers for travel books, for a video about England and for a subscription to Travel Holiday, a company magazine. **********But the offers came too fast and many people found themselves with unwanted books, compact disks or videos because they had failed to return cards to the company indicating they did not want them. **********""We began to get the sequence bunched up,"" Mr. Schadt said. ""We shot ourselves in the back.""  A Change in Plan **********Sales in the book and entertainment divisions began to slip, and word of the problems began to spread in the financial community. The company's stock, which traded as high as $56 a share in December 1992, fell to $36.875 by September 1993. The company said in May 1993 that it would reduce promotional activity in the books and home entertainment business and make its mailings more selective. **********Dennis McAlpine, media and entertainment analyst at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the number of mailings had been cut and the company's recovery was going according to plan. The stock closed at $40.375 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********""The thing that has always set Reader's Digest apart is that they actually go out to their subscribers and say, 'What do you want?' Then they go out and sell three million,"" Mr. McAlpine said. ""But I think the thing that surprised Wall Street was that the vaunted data base was a little flawed."" **********For its third quarter that ended March 31, the company posted net income of $92.7 million, down 2 percent from the corresponding period last year, and revenue of $709 million, down 4 percent. **********Global revenue for Reader's Digest magazine was down 3 percent for the third quarter and 5 percent for the first nine months. The company attributed the decline to a difficult global advertising environment. Advertising pages in the United States edition declined every month from September 1993 to March 1994, compared with the months a year earlier, but were up 11 percent for April. **********Alan Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber, said the falloff in ad pages reflected a decline in food advertising throughout the industry. ""Their biggest advertising category is food, and food in calendar 1993 was virtually flat,"" he said. ""It was down in the first quarter of 1994."" **********But he said the magazine was healthy and noted that it ""is not per se the financial engine of growth at the company; it's the front door to the data base."" **********In 1989, the company started a division to acquire special-interest magazines. It now has four in the United States: American Health, New Choices for Retirement Living, The Family Handyman and Travel Holiday. It also publishes Moneywise in Britain. The main objective in acquiring the magazines was to strengthen the data base; so far, the publications have added three million names. **********It has taken a few years to shape up the special-interest magazines, but all have had increases in ad pages this year. Mr. Schadt described them as ""very, very close"" to profitability. A Magazine Tradition **********Of all the company's properties, however, it is the Reader's Digest that has star status. It seems to be a constant in American life -- the magazine that everyone's fifth-grade teacher used to quote and the magazine that still runs features like ""Man's Best Friend"" (""To his dog every man is Napoleon""), ""Life in These United States"" and ""Quotable Quotes."" **********Officials proudly produce charts showing Reader's Digest with the largest circulation of any magazine in Canada, Britain, Finland, Germany, Mexico and Southeast Asia. In the United States, only Modern Maturity, which comes automatically with membership in the American Association of Retired Persons, has more subscribers. **********The magazine, to be sure, publishes classic tear-jerkers like a story in the May issue about Curtis Pride, a baseball player who, almost totally deaf, overcame extraordinary obstacles to play for the Montreal Expos last year. It is vintage Reader's Digest, culminating in a scene in which Mr. Pride, having just hit a two-run double, is told to look up to the stands, where the crowd is on its feet giving him an ovation that he is unable to hear. **********But contrary to what many people assume, about half of the material in the magazine is original, not reprinted from other publications, and there is an emphasis on serious journalism. The May issue has an article entitled ""America's Looming Blood Shortage,"" with business reply cards addressed to the American Association of Blood Banks, through which readers can pledge to give blood. **********""We expect a massive response,"" said Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, the editor in chief. **********The April 1993 issue had an investigative account concluding that millions of children worldwide were being lured into nicotine addiction by the marketing of American cigarettes. The report covered 20 countries on four continents. **********And the June 1993 issue included a meticulously detailed piece, ""Does Oliver North Tell the Truth?"" assessing claims made by Mr. North, the former Marine officer who gained national prominence for his role in the Iran-contra affair and is now seeking the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat from Virginia. Articles on the same topic were soon seen in other publications. **********""It was clear to us that we had access to information that the public didn't have about someone who was increasingly becoming a public figure through his tireless campaign for the Senate,"" Mr. Tomlinson said. **********""We received 50,000 letters saying, 'Cancel my subscription,' "" he added with a chuckle."

Leaky Toilets Are Priority **********Southern provincial officials complain, as President Jiang Zemin did recently, that Chinese cities waste billions of gallons of water each year through poor conservation practices and leaky toilets. Conservation should be tried first, they say. **********""If a country can send satellites and missiles into space, it should be able to dry up its toilets,"" the Chinese President complained last month, sending Communist Party cadres skittering to mount a nationwide campaign against makers of shoddy toilets. **********The aqueduct's path across China would equal the distance from Washington, D.C., to the Mississippi River and it would deliver a volume of water each year -- almost 4 trillion gallons -- that is more than 7 times the volume used annually by New York City, and equal to nearly half that of Lake Mead behind Hoover Dam. This volume is twice as large as the amount delivered by California's largest water-diversion system. **********During the late 1950's, 100,000 Chinese peasants, seized by the political fever of Mao Zedong's call to catch up with the West in the Great Leap Forward, muscled a mountain of stone to block one of the Yangtze River's largest tributaries here and build a dam that would control floods, generate electricity for China's modernization and irrigate the land into a new era of agriculture. They abandoned their farms, lived in mud huts and ate starvation rations for the glory of Communism.  Completing Great Leap **********But the Great Leap's economic flaws instead brought famine to China, killing tens of millions and scaling back huge projects like this one. The hills here remain denuded, stark evidence of the desperate years that followed. **********The aqueduct project has rekindled the hopes of the local population that this dam, after it is raised another 50 feet to create a mighty new reservoir to feed a northbound aqueduct, will finally fulfill the expectations of the ill-fated Great Leap. **********The aqueduct's enormous flow, contained in its manmade channel, will have to cross 219 rivers and streams along its path, including the Yellow River. To accomplish this, Chinese engineers are prepared to dig either a five-mile-long water tunnel under the Yellow River or erect an elevated aqueduct over it supported by 160 giant pylons. Mao's Brainstorm **********Details of the plan for the water project, conceived by Mao Zedong on a trip down the Yangtze River in 1958, are to be presented to the Chinese leadership next spring and comes at a time when China is facing a huge bill for new building that is necessary to sustain its economic boom. **********""Every province has its own very ambitious plans to build bridges and power plants and infrastructure and they are all competing for national resources,"" said Fan Gang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. **********One Chinese official predicted real opposition when the water project is submitted to the National People's Congress, where party members can press regional claims against it. **********""I think this project will be more politically complicated than the Three Gorges Dam,"" Mr. Fan said. Taming the Yangtze **********The Three Gorges project, a 20-year, $10 billion undertaking, was approved after four years of contentious debate within the Communist Party leadership. It is the largest public works project in China today and is designed to tame the Yangtze River while also generating 17,000 megawatts of electricity. But it has drawn opposition from environmental groups inside and outside China because it will flood one of the most scenic river settings in the world. **********The South-North Water Diversion project, as the aqueduct is formally known, would be the second largest national construction project. It would require a six-year effort to expand the reservoir to roughly the same size as that of the planned Three Gorges reservoir. The expansion would displace 225,000 people, mostly farmers, in Hubei and Henan provinces. **********The rescue of northern China's two most important commercial and government centers represents a large and, so far, unfinanced liability threatening the pace of China's economic expansion. Moreover, half of China's 570 cities suffer serious water shortages and Communist Party officials estimate these shortages cost the country nearly $14 billion a year in lost economic output. **********The water crisis in northern China is also an indicator of how China's environment is struggling under the demands placed on it by 1.2 billion people, demands that can only grow. Political Order Threatened **********China's economic expansion coincides with its greatest surge in population, which is expected to peak at 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion in the third decade of the next century. **********Any threat to China's ability to provide enough water for food production, job creation and overall economic growth is a threat to the established political order. **********The plan for the aqueduct project underwent final design reviews late last year, and an initial cost estimate of $5 billion was tallied. But that is certain to grow, just as the Three Gorges estimate grew -- by a factor of 10 -- during its planning stages. **********""This is a bottleneck for the development of the whole north China area,"" said Luo Xuliu, the chief engineer at the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission, where the aqueduct was designed. As Crucial as Three Gorges **********""If they cannot get enough water supply through this bottleneck,"" he said at the commission's headquarters in Wuhan, ""they will not be able to sustain rapid development."" **********""There are dissenting opinions,"" he conceded, but, he added: ""This has to be looked at from the standpoint of the whole country. I personally believe that the significance of this project is no less than that of the Three Gorges in terms of its importance to the nation."" **********""Guangdong Province,"" he continued, ""doesn't have coal, so the country has found ways to send coal from Shaanxi Province down south. The south in turn has water, so it should provide water."" **********In the last three years, a deepening drought, the worst in 30 years, has combined with a construction boom in the capital region to accelerate the rapid drain on the region's water reserves. Day of Reckoning Nears **********Local reservoirs that once fed the agricultural belt outside Beijing have been cordoned off and dedicated to urban consumption. Farmers, meanwhile, have drilled deeper and deeper into diminishing ground water supplies to irrigate their fields. **********Now, Beijing's top water expert says that a day of reckoning is almost here, though the drought was weakened by three days of heavy rain recently. **********""The reserve storage of water will be used up in the next few years without effective water-saving measures with the prolonged scorching weather,"" said Teng Shutang, chief engineer at the capital's water conservancy bureau. After that, he said, ""it will be a crisis"" and the capital's economic development would come to a ""standstill."" **********If nothing is done, Beijing's annual water deficit could exceed 250 billion gallons a year by 2010, a figure equal to half the current annual consumption. **********Perpetual drought, shortage and rationing are images of life in Beijing that its leaders cannot afford as they market the Chinese capital region as a future home for multinational corporations, luxury hotels, shopping districts and housing developments to support an ever larger foreign community in a population of 12 million. Water Table Is Sinking **********More than two million pipe wells have been sunk in northern China to exploit once plentiful ground water supplies, but progressive overuse that came with a doubling of population since 1949 has led to huge areas of ground subsidence, or the sinking of the earth, due to loss of underground water. The water table has been retreating at least one meter a year and in 1993, it dropped 1.73 meters, or 5 feet 8 inches. **********The zones of ground depression in northern China now cover an area as large as Hungary. **********Early water diversion projects focused on the Yellow River, whose waters spawned Chinese civilization 5,000 years ago. But demands on the Yellow River for agricultural irrigation have left its flow dangerously oversubscribed. **********That left the Yangtze River and its major tributaries, like the Han River, which feeds the Danjiangkou reservoir. 3 Projects Designed **********Three engineering projects, each traversing different south-to-north routes, have been designed, and Chinese leaders will have to choose among them. The leading candidate from the engineers' standpoint is the one that begins here and is called the ""middle"" course. **********With the source waters 300 feet higher than Beijing, the aqueduct would be all downhill to its destination and would be able to irrigate a swath of farmland larger than the state of South Carolina along the way. **********With a minimum of six years needed to build the ""middle course"" aqueduct and its related structures, Mr. Teng and other Beijing officials fear a long, drawn-out national debate. The water storage in two smaller reservoirs at Miyun and Guanting that are now flowing into Beijing ""will not last beyond 1999,"" he said, adding, ""I wish this project could start as soon as tomorrow."" **********But a long debate is more likely. Some Chinese officials said they fear the country will violate the spirit of the old Chinese proverb: **********""Don't wait until you're thirsty to start digging the well."""

Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, a New York-based accounting firm, ""and especially this year, since tax rates were increased retroactively to the first of last year but withholding was not."" **********Joseph P. Toce Jr., the Arthur Andersen & Company tax partner in charge of individual services for the Northeast region, pointed to another important reason to make the maximum contribution. ""With shorter career expectancies crisscrossing with longer life expectancies,"" people will need increasing nest eggs, he said. **********Taxpayers can still make these three kinds of retirement plan contributions for 1993: **********I.R.A.'s More than 60 percent of taxpayers are eligible for deductions on individual retirement account contributions of up to $2,000. The accounts may be set up at a bank or brokerage house and money may be added to them until April 15. Married taxpayers filing jointly may take at least a partial I.R.A. deduction if their adjusted gross income is less than $50,000, although the full deduction is limited to couples with $40,000 in income. For single taxpayers the limits are $35,000 and $25,000. In addition, people who were not covered by a qualified retirement plan last year -- for married taxpayers that means neither spouse -- are eligible for a deductible I.R.A. regardless of income. **********Keogh Plans Self-employed people who set up Keogh plans before the end of last year have until the due date of their returns, including all extensions, to contribute money. **********S.E.P.'s Simplified employee pension plans are another possibility for people with self-employment income. Someone who failed to set up a Keogh before the end of last year may still set up a S.E.P. and make a deductible contribution by the extended due date of the return. **********The 1993 S.E.P. contribution limit is 15 percent of self-employment income or $30,000, whichever is less. The same limits apply to a Keogh profit-sharing plan, but a Keogh money-purchase plan permits the lesser of 25 percent of self-employment income or $30,000. Those percentages are deceptively high because the calculations are based on self-employment income minus the Keogh contribution itself and one-half of the self-employment tax. **********""The S.E.P. is a cookie-cutter plan,"" Mr. Neumark said. ""It is free of administrative hassles, but there is little room for options, designs and flexibility."" Therefore, people who are just now establishing a S.E.P. for 1993 may want to set up a more versatile Keogh for 1994, he said. **********These plans are available to anyone with self-employment income, regardless of whether it is from a full-time business or a sideline activity by an employed person. **********People who do not have money to put into the Keogh or S.E.P. right now but expect income over the next few months can file Form 4868 for an automatic extension, giving them a tax return due date of Aug. 15, so they have until then to put money into the retirement plan. If they are due tax refunds, they can file their returns on April 16 and have their refund checks in time to use them for the Keogh contribution, Mr. Neumark said. **********Upper-income people should try to make the maximum contribution, Mr. Toce said, because the ceiling for 1994 falls to $22,500 from $30,000 for 1993. And employed people should take full advantage of 401(k) plans."

Jesse Jackson, the President's special envoy, may have aligned himself too closely with this country's military Government to be a neutral mediator. **********The American Embassy here announced on Thursday that Mr. Jackson and a delegation of State Department and national security officials were expected to travel to Nigeria in the next few days. Embassy officials say Mr. Jackson is acting at Mr. Clinton's request and hopes to deliver a letter from the President to Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military strongman. **********Details of the letter were not disclosed, but an official at the American Embassy here said it would call on Nigeria's military authorities to release Moshood Abiola, the wealthy industrialist and publisher who is widely believed to have won last year's presidential election. Mr. Abiola has been charged with treason and is expected to stand trial on Thursday. **********In his letter to General Abacha, Mr. Clinton is also said to have urged him to honor his pledge of handing power back to an elected civilian government as soon as possible. Resolution by U.S. House **********Earlier this week, the United States House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution calling upon the Abacha Government to release Mr. Abiola and restore democracy in Nigeria. Two key supporters of the resolution -- Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat, and William J. Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat -- are expected to accompany Mr. Jackson on his Nigerian mission. **********But Nigerian human rights campaigners have vigorously criticized Mr. Jackson's mission. They say he has long been a supporter of the former military dictator, Ibrahim Babangida, and has been an unsteady and unreliable advocate for democracy in sub-Saharan Africa. **********""General Abacha will manipulate a visit by Reverend Jackson toward his strategy to cling to power,"" Wole Soyinka, the Nobel Prize-winning Nigerian writer, said in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. **********Mr. Soyinka, writing on behalf of the African Democratic League, a Nigerian human rights group, said Mr. Jackson's relationships with several autocratic African governments would probably compromise efforts to resolve Nigeria's volatile political situation. **********Beko Ransome-Kuti, president of the Campaign for Democracy, Nigeria's main opposition group, said Mr. Jackson was a ""friend and collaborator of the military oligarchy in Nigeria"" and of General Abacha in particular. Seeking a Clear Course **********Olisa Agbakoba, president of the Civil Liberties Organization, said Mr. Jackson ""has not come out unequivocally on the issue of democracy in Nigeria."" **********He added: ""We want people who will be unequivocal and clear about where Nigeria should be going. Jackson's comments have not encouraged that attitude."" **********In a presidential election here on June 12, 1993, the Babangida Government repeatedly cited Mr. Jackson's support of its plan for a highly regimented transition to democracy. While Mr. Jackson never explicitly endorsed any candidate in the 12 election, he was widely perceived here as a supporter of the Babangida Government, which established two parties, controlled their platforms and managed their campaigns. **********When the more leftist party headed by Mr. Abiola appeared to be winning, the Government disallowed the elections, leading to widespread protests that were silenced when General Abacha seized power in a bloodless coup in November. He promptly began dismantling the democratic institutions that had been constructed, abolishing national and state assemblies, dissolving the two legal political parties, removing elected state governors and proscribing all political meetings and associations."

The refugees can be encouraged to dig in and become entrenched in the sordid camps, where military and civilian resources have been dispatched to keep the refugees afloat. Or they can be prodded, but not pushed, to go home. **********In recent days, the preference has become to prepare for the refugees to stay for the long haul, even though this was not the first choice and the implications are unappealing. Already, refugee officials are wondering if the Rwandan refugees will become a prolonged presence, like the 13 years the Cambodians stayed on the Thai border or the 30 years the Eritreans camped in the Sudan. 'Genuine Fear' of Returning **********""In the beginning of the cholera epidemic, I thought the refugees would get up and go home,"" said Mike McDonagh, an experienced hand in refugee crises in Africa and Asia and the director of the relief agency Irish Concern. ""I thought this was the best thing. But I think there is a genuine fear of going back."" **********Entwined in the dilemma for the donors is the realization, now that the emotion of so many cholera deaths has abated, that the refugees include many people implicated in the massacres in which an estimated 500,000 Tutsi civilians were killed. **********Members of the Interahamwe, a militant Hutu militia that carried out many of the killings, have been identified in the camps. Some hold power over food distribution.  'More Difficult It Becomes' **********""No one is under any illusion about whom we are dealing with here,"" Mr. McDonagh said. ""We can't not help these people. But the more you read, the more you talk, the more you see, the more difficult it becomes."" **********Reports from Rwanda that some returning Hutu refugees have been killed by elements of the new Tutsi-dominated Government have added strength to the argument that the refugees should not be hastily returned. Because of the immensity of the atrocities committed by Hutu militia against the Tutsi, retaliation against Hutu refugees is almost to be expected, some refugee experts say. **********The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is responsible for the safety of refugees no matter what their political persuasion or past, has recently become doubly cautious in its policy of repatriation. In 1992, the agency encouraged Tutsi refugees to return to Burundi and some were killed by Hutu. Not Taking Initiative **********Here, the refugee agency's official position is not to stop the Rwandan refugees from going back. But the agency is not taking the initiative to encourage their return, either. **********One obvious way to see whether it is safe for refugees to return would be for the United Nations to investigate the reports that refugees have been killed on their return. But Panos Moumtzis, a spokesman for the agency, said it did not have the staff to do the job. **********Another anticipated way of assuring the safe passage and reintegration of the refugees is through a United Nations military contingent of about 4,000 scheduled to arrive in Rwanda by the end of August. **********But it does not look as though the target date will be met, diplomats said this week. Many of the African countries that have offered troops have said they cannot afford to pay their transportation to Rwanda. **********Adding to the reluctance to expedite the refugees' return are the mixed signals from the new Government in Kigali. After some coaxing from the United Nations, the Government said it would allow the refugees back into Rwanda without any screening for criminality. But then it announced that it would press ahead with war-crime trials without international supervision. **********The State Department, which is trying to encourage the new Government to strengthen its welcome of the refugees, said Thursday that it opposed this approach. It asked the new leaders to open the door to international tribunals. **********As doubts continue about the wisdom of encouraging the refugees to go home, a routine, even an inertia that inevitably sets in after a lot of money and resources have been spent in establishing camps, is setting in here. **********Dozens of international relief agencies are supplying food, water and medicines, alongside soldiers from the United States and France. One agency, Doctors Without Borders, is running one of its biggest operations: 150 Western doctors and nurses and 700 Rwandan and Zairean staff. Lists of Constituents **********The refugees are daily becoming more established. Provincial leaders and those under them have drawn up a list of their constituents just as they did at home. They are doling out food and political favors according to the way it was in the hills of Rwanda. The narrow roads to the refugee camps have become congested with food and water trucks. **********And there is the strong likelihood that the refugees will become politically organized and present a challenge to the new Rwandan Government. The Rwandan Army is milling around the refugee camps, fanning the already strong fear of the new Rwandan Government. **********Already, there are signs of a political cohesiveness. **********Increasingly, in the last few days, refugees have repeated the line that they will organize themselves to go back and overthrow the new Government. Aside from anything else, they say, they have the numbers. Before the massacres, the Hutu represented 85 percent of the population and the Tutsi 15 percent. Since the killings, the numbers are probably even more lopsided even though most of the population is outside the country. **********""The longer the refugees stay, the harder it will be to get them home,"" Mr. Moumtzis said."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/business/where-job-hunters-hit-the-jackpot.html,,1994-06-30,,1642,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Where Job Hunters Hit the Jackpot,Where Job Hunters Hit the Jackpot," **********With pay bounding ever higher and jobs so plentiful that the local employment benefits office is often deserted, this Plains-hugging city of 105,000 is the closest thing in America to a place where it's the job seeker who says ""Don't call me, I'll call you."" **********With unemployment in Sioux Falls the lowest in the nation -- 1.9 percent in May, according to the latest figures from the Labor Department, and possibly less, compared with 6 percent nationwide -- Karen White, personnel officer at Hutchinson Technology Inc., has had to get used to interviewing prospects for the company's computer-parts assembly line at 6 A.M., before they go off to work. **********And Scott Simpson, owner of Sun Masters, which tints glass in cars and homes, says he has more business than he can handle and would open another shop if he could find people to work in it. **********""I've got to go all over the place to get people -- and then I've got to give them an arm and a leg,"" Mr. Simpson complained. ""They're very demanding."" **********At a time when policy makers as well as professors -- to say nothing of the Federal Reserve -- are looking warily at the possible negatives of economic strength, South Dakota's biggest city provides a laboratory of sorts in which to test what economic theory predicts of tight labor markets. **********Foremost is the traditional trade-off between joblessness and inflation. Workers account for about 70 percent of the typical company's costs, and estimates of how low the nation's unemployment rate can go without stoking inflation range between 5 percent and 7 percent. **********But a two-day visit this month showed clearly that pay is not the only thing getting more costly here. The main effect, not surprisingly, is on prices that are locally set, from real estate to haircuts. The leading complaint involves rents, which average about $370 to $750 a month for a two-bedroom apartment, the most popular size; last August, such units went for $350 to $600 a month. ""I'd say rents are up about 7 percent over all from last year,"" said Jeffrey Iverson at the Rental Connection, a locating and property management service. This is triple the national rate of consumer price inflation. **********According to Jim Honermann, owner of Barber Harbor, a large emporium on the 41st Street shopping strip, ""Everything is going pretty fast and furious here."" The basic men's haircut at Barber Harbor rose $1 last year, to $12, and may soon rise again, he said, to ""at least $13."" **********With its its jobless rate down to the so-called frictional pool, composed mainly of people between jobs or new to the labor force, Sioux Falls also fulfills numerous other predictions about the effects of labor shortages. Among these are less qualified job applicants, high turnover, vacancies that on occasion cause work to be contracted out to other areas and intense competition that requires frequent sweetening of pay and benefits. **********Business and government people here say employers would be finding things even tougher if the city were unable to draw workers from a region of small towns and farms that is in economic decline. **********While blue-collar workers are among the hardest to find, service-sector operations like Citibank's huge credit-card processing complex are also pinched, providing academics and policy makers with another situation with test tube potential. Both are newly interested in the wage relationships of people with different skill levels and in ways of gauging the increased mobility and flexibility of the American work force. 'One Occupation at a Time' **********""Increasingly, wage levels are set with an eye to the competitive rates found in the local labor market, one occupation at a time,"" Audrey Freedman, a New York consultant, recently told a House panel examining the distribution of incomes. **********In Sioux Falls, though welders and skilled construction workers are in particularly short supply, the fiercest local job battles tend to be fought over the relatively unskilled. **********""We have raised our entry-level wage three times in the last year and a half,"" said Sandy Stoltz, personnel director for Carlisle Plastics, a producer of food and yard bags for Sears and other major retailers. Most recent was the May jump of 50 cents an hour that lifted starting pay to $6.60, with an extra 40 cents for the night shift. **********At Bell Paper Box Inc., the larger of only two suppliers of priority-mail envelopes to the United States Postal Service, Mark S. Graham, the president, says that 80 percent to 90 percent of new hires leave before working three months. 'I'm Out of Here' **********""We need to bring in three or four people because you're only going to have one of them left,"" Mr. Graham said. When something displeases them, he added, ""they just say 'I'm out of here' because they can go down the street"" and do better. **********Sioux Falls, named for a series of red-rock cascades on the Big Sioux River and boasting the nation's biggest livestock market -- more than 1.1 million hogs, cattle and sheep are expected to be auctioned this year -- is not alone in finding labor an increasingly scarce commodity. To varying degrees, the same pressures are showing up in other metropolitan areas with exceptionally low unemployment rates, a group heavily concentrated in the Midwest, in many cases cities with major universities. ""These places historically have had low rates,"" partly because of a broad mix of recession-resistant business and industry, David Smith, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said. **********And then there are places like Sheboygan, Wis. -- a city whose 3.1 percent unemployment rate places it below the top 10 -- where strong demand for production workers has inspired efforts to import them. A current target is the 2,000 Briggs & Stratton Corporation employees in the Milwaukee area, 50 miles to the south, who were recently told they would be laid off over the next few years as the company shifts some production to lower-cost areas. Hospitable to Enterprise **********Sioux Falls, which like much of the central United States, suffered from the agricultural and energy recession of the 1980's but was largely unaffected by the 1990-91 downturn, is a virtual boom town. It is one of the relatively few places in United States where the factory work force is actually growing. But the a boom is based not on oil or entertainment projects or mega-dollar government projects but mainly on being hospitable to enterprise -- no corporate or personal income tax -- and its manageable size. **********Indeed, the city's tiny minority population -- Sioux Falls is 96.8 percent white, mainly of Scandinavian and German extraction -- has benefited from the intense demand for workers, pulling American Indians and blacks, some with checkered employment histories, into relatively well-paying jobs. **********Among its other advantages are low-cost electricity and a midcontinent location that saves money for telecommunications businesses. **********Virtually everyone here cites the effect of glowing articles in Money magazine, which in 1992 ranked Sioux Falls first on its list of livable locales. Though losing this honor last year, to Rochester, Minn., Sioux Falls still boasted the top-ranked economy. **********But as fast as newcomers arrive, many from neighboring Minnesota, where the tax burden is significantly higher, the Sioux Falls job market bids for them -- whether in financial or medical services or at such manufacturers as Hutchinson, which makes suspension assemblies for disk drives, or Aerostar International Inc., a maker of various types of balloons, including nearly all new balloons over the last 10 years for Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York. Minimum Wage **********At John Morrell & Company, whose 2,800-worker packing plant has been a pillar of the Sioux Falls economy for 85 years, even $9 an hour to start is not enough to keep the ranks full. Hutchinson's $1-an-hour raise, a 16 percent increase in starting pay, for all its production workers last October forced many other employers to follow. Greg Peterson, manager of the local Job Service office, said that not even high school students could be hired here for the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour; they get at least $4.75. **********Another effect of the tight labor market is to force employers to recruit more imaginatively and over ever-greater distances, luring many workers into daily treks of 100 miles or more and threatening the city's 12-minute average commute. Many applicants are already employed, leading to off-hours interviews as people ""take a shot,"" as Mr. Peterson put it, at the most desirable jobs with such regional or national employers as Federal Express, Northern States Power or Burlington Northern. **********South Dakotans who had decided to move to Sioux Falls had produced ""an uneasy marriage,"" said Lieut. Gov. Steve Kirby, who, like many officials in smaller states with part-time legislatures, remains active in business -- in his case a venture capital company. He said depopulated rural areas consoled themselves with the ""spring of money"" that taxes from Sioux Falls provided for the programs of state and local governments. National Job Bank **********Robert G. Stanek, president of the SMC Corporation, said that despite raising wages twice so far this year,his machinery company was short 20 hands, workers he said he would be willing to train free and who could make it unnecessary to contract out some production to nearby parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska. **********Perhaps the best thing policy makers could do, Mr. Stanek suggested, would be to create a national job bank that could link employers here with the legions of motivated but marginally skilled unemployed in other parts of the country, particularly in urban centers. **********""These people,"" Mr. Stanek said, ""are not finding their way to Sioux Falls."""

It employs 1,500 people worldwide and had annual sales of about 460 million DM in 1993. **********Two other recent financial scandals that have rocked the German banking industry - the bankruptcy of the property developer Jürgen Schneider AG and the near-collapse of the big German blue-chip industrial and trading conglomerate Metallgesellschaft AG - have also involved allegations of fraud or derivatives speculation. **********The three cases are alleged to have involved fraud of a kind that German banks and credit supervision authorities now seem increasingly helpless to thwart. **********The Bielefeld prosecutor's office, which specializes in corporate criminality, estimated that Balsam owed 50 German and foreign banks as much as 1.6 billion DM. A Wiesbaden-based factoring company that did business with Balsam faces an additional 2 billion DM loss. No single bank is expected to lose more than 100 million DM, banking sources said. **********Bloomberg Business News quoted German banking sources as saying that the Balsam managers were suspected of counterfeiting audit statements to verify bogus receivables, then obtaining loans that were invested in sophisticated derivative financial instruments, in order to plug the company's operating losses. **********Earlier, prosecutors said that Balsam's chief financial officer had told them that the company had been bankrupt in its operations since the mid-1980s. **********Prosecutors continued their investigation on Wednesday as the company's supervisory board, which oversees the management board, dismissed Balsam's chief financial officer and asked for court- appointed assistance. **********While the German Stock Exchange initially shrugged off fears of large loan losses, market players worried openly that the Balsam scandal would weigh on German bank shares still recovering from the two earlier scandals. **********Bankruptcy experts said the incidence of fraud and other forms of corruption would inevitably rise, along with the tide of overall corporate bankruptcies in Germany. Such cases are heading toward a record 16,000 this year as many companies discover that they exhausted their savings in the current recession, the country's worst in decades. **********Prosecutors said Klaus-Detlev Schlienkamp, Balsam's chief financial officer, who was dismissed Wednesday, confessed to having submitted forged orders to Procedo Gesellschaft für Exportfactoring, the main lender to Balsam. He said he used the payments to speculate on financial markets to cover up operating losses. **********The other board members deny involvement in the alleged scam. **********""It leaves you speechless,"" a top manager at a leading Frankfurt bank told Bloomberg Business News. **********Procedo, one of the biggest factoring companies in Europe, is half owned by Mainz-based Allgemeine Kreditversicherung AG, of which two big insurance companies, Allianz AG and Munich Reinsurance AG, in turn own 25 percent each. **********Factoring companies assume the responsibility for collecting debt owed to their clients. In this case, Procedo paid Balsam hundreds of millions of marks for orders that apparently did not exist. **********""We've only found out a couple days ago that something was amiss,"" a Procedo official said Wednesday."

Ex-Official Is Blamed for German Loss"," **********The catastrophic oil-trading losses on the New York Mercantile Exchange that nearly bankrupted Metallgesellschaft A.G. of Germany last month were the fault of the sprawling conglomerate's former chairman, the company's supervisory board said today. **********At a bitter special meeting of shareholders in the grand ballroom of the Frankfurt Zoo, Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board accused Heinz Schimmelbusch, who was dismissed in December as managing board chairman, of deliberately misleading his superiors and withholding information about losses from oil trading at an American subsidiary, the MG Corporation of New York. **********Mr. Schimmelbusch was dismissed after announcing that the company would swing from a profit of $151 million in the fiscal year 1992 to a huge loss in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. That loss turned out to be $1.1 billion. The company lost another $813 million in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.Responsibility Passed On **********Mr. Schimmelbusch, who currently lives in Manhattan, has refused to talk to the press. **********By blaming Mr. Schimmelbusch, the board appeared to absolve itself of responsibility for the $1.33 billion of losses incurred on the New York exchange in the last nine months as the values of oil-futures contracts plummeted. The losses effectively wiped out the company's equity capital in December. **********Metallgesellschaft is Germany's 14th-largest company, with activities ranging from mining and nonferrous metals smelting to financial services. It was rescued in mid-January, when a consortium of 120 creditor banks provided a bailout with $1.9 billion in fresh capital. The consortium was led by Deutsche Bank A.G. and Dresdner Bank A.G., the two largest German commercial banks, which are big Metallgesellschaft shareholders. **********The debacle at Metallgesellschaft has touched off a bitter public debate about German corporate laws and a two-tiered system of controlling companies. Like most German companies, Metallgesellschaft has a managing board, which operates its businesses, and a supervisory board, which hires and ousts management, oversees its activities and reports to stockholders. **********The debacle has also revived a discussion about the role German banks play in the nation's business and industry. Executives from the nation's top banks sit on the boards of nearly all big companies and their institutions own substantial equity stakes and control vast numbers of shares through proxies from clients.Screams and Shouts **********Unhappiness with that system boiled over today in Frankfurt. Angry shareholders repeatedly disrupted the proceedings with screams of rage and shouted demands for the resignation of Ronaldo Schmitz, the supervisory board chairman, whose main job is serving on Deutsche Bank's managing board. Metallgesellschaft's share price has fallen about 50 percent since the losses came to light. Its shares rose 5 marks today, to 187 marks, on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. **********As his image was flashed on a giant screen above the stage in the ballroom, Mr. Schmitz argued that the losses were kept hidden from his board. ""At no point in time during the fiscal year 1992-93 did the managing board inform the supervisory board about the futures trading in New York, or its increase or the new indebtedness that went along with it,"" Mr. Schmitz told a packed house of hundreds of shareholders. Most of them have minor holdings in the company. Seven institutional investors hold 65.3 percent of Metallgesellschaft's shares. **********Mr. Schmitz also indicated that the company was considering civil and criminal charges against Mr. Schimmelbusch. But the new managing board chairman, Karl-Josef Neukirchen, said Tuesday that the company would not press for charges until it completed an internal inquiry,which is due by March 30."

But 18 soldiers needed hospital treatment, including one with a serious head injury and another with a dislocated shoulder, said William Ormsbee, a spokesman for the United States Southern Command in Panama. About a dozen Cubans were hospitalized, Mr. Ormsbee said. **********More than 600 American troops were rushed in to help 530 soldiers at the camp quell the violence and help capture the escaped Cubans, some of whom tried to swim across the Panama Canal. **********Today's disorder erupted less than 24 hours after 200 Cubans in the same camp commandeered a civilian food truck, broke through the gates of their camp and shattered windshields on three military vehicles. About 40 American troops securing the camp suffered minor injuries in a 30-minute scuffle before the military authorities persuaded the refugees to return to the camp. **********The two incidents together reflect the rising tensions among the 8,600 Cubans who have been held in a diplomatic limbo in Panama since early September. In addition, 22,000 Cubans are under guard at the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. **********The refugees in Panama are among the thousands of boat people who fled last summer but were denied direct entry to the United States. When the United States ran out of room to house them at Guantanamo, Panama agreed to take some in, but under American control. **********Military officials and refugee advocates said the Cubans were angry over the uncertainty surrounding a decision by the Clinton Administration last Friday to grant entry to the United States for Cuban families in the camps. **********Administration officials insist that only the neediest children and their parents will be admitted, but some Cuban refugee groups expect most families to win entry. **********""This is indicative of the frustration that the camp residents are feeling, not about conditions in camp, but about the political situation they find themselves in,"" said Bill Frelick, a policy analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees, who visited the Panama camps in October. **********Details were still unclear tonight but the military authorities said the chain of events started at about 5 P.M. on Wednesday when 500 Cubans in one of four refugee camps began hurling rocks at the unarmed United States troops outside. **********About 200 Cubans seized the food truck and crashed through the gates of the 8-foot-high fence, which is topped by barbed wire. Once outside, the Cubans smashed the windows of two utility vehicles and a van, and demanded to speak to United States Embassy officials. **********Camp authorities blocked the group's advance and promised to consider the refugees' grievances.  The coaxing eventually persuaded the Cubans to go back to the camp, the military authorities said. **********But this morning at about 9 A.M., the officials said, about 200 Cubans began building a barricade near the camp's entrance.

Four Prime Ministers have fallen in the process and a fifth may be consumed this week. **********But when Japanese talk about ""seiji kaikaku,"" or political reform, what they mean depends on who is doing the talking. As Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa makes a last-ditch effort to revive the legislation that was defeated in the upper house of Parliament on Friday, a fundamental question persists on whether anything will change. **********""This is the question I keep asking everybody in town,"" the best-known American politician in Tokyo, Ambassador Walter F. Mondale, said the other day. ""So far, here's my answer: Nobody has a clue."" **********The source of some of the confusion arises from the fact that there are two distinct parts to the reform plan promoted by the Government. Electoral-District Plan **********The first part is a series of anti-corruption measures intended to limit campaign donations from businesses and individuals, and it looks similar to measures curbing the use of such funds in politics in the United States. **********But the other proposal would involve a radical change in the way electoral districts are carved up, and how many people represent each district. The politics surrounding this measure are so Byzantine and filled with tales of surreptitious plots to obtain or hold power that few Japanese understand it. **********The details of both elements are being fought over in a battle among the disparate factions within and outside the Government, a contest in which there are no clear partisan lines. It will be over on Saturday, when the current session of Parliament expires. **********Today Mr. Hosokawa's ruling coalition -- a collection of eight parties that have sharp internal disagreements about the political reform bills -- agreed to form a special committee to try to work out a compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party, which ran the country for 38 years until it was ousted last summer. The Liberal Democrats are also split on the issue, mostly between a group of older conservatives who want to maintain the status quo and some younger, reform-minded members who are terrified of being caught on the wrong side of the debate. Compromise Unlikely **********The chances of a compromise emerging from the committee look slim, political experts say. But both sides were struggling today to make sure that if the political reform effort implodes here for the third time, the other side takes the blame. Mr. Hosokawa was reported to be readying a speech or news conference to take his case directly to the people, an unusual step for a Japanese Prime Minister to take on a piece of legislation. Then again, Mr. Hosokawa is the first Japanese premier known to keep a photograph of John F. Kennedy in his office. **********But in Parliament today, some members of Mr. Hosokawa's coalition said that if the bills fail he would resign. The Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata, hinted Mr. Hosokawa would dissolve the Parliament and declare elections, after first calling one more vote that would flush out who was opposed to the reform bills and who favored them. Still others said the Prime Minister would fold under the pressure, and agree to a watered-down reform plan. **********""This is embarrassing,"" one senior bureaucrat in Mr. Hosokawa's Government said tonight. ""Once we had a Government so stable that the rest of Asia admired us. Now we look like a banana republic."" **********The most straightforward part of the plan would, in theory, make it far easier to determine who is pumping money into the political system. Any donation over $450 would have to be reported; currently donations under $9,000 can go unreported. Any purchase of more than $1,800 in tickets to a fund-raising party would also have to be disclosed; the current limit is $9,000. A public election fund would also be created. Individual Contributions Out **********But most important, the plan would ban any contributions to individual politicians. Only donations to parties would be permitted. The last point has outraged the Liberal Democrats, whose connections to the business community -- and abilities to fix contracts -- are now legendary. They are demanding a new bill lift that ban. **********The critics of the anti-corruption provision argue that it has many loopholes, and that it does nothing to eliminate the cause of bribery: The fact that politicians must pay for most of their own staffs and offices, and contribute to weddings, funerals and other cash-laden events. But public approval for the anti-corruption measures is high, and some suggest that just that part of the bill should be enacted. **********Restructuring the electoral system is a far different matter. Currently, each parliamentary district in the country has four to six representatives. Until the big political upheaval here last summer, when two dozen Liberal Democrats defected to new parties, most districts were represented by three or four Liberal Democrats and then one or two members of the smaller parties: the Socialists, the Communists and a range of others. Limited Representation **********Under the new system all those districts would be abolished. Each new district -- there are 274 in the Hosokawa plan -- would elect one representative. And then, in addition to voting for one parliamentary representative, each voter would get to vote for a particular political party. Two hundred and twenty-six seats would be decided that way, with each party drawing up lists of names of party members who would fill those seats. **********This system was first proposed three years ago, under the premiership of Toshiki Kaifu. Liberal Democrats said it would reduce the money spent in campaigns, because candidates from the same party would no longer run against each other. **********Almost everyone outside the Liberal Democratic Party denounced the plan. It was rigged, they said, guaranteed to keep the Liberal Democrats in power, maybe with 80 percent of the seats in Parliament. There was almost no way a candidate from a smaller party could draw the largest number of votes in most districts: Faced with electing a single representative, rather than a half dozen, Japan's cautious voters would choose a conservative. **********Mr. Hosokawa and his ally, Ichiro Ozawa, have often said that another fracturing was necessary to reorganize the forces of politics. And the electoral system was tweaked to do just that. It would cut down on the number of districts, especially in overrepresented rural areas. That meant that at least 30 parlimentarians now holding Liberal Democratic seats would have to be edged out for party nomination. Presumably, many of them would defect to Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Ozawa's parties, who are short of candidates. **********Here is the mystery: To win a number of the directly elected seats, the coalition parties will have to agree on a single candidate to oppose the Liberal Democrats, or they will end up splitting the pro-reform votes. Right now, those parties can agree on very little. So the system could end up destroying the reformers who passed it."

Now you can rest assured that your assets will go to your heirs, including grandchildren, not the Government. And if there is a family business, it will not have to be sold to pay taxes. **********But there is a villain that could upset these well-laid plans. It is the little-known generation-skipping tax, which is levied at a flat 55 percent on gifts and bequests in excess of $1 million that go to grandchildren or others in a second generation, and is intended to make up for estate tax that the Internal Revenue Service does not get to collect when one generation is bypassed. **********Because the real estate and other assets of a family business often exceed $1 million, business owners need to be particularly careful to avoid springing this tax trap. **********""As a general rule, most people don't have to worry about it,"" said Ross W. Nager of Houston, managing director of Family Wealth Planning Services for Arthur Andersen & Company. ""The big exception is trusts. With insurance trusts, it is particularly surreptitious. Put in small dollar amounts, and one day it will sneak up and bite you."" **********In some ways the generation-skipping rules are parallel to those for gift and estate taxes, in which there is a $600,000 unified credit. Up to $600,000 may be left to heirs tax-free unless the credit has been reduced by individual gifts of more than $10,000 during one's lifetime. **********Similarly, direct gifts to a grandchild of up to $10,000 are free from the generation-skipping tax. **********Here's the rub: assets placed in a trust for grandchildren or left to them in a will may appreciate substantially, resulting in an unexpected tax burden. **********Furthermore, gifts to a trust, like the annual premium on a life insurance policy, are not automatically covered by the $10,000 exclusion. Mr. Nager explained that donors could file a generation-skipping tax exemption election each year, so that, say, the $4,000 annual premium is exempt. Without this annual gift-tax filing, the tax could ultimately be levied on the entire proceeds of the policy. This filing is often overlooked, Mr. Nager said, because it is one line of the fourth page of a gift-tax return. **********Similarly, someone who wishes to give a stake in a family business to a grandchild can do so by having the business appraised, giving stock to the grandchild over a period of years and filing the annual exemption election if the gift is more than $10,000 (or if any amount is put in trust for the grandchild). If the stock is left to the grandchild in a will, it might eventually be subject to tax at an appreciated value. **********Charles Cangro, senior tax manager with Ernst & Young in New York, said, ""The trick is to allocate the exemption early before the assets grow too substantially."" **********Tim Kochis, president of Kochis & Fitz, personal financial consultants in San Francisco, cautioned people to be realistic about their financial situation. ""The important issue is whether one can afford to take an aggressive approach to making gifts,"" he said. **********For example, many couples in their 60's with assets of $1 million to $2 million feel affluent and want to do something for their grandchildren. ""But they may live another 20 or 30 years,"" he said, and a setback in terms of the market, health or inflation could deplete their savings. **********""There is an appropriate balance between tax planning and cash flow and investment planning,"" Mr. Kochis said. ""Also, there may be personal, psychological and family reasons for not doing so."" **********But psychology cuts both ways. Mr. Kochis described one client who was like a racer who kept running, unaware he had passed the finish line. He had amassed a net worth of about $15 million through a lifetime of hard work, ""but still had a working-class mentality,"" feeling he had to struggle and could not help his grandchildren as he would have liked. **********Mr. Kochis ran a number of ""what-if scenarios"" on retirement planning software, showing him that even if he lived to a very old age and his investment returns were exceedingly low, he could easily afford the gifts."

The spots, which promote the lakes, beaches, campgrounds and wilderness areas of Long Island and upstate New York as summer vacation sites, end on a tongue-in-cheek note: ""Even our logo is impressive,"" an announcer says, as the familiar ""I  NY"" icon fills the screen. **********""This is not to take away from McCann,"" said David Ganz, the department's director of advertising and the executive assistant to Vincent Tese, the state director of economic development. Mr. Ganz praised McCann New York for ""a phenomenal job"" on the other aspects of the account, which include strategic development, print advertisements, newspaper inserts, direct marketing and media planning and placement. **********But ""we went through a few rounds of creative that we weren't happy with,"" added Mr. Ganz, who worked at McCann-Erickson for 10 years in New York and Atlanta as an account director for clients like Heublein, Mennen and Sony. ""So it was wonderful to have another agency resource."" **********Anderson & Lembke was available because it had been working since November on an account for the department and a group of 11 New York utilities like Consolidated Edison and Nynex, which formed an organization called the Alliance for a New New York. The account, with billings estimated at $25 million for five years, involves the production of advertising intended to persuade businesses to locate in New York State and to convince in-state businesses to stay. **********The alliance campaign, introduced in late February to positive reviews, carries the theme ""I.Q.NY, a state of minds"" -- puns on both ""I  NY"" and the selling point that the knowledge and intellectual resources of its work force make New York State a desirable business locale. **********Because Anderson & Lembke started working on ""I love New York"" only after the disagreement between McCann New York and the department, it had just weeks to produce the commercials before an early May deadline. More challenging, the assignment was made in March, when, as Mr. Ganz put it, ""it's hard to shoot beautiful scenery because there's two feet of snow on the ground."" **********Because ""we didn't want to shoot in California,"" he joked, the agency had to re-use footage from previous spots dating from 1977, when ""I love New York"" was introduced, to 1985. The old film was spruced up in four days of editing at Charlex, the New York video production house known for computerized legerdemain. **********""I don't know if it's next year's One Show winner,"" John Athorn, creative director with Anderson & Lembke in New York, said, referring to the annual awards ceremony, ""but I don't think we have to make excuses."" **********Indeed, while the commercials are emblematic of the hyperbolic ours-is-better-than-yours genre of state tourism promotion, they look fresh rather than dated. The agency, which specializes in business-to-business advertising, has billings of $110 million in three offices, New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam, and other new clients including Inc. magazine and the translation services division of Berlitz International Inc. **********Hans Sydow, managing director of the agency's New York office, said, ""Their misfortune was our fortune,"" referring to McCann New York. **********""It sounded like an assignment from hell because of all the limitations,"" he added, ""but we feel good about the end product."" **********Mr. Ganz said calling on Anderson & Lembke to help ""was awkward, yet I believe McCann understood."" **********Understood, yes. Even so, McCann New York decided it would not join in the review on the next three-year contract for the account, running from Aug. 1, 1994, through July 31, 1997. The department sent questionnaires to 73 agencies; before McCann New York was awarded the account in August 1991, it had been handled for 14 years by Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York. **********""We have mutually decided not to pursue a further relationship"" with the department, said Susan Irwin, a spokeswoman for McCann. ""It's been a good relationship, but there were some honest disagreements along the line. Sometimes, both sides disagree for perfectly valid reasons on both sides."" **********Anderson & Lembke, needless to say, had a different perspective.

Plan to Shift Power To Outside Directors,COMPANY NEWS; G.M. Plan to Shift Power To Outside Directors," **********In an effort to institutionalize sweeping changes in the governance of the General Motors Corporation during the last two years, G.M.'s board has published a series of guidelines aimed at shifting corporate power from the chief executive to nonemployee directors. **********The guidelines, which are not binding, propose that the nonemployee directors have ""complete access"" to G.M. managers instead of having to go through John F. Smith Jr., the auto maker's president and chief executive; that Mr. Smith undergo a formal annual evaluation by the nonemployee directors, and that those directors -- rather than the chief executive -- choose new directors. **********Also included among the 28 guidelines are recommendations that nonemployee directors receive copies of board presentations in writing and in advance. On occasion, G.M. directors had complained that they were ill informed and ill prepared to render judgments on business issues facing the auto maker. Message in Annual Report **********The existence of the guidelines was first disclosed in a message from John G. Smale, G.M.'s chairman, in the company's annual report to shareholders, which was mailed on March 17. Copies of the guidelines were also sent to 150 institutional investors, members of the media and corporate governance experts. Jay W. Lorsch, a professor at the Harvard Business School, said: ""I'm surprised at how well they've done. I particularly like the way they've thought through how the board will be independent and how the board selects directors."" **********Mr. Smale, a former chief executive of the Procter & Gamble Company, explained to G.M. shareholders that the guidelines were meant to insure that the board ""is performing its responsibilities with the same discipline and dedication that it expects of management."" In November 1992, Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chief executive, resigned under pressure and Mr. Smale, a nonemployee G.M. director, took over as chairman while Mr. Smith became chief executive. **********Mr. Stempel's ouster and the separation of the powers of chairman and chief executive capped a period of turmoil for G.M. that began in the 1980's, when the auto maker lost a huge chunk of business under the authoritarian rule of Roger B. Smith, Mr. Stempel's predecessor as chairman and chief executive. Mr. Smith tightly controlled information and contacts with company officials, causing some directors to feel frustrated that they were not able to gain a clear picture of the company. Big Pension Fund Is Pleased **********""The board didn't act independently, as it should, under Roger Smith, and that's putting it mildly,"" said Richard H. Koppes, general counsel of the California Public Employees Retirement Fund, which says it owns seven million shares, or nearly 1 percent, of G.M. common stock. ""But Mr. Koppes said the management of the pension fund was quite pleased with the guidelines. He said that other companies, which he declined to identify, were deliberating on similar guidelines aimed at making directors more independent. **********Mr. Koppes said he favored the formal separation of the office of chairman and chief executive into two jobs, with a nonemployee director holding the chairmanship, as is the case now at G.M. The G.M. guideline is more equivocal on the subject of separate powers. In the case of a chief executive also serving as chairman, the guideline recommends establishment of a ""lead director"" who acts as chairman of the outside directors, presumably to represent the consensus of the outside directors to company executives."

Variety of Pricing Factors **********The variations underscore the complexity of the F.C.C rules and how they are being interpreted by the cable industry, with pricing permutations based on factors like the number of channels provided and the average personal income of a particular city. **********Indeed, in New York, Time Warner Cable explained today that several of its systems in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn qualified as ""low price"" systems and did not need to drop their rates at all in response to the newest round of regulations. **********As a result, there were several distinctly different interpretations today of what has actually occurred since price regulation went into effect on Sept. 1. **********The F.C.C, which had been embarrassed last year after its seemingly strict first set of cable price regulations actually sent many prices up instead of down, hailed the results of the new survey. Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said the new regulations, mandated by Congress in the Cable Television Act of 1992, had been enormously successful.  'The Cable Act Has Worked' **********""We have broken the back of hyperinflation in cable television prices,"" he said this afternoon. ""This survey means that the Cable Act has worked. It means this is one of the greatest consumer actions in the history of consumer actions."" **********But Richard M. Kessel, head of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, said the cable law and the agency's enforcement of it had been ""riddled with loopholes."" **********""Many consumers in our state have experienced minimal reductions,"" Mr. Kessel said today, ""and some consumers, a significant number, haven't gotten any reductions at all."" **********""I doubt the average cable customer could buy a Happy Meal at McDonald's with the savings they get from rate regulations,"" Mr. Kessel said. **********In its survey of cable prices in the 25 biggest cities, the F.C.C. found that the average basic rate in cable systems covered by the new regulations dropped from $25.17 a month last August to $23.50 today. **********The F.C.C. data did not include the metropolitan New York region outside of New York City. **********Over all, the reductions are roughly in line with what F.C.C. officials had predicted -- though they are smaller than many consumers may have been expecting. **********After two separate efforts to cut cable prices -- going into effect in September and again in May -- the F.C.C. had estimated that its rules would reduce revenues for basic and ""enhanced basic"" services at many systems by as much as of 17 percent. But as a practical matter, many systems were expected to show smaller declines.  Not Universally Applied **********In some cases, the cable operators were already charging relatively low prices, and so were not bound by the cuts. In other instances, cable systems escaped regulation entirely because local governments did not ask the F.C.C. for rate-setting authority. **********And in many cases, including New York City, cable operators avoided steep drops in overall revenues by adding more channels to their line-ups. Time Warner increased the number of channels in Manhattan from 53 to 61 in the last year. **********Richard Aurelio, president of Time Warner Cable's New York operations, said most New York systems could be classified as ""low price"" systems for two principal reasons.  The first is that the systems offer nearly twice as many channels as the nation's average system, he said, and so the price on a per-channel basis has actually dropped. **********The survey supports this assertion, saying that Time Warner's average per-channel price in Manhattan has dropped 22 percent since August, from 49 cents a month to 38 cents. **********The second reason, Mr. Aurelio said, is that prices in New York City are also affected by regional demographics. The new rules let systems charge somewhat higher prices if they are in cities with higher per-capita incomes, partly on the rationale that such areas tend to have higher costs of doing business. **********The survey is hardly the last word on the issue, however. F.C.C. officials emphasized today that the new prices do not have the ""blessing"" of the commission yet; rather, they represent the prices that cable system operators are charging in the belief they conform to the current rules. **********Local governments and consumers can still complain about prices, at which point the commission would scrutinize them to make sure they actually comply wth the rules. **********Within the five boroughs of New York City, according to the F.C.C. survey, since Aug. 31, 1993, rates for basic cable and equipment rates have changed as follows: **********Cablevision in the Bronx, up 4.64 percent, to $25.01; the Time Warner system in Brooklyn that also serves portions of Queens, down 11.28 percent, to $22.65; Time Warner in Manhattan, up 7.43, to $23.58; Paragon in Manhattan, up 7.74 percent, to $23.65; the Time Warner system serving only Queens, up 0.63 percent, to $24.10, and Americable on Staten Island, unchanged at $28.95."

The influx of mostly Tutsi refugees from Rwanda has also touched off revenge killings against Hutu in Burundi. Fears of War **********The army says it plans to disarm the city and the country by force, but diplomats and relief officials say such an attempt would set off an all-out war. **********The army also said today that on Sunday it had foiled an attempt by renegade Tutsi paratroopers to oust the interim President, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. The Army Chief of Staff, Col. Jean Bikomagu, said several people had been arrested. **********As one Western diplomat put it: ""You have to be extremely optimistic to say that things will get better. We've had six months since the coup and things have just rotted. **********""It can't stay in limbo forever. Something will have to give. There is no reason to think that there will not be many, many innocent people killed."" **********Thousands of residents have fled. Many business people and Government officials, worried about security, sleep across the border in Zaire and commute to Bujumbura, 20 miles away. Embassies have reduced their staffs and stand by for evacuation. **********Diplomats say the fighting is not merely a spillover from the massacres in Rwanda but is rooted in ethnic and political tensions that have grown since last October, when Burundi's first democratically elected President, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was killed in a failed coup. **********Both Rwanda and Burundi have Hutu majorities and generally better educated Tutsi minorities. But while in Rwanda the Government and the military have been dominated by Hutu, Burundi has been controlled by Tutsi until recently, and there is a deep-seated hatred between the Hutu and the military. **********Mr. Ndadaye was Burundi's first Hutu leader, and his election marked the end of centuries of Tutsi dominance. But neither Mr. Ndadaye nor his Hutu successor, Cyprien Ntaryamira, were able to end the Tutsis' hold on the military, the country's most powerful institution. **********The killing of Mr. Ndadaye was part of a paroxysm of violence that left up to 100,000 dead and forced tens of thousands of Hutu into Rwanda. Deaths of Two Presidents **********Hutu and Tutsi militancy intensified in Burundi after the assassination, with both sides feeling they had been cheated of power. In January and February, Tutsi extremists paralyzed the capital with strikes. Then in March, heavy fighting broke out in the suburbs between the military and well-armed Hutu militants. **********Hundreds were killed and thousands fled. Human rights groups and diplomats say the army was also involved in killings and looting. **********On April 6, when the new President, Mr. Ntaryamira, and President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda were killed in a suspicious plane crash in Rwanda, Burundi remained calm while Rwanda exploded in violence. Diplomats say the Burundians widely believed that the assassination was aimed at the Rwandan President, not theirs. **********But with most of Bujumbura segregated into Tutsi and Hutu neighborhoods, and with Hutu militants arming peasants in the countryside, the ingredients for widespread blood-letting are there. **********""There is now an open war between the army and these Hutu mercenaries,"" said Sylvie Kinigi, who was Prime Minister under Mr. Ndadaye and briefly head of state. She is a moderate Tutsi who has been threatened from both sides. **********""If we don't act rapidly, then war is inevitable,"" she said. ""Ethnicity has become an alibi for obtaining power."" **********Mrs. Kinigi said the only hope was that Burundians would become exhausted by the fighting. But like many residents, she sees the current problems as a product of a democratic system thrust on her country too abruptly upon independence from Belgium in July 1962. Ultimately, she said, it just fed ethnic divisions. **********""We entered into democracy without having the means of dealing with it,"" she said. ""The process was too rapid. There was no time to form political leaders. So parties formed on the simple criteria of ethnicity. With Rwanda, we have in common inexperience in democracy and ineptness in managing power."""

Europeans, for their part, are still skeptical of American reliance on air power to stop Serbian attacks, and the United States has apparently given up trying to convince them. **********Let's get it behind us, the allies seemed to say today, though the differences remain. ""The importance of today's meeting is that NATO is going to make itself relevant to the future,"" Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. **********Even on this fundamental level there were important disagreements over how fast the alliance should accept applications from Eastern European nations. **********When the Clinton Administration made clear last month that it was ready to move ahead on new members, the allies warned that going too fast could leave Russia feeling threatened. A year ago it was the other way around: Washington was more worried about Russia's feelings than the Europeans were. **********Nor do the Europeans, led by Germany and France, want NATO to take in new members faster than the European Union, which is trying to strengthen its own military arm. **********The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, seemed tonight to confirm European apprehensions when he objected to the one-year schedule that was finally agreed upon, saying it was too short. The initial American proposal was to set a deadline of mid-1995 for NATO to tell prospective new members what they need to do to join. **********At first, Germany and France tried to persuade the United States not to set a schedule, but Secretary Christopher finally persuaded the Germans that if they did not set a date, Republicans in the majority in the new United States Congress could try to impose one. **********""We will present the results of our deliberations to interested partners prior to our next meeting in Brussels,"" the foreign ministers finally agreed. That will not be until the end of 1995, but even that faraway day was enough to upset Mr. Kozyrev. **********American officials said tonight that the British had been the biggest European supporters of the expansion plan. But Britain and France have been the countries most at odds with Washington over bombing Serbs in Bosnia, because they feared retaliation against the nearly 10,000 peacekeepers they have provided there. **********For France and even for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is eager to dispell French fears about the reunited Germany and keep moving toward European unity, NATO does not rule out a separate European defense identity -- one the French have pursued on their own for years. **********Many Germans, used to relying on more than 300,000 American troops in their country to protect it from Soviet attack during the cold war, worry that future administrations may not honor the Clinton Administration's pledge to keep at least 100,000 there after next year. **********The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, also had some words Senator Bob Dole, who is expected to become the G.O.P. majority leader and has been urging the Europeans to get their troops out of the way in Bosnia and lift the weapons embargo against the Government there. **********""Lifting it now would probably make the situation even worse,"" Mr. Kinkel said, repeating a widely held European view. **********Last week NATO and the United Nations could not agree on an American suggestion that intensified air raids could stop the Serbs' advance on the Government-held Bihac enclave, and today one French official said, ""What happened in Bihac is a rehearsal of what would take place if the embargo were lifted."" **********The NATO Secretary General, Willy Claes, observed this evening: ""It is very difficult, maybe impossible, to reconcile a peace mission on the ground with a kind of peace enforcement from the air. We've learned several lessons, and before accepting a new peace mission, we will look very carefully at the rules."" **********The broader issue, though, is whether an alliance whose partners do not agree on the threat itself will long have a persuasive reason for being. **********""For 40 years Europeans and Americans had the same analysis of what the security threat to all of them was,"" said Dr. John Chipman, director of the International Institute of Security Studies in London. ""Now that the Soviet Union is gone, they disagree not only about what to do in the former Yugoslavia, but what the nature of the threat is."""

How refreshing. **********It is no coincidence that a major campaign introduced yesterday for Diet Coke, carrying the theme ""This is refreshment,"" is uncharacteristically infused with those Pepsi-esque attributes. The ads for America's leading diet soft drink are the first since the Coca-Cola Company rocked Madison Avenue in October by replacing Lintas New York, the agency that had handled Diet Coke since its introduction in 1982, with Lowe & Partners/SMS on the estimated $70 million account. **********Apart from Lowe's reputation for drolly unconventional work for brands like Grey Poupon mustard, Lowe executives now instrumental in the Diet Coke campaign, including Lee Garfinkel, vice chairman and chief creative officer, produced memorable Pepsi commercials while at BBDO New York. **********That's why the broadcast, print and outdoor ads for Diet Coke, No. 3 in the nation's estimated $48 billion soft drink market behind only Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi, depart markedly from the bland, old-fashioned strategies once emblematic of Coca-Cola. **********""We've been on a mission to chart a new course,"" Nancy Gibson, Diet Coke's worldwide director, said at a news conference in Manhattan. Offering a preview of the campaign, which begins on Jan. 22, she called it ""light-hearted, witty, built on humor."" **********Indeed. The seven initial television commercials eschew the traditional trappings of spots for diet soft drinks, like impossibly slender women in revealing swimwear, paeans to taste and jingles; ""This is refreshment"" is a punch line, not an incessantly repeated slogan. **********There is, however, beaucoup sex. In one commercial, as the blues singer Etta James warbles ""I Just Wanna Make Love to You,"" female office workers ogle a hunk doffing his shirt and taking a Diet Coke break. In another spot, an embarrassed hotel waiter, delivering Diet Cokes, knocks repeatedly but futilely at the doors of honeymoon suites. **********Asked whether the commercials were salacious, or whether their sensual tone conflicted with Coca-Cola's typical wholesomeness, Ms. Gibson was taken aback. ""They're really a celebration of relationships,"" she said. Bad relationships, too, as witnessed in one spot in which a young woman drives to a pool hall, angrily throws her beau's belongings at him, stomps on his cowboy hat and departs with her dog and her Diet Coke. **********Even so, Ms. Gibson added, in tests consumers perceived the commercials ""as absolutely within the spirit we meant."" **********The campaign is absolutely significant for several reasons. The primary one is that sales of diet soft drinks, 27 percent of the total market, have faltered after years of strong gains. **********""The diet business has really gone into a deep landslide,"" said Jesse Meyers, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter in Old Greenwich, Conn. **********""The problems are exacerbated by 'cola fatigue,' "" he added, noting that colas -- 63 percent of soft-drink sales as recently as the late 1980's -- ""have fallen to approximately just under 59 percent today."" **********The reason for the decline of both categories is competition from so-called New Age beverages like juices, flavored waters and iced teas. **********""New Age is digging into the diet market and they've got to figure out a way to respond,"" said John C. Maxwell Jr., an analyst who follows the soft drink industry for Wheat, First Securities in Richmond. **********Mr. Meyers said: ""It's the fault of the baby boomers. They're as constant as yo-yos, moving like butterflies from teas to juices to diet products."" **********Ms. Gibson acknowledged that many Diet Coke drinkers ""seek novelty in other beverages and have perhaps gone out to explore some of the new product categories."" **********Though recapturing them is ""a daunting proposition,"" she added, the campaign should help because research shows many ""went to those products thinking them healthier, but found they had attributes they didn't realize"" -- like calorie levels higher than Diet Coke's, which is less than one per 6-ounce serving. **********Mr. Meyers predicted that when new labeling regulations take effect later this year, ""some of the New Age products will be revealed for what they are, poseurs masquerading as diet soft drinks."" **********The campaign is also important because it is Diet Coke's first big national campaign since ads carrying the theme ""Taste it all"" were unceremoniously dumped in March, only two months after Lintas New York introduced them. Seven months later, the agency lost the assignment to create Diet Coke ads for English-speaking countries. **********Ms. Gibson, the first Coca-Cola executive to discuss why ""Taste it all"" vanished so abruptly, said it was too reminiscent of the 1980's in articulating ""that we were looking for it all."" **********""We're not aspiring all the time to bigger and better,"" she added. ""We're seeking some balance in life, focusing on some of the simpler pleasures."" **********One of the campaign's simple pleasures is making subtle references to soft drink advertising. By doing so, it complements the ""Always Coca-Cola"" campaign produced for Coke Classic by the Creative Artists Agency, reveling in historical Coke trappings like signs and logos. **********""This is refreshment"" echoes ""The pause that refreshes,"" the longtime slogan for Diet Coke's sugared sibling. The honeymoon suite commercial features the pop stars Dr. John and Ricki Lee Jones singing ""Makin' Whoopee,"" which was heard in Pepsi ads from 1961 to 1963 as ""For Those Who Think Young."" And another spot, in which an unlikely bobsled team mugs at the camera, uses the Khatchaturian ""Sabre Dance"" from ""One, Two, Three,"" Billy Wilder's 1961 comedy starring James Cagney as a Coke executive in cold-war West Berlin. **********Self-referential ads are a Pepsi hallmark; a current commercial, starring the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, evokes Coke's familiar spot with the football player Mean Joe Greene. **********""They had time enough to come up with a campaign of their own,"" Amy Sherwood, a Pepsi-Cola spokeswoman in Somers, N.Y., said. ""Too bad they didn't. We'll see how long this one lasts."" **********Ms. Gibson said that if this campaign was as unsatisfying as ""Taste it all"" was, she and Sergio Zyman, Coca-Cola's new chief marketing executive, would have no qualms about killing it, too. **********""Advertising is much more of an art than it is a science,"" she said. Though, for luck, she did something old-fashioned: She knocked on wood."

But oil analysts say there are some special opportunities, especially among the domestic oil companies, including ARCO, Phillips Petroleum, Pennzoil and Amarada Hess. Some, however, acknowledge that the best time to buy may be six months from now, when oil prices start moving. **********Simon Trimble, an oil analyst at Lehman Brothers, says that because of pessimism over the future price of oil, the domestic oil stocks have taken a rougher beating in the market than have the large international companies, which generally can better weather regional economic downturns because they get their oil and market their products globally. **********But the situation has created some bargains. **********""The clear advantage that the domestics have is that the United States is coming out of the recession very rapidly, whereas the internationals are faced with ongoing recessions in Europe and Japan,"" he explains. **********Another plus is that the recent cold and storms in the East have firmed up demand for natural gas and heating oil. That will particularly benefit the domestic producers, which market most of their products in the United States. **********In fact, as winter weather swept over much of the country yesterday, crude oil prices staged a small recovery. Heating oil and natural gas prices also rose. **********Another benefit: oil companies generally have strong yields from dividends. **********But some analysts warn that oil prices are in a holding pattern -- and oil stocks, therefore, remain in the same condition. **********""The market was certain that OPEC would step in early to drive oil prices higher by cutting production at an emergency meeting in the latter part of January,"" Mr. Trimble says. ""What's happened is that the market has begun to realize that the chance of calling such an emergency meeting is falling fast."" **********As a result, oil prices are expected to continue to stand at about $14 to $16 a barrel most of the year. For the first six months of 1993, the price averaged about $19 a barrel. **********""It's premature to be buying these stocks,"" says William Randol, an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers. ""There is still more carnage that lies ahead."" **********Mr. Randol says that although demand for gasoline was up more than expected last year, 2.3 percent from 1992, that has less to do with the economic recovery than with the more narrow reason that consumers are buying larger, less-fuel-efficient vehicles -- like small trucks. Such consumer tastes often fluctuate year to year. **********Nevertheless, Jim Clark, an oil analyst at First Boston, says there are some attractive buys. **********""The way to make money is to buy stocks that are relatively inexpensive in the group,"" he says. **********One of his favorites is Amoco, which has a dividend yield of 4 percent, has low debt and is one of the least expensive stocks given its potential strong position. The stock closed at $53.875 yesterday, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********In addition, Mr. Clark adds, the company has a strong position in natural gas in North America. Natural gas prices have a better chance of holding up in North America than those of crude oil because demand for gas has been high and prices have been rising. **********Small additions to capacity in refineries could also help Amoco, which could become the largest refiner east of the Rocky Mountains in the next few years, strengthening its ability to market its products in the East and Midwest. **********""Even in a weak crude oil environment,"" he adds, ""there will be stocks that will outperform the rest."""

Japan has just appointed its fourth prime minister in a year and is headed for a long period of political instability. **********The European Union has made a spectacular mess of appointing a new president of the European Commission, and is obviously desperately short of the vision needed to revive the European idea and unite the Continent. **********In the United States, the latest polls show an increasing number of Americans viewing President Bill Clinton as weak and indecisive. And lack of confidence in his leadership has contributed to the latest plunge in the dollar. **********Anyway, the high noon of U.S. hegemony is over. As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen put it, ""there isn't one country calling the shots anymore."" **********Not even a combined heave by the Group of Seven industrial countries can push the dollar where it doesn't want to go. And when G-7 leaders gather in Naples next week for their annual summit, for all the pomp and circumstance, they will exert little real influence on global events. **********The pace of change in the world economy - faster than at any time since the Industrial Revolution - is outstripping governments' ability to deal with it. While businesses and financial markets increasingly operate globally, government is still confined to national or regional boundaries. **********The political disarray is making matters worse. Japan's political turmoil, for instance, is also contributing to the dollar's problems and complicating attempts to resolve damaging trade disputes between Tokyo and Washington. **********In many countries, including Japan, Italy, France and Canada, traditional parties have been unceremoniously battered by disgruntled electorates. **********But instead of interpreting all this as a call for more inspirational leadership, most politicians have responded by taking an even shorter term view - looking only as far as the next vote, the next opinion poll, the next economic statistic. **********The combination of shortsighted, locally focused leadership and economic globalization is having a curious result: The international bureaucracies are coming into their own - at the politicians' expense. **********The G-7 countries gladly delegated much of the responsibility for rescuing the Russian economy to the International Monetary Fund. If Russia overcomes its problems, more credit will be due to the Fund's officials than to the G-7 governments. **********Unemployment is the worst political problem facing many industrial countries, but the best work on it so far has been done by the bureaucrats at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. **********The planet's future prosperity will depend heavily on officials at the powerful new World Trade Organization due to start up next year. **********And in the European Union, it is not the national governments but the often wrongly reviled bureaucrats of the European Commission who are producing the best ideas on bringing the Continent's two halves together. **********That makes it all the more important to choose the right people to run these organizations and to ensure that the organizations themselves work effectively. **********But it's another sign of the times that the bureaucrats at the OECD are making big efforts to modernize their institution, while the G-7 political leaders are blatantly failing to do the same for theirs. It's not surprising that top politicians are increasingly competing for the best bureaucratic jobs. **********Of course, there is a limit to what the bureaucrats can - and should - do. In the West at least, they still receive their instructions from politicians. And their ideas need political approval. **********But it is a sad comment on today's leaders that many bureaucrats have a clearer vision of how the world is changing, and how to tackle its problems, than their elected masters."

Eisner, the chairman and chief executive, has taken a major risk that leaves not only the successful film studio in turmoil but also the entire company, movie industry executives and agents said today. **********Mr. Katzenberg's decision on Wednesday to quit the company he helped build during the last decade after the rebuff by Mr. Eisner comes at an especially troubled time at Disney. Once one of the most stable and successful entertainment-industry giants, Disney had been engulfed by strains this year in its management and businesses that have been compounded by the turbulence surrounding Mr. Katzenberg's departure. **********The death of Frank G. Wells, the company's president and Mr. Eisner's closest associate, in a helicopter crash on April 3 was followed slightly more than three months later by Mr. Eisner's emergency quadruple heart-bypass surgery. Mr. Eisner, who is 52, is working part time, and colleagues said he looks frail. Losses at the Euro Disney park outside Paris, the slow growth at Disneyland and Disney World as well as growing opposition among historians and conservationists to a proposed Civil War theme park in Virginia, have added to the company's difficulties. **********Most troubling for the company, industry analysts said, is the gaping hole Mr. Katzenberg's exit leaves in several areas. His strong leadership of the animation division delivered movies, such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King,"" that earned billions of dollars for Disney in box office, video and merchandising receipts. **********He was involved in the company's television programming as well as Disney's arrival on Broadway with the hit ""Beauty and the Beast."" He also shrewdly expanded the reach of the motion pictures division through the acquisition of Miramax, whose offbeat films are hardly traditional Disney fare, and a production deal with the Academy Award-winning team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, the makers of ""Room With a View,"" ""Howards End"" and ""Remains of the Day."" No Room at the Top **********Several people at Disney said that Mr. Katzenberg's mood changed from exuberance to sadness this morning as he responded to dozens of messages from industry colleagues. ""He loved this job; he loved this company,"" said one of his top aides. **********His exit was attributed to Mr. Eisner's insistence that he wanted to run the company alone, without a partner. Several executives at Disney said that Roy E. Disney, the company's vice chairman and one of its few remaining links to its founder, Walt Disney, his uncle, was opposed to enhancing Mr. Katzenberg's responsibilities by giving him the No. 2 job. **********Those reasons are said to be personal but unclear. Mr. Disney has been in nominal charge of animation for years, though Mr. Katzenberg has dominated the division's productions. Yesterday, Mr. Eisner said Mr. Disney would serve as Mr. Katzenberg's replacement in the animated division. **********Mr. Katzenberg, whose responsibilities will be partly assumed by Joe Roth, the former chairman of 20th Century Fox, met with Mr. Roth at lunch today at Disney's studios in Burbank, Calif. **********In a phone interview, Mr. Katzenberg, who is 43, said: ""This is not an angry or hostile separation. This is really about two people who have worked in a relationship for 19 years. It reached a point in which I was seeking to redefine the relationship and become Michael's partner. I wanted a greater challenge and new opportunities. I wasn't looking to walk away from it, abandon it. **********""Michael's the boss, and he has every right to run the company the way he's most comfortable,"" said Mr. Katzenberg, who will leave in mid-September. ""I haven't a scintilla of resentment about that. Michael's been my mentor, my teacher and my friend for 19 years, and I adore him."" **********Mr. Katzenberg said his future plans were up in the air. His friend, David Geffen, the billionaire investor and businessman, said, ""Jeffrey will do precisely what Michael did at Disney -- run his own show."" **********Mr. Katzenberg said he had placed Mr. Roth on a list of potential successors when he discussed the possibility of departing Disney last year. But some Disney executives said that Mr. Katzenberg was surprised at the abrupt timing of the announcement, in which his exit was placed in the context of a series of overall shifts at the company. These included the appointment of Mr. Roth as chairman of Walt Disney Motion Pictures, a new unit. **********Mr. Roth, 46, said today he was not planning a major overhaul. ""Jeffrey's run the place in his own image for 10 years,"" he said. ""I hope I can inherit it with as few hiccups as possible and get on with the business of making movies."" **********The job of one top Disney executive, David Hoberman, may be vulnerable. Mr. Hoberman, a close ally of Mr. Katzenberg's, was appointed in late April to oversee production activities and named to the post of Walt Disney Studios motion picture president. The tasks are similar to those described for Mr. Roth. **********Asked if Mr. Hoberman was planning to stay, Mr. Roth replied: ""I don't know. I'll see him today. It's his call. It's up to him."" In an interview today, Mr. Hoberman said, ""I am definitely planning to stay."" **********Mr. Roth was chairman of 20th Century Fox from 1989 to 1992 and then formed his own company, Caravan, at Disney Studios. During Mr. Roth's tenure, Fox enjoyed the best two years in its 77-year history, in 1990 and 1991. His hits included ""Home Alone,"" ""Sleeping with the Enemy,"" ""My Cousin Vinny,"" and ""White Men Can't Jump."" **********But Fox also endured some big-budget turkeys, like ""For the Boys,"" ""Shining Through,"" and ""Hoffa."" At Caravan, Mr. Roth's record has also been uneven, with major disappointments like ""Angie,"" and ""I Love Trouble,"" though he has a modest hit in ""Angels in the Outfield."" **********Under Mr. Katzenberg, the filmed-entertainment unit has surpassed theme parks as Disney's major revenue producer. Movie profits have been driven almost entirely by animated films. On the other hand, live-action films have floundered, with Disney releasing such big recent disappointments as ""Renaissance Man,"" ""Hocus Pocus,"" ""Born Yesterday,"" and ""Swing Kids."" **********The top films of Mr. Katzenberg's era, according to The Hollywood Reporter, an industry publication, are ""The Lion King,"" which has grossed nearly $254 million since its release earlier this summer; ""Aladdin,"" a 1992 hit whose gross reached $217.4 million; and ""Pretty Woman,"" a 1990 comedy that grossed $178.4 million. **********""The animated side has become a machine,"" David Londoner, an entertainment industry analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said. ""All kinds of talented people are there. I don't think it will go away. But would I have liked Jeffrey to have stayed? Yes."""

Redstone, made a new offer yesterday that included more cash per share plus some assurance that the volatile stock portion of Viacom's bid would retain its value if a merger was completed. **********Based on closing prices in yesterday's stock trading, the overall value of Viacom Inc.'s new bid was still lower than the pending offer from QVC Network Inc.: about $82.50 a share, compared with QVC's $84 a share. Yet many Wall Street analysts and traders said the higher cash portion of Viacom's offer, plus the protection against future declines in Viacom's stock, might force QVC to alter its own bid. **********""It's a dead heat,"" one Paramount shareholder said yesterday. Eyes on the Stock Market **********Several traders said they were waiting to see how the bids stacked up in coming days as the value of Viacom's and QVC's stocks fluctuate. ""On the numbers, QVC is better today,"" one said. ""But going forward, you have some protection on the back end in Viacom."" **********Viacom raised its bid to $107 a share for 50.1 percent of Paramount's stock, up from its previous offer of $105 a share. It also promised Paramount shareholders that if Viacom's class B nonvoting stock dropped below $48 a share in the first year after completion of a merger, investors would get some compensation. **********QVC's pending offer is worth $92 a share for the same amount of Paramount's stock, but the overall value of its bid appears to remain higher because the stock portion is stronger.  Difficult Judgments **********Late yesterday, investors were scrambling to evaluate the two bids because the kinds of stock Viacom is offering are so remarkably complicated. **********But investors must also predict how the Viacom and QVC stocks would perform depending on which side won Paramount. ""Even when two people agree for example, on how much money a merged QVC-Paramount will earn,"" the trader said, ""they may each have their own projection for how attractive that stock would be for investors in the future. That means the multiples they come up with will be different."" **********With the overall values of the bids so close, intepretation plays a larger role in choosing one bid over the other than it did when there was a yawning gap in the values of the two offers. Before Viacom's new bid yesterday, that gap was about $6 a share, depending on stock market trading. **********Interpretation is likely to be toughest for the Paramount board, which is to meet later this week to consider the new bid. The board had previously declared the QVC offer superior, but now it becomes a judgment call. **********And now that Viacom has complied with the board's request for substantial cash and protection for Paramount's shareholders, the board cannot take the new bid lightly. ""Even if you believe the values are roughly the same,"" the trader said, ""the form of the Viacom bid complies more directly with the board's request.""  Not Over Yet **********No matter what action the board takes this week, the four-month-old bidding war may drag out yet longer. The decision by Viacom to revise its bid yesterday left open its chance to raise its offer yet again before the final Feb. 1 deadline -- the date by which Paramount's board has said each side must make its best and final bid. Because tender offers have to be open for 10 business days, their final offers would close on Feb. 14. **********QVC's current tender offer was to have closed this Friday, but the bidders have agreed that when the other side raises its bid, it will extend its own tender offer to close simultaneously. That means Paramount shareholders have 10 business days from yesterday -- until Jan. 31 -- to sell their shares to either Viacom or QVC under the offers now on the table. **********""Viacom's strategy was clever,"" the trader said. ""Now it can see if QVC raises again, and then decide whether and how to match it."" **********By coming back so quickly with such an aggressive bid, Mr. Redstone and his new partner, Blockbuster Entertainment's chairman, H. Wayne Huizenga, indicated their intense determination to win Paramount. **********Predictably, both sides indicated yesterday they had now put their best offers on the table; Mr. Redstone said so in his news release yesterday. **********And people close to QVC's chairman, Barry Diller, said yesterday that Mr. Diller had definitely decided against raising his bid because he believed that doing so would raise Paramount's debt to an unreasonable level. Mr. Diller, moreover, is said to be reluctant to give up more control to his investment partners, which include the BellSouth Corporation. Several people close to Mr. Diller said he had considered putting out a statement yesterday saying that he would not raise his offer, although he did not do so. **********Still, Mr. Diller's associates stopped short of saying that he would not alter his bid in some way, perhaps by guaranteeing the value of the QVC stock, as Viacom has done. Lisbeth Barron, who follows media companies for S. G. Warburg & Company, said: ""It is possible that QVC won't alter its bid. But it is more reasonable for either side to make that decision 10 days from now.""  An Offer of Protection **********The new component of Viacom's bid is a ""contingent value right,"" a mechanism aimed at protecting the value of Viacom class B stock if it trades below an average of $48 a share for the 60 business days preceding the first-year anniversary of the merger. The right would trade independently and would essentially mean shareholders would be compensated if the stock traded below that. **********Viacom's class B shares closed at $37.75, down $1.375, yesterday on the American Stock Exchange. The class A shares were down $1.75, at $40.25. **********QVC's shares were down 50 cents yesterday in Nasdaq trading, closing at $43. **********Paramount shares gained $1.25, to $80, on the Big Board."

Even so it was a mystery why she chose the start of the election campaign to remind Germans how bitter Mr. Brandt had been after resigning as Chancellor in 1974, after the discovery that one of his personal assistants was an East German Communist spy. **********He felt betrayed, she said, not so much by the Communists as by his own party's parliamentary floor leader, Herbert Wehner, a crusty ex-Communist -- and she had 43 pages of Mr. Brandt's handwritten notes published in the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today to prove it. **********For good measure, she added that Hans-Jochen Vogel, a prominent Social Democrat, had told Mr. Brandt in 1991 that Mr. Wehner had been doing the bidding of ""the other side"" in bringing her husband down. Mr. Vogel denied ever saying anything of the sort. **********Mr. Wehner died in early 1990, nearly three years before Mr. Brandt. They rarely spoke during their last decades.  Now, with the Christian Democrats of Chancellor Helmut Kohl rubbing their hands with glee, Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt and Greta Wehner, the stepdaughter whom Mr. Wehner married after the death of his second wife, are battling in what newspapers here call ""the war of the widows."" **********Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt did not contribute a single new fact to the debate, Mrs. Wehner said in an open letter in her late husband's defense that was among several documents she released to prove his loyalty. **********Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt, in turn, asserted that a former Soviet Ambassador had said that one of Mr. Wehner's closest associates had been a K.G.B. agent, a statement that the former ambassador categorically denied. **********But with election fever running high, and newly discovered documents from the Soviet archives showing that, as a Communist in exile in Moscow in 1937, Mr. Wehner had denounced comrades who had later died in Stalin's purges, denials did not seem to matter. **********Mr. Scharping urged his party not to be distracted by ""mudslinging,"" rejecting calls from members to expel Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt from the party. **********The most explosive charge she made was that Mr. Wehner had somehow connived behind Mr. Brandt's back to bring him down, in negotiations he carried out over the years with an old former comrade, the East German Communist leader Erich Honecker. **********But 868 pages from files the former East German secret police and the K.G.B. kept on Mr. Wehner, covering the period through 1968, were made public on Monday, and they contained no hint that Mr. Wehner had ever worked on their behalf. He was expelled from the German Communist Party while imprisoned in Sweden during the last part of the war, and converted later to Social Democracy. **********The last thing the East Germans would have wanted Mr. Wehner to do would be to bring down Willy Brandt, who ended years of diplomatic isolation of the Communist regime. **********""The fall of Willy Brandt was the last thing we wanted,"" said Markus Wolf, who was the East German intelligence chief at the time. **********With Mr. Kohl and his party sinking in the polls and unemployment expected to keep rising before the elections, Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt's charges seemed made to order for them. ""This could be the issue we were looking for,"" one of Mr. Kohl's strategists said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/30/world/the-south-african-vote-mandela-mandela-speaks-of-reconciliation.html,Bill Keller,1994-04-30,,1106,,The New York Times,World,News,article,MANDELA SPEAKS OF RECONCILIATION,THE SOUTH AFRICAN VOTE: MANDELA; MANDELA SPEAKS OF RECONCILIATION," **********As the elections that will almost certainly elevate him to the presidency stuttered to a fitful conclusion today, Nelson Mandela laid out a vision of his government as a grand negotiating forum in which every party will have a voice, past crimes will be forgiven and the power of the majority will rarely be used. **********Rather than a dramatic break with the past, or a frantic first 100 days of presidential activism, Mr. Mandela said in interviews over two days, the first themes of his new presidency would be reconciliation and consensus. **********Defenders of apartheid would be pardoned for crimes, he promised. Anxious ethnic minorities would retain their jobs and cultures. Big business would play an influential role in shaping economic policy. The departing President, F. W. de Klerk, and other holdovers from the white Government would not be a token presence but trusted partners in the Cabinet. **********Even the racist outlaws of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, whose members have been accused by the police in a spate of pre-election bombings aimed at sabotaging the transition, would not be banned but invited to the bargaining table, Mr. Mandela said. **********""We must never forget that the National Party of Mr. de Klerk was once in exactly the same position as the right wing today,"" he said. **********He promised there would be no dismantling of monuments or symbols cherished by whites, no renaming of streets and cities that bear the names of apartheid founders, without ""very intense, patient, serious discussion."" **********And as for the yearning of some black nationalists to rechristen the country Azania, Mr. Mandela scoffed that this was ""far-fetched."" **********Mr. Mandela's concept of the new government sounded remarkably like a continuation of the negotiating partnership forged since Mr. de Klerk released him from prison four years ago. That process, involving more than 20 parties, produced an interim Constitution and the first elections open to all races. Moving Carefully **********""Even if we may emerge with a landslide victory, we have to be very careful and not create the fear that the majority is going to be used for the purpose of coercing minorities to accept the policy of a particular party which has emerged victorious,"" Mr. Mandela said. **********Outlining his program of reconciliation in interviews with The New York Times and other newspapers Thursday and today, Mr. Mandela made these points: ***********Most white police officers and others who killed or tortured in defense of apartheid would be given indemnity for their crimes and would not be publicly identified. Only those who committed the most recent crimes would be ineligible for such a pardon. ***********The new government would continue to subsidize schools run for ethnic minorities, including the white Afrikaners. Although the emphasis in education would be on upgrading black schools and promoting ""nonracial"" education, he said, ""we believe that by recognizing diversity we will actually be uniting the people of South Africa."" ***********He would support ""a simple, low tax"" because high taxes would scare off foreign investors. But if forced to choose between raising taxes and curtailing his party's promises, he would raise taxes. Setting a Minimum **********Mr. Mandela said the African National Congress's ""reconstruction"" program of housing, jobs and free education -- which the party estimates would cost $12 billion but which critics say could be twice as expensive -- was ""the minimum policy."" **********""It is inconceivable that at any time we will cut down on that policy,"" he said. **********Many whites mistrust Mr. Mandela's evocative talk of a consensus-oriented Camelot, and many of his own followers think it is a recipe for paralysis. **********But Mr. Mandela was insistent that the same patient negotiations that produced the Constitution and elections could be used to balance the rival imperatives of his government -- the need to raise the hopes of impoverished blacks, and the need to prevent skilled whites from quitting or resisting. Five-Year Expedient **********He said he viewed the unity government as a five-year expedient, after which the country should revert to majority democracy in which defeated parties are consigned to the opposition. **********""I do not think that we need a government of national unity beyond five years, especially if we are able to build this environment of mutual trust,"" he said. **********Asked how his government would react if, as has happened in recent months, homeless blacks occupied houses built for others, Mr. Mandela said this white fear was unjustified because blacks will no longer feel unfairly excluded from state housing programs. **********In Durban and Cape Town, homeless people descended on new tract homes and refused to leave until they were promised alternative housing. The invasions generated alarm among whites, Indians and mixed-race voters about whether Mr. Mandela could control his followers. A New Perception **********""The situation will be totally different,"" he said today. ""Because one of the reasons why people occupied these houses was the fact that the perception is now widespread that the Government has been concentrating on building houses for certain racial groups and not for Africans."" **********""A democratic government will build houses for everybody,"" he said. Any occupation of property, he added, would be ""a police matter."" **********Mr. Mandela had effusive praise for some members of the outgoing Government, singling out four men with the hint that they might hold office in a new government. **********They were Roelof F. Botha, the longtime Foreign Minister, whom he lauded as ""one of the most enlightened in the National Party""; Roelf Meyer, who was the Government's chief negotiator on the Constitution; Kobie Coetsee, the Justice Minister, who established a close rapport with Mr. Mandela as the Government's first intermediary to the liberation leader in prison, and Leon Wessels, the Minister of Local Government. Amnesty Categories **********On the question of an amnesty, Mr. Mandela has divided offenders into three categories. **********Under an agreement with the current Government, anyone who committed a crime with a political motive before October 1990 may obtain an automatic indemnity by applying to a commission. **********Those involved in political crimes up until last December must apply to the new Parliament case by case, but Mr. Mandela said he would personally favor absolving them. **********""Let us not open up wounds which would make it difficult for us as a government of national unity to promote this spirit of mutual confidence,"" he said. **********No one who continued illegally obstructing the transition this year, he said, should be eligible for indemnity."

In the national elections last March that put Mr. Berlusconi into office, Termoli voted overwhelmingly for his Forza Italia movement. **********But his policies have turned many of the 30,000 people of Termoli sour. **********Termoli has a Fiat plant that is its pride and joy. The Government's austerity plans has hit industrial workers hardest, and what happened this fall at the big plant out on the edge of town, where Fiat S.p.A. makes motors, was the last straw. **********The factory came to this southern town in 1972 with Government incentives. Its jobs have been a salvation for many in the dirt-poor region, but unemployment is still 15 percent, compared with 5 percent in the north. **********The recession affected Fiat as well. Auto manufacturing has become fiercely competitive, with Fiat fighting bigger and stronger rivals in Germany and Japan, and so little Termoli saw itself cast into the limelight as an industrial test case. **********In the fall Fiat's headquarters in far-off Turin sent word to Termoli's workers that to remain competitive, workers would have to work on Saturdays, but without pay. For the many workers who had already been working on Saturdays but getting overtime pay, it meant an effective pay cut of about 25 percent. In exchange, Fiat said, Termoli would get $250 million of investment, 400 jobs and an assured future. **********If the workers turned down the deal, Fiat said, it would be forced to move production elsewhere -- to Poland, say, where Fiat already has factories, and where wages are low and people are hungry for work. **********For the 3,000 Fiat workers in Termoli, the proposal would have been a bitter enough pill under any conditions, but it seemed to magnify the anger they already felt about Mr. Berlusconi's Italy. **********The Government has refused to resume public works spending in southern Italy, which came to a standstill with the corruption scandals of the last three years. The Government had also cut the kind of investment aid to industry that lured Fiat in the first place. **********""The present state is one of paralysis,"" said Salvatore Cafiero, an expert on southern Italy's economy. **********So on Dec. 2, when each of the factory's three shifts voted secretly, 65 percent of the workers said no to Fiat's proposal. ""No to Saturday, and to 400 Jobs,"" trumpeted La Repubblica, a national daily. **********Then Mr. Berlusconi's Government and Fiat put pressure on the union to reverse the vote. The Labor Minister, Clemente Mastella, showed up in Termoli and chided workers, saying they risked ""annulling decades of effort toward progress in the south."" Because many of Termoli's Fiat workers live in outlying villages, mayors of towns throughout the Molise region appealed to the workers to reverse their decision. **********""In a town with 2,000 people, 10 Fiat workers can be the pillar of the local economy,"" said Termoli's Mayor, Remo Di Giandomenico. **********On Dec. 16, reeling from the national outcry, the workers voted again. This time, by a public show of hands, 65 percent approved the changes. **********The Roman Catholic Bishop of Termoli, Domenico D'Ambrosio, had joined the onslaught on the workers, criticizing them as ""lacking solidarity."" But now he says he may have been too harsh. ""In this new state of affairs, the price labor is paying is high,"" he said. **********Ruggero Nobile, a chain-smoking union delegate whom the workers blame for backing down, said the workers voted no the first time because they did not believe Fiat's threat. ""This is a strategy of creating labor flexibility that's all over Europe,"" he said. **********But Mr. Nobile conceded that he was concerned because in a nation where social peace is built on a balance between labor and business, Fiat may be tempted to exploit its strength. **********""Fiat feels free because it's destroyed the unions here,"" he said. ""But it will pay a price over the long term."" **********Out at the factory, anger hangs in the air. **********""The pot's boiling, but with a cover clamped on,"" said Francesco Ianiri, 40, who has worked at Fiat for 22 years. Umberto Beccia, 48, agreed. Government policy, he said, had filled the bucket of anger, and Fiat's move was simply ""the drop that made the bucket overflow."""

The profitability of insurers, which has been lower than the average for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index every year since 1986, remained low in 1994, with insurers earning a meager 3.9 percent return on capital, down from 10.6 percent in 1993. **********Insurers' profits in 1995 are expected to improve modestly to more than $11 billion and a 7.5 percent return on equity, Peter Wade, an associate director at S.& P., said. **********Keen competition among companies will prevent sharp increases in premiums, he said, noting that earnings improvements will be tied closely to cost-cutting within individual companies and the level of catastrophe losses. **********Unfortunately for property insurers, catastrophe losses have been rising, as population growth and building construction in vulnerable areas have increased risks at the same time as the weather seems to have turned harsher. **********Five of the six largest insurance catastrophes in the United States have occurred in the last five years, led by the $17 billion of losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the $9 billion of losses from the Los Angeles earthquake in January. **********The Los Angeles earthquake accounted for most of the $13 billion of catastrophe losses in 1994, making it the second-worst year ever. The worst year was 1992, when catastrophe losses totaled $23 billion. **********Because the property and liability insurance industry has long paid more in claims and expenses than it collects in premiums, it relies on earnings from investments to produce profits. In 1994, profits from capital gains in securities trades dropped to only $1.9 billion from $9.8 billion in 1993. **********At the same time, the maturing of old bonds with high interest rates and the reinvestment into new lower-yielding securities caused a slight decline in investment earnings, primarily interest."

Instead, it said, it is meant as a gesture of reassurance to investors. **********""We have a lot of confidence in the portfolio manager and want to show our good faith to the shareholders,"" said Edward Kohler, president of the money management arm of the Minneapolis-based brokerage firm. **********The fund, which was meant to offer high-interest payments while keeping principal stable, invested mainly in securities backed by home mortgages and complex derivative securities based on them. It was the best- performing fund in its class from 1991 through 1993, years in which long-term interest rates fell. **********But as interest rates shot up far more than expected early this year, prices of mortgage-backed bonds fell sharply. And as investors shied away from mortgage derivatives, prices of those securities fell even further. **********As a result, the fund's assets fell from $800 million at the beginning of the year to $593 million. About $160 million of that decline was from the falling prices and $40 million from withdrawals by investors. **********Piper Jaffrey said yesterday that it would invest $10 million in the fund and would shut the fund to new investors on June 20 or when the fund's assets hit $650 million, whichever came first. If the fund does not reach that level, Piper said it would invest up to another $15 million in it. **********Mutual fund experts said the announcement of the investment by Piper in its own fund was unusual. Other fund managers from time to time invest in their own funds, but they generally do not disclose it. In a handful of cases, mainly with money market funds, the fund managers have actually bailed out funds they ran, buying securities that went bad. **********Barry Barbash, director of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Piper's investment seemed to present no legal or ethical problems. ""It seems to be a marketing or public relations gesture,"" he said. ""They aren't going to make investors whole, but they want to show they have faith in the investments they made."" Prices Below Market Value **********Mr. Kohler said that the shares of the fund were an attractive investment because many of the securities in its portfolio had fallen to prices below their fair value in the recent market turmoil. The fund will be closed to new investors so that if the shares recover in price, as the firm expects, the benefits will go to the existing investors, not to new investors who buy in at fire-sale prices. **********Mortgage-backed securities are bonds that represent pools of home loans made by banks and other mortgage lenders to home buyers. They are harder to value than normal bonds issued by governments and corporations because homeowners often prepay their mortgages when they sell their houses or refinance. **********If interest rates fall, more homeowners refinance. This hurts the holders of the bonds who owned the previous mortgages that were pegged at higher interest payments. **********In recent years, Wall Street brokerage houses have taken pools of these mortgage-backed securities and divided them into separate pieces to appeal to different sorts of investors. A pool typically is divided into one security that offers a regular schedule of interest, with less risk of prepayment, and several other securities that offer higher potential returns but with much higher risk. **********These more complex securities, often known as mortgage derivatives, are quite volatile, and some performed quite well last year. But this year many were hit by an unexpected triple whammy. Fewer Refinancings **********First, as interest rates rose, the prices of all bonds fell. Second, since fewer people refinance mortgages as rates go up, it takes longer for mortgage investors to get their principal back, which makes the bonds worth even less. And third, since the securities are complex, and the effect of rates on prepayment is hard to predict, investors have tried to bail out of many of these derivatives, causing the market to fall even further. **********The Piper fund is managed by Worth Bruntjen, a Piper veteran, who also managed the Managers Intermediate Mortgage fund and three closed-end bond funds under the American Government name, all of which have had similarly bad performance. **********These funds are in the government category because they invest in federally insured mortgages. But that protects only against default by homeowners, not declines in market value. **********Mr. Kohler said that the fund would continue the same unusual strategy with only a few modifications. Any new money invested in the fund, including that of Piper, will be used to buy new short-term Treasury securities, which will reduce the fund's interest rate sensitivity somewhat. And it has slightly decreased its participation in the so called roll market, in which the fund agrees to buy mortgage securities on a certain date in the future in return for a fee from a securities dealer. These trades are a form of leverage because the fund can make or lose money on these positions, which it has committed to but not yet actually bought."

The patent office reversed itself and tentatively approved Microsoft's controversial application for trademark protection for the word ""windows."" **********Some intellectual-property experts fear the Patent Office ruling could have a significant impact on the software industry because of the way that they say Microsoft uses its control of the term Windows to control the applications software market. **********""This is unprecedented,"" said Allen J. Baden, an intellectual-property lawyer at Kenyon & Kenyon in New York. ""This is an example of the way Microsoft's leverage in one area is being used to strengthen its other products."" **********The Justice Department accord forced Microsoft to agree that it would not use its control of its computer operating system business to control the activities of independent software developers. But, Mr. Baden said, the company is now using its Windows trademark to insure that programs will be compatible not only wih future versions of Windows but also with Microsoft's other operating system, Windows NT. **********""People are complaining that Microsoft is using the trademark as leverage,"" he said. **********Microsoft executives heatedly dispute the accusations that they are using their trademark as a mechanism for industry control. **********""They're confusing the power of the logo with the quality of the operating system,"" Brad Chase, general manager of Microsoft's operating system division, said. ""We're not trying to use the trademark in any way to prohibit people from writing Windows-compatible software."" **********Microsoft has sold more than 50 million copies of its Windows software, which is used to control the basic operations of a desktop personal computer. **********But in a much-appealed case,the Patent and Trademark Office had originally ruled the term ""windows"" was in wide use in the computer industry before Microsoft applied for the trademark on Aug. 20, 1990. **********In its first ruling against Microsoft, in 1991, the Patent Office stated, ""The fact that an applicant may be the first and only user of a merely descriptive or generic designation does not justify registration if the term is merely descriptive."" Began in the 1960's **********Microsoft appealed the ruling, obtaining a number of affidavits from industry executives supporting its contention that Windows is now generally recognized as a Microsoft trademark. The company also hired a research concern, which conducted a survey that indicated that 67 percent of the ""relevant purchasers"" considered ""windows"" to be a brand name. **********Programs that divide computer displays into different ""windows"" were pioneered in the 1960's and 1970's by Douglas C. Engelbart, a computer researcher at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif. Computer programs that permitted the display of overlapping windows of information were then developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and offered in products like Visicorp's Vision and the Apple Macintosh long before Microsoft applied for the trademark. **********Opponents of Microsoft have argued that it is trying to carve out exclusive use for a word that is as common in the computer industry as ""sudsy ammonia"" is in cleaning compounds or ""the pill"" in contraceptives. Efforts to trademark both those terms have been rejected by the Patent Office over the years, as was ""light beer,"" which the Miller Brewing Company tried to register. **********In a letter issued in February 1993, the Government sided strongly with Microsoft's opponents. The letter contended that the word ""windows"" had a generic meaning in the computer industry and was in use before Microsoft introduced its product. **********On Microsoft's appeal, the application was approved in December 1993, without a published explanation. Most recently, the Patent Office formally published a note in June that states that the trademark appears to be entitled to registration. The agency will issue a final formal registration sometime in the future if there is no opposition. **********After the trademark decision, which was published on June 21 and which is a reversal of a Patent and Trademark Office rejection of the company's latest application in February 1993, three big Microsoft rivals -- the Novell Corporation, I.B.M., and Sun Microsystems -- and Ward Systems Group, a small software company in Frederick, Md., filed documents asking for time to file an opposition. **********But now no one seems ready to oppose the software giant on its control of the term ""windows."" Sun officials said the company decided not to oppose the trademark, but would not comment further. A lawyer representing Novell said the company had chosen not to ask for a second extension to oppose the registration. A spokesman for I.B.M. said the company had recently filed for a second extension and was still considering the issue. Lawyers for Ward Systems, which has also filed a request for added time, said the company did not wish to comment. **********Microsoft executives said that there is currently no opposition to the Patent Office decision. **********""There has been no opposition at this point,"" said Daniel Laster, Microsoft's trademark lawyer. He said the company was just taking steps to protect its intellectual property in the wake of the tremendous success of its Windows 3.0 software. **********Borland International Inc. had earlier opposed Microsoft's trademark application and had filed a series of its own applications for terms including ""Turbo Windows"" and ""Windowsvision."" But Borland withdrew those applications after it reached a settlement with Microsoft in September 1993. **********Intellectual-property lawyers familiar with the industry said Microsoft had systematically gone about purchasing competing trademarks to overcome any opposition to its control of the term ""windows."" **********""Microsoft has proven that you can take a generic term and if you put enough money and success behind it you can successfully assert the right to the trademark,"" said Sally M. Abel, a lawyer at Fenwick & West in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Generic terms are ordinarily not protectable. This is an example of where a large, successful company can reverse that."""

But they remain baffled by the motives of the unknown intruders, who stole tens of thousands of passwords. **********""It had all the trappings of an orchestrated effort,"" L. Dain Gary, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team center, said yesterday. Assault on Gateways **********Mr. Gary, whose group sent a warning last week to all network administrators on the Internet, said the break-ins apparently began sporadically last summer on isolated computers. But recently, the assault intensified, turning to computers that were strategic gateways to the Internet. One such computer was operated by Panix of New York City, a major Internet service provider. Panix reported that 300 other computers were compromised as a result of the security breach in the Panix computer. **********The Internet, a web of some 10,000 networks that include military, government, academic and corporate computer systems around the world, is used by an estimated 15 million people. The Computer Emergency Response Team, based at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, was set up with Federal financing five years ago to monitor the security of the Internet and other national computer networks, especially government and military networks. **********The response team's warning came on Feb. 3, after officials recognized a surge in break-in reports from companies known as Internet service providers. There are an estimated 500 service providers in the United States. Each is a gateway to the Internet for as few as a dozen or as many as 10,000 or more customers. **********Other security experts said that while the scope of the assault was surprising -- the number of computers, their strategic importance on the Internet and the timing of the break-ins -- the fact that it occurred was not. The weaknesses exploited were well known in computer networking. **********""The actual method used is nothing new,"" said Pushpendra Mohta, director of engineering at Cerfnet, an Internet service company in San Diego. ""It's not really a hole or a bug, but a feature that can be exploited for many things, including by network operators for trouble-shooting or capturing information about activity on the network."" Mr. Mohta said his system was not affected. Advice: Change Password **********Security experts said all Internet users should immediately change their passwords and make a habit of doing so frequently. **********In general terms, the intruders did their work remotely, using computer networks to crack the security on one or more computers that act as gateways to the Internet. They installed a secret ""sniffer"" program, disguised to avoid detection, that captures information on network activity. The sniffer was put in ""promiscuous mode"" to snare any information that crossed its path. **********The passive sniffer grabbed the first 128 characters of every message that passed through the computer, including the identity of the user, his or her password and the identity of the destination computer. **********Later, the program could play back the instructions. If the password had not been changed in the meantime, the intruder gained access to another computer. The process was then repeated. Because the computers that were targets were Internet gateways, the effect was amplified: a single successful sniffer could collect thousands of passwords and thus, in theory, compromise the security of thousands of computers worldwide. **********The question is who did it. **********""There are about 50 people who really have the capacity to defeat the system,"" Mr. Gary of the response team said. ""At least, that's the number we get from our friends in law enforcement and investigative agencies. Those are the ones who have the skill, the desire, the energy and the persistence to go after the network until they get the job done."" **********""But there are about three or four hundred wannabes who will copy what those gurus do,"" he added. **********Perhaps more troubling is that there is no apparent motive for the attacks. Officials of the response team said there had been no reports of intruders using the stolen information for malicious or criminal activities. **********""The analogy is someone going around the neighborhood collecting keys to all the houses,"" said James C. Settle, supervisory special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Computer Crime Squad in Washington. ""They're probably not going to all that effort just to collect all those keys. We would expect they're going to do something."""

The landmark was set during the second quarter, which closed with outstanding issues totaling $2.06 trillion. **********The data, contained in the latest quarterly report on International Banking and Financial Market Developments issued by the Bank for International Settlements, show the U.S. dollar accounting for 37 percent of outstanding international bonds, followed by the yen with 14 percent and the Deutsche mark with 10 percent. The Japanese are the largest borrowers, accounting for 16 percent of the outstanding volume. The British are second with 9 percent and the French and Americans are tied with 8 percent. **********In global terms, the international market remains a distant third behind the $7 trillion domestic U.S. market and the $3 trillion domestic Japanese market, but comfortably ahead of the German domestic market where outstanding paper totals some $1.4 billion. **********Setting the pace for the rapid expansion of the international market - and no doubt the key to how fast it grows in the future - is the amount of government financing. Whereas the overall market has expanded 105 percent in seven years, the amount of paper issued by governments and state agencies has soared 162 percent. **********The increased share of public debt issued in the international market reflects the huge increase in budget deficits. As countries become increasingly constrained about how much new debt they can issue, this source of market growth could fade. **********Official borrowers in Canada are the largest users, with $117.6 billion of debt outstanding - 24 percent of total borrowing by government and state agencies. Sweden is a distant second with $56.8 billion and Finland and Italy are tied in third. **********No doubt, also, recourse to bond financing has been encouraged by a decline in interest rates, which may not remain as favorable in coming years. Another element is the ease of financing. The market for medium-term notes has also exploded with $331 billion outstanding at the end of June and, as the report noted, a significant proportion of these are Eurobonds issued under the documentation of note programs. **********However, Jonathan Wilmot at CS First Boston in London forecasts that while activity in the international capital market ""will stay quite large, the really explosive growth of the past decade is probably behind us."" **********Instead, he looks to the international equities market as the coming decade's main arena of growth. Financial needs, for capital equipment and infrastructure, will be greatest in the so-called new regions of China, India and the former Soviet Union. Mr. Wilmot expects these to be ""mostly financed in equity markets."""

The S.E.C. filing suggests that the Northrop bid had set up a bidding war that Martin Marietta sought to avoid by paying cash rather than stock for the military contractor based in Bethpage, L.I. **********The acquisition will make Martin Marietta the world's pre-eminent supplier of high-technology military electronics, underscoring a new wave of consolidation in the weapons industry as the Pentagon cuts its budget after the cold war. In response, military contractors are focusing on the businesses they know best. **********Grumman and Martin Marietta officials said today that they were cooperating with an S.E.C. investigation into apparent insider trading in Grumman stock before the announcement of the takeover. **********""The S.E.C. has contacted us and we are cooperating with them,"" Robert P. Harwood, Grumman's vice president of public affairs, said. Charles Manor, a spokesman for Martin Marietta, said his company had been notified of the investigation and would ""cooperate in any way requested."" **********There was a sharp increase in trading in Grumman options -- which gave the buyers the right to buy Grumman stock at fixed prices -- beginning on Tuesday, March 1, and continuing through Friday. Options market-makers at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, where the options are traded, said even when prices of the options rose to apparently unreasonable levels, the buyers were willing to pay, possibly indicating they had advance word of the takeover, which was announced on Monday. **********Losing Grumman to Martin Marietta is a big blow to Northrop, which has been unsuccessful in recent attempts to acquire weapons industry businesses, leading many analysts to speculate that Northrop will soon merge with a larger contractor. Unsuccessful Bids **********In 1992, Northrop bid unsuccessfully for the General Dynamics Corporation's military aircraft division, which was acquired by Lockheed for $1.53 billion. Last year, Northrop lost I.B.M.'s Federal Systems Group to the Loral Corporation, which paid $1.58 billion for the unit. **********Industry analysts said that while Northrop had a significant backlog of weapons business, it had few new contracts on the horizon and would have difficulty competing alone in a fast-shrinking market. **********""Northrop has to do something because in this industry you have either to acquire or be acquired,"" Jack Modzelewski, an analyst for Paine Webber, said. **********Industry analysts said that they would expect Northrop to fetch $55 to $60 a share based on its current revenues. Likely buyers are big weapons companies like McDonnell Douglas or diversified companies like Rockwell International, Textron and Allied Signal, analysts said. **********Although such a move is considered highly unlikely, Northrop could still raise its offer for Grumman, setting off a bidding war."

A graduate of the Harvard Business School, he managed Morgan Stanley's public utility business until 1990, when he left to start his own firm, Barr Devlin Associates in New York, providing financial advice to gas and electric companies. But in January, the 51-year-old Mr. Barr will take on a position that has seemingly nothing to do with investment banking or utilities: he will become the next president -- and the first businessman president -- of the Poetry Society of America, the country's oldest poetry association, with 2,500 members. **********As a poet who has published two books, with a third on the way, Mr. Barr sees close parallels between his varied enterprises. **********""I view both business and poetry as organizing activities that are carried out by the self in response to a chaotic world,"" he said. ""I see myself as someone who wanders around the world turning what I see into money and poetry."" **********Mr. Barr is not wandering alone. Continuing a tradition whose most famous representatives may be T. S. Eliot, a banker, and Wallace Stevens, an insurance executive, he is one of a growing number of poet-bus inesspeople. They work in industries ranging from insurance and real estate to consulting and public relations, and they largely aim to make their poetry accessible to an audience that includes their co-workers. **********While some of these businesspeople-cum-poets have formidable literary reputations and several books to their names, others are just beginning to emerge from their garrets. Few actually write about their businesses, but most, like Mr. Barr, see no conflict between corporate and poetic endeavors. **********Donald Everett Axinn, a real estate developer on Long Island and published poet, said of his dual pursuits: ""Both present challenges and risks. The poem and the office building both require structural form."" **********And Mr. Barr asserted: ""If you make your life's work out of your passion, then there doesn't need to be any difference between business and poetry."" **********Mr. Barr started writing poetry in the mid-70's, while he was helping establish the Natural Gas Clearing House in Houston, the largest American gas marketing concern of its kind. These days, he is putting together a similar business to market electricity. **********But most mornings, he wakes at 3 to put in a few hours on his poems, before the phone starts to ring. At other times, he speaks fragments of ideas into a dictaphone he carries in his briefcase, later working them into his journals. He has published ""The War Zone"" (Warwick Press, 1989), with poems about the Vietnam War (Mr. Barr is a former Navy officer), and ""Natural Wonders"" (Warwick, 1991); ""The Dial Painters"" is due out next year. **********Ted Kooser, 55, carries the creative process into his job at Nebraska's Lincoln Benefit Life, and asserts that companies benefit from hiring poets. ""Having effective language skills,"" he said, ""can be powerful in a corporation."" **********As a vice president at Lincoln Benefit, he publishes the insurance company's newsletter, writes advertising copy and oversees some legal compliance work. But Mr. Kooser is also a leading Midwest poet, considered by some critics to be among the best of his generation. **********Mr. Kooser has been in insurance for 30 years, but his love of poetry goes back even further. He studied at Iowa State under the poet Karl Shapiro and has produced seven volumes of poetry, starting with ""Official Entry Blank"" (University of Nebraska) in 1969. His most recent book, ""Weather Central,"" has just been released by the University of Pittsburgh Press. **********""I write poetry that is free of literary allusions. I'd like to reach a broader audience, not exclusively those who read poetry,"" he said. After he has written a poem, Mr. Kooser said, he often shows it to the secretaries and clerks at his company, rewriting it if it seems unclear. **********MR. KOOSER has lived all his life in Iowa and Nebraska and most of his poems are drawn from Midwest experiences. William Cole, a former columnist for he Saturday Review who has edited some 50 anthologies of poetry, said of Mr. Kooser: ""He knows more about small-town people"" than any other poet I know; he's a truly American poet."" **********Publishers are beginning to recognize that poetry by business executives might command readers. The University of Illinois Press is publishing ""For a Living: The Poetry of Work,"" edited by Peter Oresick, acting director of the University of Pittsburgh Press, and Nicholas Coles, associate professor of English at Pittsburgh. It has some 180 poems about the office, and the contributers include Mr. Kooser and Dana Gioia, a former vice president at Kraft General Foods who is also a poet, translator and literary critic. **********""Despite what people in the arts think, the contemporary business world is full of first-rate artistic talent,"" said Mr. Gioia, 44. Many, he said, ""have made careers in business because of the career uncertainties of the arts world."" **********Mr. Gioia studied comparative literature at Harvard before getting an M.B.A. from Stanford. In his 15-year stint at Kraft in White Plains, N.Y., he was involved in marketing products like Jell-O. Over the same time, however, he has published two books of poems, ""Daily Horoscope"" (Graywolf Press, 1986) and ""The Gods of Winter"" (Graywolf, 1991), on ""the same inevitable themes as other poets -- love, death, time, the fragility of anything human."" **********Mr. Gioia, who lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., is now a full-time writer, though he continues to work part-time as a marketing consultant for clients like Citicorp. Mr. Gioia sees the numbers of businesspeople writing poetry as part of a broader renaissance of the art in American culture -- including rap -- outside the campus. **********Mr. Axinn, 65, the chairman of Donald E. Axinn Companies in Jericho, L.I., entered real estate in the late 1960's, going on to build more than 40 office and industrial buildings in Long Island and New Jersey. His first book of poems, ""Flighting Down the Wind,"" was published by Floral Press in 1978, and another, ""The Latest Illusion,"" will be out next June. **********""The poems are not about real estate, though you may get that impression from the title"" of his newest work, he said with a laugh. He usually writes at 5 or 6 in the morning, and frequently goes to his farm in Middlebury, Vt., looking out at the Green Mountains as he works on his poems. An avid pilot, Mr. Axinn has also written poems about flying, wildlife and children. **********Mr. Axinn said he sees business and poetry as inseparable parts of his life. And one has actually helped the other over time: ""I once made a deal with the chairman of a company who came to one of my poetry readings,"" he said. ""He found me interesting.

Murray, who has written on death, the relationship between love and fear and the repercussions of memory, is among the few executives who also have written poems about business experiences. **********Mr. Murray, 48, recently left his job as executive vice president at the Chicago office of Ruder Finn, a $28 million corporate communications company, to start his own firm, the Murray Communications Group. Besides having worked in public relations for 24 years, Mr. Murray has produced five volumes of poetry, the most recent being ""Walking the Blind Dog,"" published in 1992 by the University of Illinois Press. **********Mr. Murray's next book, ""Oils of Evening,"" to be published next year by Lake Shore Press, is a 150-page poem about art theft and forgery. **********Inspiration sometimes visits Mr. Murray and others unexpectedly during meetings, but Barbara Loots, 48, who writes greeting cards for Hallmark in Kansas, must attend to the muse almost all the time. ""I've been with Hallmark for 28 years,"" she said. ""Hallmark has a culture that nourishes me more than an academic culture would."" **********Ms. Loots, who will publish a volume of poems next year, said the discipline of writing greeting cards has helped her poetry. She sees a difference, however, between the two kinds of writing: ""In the greeting cards, I have to say what someone else wants to say. In my poems, I say what I want to say."" **********While these businesspeople-poets have all had their work published, Basil Rouskas, 50, president of Basil Rouskas Associates, an outplacement firm in Franklin, N.J., just recently worked up the nerve to start sending his poems to publishers. A native of Greece, he began writing political poems nearly 30 years ago, protesting against the military dictatorship there. **********""Corporate life represses emotions,"" he said. ""People pretend it is fine to make up business plans, but they don't acknowledge their emotions. This is unhealthy."" Mr. Rouskas believes poetry allows him to do just that, which is why he has decided to start publishing his work. He gets his start here, with ""Commuters' Sunset,"" a poem he wrote in 1978: **********As the sun descends behind a hill **********The lights of the radio tower start blinking. **********In the distance, **********a river drains the blood **********from the veins of the valley. **********And we, again, prepare ourselves **********For another day's train ride **********From work.""Restoration""*I love to recover the qualityof things in decline.To scour stone, scale paint from brick,to compel, with wire brush,the flourish wrought by iron.To refinish wood, solving forforgotten grain.To give, by weeding, our stone wallback its dignity.To left and right the borders of our lot,to square the corners of our keep.I have even dreamed: pushing a pushcart,I stop anywhere and startdoing what needs to be done.The first building takes time:replacing windows, curing the roof.I know compromises must be madeand make none, a floor at a time.I work along an interstatea century after Johnny Appleseed.A modest people makes me chief.(They, too, enjoy the hazy shineof finished work by last light.)Storm drains relieved, brick walls relaid,a heritage of dust and wrappersis renounced.

At the lowest level, he said, are technical and analytical skills, and in the middle, interpersonal skills. But at the highest tier, conceptual skills are crucial. **********""These skills are the closest to creativity,"" Professor Webber said. ""Creativity is the ability to see how things from one context fit into another. These abilities are crucial for management. When you look at most poetry, it is an analogy; the best poets see parallels between a butterfly and aspects of human behavior."" **********A thread that binds some bus inesspeople who are poets is their escape from corporate life into entrepreneurship.

""I expect that support will grow stronger when people see the cost to the Government of not having arrangements to move the costs of disasters to the private sector,"" said Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska who is a sponsor of the bill. **********Norman Y. Mineta, a Democratic Representative from San Jose, Calif., said the Clinton Administration seemed to favor the bill so far, although the Office of Management and Budget has not analyzed it in detail. **********Some conservative legislators, who said they were usually suspicious of Federal programs, have embraced the disaster protection bill as a way to reduce the drain on the Federal budget. **********""You have got to have compassion for people who are suffering from a disaster, but it is not fair to expect taxpayers in other parts of the country to keep picking up the tab,"" said Curt Weldon, a Republican from Pennsylvania. ""This bill provides incentives for local governments and homeowners to protect themselves against the risks they know exist."" **********Some consumer groups have also signaled their support. ""We have mandated insurance to drive a car and to purchase a home; this is just one more area where the needs of society call for insurance,"" said Linda F. Golodner, director of the National Consumer League in Washington, who said some homeowners would prefer to do without it. **********Because many homeowners in California do not buy insurance that covers earthquake damage, only a small part of the losses in Los Angeles are covered by insurance. Although estimates of the losses range as high as $15 billion to $30 billion, the cost to insurance companies has been estimated to be as low as $1 billion or slightly more. The difference will be absorbed by individuals and businesses, or covered by state and Federal funds.  Reduction Seen in Spending **********From 1977 to 1990 -- a period that does not include such costly disasters as last year's floods in the Midwest and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 -- spending by the Federal Emergency Management Association totaled $4.9 billion, while other Federal agencies spent $2.4 billion. About a third of the $15 billion in disaster loans made by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration before 1992 have defaulted, adding another $5 billion in Federal spending. **********Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, in a study prepared for the Natural Disaster Coalition, estimated that the disaster protection bill could reduce disaster spending and reduce the Federal budget deficit by at least $700 million, and perhaps as much as $7.2 billion, over five years. **********The Federal Treasury would also gain if the broader use of earthquake insurance resulted in fewer casualty loss deductions on individual tax returns, or if the damage from earthquakes was reduced by precautions like the adoption of tougher building codes.  Preparedness Affected **********Robert E. Hoyt, a professor of insurance at the University of Georgia, said Federal disaster assistance also tended to reduce the incentive for homeowners, businesses and local governments to prepare for catastrophes. ""There is nothing wrong with that if we want society to subsidize people living in high-risk areas,"" he said. ""But the problem with that is if you insulate people from the full cost of their decisions, they may not make good decisions."" **********He said local governments eager to increase their tax base by encouraging development were more willing to adopt lax building codes and skimp on spending for emergency planning and earthquake-proof roads if they knew that Federal aid would be provided after a disaster. **********The linchpin of the disaster protection bill is a special fund, created by insurance companies based on how much business they do in areas that are vulnerable to disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, that would be used to keep the insurers solvent if the losses from a catastrophe are too large. Expanding Basic Protection **********If the fund proves inadequate, the companies could borrow from the United States Treasury, but would have to repay the loans with interest. If the companies want that protection, as most of the industry does, they would be required to include coverage for earthquakes, volcanic action and tidal waves as part of the basic coverage for homeowners across the country -- not as an extra option, as is now the case. **********In some states like North Dakota, the cost of the extra coverage to homeowners would be negligible and they would not be expected to subsidize Californians, who would pay a higher price. **********Insurance companies estimate that collecting premiums for earthquake insurance from all the homeowners in California, rather than the minority who choose to buy the coverage because they live in particularly risky areas, would allow them to cut the cost of earthquake coverage to $55 for each policy, from an average now of $240. **********The disaster protection bill calls for 5 percent to 10 percent of homeowners' premiums for earthquake coverage to be used for grants to states and local governments for better enforcement of building codes and other measures that would reduce the damage and costs of disasters. Governments that failed to enforce appropriate building codes and develop emergency plans would not be eligible for the grants, and could be denied some kinds of Federal disaster relief. **********Although California began requiring insurance companies to offer earthquake insurance in the early 1980's, the combination of a high price and lack of zeal on the part of those selling the insurance has left most homeowners and businesses unprotected from losses due to earthquakes. Only 25 percent of the state's residents buy coverage, though that rises to about 40 percent in some areas like Los Angeles where quakes are most frequent and the risks are the greatest.  Coverage 'Underpriced' **********""If people ask for it, we sell earthquake insurance if the building meets standards, but we don't go out and push it very aggressively because we think our aggregate exposure to loss is too high,"" said George Ramsdell, chief underwriter at Continental Insurance. ""From the simulation studies we have done, it appears to us that earthquake coverage is underpriced relative to the potential losses."" **********The state insurance department in California is also aware of the losses that could occur in a big earthquake. After the quake in San Francisco in 1989 the insurance department blocked the creation of a state earthquake insurance fund that would have provided $15,000 of coverage to every homeowner, with a $1,000 deductible and an annual premium of $60. **********""Our analysis showed that in the event of a really big quake, the fund would have been bankrupted,"" said Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the California state insurance department."

""We definitely have some rough spots in the fourth quarter,"" Mr. Kelly said. **********Analysts, who were expecting fourth-quarter profits of 31 cents a share, revised those estimates to an average of 12 cents a share. In the three months before, Southwest earned a record 40 cents a share. **********The company, based in Dallas, released the forecast late Wednesday, citing its recent acquisition of Morris Air, fare sales and increasing competition. Shares of Southwest fell 37.5 cents, to $17.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. **********Shares of UAL, parent of United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, fell $4.375, to $87.625; AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell $2.125, to $48.75, and Delta Air Lines dropped $2, to $46.25. **********Airline stocks tend to move in sympathy with each other, even though some carriers are reporting improved results for the year, said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for Salomon Brothers. **********Investors assumed that ""if the most profitable airline in the aviation industry is going to disappoint the industry, the financial structure of the others is going to crumble too,"" he said. **********John Dasburg, the president of Northwest Airlines, had a different explanation for the reason investors soured on transportation stocks. He noted that Warren E. Buffett, who owns a stake in USAir, had a negative assessment of the industry's prospects when he spoke to analysts earlier this week. ""When you have an astute investor make a derogatory comment in general about the industry that provides some anxiety,"" Mr. Dasburg said. **********Continental Airlines, based in Houston, which emerged last year from its second trip through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has lost $89.9 million, or $3.69 a share, in the first nine months of this year, and a fourth-quarter loss is expected. **********Glenn D. Engel, who follows the airlines for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he was surprised that the stocks of the big carriers were hurt by Southwest, which has built its reputation as a low-cost carrier.

To guitar aficionados, the Gibson Guitar Corporation plant is a virtual Santa's workshop. Scores of gleaming, hand-painted guitars dangle from overhead, many models resonant with musical history: B.B. King's ""Lucille,"" the classic solid-body ""Les Paul,"" the asymmetrical ""Flying V"" popularized by Jimi Hendrix. **********The electric sanders and paint sprayers create an especially sweet birthday chorus for Gibson, which marks its centennial this year with concerts, exhibits and a May tribute at the White House, with the sax-jamming President Clinton as host. **********Eight years ago, Gibson was one breath away from holding a wake, having folded all its divisions except one line of guitars, and it was losing money despite cutting its staff. Gibson's remarkable recovery, guitar retailers and industry spokesmen say, can be credited to an unlikely pair of rock-and-roll-era executives, Henry E. Juszkiewicz and David Berryman. **********""Gibson's figures are extraordinary this year,"" said Paul Majeski, publisher of Music Trades Magazine, in Englewood, N.J., which compiles statistics on the instrument industry. **********Gibson's wholesale shipments in 1993 were an estimated $70 million, up from $50 million in 1992. When Mr. Juszkiewicz and Mr. Berryman took over in 1986, sales were below $10 million. This success dovetails with an overall surge in the guitar business, in which sales of acoustic and electric instruments jumped more than 25 percent last year, the best year ever for the $4.4 billion musical instrument industry. **********In 1986 the company -- named for a turn-of-the-century shoe-store clerk and mandolin maker, Orville H. Gibson -- was suffering from nearly two decades of absentee corporate management under an Ecuadoran conglomerate, Norlin Music Inc. **********""Under Norlin, the quality of Gibsons really deteriorated,"" said George Gruhn of Gruhn Guitars Inc., a guitar retailer in Nashville. **********What's more, Gibson's troubles coincided with a severe downturn in the guitar market as baby-boomers found new diversions. **********""The company was definitely unraveling,"" said Mr. Juszkiewicz, who has been chairman of Gibson since 1986. ""Sales were decreasing by 20 percent a year, and they were losing money on the order of 10 percent of sales."" When he saw those dismal figures, the automotive engineer (and a former rock guitarist) decided to buy the company. **********""I saw the power of that brand name,"" he said in his modest, cluttered office. ""I knew it was going to be a tough gig, but I thought it had all the potential for a turnaround."" **********Mr. Juszkiewicz and Mr. Berryman, his partner in a fledgling educational tapes company, bought Gibson for $5 million, most of it borrowed. **********As chairman, Mr. Juszkiewicz, 41, a guitar zealot who sprinkles his speech with such words as ""cool"" and ""neat,"" is the front man -- although he is guarded about divulging statistics on the privately held company. Mr. Berryman, 42, a financial specialist and Gibson's president, prefers to remain backstage. In explaining Gibson's turnaround, the two men point to improved quality, an emphasis on popular, classic guitars rather than constant innovation, and restored ties to musicians and retailers. **********Mr. Juszkiewicz said that since 1986 Gibson has seen a 30 percent compound annual growth in sales. ""Of course, that's high because we were starting at a very low point,"" he noted. **********While the Nashville factory was turning out only one electric model back then, it now produces more than 80. Other changes include a new operation that hand-tools custom guitars for celebrities and others who can afford $6,000 or more, and a line of special reissue models of famous Gibsons of the 50's and 60's, like the 1959 Les Paul. The company also has an aggressive program in which it provides guitars to famous musicians in exchange for their endorsements. **********""IT'S extremely important to stay close to the musicians and provide what they need,"" Mr. Berryman said. ""We want their comments. We also want them to be seen playing our guitars in concerts, on MTV and in magazines."" **********Gibson has also revived three long-dormant divisions: mandolins, acoustic guitars (both plants in Montana) and amplifiers. As part of a long-term diversification plan, it recently purchased the Slingerland Drum Company, and before that Steinberger, which manufactures high-tech electric guitars. The only operation that has failed to profit, management says, is a three-year-old joint venture in Russia that builds low-cost guitars. **********Gibson's history has been as volatile as that of the music industry. Orville Gibson, of Kalamazoo, Mich., was an amateur guitarist and woodworker back when the mandolin was all the rage. To get more resonance, he redesigned both instruments, giving them arch-shaped tops like violins instead of conventional flat tops. **********The demand for mandolins soon surpassed Mr. Gibson's output capacity, so he sold his design to five businessmen, who organized the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company in 1902. **********In the 1930's, guitars began to replace banjos in dance bands. Gibson was on top of this trend with its arch-topped L-5 and its Super 400, both designed for big-band jazz players. **********In 1944 Gibson was purchased by the Chicago Musical Instrument Company, the nation's largest distributor. This coincided with the appearance of the electric guitar. Gibson hired the jazz guitarist Les Paul to help design what eventually became the classic solid-body electric that carries his name. With its versatile sound and timeless look, the Les Paul Gibson, unveiled in 1952, remains one of the most popular guitars among rock and jazz musicians. **********The high note for Gibson, and the guitar industry in general, began in the mid-1960's. ""The folk movement got it started, but then came the Beatles, and the electric guitar saw an explosion,"" said Jerome Hershman, executive vice president of the Guitar and Accessories Marketing Association, in New York. ""If you had anything that looked like a guitar, you could sell it."" **********No reliable statistics exist, but it is generally agreed that 1972 represented the sales apex, with more than two million fretted instruments (mostly guitars) shipped to dealers. **********IN late 1969, an Ecuadoran company called ECL (later named Norlin), with interests in concrete and beer, acquired control of Gibson. The good times continued for several years, and a second plant was built in 1974, in Nashville. (The company consolidated operations there in 1984.) But as guitar sales declined, Gibson made a series of disastrous mistakes. **********""Corporate bean counters from thousands of miles away started dictating to the sales department that the old stuff was stale, and that what they needed was new, new, new,"" said Matt Umanov, a guitar retailer in New York City. ""That led to all kinds of stupid design changes."" **********By all accounts, Gibson also let its quality slip. Its competitors, like Fender, Martin and Guild, also suffered, but only Gibson's woes included self-inflicted wounds. **********Zachary Marantis, who was Norlin's vice president and general counsel, said market factors had much to do with Gibson's decline. ""There were major problems with currency exchange that hurt our foreign markets,"" he said, adding that competition from Japan, which was manufacturing inexpensive Gibson imitations, also hurt. **********Retailers and manufacturers attribute the decline to several factors: lack of any trend-setting band, videos and computers competing for young people's attention, and complicated electronic guitar accessories that intimidated beginners. **********By the time Mr. Juszkiewicz came along in 1986, Gibson had stopped making mandolins, acoustic guitars and virtually all electric guitars except its cash cow, the Les Paul. **********Mr. Juszkiewicz was an unlikely rescuer of one of America's premier instrument companies. With degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering from the General Motors Institute and an M.B.A. from Harvard (where he played guitar in a rock band named Tony and the Tycoons), he was on track toward becoming a solid company man. But he also sensed excitement in small ventures. To learn about mergers and acquisitions, he put in two years at Neiderhoffer, Cross & Zeckhauser Inc., a New York investment bank. **********Along with two classmates, Mr. Berryman and Gary Zrabrowski, Mr. Juszkiewicz began looking for a small, ailing company. In 1982 they found one that produced educational tapes in Oklahoma City, and they brought it to profitability within a year. Restless, Mr. Juszkiewicz started looking for new challenges. **********In January 1986, Mr. Juszkiewicz and Mr. Berryman (Mr. Zrabrowski remained with the educational tapes company in Oklahoma) took control of Gibson. To ease an immediate cash shortage, they dismissed 30 of Gibson's 250 workers, including all the top managers. **********Realizing that Gibson's strength was its heritage, the partners began retooling the factory to recreate and improve its classic guitars. They also upgraded every part of the operation, from wood and electronics to paint. Old sound pickups were dismantled, studied and replicated to achieve the 1950's and 1960's sound. **********The market responded enthusiastically. ""Gibson backtracked and eradicated a lot of the bad design changes it made in the 1970's,"" said Mr. Umanov, the guitar retailer. **********""Gibson is now doing everything right, and we're definitely selling more of them,"" said Scott Black, sales manager of the Guitar Center in Los Angeles, a 17-outlet chain that is the largest guitar retailer in the country. Retailers say other top guitar companies, like Fender, have also improved their quality. **********Besides Les Paul, the celebrated guitarists on the Gibson publicity wagon include Chet Atkins, B.B. King, Steve Miller, Jim Hall, Eric Johnson, Albert King and Joe Pass. **********Leaning back in his swivel chair, Mr. Juszkiewicz said his goal, through acquisitions like that of Slingerland and Steinberger, is to make Gibson the largest instrument company in the United States. ""That's pretty ambitious considering Yamaha is about 30 times as big as us,"" he noted, adding, ""It could take some time."" **********Mr. Juszkiewicz deflected speculation that Gibson is considering a public offering to raise cash for further expansion. ""On one hand it's appealing because it would be a quick way to do it,"" he said. ""But then I don't know if I could operate the way I want having to answer to other people."""

This has convinced some that the Federal Reserve will nudge interest rates higher in an attempt to prevent the economy from overheating, which would add to inflation. **********""I think they're going to do it,"" said James E. Annable, a senior vice president and chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. ""This economy looks strong and it's an economy without a lot of excess capacity"" for further growth. **********But consumer prices have yet to reflect the increase in producer prices, and Fed officials announced after their last rate increase on Aug. 16 that they would not act again soon. ""They said it should be adequate for a time, and six weeks doesn't seem like enough time,"" said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. **********Indeed, there is pressure on the Fed from many sides to stand pat for now. Many Congressional Democrats have called for the Fed to stop raising rates, including Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, who heads the House Banking Committee. And on Saturday, the nation's manufacturers urged the Fed not to raise rates again this year and risk their resurgent prosperity. **********The Federal Reserve's position is particularly unclear, since the Fed's top officials have made relatively few pronouncements on the economy since the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy, last met on Aug. 16. **********The seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board, including the chairman and vice chairman, and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks are all members of the committee, which meets every six to nine weeks. The governors and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York vote on interest rates at every meeting, while the 11 other presidents take turns doing so, with only 4 of them voting at any given meeting. **********Two committee members said in recent interviews that they did not see the economy as growing quickly. While neither official was willing to discuss interest rate policy, their views suggested that they might be inclined to wait before raising rates again. **********Cathy E. Minehan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which oversees banks in New England, said that growth in the economy there was becoming less brisk. **********""I think the sense that we have is that it's probably slowing a bit just like the national economy is slowing a bit,"" she said in an interview last Monday. ""I think it takes a while for a monetary policy to have an effect, and I don't know whether it has been enough, but I think it's probably slowing a bit."" **********Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, made the same point. The economy ""is continuing in a moderate growth path,"" he said. Still, he added, inflation ""is always a matter of some concern."" **********Many members of Congress have criticized the Fed for raising short-term interest rates five times this year, most recently on Aug. 16. The discount rate, which banks pay to borrow money overnight from the Federal Reserve, has risen to 4 percent from 3 percent. The Federal funds rate, which the Federal Reserve controls and which banks pay to borrow money overnight from each other, now stands at 4.75 percent, up from 3 percent. **********But while the economy may be slowing, Fed officials appear to feel no regrets. **********""I think that what the numbers show is the wisdom of our actions earlier this year -- if we were still at 3, I think it would be a matter of serious concern,"" Mr. Lindsey said in an interview a week ago. **********Federal Reserve officials are barred from granting interviews on the economy and monetary policy for a week before or after a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. **********Senior officials in the Clinton Administration have avoided saying anything about interest rates, while emphasizing that consumer price inflation remains very low. **********""They're the best numbers we've had in years,"" Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said on Friday at a White House news conference about bank regulation. Choosing his words carefully, Mr. Bentsen went on to say that while the Administration was always concerned about inflation, he did not see any immediate need for ""deepening concern."" **********While Mr. Bentsen refused to say anything about short-term interest rates, he played down the significance of data showing high use of the nation's industrial capacity, pointing out that less than a quarter of economic output now consists of manufactured goods. Most output these days, roughly three-fifths, is made up of services. **********Beyond all that, the Administration's tough stance in trade talks with Japan worries some investors and has complicated the Fed's decision.

Best of all, they say, there is no guerrilla or army activity in the area. **********But as life turns from chaos to order for these refugees, they seem destined to be uprooted again. The land on which the Indians built their shantytown is a prime archeological site, and the Government is poised to evict them. **********""In the midst of destitution these people have worked hard to put their lives back together only to see their dreams fall apart again, and for reasons that they don't fully understand,"" said Patricia Romero, a social worker for the Human Rights Association, one of Lima's leading human rights groups. ""Archeology, ecology, land use -- these are terms that mean little to people trying to survive."" **********Fearful and confused, the refugees retreat to their brick shanties when they see a Government worker surveying the land near the settlement. **********""When I see the men come to dig, my heart starts beating very fast because I think they are going to force us to leave,"" said Olivia Huaytalla. ""But we can't go back to the mountains. It was horrible there."" **********In the mountains in the southwestern state of Ayacucho, the refugees said, Shining Path guerrillas would force them to attend indoctrination meetings. Government soldiers, accusing the Indians of sympathizing with the Shining Path, would retaliate by destroying their homes. **********Government officials here said that while they sympathized with the the refugees, the archeological site was too valuable to allow them to remain, even though the officials have no other place to house them. **********The case underscores a growing problem for the Government, which has claimed victory over the Shining Path with the capture of its founder, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, but has yet to deal with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who, displaced by the war, have created shantytowns like this one. **********In a few shantytowns the Government is helping residents to install electricity and running water, and it has provided military escorts for several hundred Ashanika Indians to return to their homes in Peru's eastern jungle. But most refugees remain. **********Jose Pinilla, an official of the Museum of Archeology, is responsible for overseeing the ruins of Cajamarquilla, a pre-Inca city dating from A.D. 200. He said the Government was ill-equipped to keep squatters away from the country's archeological treasures. **********""There is very little appreciation for our cultural heritage here in Peru, as evidenced by the lack of adequate signs to tell people that certain areas are archeological zones and should not be invaded,"" Mr. Pinilla said. ""But it has also become fashionable for squatters to say they have been displaced by terrorism in order to justify their invasion."" **********Archeological experts here said that Cajamarquilla was an important archeological site because it was well preserved and provided researchers with a glimpse of what life was like for pre-colonial Indians in Peru. ""They did not mix with Spanish culture, and if we study this society we will have a better idea of how the indigenous Peruvians lived,"" Mr. Pinilla said. **********Cajamarquilla consists of 413 acres, 35 percent of which have been invaded by settlements, including Santa Cruz de Cajamarquilla. So far, researchers have studied only about 10 percent of Cajamarquilla. **********The refugees said they feel the Government has betrayed them because officials of the National Institute of Culture, which oversees the area's archeological sites, initially gave them permission to settle on the land as long as they did not venture beyond a certain boundary, which the refugees say they have honored. The institute says no such permission was granted. **********Like most of the refugees here, Maria Juaman Lauro and her husband, Pedro, who left Iquida in 1990 with their 7-year-old daughter, earn about $15 a week, making bricks. **********On a good day, the Lauros make 700 to 900 bricks, but the brick factory is preparing to close because of new Government regulations that prohibit the use of agricultural land for brickmaking. **********The refugees are looking for other work, which is difficult to find. The Lauros pool their money with 10 other families to buy supplies for a community kitchen, where the women take turns cooking meals. **********But the Indians are not leaving without a fight. Already, each family has donated one week's wages to a fund that was used to hire a lawyer to make their case in the courts. **********""Why do we have to leave?"" Mrs. Lauro asked. ""We are not on top of the ruins. We have no where else to go. Where do you go when you get kicked out of a shantytown?"""

Mercifully, the thousands of spots that flooded millions of homes have been turned off -- at least for the next 875 days, when the 1996 Summer Olympics will begin in Atlanta. **********The overwhelmingly banal and boring barrage of advertising had so deleterious an impact on this sore-eyed viewer that by Sunday night it had induced hallucinations that the name of a Norwegian soft drink, Solo, was visible in twinkling lights during the closing ceremonies. **********Oh. According to the Reuters news agency, there was such an ad during the ceremonies, which the brand's marketer, Solo A.B., denies approving or authorizing. Nevertheless, the incessant calvacade of spots, promotions, teasers, sponsored blimp's-eye panoramas and sundry other overcommercialized moments dominated the 16 days of telecasts to the point where they provoked all sorts of disturbing visions. **********For instance, the Games frequently seemed to be taking place in 1956, 1948 or some other year in which ""Your Hit Parade"" was still charting the country's musical tastes -- thanks to all the spots overplaying chestnuts like ""Moonglow,"" ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Let It Snow,"" ""You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To"" and ""Mr. Sandman."" **********And it seemed there was a series of promotional commercials for the ""CBS Evening News"" that were so annoying, so obnoxious, so smarmy in their patronizing tone -- pretending that two highly paid, purportedly professional newscasters are buddies who babble about each other's charms -- that the network ought to go dark for a month to atone for its grotesque and imbecilic campaign.  Oh. According to the half of the population of America that watched the Winter Games, there was such a campaign, which turned Dan Rather and Connie Chung into the network news equivalents of Beavis and Butt-head. Needless to say, the commercials, by Jacobs & Gerber in Los Angeles, were so fabulously awful they are to news promotion what ""The Chevy Chase Show"" was to late-night programming. **********As a result, the ""CBS Evening News"" commercials have been awarded the dreaded lead medal for base, and debased, performance, in this column's post-Olympics advertising review. Many other spots rang falsely enough to have been awarded tin medals; a handful were clever and effective enough to have been as good as gold. **********Here are how advertisers and their agencies fared: **********AMERICAN EXPRESS and VISA INTERNATIONAL.

Washington's best hope now for a speedy agreement is to count on Japan's bureaucrats, whom it once derided as being the recalcitrant gatekeepers of Japan's economy. **********The Clinton Administration had been counting on political reformers, represented by Mr. Hata and his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, to open Japan's markets by forcing their will on the reluctant bureaucrats. **********But Japan is about to get its fourth Prime Minister since the so-called ""trade framework"" agreement setting ground rules for the negotiations was signed a little less than a year ago. And it now seems that there will not be a strong political leader in Japan for months, if not years, until a stable new political system evolves to replace nearly four decades of one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. **********It is possible that the vacancy in the Prime Minister's office can be filled next week and even that Mr. Hata will be re-elected, meaning there will be little loss of momentum in economic policies. But whoever takes the office is likely to be hamstrung by the same coalition politics that weakened Mr. Hata and Mr. Hosokawa. And the new Prime Minister is likely to remain in office only until the next general election, probably at the end of the year. **********""There aren't too many viable politicians around,"" said a United States Government official. He said officials were hopeful that Japan's ministries would have enough authority and leeway to negotiate an agreement on their own and that it was now just a matter of ironing out details. **********But that could be wishful thinking. Eventually, politicians are called in to resolve difficult questions -- to make a ""political decision,"" in the parlance of negotiators. **********""If there is a political vacuum for some time, I think the talks will be halted,"" a Japanese trade official said today. Avoiding a 'Political Vacuum' **********After serving only two months as Prime Minister, Mr. Hata announced his resignation today just before the Parliament was scheduled to vote on a no-confidence motion that would almost certainly have ejected him from office. He said resigning would avert the ""political vacuum"" that would arise if he instead called for new elections -- his other option had he lost the no-confidence vote. **********But many political analysts think the struggle among the various parties to form a new governing coalition will leave a vacuum nevertheless, just as Japan is facing economic decisions. **********In addition to negotiating agreements on specific trade sectors, Japan is supposed to unveil a new package of measures by the end of the month to deregulate its economy, cut income taxes and increase long-term public spending, all measures sought by the United States. **********This package could be left incomplete because of the political confusion. And if a new party comes into power, it could conceivably throw all the plans of the old regime out the window. Parts of Plan Opposed **********The Socialists oppose parts of the tax reform plan that is advocated by Mr. Hata's ruling coalition. The Liberal Democratic Party might ease up on deregulation to protect traditional constituents like farmers, small-shop keepers and construction companies. **********By increasing the probability that the trade talks will stall, the political confusion could lead to a rise in the Japanese yen, which is already pressing up against the psychological barrier of 100 to the dollar. **********Political confusion could also delay Japan's nascent economic recovery.  Growth in the economy would allow Japan to buy more imports and would have the greatest effect in the short run of lessening the country's towering trade surplus. **********Still, some experts said that no matter who takes power, Japan will gradually move in the direction of deregulation, opening its markets and increasing spending on public works. This is a consensus society, and the consensus is that such measures are needed, not to appease the United States but to make sure Japan's economy remains as vibrant as it has been in the past. **********""They have no choice but to follow the lines that have been laid by the Hata administration,"" said Takeshi Kondo, general manager of the office of political and economic research at Itochu Corporation, a major trading company. ""There are no viable political options."" No Deadlines, U.S. Says **********To some extent, Washington has already laid the groundwork for playing down any disappointment at the summit meeting in Naples, which will run from July 8-10. It has said that there are no deadlines for the trade negotiations and that it is willing to accept agreements in individual sectors rather than all or nothing. In February when the trade talks broke down at the summit meeting between President Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa, Washington had rejected piecemeal agreements. **********Despite such statements, both nations have a strong interest in producing some agreement at the summit meeting. Both want to stop the battering of the dollar in world currency markets, which threatens to accelerate inflation in the United States and imperil the budding economic rebound in Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a major reason the dollar is weak against the yen, so any setback in trade talks could send the yen higher. **********Further delays risk undermining the credibility of the trade strategy toward Japan, which was supposed to yield measurable results in opening Japan's markets. So far, it has not even yielded measurable results in forging agreements. **********For the next few days, Japanese political involvement in the trade talks will not be needed. The matter will be in the hands of the bureaucrats, who are hammering away at the nitty-gritty of changing Government bidding procedures and measuring access to Japan's auto market. **********United States officials say that if agreements are to be reached before the Naples meeting, they should be concluded by next weekend. Otherwise, the talks might be postponed until after the meeting. **********The Administration wants to avoid last-minute negotiations at the Naples meeting itself because they could lead to an embarrassing disappointment, like the letdown in February when trade talks collapsed at a meeting between Mr. Hosokawa and President Clinton. **********Negotiators say that an agreement on insurance has the best chance of being concluded in time for the summit meeting. Talks on Japanese Government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, which once seemed to be moving smoothly, have hit some roadblocks recently, though it is not out of the question that an agreement will be reached before the Naples meeting. An accord on automobile and auto parts, which account for the bulk of Japan's trade surplus with the United States, is not expected. Slow Progress on Deregulation **********On deregulation of the economy, another goal sought by the United States, Japan announced an initial plan in March but left some key points unresolved, including a permanent income tax cut to spur consumer spending, an increase in public works spending to help stimulate the economy and draw in imports, and concrete details on deregulation. **********Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, dismissed the March plan as ""half-finished work"" that was ""of limited substance."" **********The new deregulation plan is expected to be announced as scheduled. While it is stronger and more comprehensive than the March plan, it might still disappoint Washington. The problem is not Mr. Hata's resignation, but his inattention to the issue over the last two months. **********""If we had had a stronger Cabinet, we would have had a much stronger deregulation package,"" said a bureaucrat who worked on the plan. **********The tax cut might be left for the next administration since tax reform was one of the issues that kept the Socialists from rejoining Mr. Hata's coalition and averting his resignation as Prime Minister."

His gift for communication has helped make him one of the most popular political figures in the Czech Republic. **********Mr. Klaus calls the meetings part of his ""permanent campaign."" **********""It's talking to ordinary people,"" he said, a way of keeping himself in front of the voters. He is so good at it that as the star of another skilled communicator -- the philosophical President, Vaclav Havel -- loses some of its glow at home, that of the pragmatic Mr. Klaus has brightened. Succeeding Where Others Fail **********Mr. Klaus makes the same pitch at each stop, arguing that the pain of the transition to capitalism will eventually translate into gains. He trumpets what he considers his policy successes, which he says have made the Czech Republic No. 1 in the region. **********Mr. Klaus is the only leader in Eastern Europe who has unabashedly embraced market reforms and has seen his popularity rise. **********In Poland last year, Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka, whose economic views are similar to Mr. Klaus's, was forced out of office by former Communists. Her defeat was explained in part by her refusal to get out on the hustings. **********In Hungary, the support for Prime Minister Jozsef Antall was at a low point before his death last month. His party, which has supported free-market reforms for four years, could lose this spring's elections, also to the former Communists. Reasons to Be Proud **********These failures have not escaped Mr. Klaus, who held three meetings like this every month last year and will do more, he said, in 1994. He reinforces the road show, where he is accompanied by a retinue of Cabinet ministers, with a weekly radio talk and a newspaper column. He is frequently on television. **********Mr. Havel also gives a weekly radio chat but Mr. Klaus -- the first post-Communist Finance Minister and the Prime Minister since 1992 -- holds most of the power. The 1993 Czech constitution scaled back the position of President to one of moral arbiter and national standard-bearer. **********For the moment, Mr. Klaus has something to brag about. Unemployment is 3.5 percent, compared with 15.8 percent in Poland. The inflation rate, at 18 percent, was the lowest in the region last year. Exports to Western Europe rose 16 percent, and the country ended 1993 with a budget surplus. **********These trends helped create the acquiescent mood of the audience here. Tough Talk **********Under Communism, Ostrov, a town of 20,000 that lies 100 miles west of Prague, was attached to a hard-labor uranium mine, and many of the town's structures, including the culture hall where Mr. Klaus spoke, were built by political prisoners. With the end of Communism came some unemployment as a local factory lost orders. But many of those laid off have been absorbed into new service industries, and others are taking advantage of a more open border to commute to Germany for jobs. **********Even so, people here complain that it is difficult to make ends meet. **********But Mr. Klaus's message was more of the same sacrificial medicine inspired by the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, whose party has advised Mr. Klaus's Civic Democratic Party. (Outside his Prague office, a Czech car was seen recently with a British bumper sticker: ""The Tories Do it Better."") **********Mr. Klaus had little encouraging to say to questions about everyday living. On wages, a sore point because Czech workers are among the more poorly paid in the region: ""You have to see wages from all aspects. You have to reach a midpoint. We have to keep wages regulated. It is the only way to prevent inflation."" What Czechs Can't Afford **********Why couldn't university education be completely free? Not possible in the new economic environment, he said, to rounds of applause. **********Why are environmental matters being ignored? ""The environment is a very expensive matter,"" he said. ""It can't be solved overnight. People say that if there were better laws, the environment would be better. This is nonsense. Perhaps it could be done somewhat better, but let's not live in false illusions."" More applause. **********Mr. Klaus allowed himself a little personal glory: He had received more than 20 pounds of Christmas cards; he would be meeting soon with European leaders in Switzerland; the International Monetary Fund had just called from Washington that afternoon to congratulate him on the economic outlook. **********Outside the hall, glossy books were on sale, the Gospel According to Klaus, and they moved briskly. **********""I am his fan,"" said Dana Skyriova, 39, a physiotherapist who sat in rapt attention during the meeting.

And that the future of the personal computer industry may be a lot brighter. **********Mr. Law, 40, who makes his living as a magician and a psychic, spends a lot of time in front of the tube in his house in El Cajon, near San Diego. He gets the latest news and weather, sends and receives electronic mail, shops and checks travel guides to find out where to eat out. **********But Mr. Law's tube is not a television. It's a computer, hooked to the local cable system. ""It runs like the wind now,"" he said. ""It's amazing what's available. And I'm getting sound and pictures that I wasn't getting before."" **********A few years ago Mr. Law might have seemed unusual. Now, however, there are millions of Americans like him, and the number is growing fast. They are people who can operate their personal computer as effortlessly as they can drive a car, who are as comfortable with a computer as with a television set. And they are people who would rather spend their time in front of a PC than a TV. **********Such people are giving pause to the big-name companies in a variety of industries that have gambled with much fanfare that it is the television, not the personal computer, that will be the portal to the many ""interactive"" services already here or on the horizon. Among those services are home shopping, video games that can be played with someone elsewhere, electronic mail, video conferencing, and news and information retrieval. **********These companies, including Time Warner, Tele-Communications Inc., AT&T, Viacom, US West and Bell Atlantic, have invested a lot of money and credibility in dozens of field tests of interactive television in places like Queens, N.Y., Orlando, Fla., and Alexandria, Va. Now, almost overnight, they are realizing that the personal computer may be the place to be. **********""For interactive applications the personal computer is going to win,"" said Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which receives financing from both the personal-computer and television industries. **********The argument of the companies betting on television as the best way into the American home is simple: Almost everyone has a TV, and almost everyone is far more comfortable using a TV than a PC. Sounds like the argument buggy makers made after the Model T was introduced 85 years ago. **********But just as improvements on the automobile made it far more appealing and affordable, advances on the personal computer are making it much easier to operate, much more useful and much less expensive. For example, the newest generation of personal computers have chips powerful enough to run video with the resolution and lack of jerkiness of a television picture. **********So ubiquitous and familiar will the personal computer become, particularly among younger Americans, that it will soon be the most indispensable tool in the information age, says the economist George Gilder. As a result, many communications, computer and entertainment companies are reversing course and scrambling to invest in interactive services that can be used on the personal computer instead of -- or at least as well as -- on the television. **********For example, Tele-Communications, the largest cable operator, has joined with Microsoft, the largest software company, to test software that allows a personal computer access to data bases over TCI's cable network. **********Viacom, the cable and entertainment giant, is developing multimedia games and educational programs that will blend the interactivity of a CD-ROM with the format of an MTV or a Nickelodeon. For example, personal computer users might someday tap into the cable network to receive video games on a pay-per-use or subscription basis, or tune in to interactive television programs that permit the viewer to take the role of one character and change the outcome as the show progresses. And in its Castro Valley, Calif., trial of interactive services, Viacom now plans to experiment not only with television but also with the personal computer. **********These companies are joining many computer, software and information companies that have already recognized the potential of the PC for interactive services and are rushing to capitalize on it. Later this year Microsoft plans to release a new version of its Windows operating system that will simplify the process of connecting personal computers to cable and telephone networks. The Intel Corporation plans to introduce next month a modem that hooks a personal computer to cable-television lines and allows PC users to receive information from the cable network more than 2,000 times faster than through a conventional telephone modem. And in San Diego, Prodigy, the nation's largest on-line computer service, has tapped into the high-capacity local cable lines, allowing it to offer customers like Mr. Law not only text but sound, pictures and, soon, video. **********Now that personal computers can offer video of television quality, many software publishers expect to announce entertainment and educational products to be delivered over cable networks and phone lines to PC users. Microsoft is developing interactive programs including ones that allow home banking and the gathering of sports statistics. And early next year, Prodigy, in cooperation with the ESPN cable network, plans to offer its users video clips of sports highlights. **********For investors, the implications are obvious. Personal computer makers like I.B.M., Compaq and Apple all stand to gain, as do chip makers like Intel and Motorola and software companies offering educational or entertainment programs, like Microsoft, Broderbund and Electronic Arts. Companies with a big stake in developing the devices for interactive television, including Silicon Graphics, General Instrument and Scientific-Atlanta, stand to lose. And other companies that committed money and time to experiments in interactive television stand to be embarrassed. **********The advantage enjoyed by the personal computer over the television may not last beyond the next few years, however. There is much debate about what the ""home information appliance"" will look like a decade from now. One view -- call it the Ronco Dicer Slicer Approach -- is that a single device combining all the attributes of a computer and a television will emerge. It will have a high-definition screen and a controller that is a cross between a remote-control wand and a keyboard. **********But there is an increasingly accepted school of thought that there will someday be not one but many devices in the home. Like kitchen appliances today, information appliances a decade from now will each have a different function. The personal computer and the TV will both be so affordable that the average family will think nothing of having one or more of each, as well as other information appliances, like smart telephones. **********But for now, at least, it is the personal computer, not the television, that is becoming an increasingly powerful magnet. The TV Vision **********The vision of interactive television, as espoused by executives like Mr. Malone of Tele-Communications Inc.  and Mr. Levin of Time Warner, is of a futuristic version of the cable-converter box atop the family TV. It would bring into the home an avalanche of new services -- any movie, any time; video games that would allow many players in many places; home shopping and banking; electronic mail and information services. It would be easily operated even by the technically unsophisticated by means of a simple wand that could act like an existing remote-control device or like a personal- computer mouse. **********Everything from the box atop the TV, known as a set-top controller, to giant computers that would distribute the services over the cable network has had to be designed, and is now being tested in various communities. **********Among the most passionate defenders of this vision are executives at Time Warner, which has tested such a system in Queens and plans another test for Orlando, Fla., starting this fall, and at Silicon Graphics Inc., which is designing the set-top controller for Time Warner. They argue that entertainment viewed on the television, not other services offered on the personal computer, will be the driving force that brings interactivity to most Americans. **********""How many American homes even have a den for the personal computer?"" said Ed McCracken, chairman of Silicon Graphics. ""At a personal computer you sit there and do things and the computer reacts. In the entertainment world the television does things and you react to it. This is going to be about entertainment."" The PC Vision **********But now this vision is being challenged by the growing realization that desktop computers and their networks are no longer the realm of scientists and hobbyists. More than 5 million people in this country will be subscribing to commercial on-line services by the end of the year, up from 3.9 million last year, according to Jupiter Communications, a New York market-research firm. **********The Internet, the network that connects on-line services as well as students, scientists and Government employees, is growing even more quickly, and now counts 20 million computers worldwide -- roughly the number of homes viewing last week's most popular TV show, ""Seinfeld."" **********Executives at Intel point out that almost 30 percent of the nation's homes already have personal computers, a figure that will rise to well above 50 percent by the end of the decade. And 52 percent of the homes with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 a year have PC's, as well as 65 percent of homes above $100,000, according to Link Resources, a market-research firm in New York. **********Even computer industry executives say they have been surprised by how rapidly the personal computer is being adopted in the home. ""We in the computer industry thought our business was in corporations,"" said Avram Miller, vice president for business development at Intel. He said that last year 45 percent of the personal computers with Intel chips were shipped to homes rather than businesses and that revenue from the sale of personal computers surpassed that from color televisions in the United States. **********Also favoring the personal computer is the advantage it currently enjoys over the television in what it can offer. Most of the services envisioned for interactive television, like home shopping and information retrieval, are already available over the personal computer from on-line services like Prodigy, Compuserve and America On-Line. And they are becoming easier to use, thanks to the addition of point-and-click controllers and improvements in on-screen graphics. **********The computer has other advantages, too. It has a display screen that offers higher resolution than the television screen, which has been locked into the same resolution for more than five decades and is unlikely to change before the end of the century. This means that the personal computer can produce higher-quality video. **********Also, the computer is easier to read on than a television. People are generally about 18 inches from their computer screens, as opposed to 9 feet from a TV. Many interactive services require a lot of reading. **********Those differences mean that, while the television holds the advantage for watching programs and movies as a family, the personal computer is better for just about everything else.  The Price Factor **********Interactive television may have another Achilles heel -- cost. In its trial in Orlando, Time Warner will use a set-top box that costs the company $5,000 apiece. For a similar trial in Castro Valley scheduled by Viacom, AT&T's Bell Laboratories has developed a box that will cost $4,000 apiece. **********By contrast, the main cost of connecting a personal computer to the local cable or phone system is a special modem. Companies including Zenith that sell this device are charging about $400. But that price will soon come down to around $100, about the cost of a conventional modem, said Scott Kurnit, an executive vice president at Prodigy. **********The cable companies say that the trials are strictly to demonstrate the feasibility of interactive television and that set-top controllers will fall rapidly in price before they hit the market, making them affordable to the average cable customer within three years. **********But many critics of interactive television doubt that the price will drop so quickly. **********These critics also question whether interactive television can be financed by revenues from the sale of movies, which is what its proponents are counting on to finance the construction of more sophisticated systems that offer more services. ""Everyone is talking about video-on-demand as the 'killer app' for interactive television,"" said Robert Alexander, a New York consultant, ""but I don't think that stands up."" **********Mr. Alexander estimated that it would cost $100 billion to deploy an advanced electronic network to most American homes. That works out to about $1,000 per home, although even that number will seem optimistic at least until 1996 or 1997. **********He then assumed that the price per movie in the interactive television trials would be $1 to $4, generating an hourly rate of 50 cents to $2 per hour, of which the cable operator would clear 25 cents to $1. **********Then he estimated that the cable industry would require a 15 to 20 percent return on its investment. If that is true, it would require $20 billion in revenue, equal to 20 to 80 billion hours of movies on demand. **********If the figure were 50 billion hours, that would work out to about 500 hours per household -- 10 hours per week, or 5 movies a week for every household in the country. **********""It's not disloyal to say that this kind of activity is simply not in the cards,"" Mr. Alexander said. ""Something besides movies-on-demand will have to pay for the new networks."" Cable Disappointments **********The new openness toward the personal computer can also be attributed to the collapse of some big mergers between cable and telephone companies that shared a vision of interactive television. Among those broken deals: the TCI-Bell Atlantic merger, and the Cox Enterprises-Southwestern Bell combination. **********""As a result of the failure of the mergers, people who have content are looking to the 'den' solution rather than the 'living room' solution,"" said Mitchell Kapor, the software developer, referring to the den as the room where the PC is often found. **********One more reason that prospects for the personal computer are brighter is that the cable industry has been slowing its investment in the modernization of its networks, an upgrade that is more necessary for interactive television than for interactive personal computing. Last week, for example, Time Warner said it would cut capital investment by $100 million. Tele-Communications said in February that it would delay $500 million in new spending until the Government clarified its regulatory position. **********The disadvantages of interactive TV have led to a new willingness among many companies to consider the computer. ""If we have customers using PC's we intend to serve them,"" said Robert Thompson, senior vice president at Tele-Communications. **********This new awareness shows in many recent industry moves. **********In recent months Tele-Communications has drawn nearer to Microsoft, a company with a ""PC-centric"" view of the world. The two companies, which last year came close to creating a company with others including Time Warner that would produce software for the set-top controller, are now jointly exploring Microsoft's technology for both personal computing and interactive television. **********And now that the Pentium chip from Intel and the Power PC chip from I.B.M., Motorola and Apple allow personal computers to run television-quality video, a number of companies are planning to bring out entertaining or educational software that offers sound and video. **********For example, 20th Television, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's Fox Inc., recently dispatched a top executive, Matt Jacobson, to lead an effort to develop interactive programming for Delphi, the parent company's on-line personal computer service, which Mr. Murdoch bought last year. **********Prodigy has taken a particularly strong interest in linking the personal computer to cable systems. In the company's trial in San Diego, subscribers who link their PC's to a cable system can get Prodigy almost 70 times faster than it comes into their homes by a telephone modem. Combined with the more powerful personal computers available, this means that Prodigy customers can now receive sound and video. **********Prodigy recently decided to introduce the cable connection commercially. Before the end of the year it will be available in 12 cities. (The company wouldn't name them.) Other Ventures **********Entrepreneurs are also leaping toward interactive services over the computer. For example, last year Carl Malamud, a Washington computer network expert, introduced Internet Talk Radio. Each week, with the sponsorship of computer and software companies, Mr. Malamud broadcasts a half-hour radio show. People who use powerful computer work stations can listen to Mr. Malamud's program, which includes news and interviews from the computer industry and which is broadcast ""digitally"" as ones and zeroes over a computer network and then converted to sound on the computer. **********Last week Mr. Malamud went a step farther and added video that can be viewed on computer work stations tapping into the Internet. ""The future isn't 500 channels coming out of cable TV,"" he said. ""It's going to be a personal computer that will be used in ways the cable companies never thought of."" **********At least one television personality has also jumped from television to personal computing. Adam Curry, a ""video jock"" on Viacom's MTV channel, established an address on the Internet last year that offers a newsletter, music and videos. **********Last month Mr. Curry left MTV to devote himself entirely to the new personal computer medium. In a letter announcing his resignation last week he said that the Internet ""is surpassing all traditional media, with its ever increasing global audience; the power is unlimited, and it's in the hands of the people, finally!"""

""Eventually, the Liberal Democrats and the  Socialist will disintegrate. And when that happens the reform will be accelerated, because everyone will have been reminded that the old system should be abolished."" **********A Long-Term Strategy **********Amid the shifting alliances and the chaos of the past year, it is easy to lose sight of the one master plan at work. **********It is a plan created by Ichiro Ozawa, the abrasive political strategist raised by some of the craftiest politicians in the Liberal Democratic Party, who helped lead the coup against them last year and then served as the master strategist of the reformers. **********Mr. Ozawa, an impatient man and a savvy street-fighter, has been ready to seize power from an older generation of Japanese political leaders who have been unwilling to let go. **********His long-term strategy is to eliminate the Socialists as a force and create two mainstream, conservative parties that can alternate in power in Japan, while differing on Japan's role in the world. **********One of the parties would be Mr. Ozawa's own, and it would consist of like-minded elements of the Socialists, the old Liberal Democratic Party and other splinter parties. The second big party would rise up out of whatever is left. **********'A Normal Nation' **********Mr. Ozawa makes no secret of his agenda: To turn the country into what he calls a ""normal nation,"" one that takes a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and does not hesitate to use its military in the service of international peacekeeping. **********Under Mr. Ozawa's definition, a ""normal nation"" would also slash away the layers of protective regulations that have kept competition out of the domestic  marketplace, resulting in extraordinarily high prices for Japanese consumers and extraordinary inefficiencies in many industries. **********Mr. Ozawa also talks openly about revising the American-written Constitution, which dates back to 1947, the same year as the last Socialist Cabinet. **********But the second party would have a more limited and traditional view of Japan, one that keeps the Constitution untouched, and sees Japan as an economic player  with the wisdom to stay out of world politics. **********This second grouping would follow men like former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and others who view Mr. Ozawa as a dangerous stalking-horse for right-wing forces. **********Power Shift to Cities **********But Mr. Ozawa is betting that younger Japanese will embrace his more activist view, especially when new redistricting occurs at the end of the year,  giving more strength to urban areas. **********Mr. Takemura, who joined Mr. Ozawa in last year's revolt, has now gone back to the other side to take part in the new Government. Yesterday he was rewarded  with one of the most powerful Cabinet positions, Finance Minister. **********Mr. Ozawa's strategy has been one of very un-Japanese confrontation: He has used every crisis facing the reform-minded coalition government over the past year -- first under Mr. Hosokawa and then under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata -- to force politicians to choose sides in the new order. **********For a while, his gambit worked. Every time there was a confrontation, every time the reformers' coalition threatened to unravel, Mr. Ozawa managed to chip away at the Liberal Democrats, knocking off a few more members and drawing them  into supporting his coalition. **********Defectors' Political Path **********Usually they would announce themselves to be independents, and then a few months later they would end up joining Mr. Ozawa's Shinseito, or ""Japan Renewal  Party,"" or one of the parties that allied with him in the fragile coalition government. **********A senior official in the Liberal Democratic Party today termed Mr. Ozawa's strategy ""death by a thousand cuts,"" and said it was clear to party leaders that in a few months or a few years, they would simply bleed to death. **********The Socialists, who entered an uneasy alliance with Mr. Ozawa and the rest of the coalition last summer, also feared that he was trying ultimately to break them apart over foreign policy issues. Last April they openly split with Mr. Ozawa and his closest ally, Prime Minister Hata, forcing him to become a weak minority government. **********Left-Center Tensions **********The Socialists believed their own survival was at stake. The party was already split between a fairly radical left wing and a growing number of centrists who were reshaping the party's core beliefs. **********The left wing sticks to the view that all of Japan's Self-Defense Forces are  unconstitutional, that the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung is the true government of the Korean Peninsula and that Japan's security treaty with the United States should be abolished. The moderate Socialists come closer to mainstream views on these issues. **********As with the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Ozawa was seen as exploiting the division  to splinter the Socialists, hoping to win over the centrists over to his side. **********Last week, when Mr. Hata's reform-minded government hit its crisis, a no-confidence resolution it could not win, Mr. Ozawa tried to break up both the  Liberal Democrats and the Socialists by rallying them to his banner. It nearly worked. **********""He pressed them to the wall,"" Harou Shimada, an economist who has been a frequent adviser to the reform-oriented parties. ""He forced them to join each other to try to survive."" **********An Old-Guard Alliance **********The result was the oddest of deals: An agreement by the Liberal Democrats to nominate the Socialist leader, Mr. Murayama, as Prime Minister, as long as the Liberal Democrats got all the reins of power. **********There were some defections from the Liberal Democrats, most notably former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who moved to Mr. Ozawa's side and got the endorsement of the reform coalition for Prime Minister. **********Mr. Ozawa was clearly betting that more Liberal Democrats would follow Mr. Kaifu out of the party. A few prominent Liberal Democrats did so, but the totals were not enough. But politicians now think that the next time around, there could be more defections still, which is why many people think the reformers will be back."

On the way they passed a huge, red-brick Gothic building in Northeast Philadelphia, set amid large clusters of small houses. This was the Sears, Roebuck & Company warehouse and catalogue shipping center, which sent goods to mail-order shoppers from Maine to Virginia from the 1920's until 1990. **********The five-million-square-foot complex included a Sears retail store, several warehouses, its own power station and other structures, as well as a regional headquarters for the company. Operations wound down gradually and ceased in February 1993. Later in the year, the main buildings and 48 of the 120 acres of land were sold to a Philadelphia developer, the Rubin Organization. **********Now the structures are scheduled for demolition on Sunday, to be replaced by a 455,000-square-foot retail center. It will have a 136,000-square-foot Home Depot store and a 55,000-square-foot Service Merchandise outlet. The Rubin Organization will lease and manage several additional stores. **********Construction is expected to begin this winter, and the first store should open by next summer, said Douglas Grayson, development director for Rubin. Where rail tracks once sidled up to multistory warehouses, 2,300 parking spaces will be created. **********The site is a half-hour drive from center-city Philadelphia, between Adams Street and Whitaker Avenue on Roosevelt Boulevard, as Route 1 is known in Northeast Philadelphia. A 14-story Gothic clock tower dominates the property. A last-minute attempt by a Philadelphia businessman to save the clock tower came too late, after the Rubin Organization let demolition contracts. **********""Value-oriented retailing is the only segment in this market that's growing now,"" Mr. Grayson said. ""This creates the possibility of making this a destination for shopping. We want to bring in retailers who will be around for the long haul."" **********Mr. Grayson estimated that there were one million households within a five-mile radius of the still-unnamed center. There are small community retailers in the area, but the larger shopping centers are Frankin Mills, about 20 minutes to the northeast, and the Court and Plaza at King of Prussia, about 45 minutes to the northwest. **********Clearing the site will be a major undertaking. It is estimated that the debris from 2.6 million square feet of structure demolished by implosion will total 25 million cubic yards. That is even more than was created by the demolition of the 21-story Traymore Hotel in Atlantic City in 1972, which the Guinness Book of World Records describes as a record for this kind of demolition. **********The new center will sit atop a 1960's-vintage subway station built by Sears for a subway line that city officials envisioned but never built. **********Surface rail lines and electric transmission lines on the site could not be used for the new project, Mr. Grayson said, and have already been dismantled. ""They were just in the way and would have added to the complexity of developing a shopping center,"" he said. ""And you can't use existing infrastructure because you're dealing with retailers who have prototype stores."" **********The Mercer Wrecking Recycling Corporation of Trenton is handling the demolition work, drilling 15,000 holes through the structures to carry wiring for explosives. **********The total Sears site was 120 acres. A 72-acre section, with newer warehousing and distribution space, is scheduled for sale to Cardone Industries of Philadelphia, a company that buys and rebuilds used auto parts. Cardone has three plants and warehouses in the city and would consolidate its operations in 1.4 million square feet of the former Sears warehouses. **********The closing of the Sears operation deeply affected the lower-income and middle-income communities surrounding it. Sears employed 4,500 people there at its peak, said Linda Blakley, spokeswoman for the Sears Merchandise Group in Hoffman Estates, Ill. In addition to the Philadelphia operation, Sears closed distribution centers in Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Memphis in the early 90's and consolidated their operations elsewhere. **********Begun in 1919 and opened in 1920, the main Philadelphia structure was among the world's largest reinforced concrete commercial buildings, with sprinklers fed by a water tank inside the clock tower to protect against fire. It was designed by George C. Nimmons & Company of Chicago."

Not only is the income high, but these markets also offer potentially greater capital gains than anywhere else;that is because yields should continue to converge to the German level, now 5.77 percent. **********""The peripheral markets which have room for independent rate cuts, notably Denmark, Belgium, Spain and Italy, will outperform Germany, France and the Netherlands,"" said Joanne Perez at Banque Indosuez in Paris. She especially likes Italy; she sees good potential for the lira to rise against the mark. **********She also likes Sweden, citing ""superior economic fundamentals of nearly 2 percent growth, 3 percent inflation and a current- account surplus."" **********Henrik Melph at IBJ International in London said he expected the spread of 100 basis points between 10-year yields on Swedish and German debt to narrow to around 30 basis points by year-end. He also predicted the krona would appreciate against the mark. **********Given the prospect of a long period of uncertainty in the U.S. market and the vision of high income plus possible capital gains plus protection against mark weakness, analysts at J.P. Morgan & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. predicted American bond investors would follow the lead of U.S. equity investors and diversify into Europe. **********U.S. investors in fixed-income securities have lagged in diversifying internationally, these analysts said, largely because the domestic market has provided such easy profits until now. Both groups of analysts said they considered the move was potentially large enough that, if unhedged, it could keep a lid on the dollar's rise. **********At present, however, bond investors appear cautious about new commitments. The only real enthusiasm is for short-term dollars, preferably floating-rate notes that provide protection against rising rates, and high-quality short-dated paper such as the two-year notes issued last week by General Electric Capital Corp. It was priced to yield a scant 2 basis points over U.S. government paper. **********Merrill Lynch & Co. is to this week begin marketing a global bond for Turkey, which will be seeking up to $750 million for between five and 10 years."

Reich stepped into an elevator with half a dozen fidgety aides and fiddled with the pin on his lapel. **********'Hideous!"" he concluded as a thousand unseen gears whisked him to the top of the city's towering Renaissance Center. ""Lavender and yellow? It must be the flag of some obscure Slavic country."" **********He spun the lavender side to the top. ""Last night at dinner some of the ministers had the yellow side up. Some had it down. We couldn't decide what it meant.""  Enthusiasm for Problems **********So it goes. Talking, not deciding, is the theme of the two-day Group of Seven jobs conference. And Mr. Reich, who is still very much an unreconstituted academic who seems to revel in problems as much as in the policies that grow from them, stepped off the elevator and into a new round of problems, one of which was that he got so distracted talking that he was late for his own staff meeting. **********Though his aides have been quick to deny that the jobs conference is Robert Reich's turn in the spotlight, it is a hard notion to ignore. Assigned to a post that has been routinely undervalued by Republican administrations, Mr. Reich is at the center of the Clinton Administration's effort to rethink some basics of social policy, from unemployment benefits to worker retraining to the linkages between welfare and health care. **********Now, with unemployment and other jobs issues topping the agendas of many advanced nations, he finds himself center stage in a play he might as well have written. He hardly troubles to conceal the thrill. **********""One of the subtexts of this meeting is that for years and years the G-7 has been primarily about finance, about macroeconomics,"" he said. ""It has been financial ministers and central bankers and of course heads of state talking about policy. But issues of jobs, their quantity and quality have become so much at the center of politics in every nation that the labor ministers and others are now playing a larger role.""  A Focus on Jobs Training **********The first sessions of the conference only underscored that point. ""We spent a lot of time talking about training,"" he said. ""And there was a unanimity that we all have got to do a better job in lifelong learning."" **********Here, in this city of declining hope and gritty determination, the Labor Secretary is in his metier. Sounding the alarm on stagnant social programs and calling for ""a whole new way"" to approach everything from high school studies to transitions from one job to another, he has rushed from meeting to meeting, squeezing time when he can to take his message to the news media and then pounding at it again and again in private sessions with his peers. **********His hand, or at least his advice, seems everywhere behind this conference. He flew to Detroit on Air Force One on Sunday and then went with President Clinton to Focus Hope, a jobs retraining program that he has been showering with praise for months. His distinctive bearded face and quick grin have been on every network news report for days. And his message, if not his distinct style of delivery, was at the core of the President's statements at his formal opening address today. **********Having hammered at these themes month by month since his move from Cambridge, Mass., where he taught at Harvard University, to Washington, the Labor Secretary now has more than a score of foreign ministers and about 1,000 reporters in his line of sight. And he is not missing a chance to chant his chant about retraining, retooling American industry and reorienting the approach to joblessness so that workers will not languish on unemployment insurance for months before anyone realizes that their old jobs will not reappear.  Plenty in Common **********And here, he is hearing that chant from France to Japan. ""The whole point is to share ideas, to share problems,"" he said. ""We need to realize that we really have a lot in common."" **********Running late this morning for a breakfast with President Clinton and the foreign officials, Mr. Reich paused with one foot aimed toward the coffee urns and the other toward a tape recorder. As aides nudged and quietly cajoled, he spoke at length about a conversation he had with a British official about the long-term unemployed. **********Explaining that a British program corroborated his own theories about quickly identifying workers unlikely to return to their old jobs, Mr. Reich leaned forward with enthusiasm. ""That's what we've been saying,"" he said. ""But here's the empirical evidence. That's what this meeting is all about."" **********The issues have driven him since childhood. His family moved from one economically hard-hit city to another as factories closed and businesses contracted, and he lived through the economic convulsions that he would later analyze. That experience, he said over breakfast last month, shaped his notions of economics and of job security. It also shaped his politics. **********Now, it may be shaping his social standing, too. When someone pointed out how rarely American financial and labor secretaries have met and worked together, President Clinton's economics adviser, Robert E. Rubin, suggested that the Detroit meeting could be ""a socially uplifting thing."" **********Robert Reich laughed with everyone else. But then asked -- twice -- ""For whom?"""

Cagle, who was granted his patent two weeks ago. ""I set out to create a standardized setting for small-scale soccer."" **********The court is essentially a 50-by-90-foot piece of padded synthetic grass enclosed by 7-foot-high see-through panels made of a tough, clear material. Mr. Cagle said his soccer court could fit onto the site of an old tennis court. **********""Tennis courts were overbuilt in the 70's, and lots of them are abandoned across the country,"" Mr. Cagle said. ""But now that soccer's growing so much, there is a field shortage. "" **********Mr. Cagle said his court would have a boundary three feet inside its walls so it could be used to play a miniature version of traditional soccer, where play is stopped if the ball goes out of bounds. **********But he said the court also could be used to play a small-scale type of indoor soccer, developed during the 1970's as a way to make use of hockey rinks during the off season. Indoor soccer is faster-moving and higher-scoring than field soccer because the ball never goes out of play; it bounces off the walls. **********""It's very much related to indoor soccer,"" Mr. Cagle said of the game that could be played on his court. ""It would be a very intense, fast game."" **********Mr. Cagle said he thought the new court could add to the appeal of indoor soccer as a spectator sport, which has never really caught on, by promoting it at the local level. ""When you think about how regular soccer started growing in this country, it was really a grass-roots thing,"" he said. **********As part of the World Cup festivities, the Norwegian Soccer Federation is donating another new type of soccer field, this one modular and enclosed, to New York City in a ceremony on June 13. Janin Bjorn Kanavin, Norway's consul in New York, said that the court, produced by KN-Union in Norway, was built of wood and steel but sounded similar in principle to Mr. Cagle's invention. **********""It's like in a hockey rink,"" Mr. Kanavin said. ""You can play off the walls."" **********So far, Mr. Cagle has built only a miniature model of his court, but he said Newark had expressed interest in building the first full version, which he estimated would cost about $100,000. **********Mr. Cagle received patent 5,312,109. A Way to Remove Arsenic From Soil **********As arsenic's carcinogenic properties have become more understood, the Environmental Protection Agency has phased out its use in pesticides. But soil in areas that were sprayed with pesticides containing arsenic remains contaminated with the poison, which can leach into water supplies. **********Rodney J. O'Connor and Mark A. O'Connor, a father and son, have patented a process for removing arsenic from soil. **********The patent covers two steps. One is washing the soil with carbonated water, a weak acid that effectively extracts arsenic from sandy soils. The other involves soaking the soil in sodium carbonate, an alkaline solution that works better in extracting arsenic from clay-type soils. **********Depending on the composition of a given soil, one or both of the steps might be used. **********The O'Connors said they were working on a way to return the arsenic to its original form so that it could be recycled. The E.P.A. still permits its use as a wood preservative. **********""You can't incinerate it; you can't destroy it with chemicals,"" Mark O'Connor said. ""There's nothing you can do to it to make it something other than arsenic."" **********The O'Connors have licensed their technology to five companies so far through Texas Romec Inc., their company, which is based in College Station, Tex. They received patent 5,290,528. A New Bookmark Stops the Guesswork **********For those who like to pick up a book exactly where they left off reading it, Horace A. Knowles, a retired speech writer for the Commerce Department, has invented a new kind of bookmark. **********One side is marked ""odd"" and the other ""even,"" to remind readers which of the two pages they stopped on. Further, both sides have four lines dividing the page into quarters. A reader can adjust the bookmark so that the line corresponding to the stopping place shows at the top edge of the book when it is closed. **********Mr. Knowles received patent 5,311,835."

I'm sitting in this bus and I'm not sure I'll get off again alive."" **********Hannah Schreiber, a social worker who came to live in Israel from New York five years ago, was also edgy. Earlier today, she said, she had tried to take the No. 4 rather than ride the line targeted in one of the worst terrorist attacks in Israel's history. **********A Palestinian suspected of having been the person who blew up the bus, Saleh Abdel Rahim al-Souwi, 27, appeared in a videotape given today to foreign journalists in which he said he was about to die in an attack on Israel.  [ Page A3. ]  Ms. Schreiber had tried to steer clear completely of Dizengoff Street -- a place, Mr. Razimor said, that had been ""a symbol, the one place that we thought was safe."" In the end, though, she had boarded the Dan Company's No. 5. ""I decided that life had to go on,"" she said. **********Thus did many Israelis resume their lives today, their stoicism blended with a new sense of vulnerability after the bus attack on what Israelis had come to see as the untouchable core of secular society. **********""It's the fear, it's the feeling that my home isn't safe any more,"" said Sigal Saad, 27, a jewelry designer. She was waiting at the bus stop outside Ben and Joey's fast-food outlet near the site of the bombing, for which Islamic militants from the Hamas organization took responsibility. People gathered there today to gaze at the twisted metal on the ground and the blown-out windows as high as the fifth story of buildings along the street. **********""Where is God? Where is He?"" asked Ruth Barnet, a widow who came to Israel when it was founded 47 years ago and whose three children live in the United States. ""When is it enough?"" **********Marion Nakshol, who came to Israel 12 years ago from South Africa, and who wept as she spoke, said: ""Hamas is so strong and we are not protected. Nothing in South Africa was like this. Even with apartheid."" **********Few of the people interviewed during a round-trip ride on the No. 5 between Dizengoff Street and its terminus at Pinkas Street said they believed that the attack on Wednesday should be permitted to halt the effort toward peace. **********Some pondered the fact that the No. 5 runs to a prosperous area of north Tel Aviv where many people support the Labor Government, which is seeking peace with some of the same Palestinians as bombed their bus line. **********""Don't think the opposition politicians haven't noticed that,"" said Gill Marx, who came to Israel 40 years ago from London, as she rode the southbound No.5 to meet with friends for lunch. **********But these were unsettling times, she seemed to say. Only two days before there had been the initialing in Amman of a draft peace treaty with Jordan that raised Israelis' hopes. Then there was the sense that, with the emergence of the radical Islam of Hamas, Israelis faced a new foe, not marshaled Arab armies or stone-throwing Palestinian youths, but a faceless adversary in their midst. **********""If a terrorist gets onto the bus, how do you know?"" Mrs. Marx said. ""What can you do?"" But you still had to take the bus, she said. ""You can't just close up shop."" **********Buses have drawn 28 attacks since 1954, six of them this year. But they are also the prime form of urban and inter-city transport. The Dan Company's 1,430 buses ply 107 routes in the Tel Aviv area, carrying some 700,000 passengers each day, a company spokesman said, almost half the 1.5 million people using public transport across Israel. **********The spokesman, Itzhik Kagan, said there had not been much of a drop in the number of passengers today. But the No. 5, at least, did not seem too busy as it began its run with the air-conditioning blasting to beat the fall heat and the radio pumping jaunty music to the somber people on the leafy route down Dizengoff Street and Allenby Street and Haifa Road. **********""The whole peace process is in doubt in the minds of many people who supported it, like myself,"" Uriel Dom, a 52-year-old engineer, said. ""Once, we thought the alternative to war was peace. But now we have peace and we are not sure if peace is the ultimate answer. I think security is the ultimate answer, and that's what we are looking for now -- security before peace."" **********""Every sabotage that takes place in Israel is going to turn a lot of people against peace: no question of that,"" he said. ""But life is returning very fast to normal."" **********Didi Nahoum, 17, said: ""You used to expect this in Jerusalem. But not in Tel Aviv. We feel it more now, the fear, because it's come close to us. Like in the gulf war when the Iraqi missiles landed."" **********Gali East, also 17, said: ""Now we are very suspicious. We watch everyone getting on and off the bus."" Not that the attack had altered her belief that her future lay here. ""If I left Israel,"" she said, ""it would make them feel they'd got what they wanted and I won't give them that."" **********Watching the buses crawl by, caught in traffic snarls around the repair work and the sightseers at the site of the bombing, Daniella Perry rang up the cash register at her restaurant, which offers lunches of beans and soup and meatballs in thick sauce. The place was less busy than usual, she said, as was much of usually bustling Dizengoff Street, but that was not the important thing after so many people died. **********""These were fanatics, crazies,"" she said, gesturing toward the wreckage. ""We want to live nice with the Arabs, and they want to live nice with us."" **********""But people are very angry, very disappointed."" And holding up the front page of a newspaper with color photographs of the wounded and dead, she said: ""We are all day crying. Why this? Why so many innocent young people?"""

Last year, its payout was unchanged at 7 DM a share. **********Degussa shares jumped nearly percent, to 467 DM from 454 DM, on the strong quarterly profit rise. Analysts said the company appeared to be on the road to recovery after two years of restructuring that saw a 400 million DM reduction in operating costs and a 15 percent, or 5,180, cut in staff. **********While part of the company's performance last year can be attributed to one-time gains, analysts said Degussa's successful restructuring showed the earnings potential that awaits other German companies that started cutting costs later. **********""Degussa realized early that its overhead was too high,"" said Harald Gruber, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute Deutschland and author of a recent report on Degussa's transformation from a metals conglomerate to a specialty chemicals manufacturer. **********""They did everything right except for Leybold,"" Mr. Gruber said, referring to the costly sale of Degussa's unprofitable vacuum-technology unit to Switzerland's Oerlikon-Bührle Holding AG in January. ""Now Leybold is gone, and they are in a good position to use the money that has been wasted for the last few years more efficiently in developing their chemicals and pharmaceuticals operations."" **********Founded as a coin and precious metals concern in 1868, Degussa is still widely regarded as a metals company. Karl Wagner, an analyst at Dresdner International Research Institute, a subsidiary of Dresdner Bank AG, noted that Degussa's shares rose sharply recently when Metallgesellschaft AG, another company heavily dependent on metals trading, announced it was in trouble. ""Degussa and Metallgesellschaft are classic investment alternatives,"" he said. **********But while metals-sector sales still account for half of revenue, their contribution to earnings is declining as diversification in other fields, especially pharmaceuticals, begins to pay off. **********""Degussa only uses their metals activities to guarantee a supply of materials for value-added products,"" Mr. Gruber said. On the other hand, ""Metallgesellschaft saw metals as a profit center"" and suffered when cheap imports from Eastern Europe undermined its prices, he said. **********Degussa has concentrated its precious metals activities on refining and trading and selling products containing precious metals. It dissolved its primary production division, which included mining activities, on Sept. 30."

Unemployed men while away hours on front stoops, taxis jolt gingerly down pitted and muddy streets, and broken windows scar Government buildings that are dilapidated mementos of token national interest in a state where 95 percent of the population is black. **********""The Government doesn't even send schoolbooks here,"" said Maria Luisa Restrepo Perea, a high-school teacher. ""Sometimes we have to help the children get pens, uniforms, notebooks."" **********But in recent months Colombia's black population, the largest in the Spanish-speaking world but long politically dormant, has started to organize, and there are some signs of change. **********In November, for example, high schools received a new kind of visitor: military academy recruiters armed with scholarships. Responding to political pressure, Colombia's President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, had abolished an informal color bar at the nation's air, army, naval and police officer training schools the month before.  Black Rights Law Approved **********Starting with a handful of sit-ins at Government offices here in 1991, political consciousness has grown gradually among Colombian blacks, who make up about 15 percent of the nation's 35 million people. **********Perhaps the most important change came last year when pressure by blacks in the form of street protests and even guerrilla actions helped win passage of a black rights law that is considered the most far-reaching in Latin America. **********""For the first time this law recognizes that there are blacks in Colombia,"" said Gustavo Makanaky Cordoba, a doctor here in Choco, a Pacific Coast state that has become Colombia's reservoir of black consciousness. **********Signed by President Gaviria on a visit here, the ""Negritudes Law"" allows for extending land titles to traditional black communities, promoting black education, ""punishing"" racial discrimination and setting up a presidential advisory board for black affairs. **********In a first concrete step, two recently elected deputies are entering Congress, representing seats reserved for the black population, the only such seats in Latin America. **********Recognizing a growth in black consciousness, the nation's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, announced the formation of its first all-black unit in November. Operating in Choco, the unit carries the name of Benkos Bioho, a colonial-era leader of black resistance. Two Handicaps Noted **********""We aren't children any more, we are organized,"" said the leader of one Quibdo slum-dwellers association. ""If the Government does not have the political will to invest in our people, we will have to follow the lead of all the other groups in this country -- turn to arms."" **********While the prospect of racial violence seems remote, black activists complain that their struggle for greater political power suffers from two handicaps. They are obstacles common to all of Latin America: racism by the nation's European elite and a low level of racial identification among Colombia's five million blacks. **********Colombia has Latin America's second largest black population, after Brazil. But President Gaviria presides over an all-white Cabinet, black faces rarely appear in national news magazines and television networks rarely employ black actors or reporters. Schools and universities largely ignore black history and the country has no museum of black culture. **********""We are invisible,"" Alba Otilia Duenas de Perez, a black activist, said in Bogota, the capital. **********Most of Colombia's black population live on the tropical nation's Pacific and Caribbean coasts. From Barranquilla and Cartagena, Colombia's two largest seaports, the nation's black population extends to coastal villages, interior sugar cane plantations, and the shantytowns of big Andean cities. To protect historically black villages, land titling has already begun for what the new law officially calls ""black communities."" Decades of Neglect **********""The black groups are on the coasts and the whites are in the Andes,"" Dr. Makanaky said. ""The whites channel all the state resources to favor their zone."" **********A visit to Choco, whose population is 95 percent black, is to encounter a legacy of decades of neglect by Colombia's European elite. **********""There is not one kilometer of paved road in Choco,"" Eustorgio Perez Rosero, the state civil defense director. Travel from here to the Pacific coast, 60 miles by plane, takes two days by riverboat, the only means of surface transport. **********Arriving at Quibdo airport, visitors jolt down a potholed road, passing open sewer ditches, unpainted shanties on stilts and wooden town houses on the verge of collapse. In a tropical region with one of the world's highest rainfalls, this city of 300,000 is routinely racked by floods. **********Largely populated by descendants of blacks freed after Colombia abolished slavery in 1851, Choco today is a forgotten region. The only road out of Quibdo, a spine-wrenching 150-mile dirt track to Medellin, takes 15 hours on a good day. The Government recently sent bulldozers to smooth the road, but only after guerrillas shut it in January for a week. **********""That's why Colombia has no black cyclists -- the roads are bad in black regions,"" Dr. Makanaky said, referring to the national passion for bicycle racing. In contrast, black athletes dominate Colombian boxing and soccer, sports that require little equipment. Statistics' Sad Story **********In Bogota, officials announced recently that Colombiano longer needs low-interest development loans from the World Bank. But just as Mexico has Chiapas, Colombia has Choco. **********As easy to see as the distended bellies of barefoot children here, Choco's infant mortality rate is 155 per 1,000 live births -- five times Colombia's national rate. Life expectancy is 52 years, 25 percent below the national level. Illiteracy is twice the national rate. **********""It's what I call a pigmentocracy -- white people have more access to schools and hospitals, blacks and Indians have less access,"" said Dr. Makanaky, who treats a daily stream of people with preventable diseases at his storefront clinic here. ""The Government has reduced antimalaria spending. Coincidentally, malaria is concentrated in black areas."" **********Slowing political identification has been a low level of racial identification, a phenomenon common among the mixed-race populations of Latin America. **********""Some Colombian blacks don't identify themselves as blacks, and some mixed-race people don't identify themselves with blacks,"" Peter Wade, a British anthropologist, wrote last year in an essay, ""The Black Movement in Colombia."" **********Dr. Makanaky said more bluntly: ""We are like the black movement in the U.S. in 1945. Blacks are avoiding being black. They are are trying to be as white as possible."" **********Hampering racial and cultural identification, Colombia's anthropological establishment argues that the Spanish Inquisition wiped out African customs and religious practices among the 200,000 captives imported from Africa during Spanish colonial rule. In Colombia, the Inquisition court was based in Cartagena, the only legal port of entry for slaves. Cultural Research Ordered **********Contradicting these arguments, linguists say that only 20 miles inland from Cartagena, at San Basilio de Palenque, descendants of a community of escaped slaves still speak a dialect based in part on languages spoken in contemporary Angola and Congo. **********""The stamp of Africa is on the Afro-Colombian family structure, the centrality of women in the family,"" said Nina S. de Friedemann, an anthropologist and author of a new book, ""The Black Saga: African Presence in Colombia."" ""The worship of saints is often a cultural mask for the worship of African deities."" **********Over protests from the Colombian Institute of Anthropology, a Government agency dominated by Indian specialists, the ""Negritudes Law"" specifically orders the institute to start researching ""Afro-Colombian culture."" **********Remembering the fiasco of the 1991 constitutional convention, black activists here assert that Colombia's Indians won political power only after they won national respect for their history and culture. **********Billed as ""a constitutional convention of all Colombians,"" this gathering reserved two seats for Colombia's 500,000 Indians. Blacks, with a population 10 times larger, had no seats."

One relatively reputable national poll gives Mr. Zedillo a more modest advantage of 14 points. Only one recent study, of widely challenged methodology, has shown an opposition candidate narrowly in the lead. **********The source of uncertainty is simply that almost no one believes polls. **********Despite a growing sophistication in the methods, polls in Mexico remain a metaphor for the extraordinary degree of skepticism surrounding the political process. Polls and Results Diverge **********""The special problem in Mexico has nothing to do with the mechanics of doing the job,"" said Warren Mitofsky, an American pollster who is organizing a national exit poll after the vote, on Aug. 21. ""The hard part is convincing anybody."" **********Polls and election results have diverged often in the past. Before the 1988 election, nearly all major polls gave Carlos Salinas de Gortari 6 to 11 points more than the 50.3 percent of the vote he was finally accorded, and even that result is widely believed to have been inflated by fraud. **********While experts say the methodology of Mexican pollsters is still in some cases sloppy or suspect, the problem is by no means entirely with the polls. **********Newspapers sympathetic to the Government have not been above altering the findings of opinion surveys in order to proclaim wide support for the PRI, as the governing party is called. Pollsters say it is almost routine for some clients to withhold publication of studies they commission if the results look bad for the Government or its party. **********The absence of any authoritative indicators of the way voters are feeling about the contest could contribute at least indirectly to the threat of violent protests at the result. A Lack of Faith **********In a year that has already brought a peasant revolt in Chiapas, in southern Mexico, and the assassination of the governing party's heavily favored candidate, tensions are peaking. A spate of new laws to protect against traditional methods of governing-party fraud have brought only a modest rise in people's confidence that their votes will count. And with all three of the main candidates still insisting they will win, questions about the polls will make it harder for people to sort out who may be right. **********Some political analysts and polling experts say the unreliability of Mexican surveys may be a consequence as well as a symptom of a lack of faith in their politics. **********Over the decades after World War II, during which Mexico was almost a one-party state, many people came to believe their ballots were only theoretically secret. Particularly in the countryside, where the Government's political control was strongest, residents sometimes still assert that voting against the PRI could cost them their jobs. **********Pollsters often describe the practical legacy of this past as the Nicaragua effect, after the failure of their counterparts there to accurately gauge the depth of voter opposition to the Sandinista Government before its election defeat in 1990. **********""The poorer the state, the greater the presence of local bosses, the more people hide their vote,"" said Vicente Licona, the head of Indemerc-Louis Harris, a Mexico City concern affiliated with the American organization. Comparison Called Absurd **********The Government official in charge of polling for President Salinas, Ulises Beltran, dismisses the comparison to Nicaragua as absurd. **********""What happened in Nicaragua was that the Sandinista Front organized brigades of young people who polled systematically for almost eight months identifying themselves as Sandinistas,"" he said in an interview. ""People came to associate polling with the Sandinista Front."" **********""The idea that people here will not answer truthfully because they are afraid of reprisals is simply not true,"" added Mr. Beltran, who holds a doctorate in economic history from the University of Chicago. ""There have been very precise polls of great quality in countries far more authoritarian than Mexico."" **********Yet recent history raises important questions about how well even the Mexican authorities know what is on the minds of their countrymen. **********Government officials say the intensity and sophistication of polling by Mr. Salinas was a critical source of his confidence to carry out broad changes in foreign policy, the economy, church-state relations and land tenure. But because polls showed the public accorded a low priority to political change, the Government was stunned by the outpouring of demands for greater democracy after the uprising in Chiapas. **********Miguel Basanez, head of the Mexico City office of Market Opinion Research International, argues that the country's history demands that pollsters adapt their methods to elicit truthful results. **********""Direct questions, in our Latin, Catholic, mixed-race culture, are too direct,"" he said, saying that many polls mistakenly predicted a PRI victory in 1992 elections in the northern state of Chihuahua because they simply asked, ""Whom will you vote for?"" rather than ""Whom do you like?"" 'That Isn't Polling' **********But other pollsters sharply challenge one of Mr. Basanez's principal adaptations -- surveying people on the street, where they may be more candid, rather than in their homes.  ""That isn't polling and I wouldn't dignify it with that term,"" Mr. Mitofsky said. **********Nancy Belden, whose Washington firm, Belden & Russonello, was to have directed the national poll originally commissioned by Mr. Salinas,said an experiment she conducted indicated that when people were questioned away from their homes, opposition to the PRI rose. **********Her firm is now completing a national poll for a group of American and European financial institutions. She said that she would not make the results public until later in the week, but that they appeared to coincide with those of several polls by respected Mexican firms. **********""It is conceivable that people in Mexico will say things in the polls that don't reflect how they will vote,"" she said, ""but I can't find any evidence that that kind of phenomenon is very influential. The bottom line is that we have a lot to learn here, and we'll find out on election day."""

Grand Metropolitan PLC sweetened some bitter news about its profit by also announcing that after three years of effort it had at last found a buyer for its Alpo Petfoods unit in America. **********The announcement, however, that Grand Met - the international food and drinks conglomeratewhose brands include Burger King, Pillsbury and J&B Scotch whisky - would sell Alpo to Nestlé SA for $510 million in cash was not enough for most investors. **********In heavy trading, the company's shares fell 3.5 pence, to 409 pence, as the market focused on the day's bad news - Grand Met's announcement of a round of plant closures and layoffs that would cost it £280 million ($443.6 million) in charges against earnings this year. **********As many as 4,000 of Grand Met's 80,000 jobs may go, according to press reports. Company spokesmen, though, said a final figure of job losses had not been determined. **********The latest charge comes on the heels of a similar charge last year as the company pared its work force by 3,000 people. A charge of £175 million last year plus that announced on Monday merely underlines the problems Grand Met faces. **********""It is a sign that Grand Met's markets remain very competitive,"" said John Wakely, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. He noted that the company expected to plow expected annual savings of £90 million mostly into increased marketing rather than maintaining any hope of its ability to widen its margins. **********Analysts said that the outlook for Grand Met's International Distillers & Vintners unit, the world's biggest alcoholic beverage company, is particularly poor. Profit in that unit, Grand Met's biggest money-spinner, fell slightly last year and the company admitted Monday that it expected a further decline in the current financial year. **********""IDV remains their biggest problem,"" said one analyst who noted that in spite of the economic rebound in many markets consumers remained reluctant to swallow the price rises on which the industry has relied for much of its growth in the past, much less to trade up to more expensive brands. **********The situation on the food component of Grand Met's business is brighter, with growth widely anticipated particularly from Pillsbury. But analysts still warned that the food industry overall continued to struggle to come to grips with an era of low inflation and high competition. **********One analyst noted that the charges announced on Monday, which basically cover Grand Met's International Distillers and European food divisions, even included its Haagen-Dazs premium ice cream unit. ""Haagen-Dazs is supposed to still be in a strong growth phase,"" said the analyst. **********For Nestlé, which already owns Friskies Petcare, the Alpo acquisition allows the company to pick up 6 percent of the vast U.S. pet food market, although at a price most observers describe as high. ""I think that the price Grand Met has gotten for what was an unsalable asset has surprised people,"" said Charles Winston, an analyst with Morgan Stanley."

Another stipulation said Viacom must make ""office facilities available in New York and Los Angeles for use by Canadian producers and distributors marketing Canadian films."" **********Some $23.8 million is to be invested in Canada's Wonderland, a seasonal amusement park about 15 miles north of downtown Toronto."

Some Will Benefit, Some Not **********While the Kohlberg proposal values Borden at a substantial premium over its market price before the deal's announcement, the offer is well below the prices Borden stock has commanded in previous years, and most shareholders will suffer losses if they sell to Kohlberg, Kravis. **********A part of the deal drew considerable anger from some big Borden shareholders yesterday. The offer would allow Kohlberg, Kravis to buy, with RJR Nabisco stock, 28.138 million newly issued shares of Borden from the company at a price of $11 a share. With those shares, Kohlberg would then need only 41 percent of the existing Borden shares to be tendered. It would then have a majority of all shares, and could force the deal to go through. Any holdout Borden shareholders would have to accept its offer of RJR Nabisco stock worth $14.25 for each Borden share. **********""The shareholders are being coerced into a transaction, with no ability to vote pro or con,"" said Alan I. Greene, chief executive of David J. Greene and Company, an investment manager with 2.5 million Borden shares. He questioned the Borden's judgment in accepting the offer. **********""The board of directors of Borden is the same board that let this company deteriorate over the last couple of years,"" Mr. Greene said. ""They just agreed to this transaction and walked away from the problem."" **********Allan Miller, Borden's general counsel, said ""the intention of K.K.R. was to buy 100 percent of the company,"" adding, ""Everything is a negotiation in life, and this is the deal that was negotiated among the parties."" **********Wall Street veterans could remember no deal where the currency in the acquisition of a giant company -- in this case, Borden -- was the stock of another giant company -- in this case, RJR Nabisco -- that was not making the acquisition. The manager of a large institutional holder of Borden stock, who spoke on condition of anonymity, remarked, ""This deal is extremely strange."" **********Robert Monks, a principal of Lens, a Washington-based investment fund that had a $3 million position in Borden stock, said: ""I never have heard of anything like it, K.K.R. selling half their interest in the biggest deal they ever had -- that's a very unusual arrangement."" **********Under the details disclosed yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Borden, Kohlberg, Kravis would receive from Borden a $20 million advisory fee, plus up to $15 million in expenses, if the deal falls through for any reason. If it is canceled because a higher bidder successfully takes over Borden, the payment would grow by $30 million, to a total of $65 million. **********Kohlberg's purchase of 28 million Borden shares would also proceed if there was a higher bidder, though it would have to pay more RJR shares for the purchase. **********In that case, the winning bidder for Borden would end up owning more than $300 million of RJR stock. And its payment for the company would grow by the same amount. A potential buyer with no desire to have such a large investment in RJR might thus be deterred from bidding. **********Yesterday, shares of RJR Nabisco continued to decline, off 25 cents to close at $6.375. Borden closed at $13.625, unchanged. **********Mr. Monks, like some other investors, said he was going to sell his shares. Several stockholders said they were planning no concerted action to challenge the proposed deal. ""What can we do, legally?"" asked Hans Reinisch, a stockholder from Manhattan who has held Borden shares for nine years. ""The cards are stacked."" **********Several institutional investors wondered why Borden's directors had agreed to the deal now, rather than give Erwin R. Shames, the company's chairman and chief executive, a chance to turn it around. According to a person familiar with the board's deliberations, Mr. Shames proposed a last-ditch effort at last Wednesday's board meeting to keep Borden independent, but the board rejected that option on Sunday evening. **********""This board went through four restructuring plans in six years,"" said Nomi Ghez, a stock analyst for Goldman, Sachs. ""Every restructuring brought book value down with charges, and left operations unimproved. Time was running out, the debt level was increasing, and I don't think the board felt it could take the risk of another restructuring."" **********Management's stake in the acquisition has not been worked out, said Mr. Miller, the Borden general counsel, and no talks on the matter have yet taken place with Kohlberg, Kravis. **********A Kohlberg spokeswoman said, ""No discussions have taken place to date on an ownership stake for management in the new Borden, but K.K.R. buyouts typically include management because managers who think like owners make better managers."" **********Executives of both Borden and Kohlberg have insisted that there would be no immediate sale of Borden units or a merger of Borden with RJR Nabisco. But few stockholders or analysts credit these statements. ""They always say they won't touch the company in these situations,"" said Terry Bivens of Argus Research. **********Over time, Kohlberg has tried to realize the value of its assets by cutting costs dramatically, divesting companies of unprofitable operations, and focusing on money-making core businesses. **********""But it's tough to milk the dairy business,"" said Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber, because it is largely a regional business and highly competitive."

H. Macy & Company out of bankruptcy protection through a merger, Federated Department Stores Inc. will still be able to get its plan through court by January, a spokeswoman for Federated said yesterday. **********""We're not at all discouraged by where we are in this process because of the substantial support we already do have among creditors,"" Carol Sanger, the Federated spokeswoman, said. ""If there's enough support, there should be no problem with the time-table the judge has set out."" **********Burton R. Lifland, the Federal bankruptcy court judge presiding over the Macy case, has made it clear that he wants the case concluded by January. **********On Friday, after two weeks of mediation had failed to produce a consensus among creditors about whether to support a Macy or Federated plan, Judge Lifland ordered Macy to file its reorganization plan as soon as possible, effectively sidelining Federated until Aug. 1, when Macy's exclusive right to file a proposal is scheduled to expire. Concerns Raised by Creditors **********Creditors raised concerns that waiting that long would make it almost impossible for Federated to submit a counterproposal that could be approved by January. **********But Ms. Sanger said that given the support Federated had among creditors, gaining the rest of the necessary approval it would need would be fairly straightforward. **********Still, some creditors said they were considering asking the judge to terminate Macy's exclusivity early. Federated is not likely to consider such a move on its own, although it might participate in senior creditors' efforts because it is one of Macy's senior creditors, people familiar with the case said. **********Ms. Sanger said Federated was ""disappointed but not surprised"" that the mediation process had failed to produce a clear-cut consensus in favor of one plan or the other. ""The idea of getting a consensus in such a short time is difficult, particularly when the creditors' interests are so disparate,"" she said. **********After two weeks of negotiations with all the creditors, Cyrus R. Vance, the court-appointed mediator, told Judge Lifland that neither plan had enough support among creditors to win clear approval under bankruptcy laws. Federated had garnered the allegiance of Macy's influential senior creditors and the committee representing Macy's suppliers and other trade creditors. **********But Macy's bondholders favored Macy's plan, creating a stalemate. The committee representing them contends that the package of stock, warrants, rights and gift certificates that Macy is offering them is valued at $500 million or more, while Federated's offer is valued at $400 million. **********Ms. Sanger said the bondholders' committee was valuing Macy's offer based on the company's future value, not its value upon emerging from bankruptcy. ""We're offering them a position in Federated equity, which trades in the market, so there's no question about what the value of our currency is,"" she said. ""Macy is offering the bondholders a lot of things that most people would value at zero. What the committee is doing is using the premise of higher value to inflate the value of the securities Macy is giving them."" **********Ms. Sanger noted that in 1991 when Federated filed a plan to get itself out of bankruptcy, it only had the approval of its senior creditors. ""We then started to work on the bondholders, and once the momentum got going, we got them on board, too,"" she said. Federated emerged from bankruptcy in 1992, just days after Macy filed for protection. **********Robert M. Miller, the lawyer representing the bondholders' committee, declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement Mr. Vance had asked all parties involved in the mediation process to sign. But one bondholder noted yesterday that a package of securities that Federated had offered to bondholders on May 9 was also overvalued by about 20 percent."

The merry music in the local mall. The kids cooing at Santa. The ho-ho-hos, the bells, the -- ZAP. **********Oh yes, we almost forgot: the crooks getting nailed as they attempt to slither out the door with unpaid merchandise. **********Retail store security systems are working overtime this holiday season, and so, as it happens, are the bulls and bears on the stocks of companies that make the little tags and such that wind up foiling unsuspecting shoplifters. **********But there may be more for the analysts to worry about than which antitheft device catches the most wrongdoers. Several medical journals have published reports that suggest some caution might be warranted by shoppers with pacemakers and other implanted medical devices who pass through the tall metal pillars that emit magnetic frequencies to detect whether a stolen item is making its way out the door. **********To those in the industry -- and even to government officials -- though, the evidence suggests no reason for alarm. ""There is no pacemaker issue,"" said Mike Pardue, chief operating officer at the Sensormatic Electronics Corporation, the larger of two major players in the business. Mr. Pardue's company helps fund continuing research into, among other things, whether electronic security devices have a negative impact on medical devices. So far, he says, the research group has looked at more than 60 examples of pacemakers in a lab environment, getting no more reaction to surveillance systems than would occur from exposure to a conveyor belt motor. **********Several small players compete to supply retailers with electronic surveillance systems, but, for the most part, the American market is dominated by two companies: Sensormatic of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and Checkpoint Systems Inc. of Thorofare, N.J. **********Happily for both players, shoplifting is a growth industry. The $30 billion or so in goods stolen each year create a billion-dollar-plus-a-year business for Sensormatic and its competitors. And the business is expected to pick up substantially, as a result of what's known as ""source-tagging,"" or attaching tiny security labels to hard goods like toiletries right in the factory. That's as opposed to the current process of tagging products at the store. **********This week, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores will recommend the most efficient ways in which to ""source tag"" products. With 32,000 neighborhood drug stores in its membership, any endorsement of a specific company would be a boon to that company's bottom line. Among watchers of Sensormatic and Checkpoint, the consensus at the moment is that Checkpoint is the front runner because its tags are easier to install. **********Whether Checkpoint actually wins the edge in the drug store business remains an open question. But it seems that Checkpoint is coming out a winner on the prickly issue of surveillance equipment and its possible effect on medical devices. **********While nearly everyone involved in studies of surveillance systems emphasizes that there does not appear to be a widespread health threat to users of pacemakers and defibrillators, it would be hard to ignore both studies and anecdotal evidence that at least beg further inquiry. **********The French medical journal Arch Mal Couer said in 1992 that 25 of 35 pacemakers tested developed ""serious dysfunctions"" in experiments with electromagnetic antitheft devices. The medical journal PACE published a study in January 1993 that said ""our study demonstrates that antitheft devices can be dangerous for pacemaker patients."" (""I don't think it's enough evidence,"" Mr. Pardue said of the PACE study.) **********And a study by Siemens Pacesetter Inc. showed more problems with magnetic systems (such as those used by Sensormatic) than radio frequency systems (such as those used by Checkpoint), said Delos Johnson of Siemens. ""But still in my opinion, it's not a significant problem,"" he emphasized. Of those irregularities that were pinpointed in the various studies, the lion's share popped up in magnetic systems. **********Don Witters of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health agrees that ""it doesn't appear to be a major problem."" Still, he adds, there's enough evidence out there that ""we're taking steps to look at this much closer."" **********Those who favor Checkpoint seize on anecdotal evidence that suggest the fewest problems exist in radio frequency-based antitheft systems. The pros at the F.D.A. say, though, that there simply isn't enough evidence to generalize about one system or another given that most of the studies have been done in laboratories -- not on humans. **********So pacemaker patients might not have anything to worry about when they walk through antitheft devices. But there was the case of a cardiac defibrillator patient getting ""inapprpriate shocks"" when the patient operated a radio-controlled model car, the F.D.A. has said in a published report. And then there was the time a fetal heart beat detector picked up radio and C.B. broadcasts instead of heart beats. **********Which is all to say that your grandfather's heart may do just fine when he walks through one of those devices designed to catch a thief. But can somebody do something about that doo-wop music blaring from his chest?"
