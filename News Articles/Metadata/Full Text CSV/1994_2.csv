Unemployed men while away hours on front stoops, taxis jolt gingerly down pitted and muddy streets, and broken windows scar Government buildings that are dilapidated mementos of token national interest in a state where 95 percent of the population is black. **********""The Government doesn't even send schoolbooks here,"" said Maria Luisa Restrepo Perea, a high-school teacher. ""Sometimes we have to help the children get pens, uniforms, notebooks."" **********But in recent months Colombia's black population, the largest in the Spanish-speaking world but long politically dormant, has started to organize, and there are some signs of change. **********In November, for example, high schools received a new kind of visitor: military academy recruiters armed with scholarships. Responding to political pressure, Colombia's President, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, had abolished an informal color bar at the nation's air, army, naval and police officer training schools the month before.  Black Rights Law Approved **********Starting with a handful of sit-ins at Government offices here in 1991, political consciousness has grown gradually among Colombian blacks, who make up about 15 percent of the nation's 35 million people. **********Perhaps the most important change came last year when pressure by blacks in the form of street protests and even guerrilla actions helped win passage of a black rights law that is considered the most far-reaching in Latin America. **********""For the first time this law recognizes that there are blacks in Colombia,"" said Gustavo Makanaky Cordoba, a doctor here in Choco, a Pacific Coast state that has become Colombia's reservoir of black consciousness. **********Signed by President Gaviria on a visit here, the ""Negritudes Law"" allows for extending land titles to traditional black communities, promoting black education, ""punishing"" racial discrimination and setting up a presidential advisory board for black affairs. **********In a first concrete step, two recently elected deputies are entering Congress, representing seats reserved for the black population, the only such seats in Latin America. **********Recognizing a growth in black consciousness, the nation's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, announced the formation of its first all-black unit in November. Operating in Choco, the unit carries the name of Benkos Bioho, a colonial-era leader of black resistance. Two Handicaps Noted **********""We aren't children any more, we are organized,"" said the leader of one Quibdo slum-dwellers association. ""If the Government does not have the political will to invest in our people, we will have to follow the lead of all the other groups in this country -- turn to arms."" **********While the prospect of racial violence seems remote, black activists complain that their struggle for greater political power suffers from two handicaps. They are obstacles common to all of Latin America: racism by the nation's European elite and a low level of racial identification among Colombia's five million blacks. **********Colombia has Latin America's second largest black population, after Brazil. But President Gaviria presides over an all-white Cabinet, black faces rarely appear in national news magazines and television networks rarely employ black actors or reporters. Schools and universities largely ignore black history and the country has no museum of black culture. **********""We are invisible,"" Alba Otilia Duenas de Perez, a black activist, said in Bogota, the capital. **********Most of Colombia's black population live on the tropical nation's Pacific and Caribbean coasts. From Barranquilla and Cartagena, Colombia's two largest seaports, the nation's black population extends to coastal villages, interior sugar cane plantations, and the shantytowns of big Andean cities. To protect historically black villages, land titling has already begun for what the new law officially calls ""black communities."" Decades of Neglect **********""The black groups are on the coasts and the whites are in the Andes,"" Dr. Makanaky said. ""The whites channel all the state resources to favor their zone."" **********A visit to Choco, whose population is 95 percent black, is to encounter a legacy of decades of neglect by Colombia's European elite. **********""There is not one kilometer of paved road in Choco,"" Eustorgio Perez Rosero, the state civil defense director. Travel from here to the Pacific coast, 60 miles by plane, takes two days by riverboat, the only means of surface transport. **********Arriving at Quibdo airport, visitors jolt down a potholed road, passing open sewer ditches, unpainted shanties on stilts and wooden town houses on the verge of collapse. In a tropical region with one of the world's highest rainfalls, this city of 300,000 is routinely racked by floods. **********Largely populated by descendants of blacks freed after Colombia abolished slavery in 1851, Choco today is a forgotten region. The only road out of Quibdo, a spine-wrenching 150-mile dirt track to Medellin, takes 15 hours on a good day. The Government recently sent bulldozers to smooth the road, but only after guerrillas shut it in January for a week. **********""That's why Colombia has no black cyclists -- the roads are bad in black regions,"" Dr. Makanaky said, referring to the national passion for bicycle racing. In contrast, black athletes dominate Colombian boxing and soccer, sports that require little equipment. Statistics' Sad Story **********In Bogota, officials announced recently that Colombiano longer needs low-interest development loans from the World Bank. But just as Mexico has Chiapas, Colombia has Choco. **********As easy to see as the distended bellies of barefoot children here, Choco's infant mortality rate is 155 per 1,000 live births -- five times Colombia's national rate. Life expectancy is 52 years, 25 percent below the national level. Illiteracy is twice the national rate. **********""It's what I call a pigmentocracy -- white people have more access to schools and hospitals, blacks and Indians have less access,"" said Dr. Makanaky, who treats a daily stream of people with preventable diseases at his storefront clinic here. ""The Government has reduced antimalaria spending. Coincidentally, malaria is concentrated in black areas."" **********Slowing political identification has been a low level of racial identification, a phenomenon common among the mixed-race populations of Latin America. **********""Some Colombian blacks don't identify themselves as blacks, and some mixed-race people don't identify themselves with blacks,"" Peter Wade, a British anthropologist, wrote last year in an essay, ""The Black Movement in Colombia."" **********Dr. Makanaky said more bluntly: ""We are like the black movement in the U.S. in 1945. Blacks are avoiding being black. They are are trying to be as white as possible."" **********Hampering racial and cultural identification, Colombia's anthropological establishment argues that the Spanish Inquisition wiped out African customs and religious practices among the 200,000 captives imported from Africa during Spanish colonial rule. In Colombia, the Inquisition court was based in Cartagena, the only legal port of entry for slaves. Cultural Research Ordered **********Contradicting these arguments, linguists say that only 20 miles inland from Cartagena, at San Basilio de Palenque, descendants of a community of escaped slaves still speak a dialect based in part on languages spoken in contemporary Angola and Congo. **********""The stamp of Africa is on the Afro-Colombian family structure, the centrality of women in the family,"" said Nina S. de Friedemann, an anthropologist and author of a new book, ""The Black Saga: African Presence in Colombia."" ""The worship of saints is often a cultural mask for the worship of African deities."" **********Over protests from the Colombian Institute of Anthropology, a Government agency dominated by Indian specialists, the ""Negritudes Law"" specifically orders the institute to start researching ""Afro-Colombian culture."" **********Remembering the fiasco of the 1991 constitutional convention, black activists here assert that Colombia's Indians won political power only after they won national respect for their history and culture. **********Billed as ""a constitutional convention of all Colombians,"" this gathering reserved two seats for Colombia's 500,000 Indians. Blacks, with a population 10 times larger, had no seats."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/10/world/election-near-mexicans-question-the-questioners.html,Tim Golden,1994-08-10,,1087,,The New York Times,World,News,article,"Election Near, Mexicans Question the Questioners","Election Near, Mexicans Question the Questioners"," **********With the approach of what is generally expected to be the most competitive presidential election in Mexican history, the great paradox of the campaign is this: according to most opinion polls, there isn't much of a race at all. **********Some of the latest surveys give the candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, more than a 20-point lead over his closest rival, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the right-of-center National Action Party. One relatively reputable national poll gives Mr. Zedillo a more modest advantage of 14 points. Only one recent study, of widely challenged methodology, has shown an opposition candidate narrowly in the lead. **********The source of uncertainty is simply that almost no one believes polls. **********Despite a growing sophistication in the methods, polls in Mexico remain a metaphor for the extraordinary degree of skepticism surrounding the political process. Polls and Results Diverge **********""The special problem in Mexico has nothing to do with the mechanics of doing the job,"" said Warren Mitofsky, an American pollster who is organizing a national exit poll after the vote, on Aug. 21. ""The hard part is convincing anybody."" **********Polls and election results have diverged often in the past. Before the 1988 election, nearly all major polls gave Carlos Salinas de Gortari 6 to 11 points more than the 50.3 percent of the vote he was finally accorded, and even that result is widely believed to have been inflated by fraud. **********While experts say the methodology of Mexican pollsters is still in some cases sloppy or suspect, the problem is by no means entirely with the polls. **********Newspapers sympathetic to the Government have not been above altering the findings of opinion surveys in order to proclaim wide support for the PRI, as the governing party is called. Pollsters say it is almost routine for some clients to withhold publication of studies they commission if the results look bad for the Government or its party. **********The absence of any authoritative indicators of the way voters are feeling about the contest could contribute at least indirectly to the threat of violent protests at the result. A Lack of Faith **********In a year that has already brought a peasant revolt in Chiapas, in southern Mexico, and the assassination of the governing party's heavily favored candidate, tensions are peaking. A spate of new laws to protect against traditional methods of governing-party fraud have brought only a modest rise in people's confidence that their votes will count. And with all three of the main candidates still insisting they will win, questions about the polls will make it harder for people to sort out who may be right. **********Some political analysts and polling experts say the unreliability of Mexican surveys may be a consequence as well as a symptom of a lack of faith in their politics. **********Over the decades after World War II, during which Mexico was almost a one-party state, many people came to believe their ballots were only theoretically secret. Particularly in the countryside, where the Government's political control was strongest, residents sometimes still assert that voting against the PRI could cost them their jobs. **********Pollsters often describe the practical legacy of this past as the Nicaragua effect, after the failure of their counterparts there to accurately gauge the depth of voter opposition to the Sandinista Government before its election defeat in 1990. **********""The poorer the state, the greater the presence of local bosses, the more people hide their vote,"" said Vicente Licona, the head of Indemerc-Louis Harris, a Mexico City concern affiliated with the American organization. Comparison Called Absurd **********The Government official in charge of polling for President Salinas, Ulises Beltran, dismisses the comparison to Nicaragua as absurd. **********""What happened in Nicaragua was that the Sandinista Front organized brigades of young people who polled systematically for almost eight months identifying themselves as Sandinistas,"" he said in an interview. ""People came to associate polling with the Sandinista Front."" **********""The idea that people here will not answer truthfully because they are afraid of reprisals is simply not true,"" added Mr. Beltran, who holds a doctorate in economic history from the University of Chicago. ""There have been very precise polls of great quality in countries far more authoritarian than Mexico."" **********Yet recent history raises important questions about how well even the Mexican authorities know what is on the minds of their countrymen. **********Government officials say the intensity and sophistication of polling by Mr. Salinas was a critical source of his confidence to carry out broad changes in foreign policy, the economy, church-state relations and land tenure. But because polls showed the public accorded a low priority to political change, the Government was stunned by the outpouring of demands for greater democracy after the uprising in Chiapas. **********Miguel Basanez, head of the Mexico City office of Market Opinion Research International, argues that the country's history demands that pollsters adapt their methods to elicit truthful results. **********""Direct questions, in our Latin, Catholic, mixed-race culture, are too direct,"" he said, saying that many polls mistakenly predicted a PRI victory in 1992 elections in the northern state of Chihuahua because they simply asked, ""Whom will you vote for?"" rather than ""Whom do you like?"" 'That Isn't Polling' **********But other pollsters sharply challenge one of Mr. Basanez's principal adaptations -- surveying people on the street, where they may be more candid, rather than in their homes.  ""That isn't polling and I wouldn't dignify it with that term,"" Mr. Mitofsky said. **********Nancy Belden, whose Washington firm, Belden & Russonello, was to have directed the national poll originally commissioned by Mr. Salinas,said an experiment she conducted indicated that when people were questioned away from their homes, opposition to the PRI rose. **********Her firm is now completing a national poll for a group of American and European financial institutions. She said that she would not make the results public until later in the week, but that they appeared to coincide with those of several polls by respected Mexican firms. **********""It is conceivable that people in Mexico will say things in the polls that don't reflect how they will vote,"" she said, ""but I can't find any evidence that that kind of phenomenon is very influential. The bottom line is that we have a lot to learn here, and we'll find out on election day."""

Grand Metropolitan PLC sweetened some bitter news about its profit by also announcing that after three years of effort it had at last found a buyer for its Alpo Petfoods unit in America. **********The announcement, however, that Grand Met - the international food and drinks conglomeratewhose brands include Burger King, Pillsbury and J&B Scotch whisky - would sell Alpo to Nestlé SA for $510 million in cash was not enough for most investors. **********In heavy trading, the company's shares fell 3.5 pence, to 409 pence, as the market focused on the day's bad news - Grand Met's announcement of a round of plant closures and layoffs that would cost it £280 million ($443.6 million) in charges against earnings this year. **********As many as 4,000 of Grand Met's 80,000 jobs may go, according to press reports. Company spokesmen, though, said a final figure of job losses had not been determined. **********The latest charge comes on the heels of a similar charge last year as the company pared its work force by 3,000 people. A charge of £175 million last year plus that announced on Monday merely underlines the problems Grand Met faces. **********""It is a sign that Grand Met's markets remain very competitive,"" said John Wakely, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. He noted that the company expected to plow expected annual savings of £90 million mostly into increased marketing rather than maintaining any hope of its ability to widen its margins. **********Analysts said that the outlook for Grand Met's International Distillers & Vintners unit, the world's biggest alcoholic beverage company, is particularly poor. Profit in that unit, Grand Met's biggest money-spinner, fell slightly last year and the company admitted Monday that it expected a further decline in the current financial year. **********""IDV remains their biggest problem,"" said one analyst who noted that in spite of the economic rebound in many markets consumers remained reluctant to swallow the price rises on which the industry has relied for much of its growth in the past, much less to trade up to more expensive brands. **********The situation on the food component of Grand Met's business is brighter, with growth widely anticipated particularly from Pillsbury. But analysts still warned that the food industry overall continued to struggle to come to grips with an era of low inflation and high competition. **********One analyst noted that the charges announced on Monday, which basically cover Grand Met's International Distillers and European food divisions, even included its Haagen-Dazs premium ice cream unit. ""Haagen-Dazs is supposed to still be in a strong growth phase,"" said the analyst. **********For Nestlé, which already owns Friskies Petcare, the Alpo acquisition allows the company to pick up 6 percent of the vast U.S. pet food market, although at a price most observers describe as high. ""I think that the price Grand Met has gotten for what was an unsalable asset has surprised people,"" said Charles Winston, an analyst with Morgan Stanley."

Another stipulation said Viacom must make ""office facilities available in New York and Los Angeles for use by Canadian producers and distributors marketing Canadian films."" **********Some $23.8 million is to be invested in Canada's Wonderland, a seasonal amusement park about 15 miles north of downtown Toronto."

Some Will Benefit, Some Not **********While the Kohlberg proposal values Borden at a substantial premium over its market price before the deal's announcement, the offer is well below the prices Borden stock has commanded in previous years, and most shareholders will suffer losses if they sell to Kohlberg, Kravis. **********A part of the deal drew considerable anger from some big Borden shareholders yesterday. The offer would allow Kohlberg, Kravis to buy, with RJR Nabisco stock, 28.138 million newly issued shares of Borden from the company at a price of $11 a share. With those shares, Kohlberg would then need only 41 percent of the existing Borden shares to be tendered. It would then have a majority of all shares, and could force the deal to go through. Any holdout Borden shareholders would have to accept its offer of RJR Nabisco stock worth $14.25 for each Borden share. **********""The shareholders are being coerced into a transaction, with no ability to vote pro or con,"" said Alan I. Greene, chief executive of David J. Greene and Company, an investment manager with 2.5 million Borden shares. He questioned the Borden's judgment in accepting the offer. **********""The board of directors of Borden is the same board that let this company deteriorate over the last couple of years,"" Mr. Greene said. ""They just agreed to this transaction and walked away from the problem."" **********Allan Miller, Borden's general counsel, said ""the intention of K.K.R. was to buy 100 percent of the company,"" adding, ""Everything is a negotiation in life, and this is the deal that was negotiated among the parties."" **********Wall Street veterans could remember no deal where the currency in the acquisition of a giant company -- in this case, Borden -- was the stock of another giant company -- in this case, RJR Nabisco -- that was not making the acquisition. The manager of a large institutional holder of Borden stock, who spoke on condition of anonymity, remarked, ""This deal is extremely strange."" **********Robert Monks, a principal of Lens, a Washington-based investment fund that had a $3 million position in Borden stock, said: ""I never have heard of anything like it, K.K.R. selling half their interest in the biggest deal they ever had -- that's a very unusual arrangement."" **********Under the details disclosed yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Borden, Kohlberg, Kravis would receive from Borden a $20 million advisory fee, plus up to $15 million in expenses, if the deal falls through for any reason. If it is canceled because a higher bidder successfully takes over Borden, the payment would grow by $30 million, to a total of $65 million. **********Kohlberg's purchase of 28 million Borden shares would also proceed if there was a higher bidder, though it would have to pay more RJR shares for the purchase. **********In that case, the winning bidder for Borden would end up owning more than $300 million of RJR stock. And its payment for the company would grow by the same amount. A potential buyer with no desire to have such a large investment in RJR might thus be deterred from bidding. **********Yesterday, shares of RJR Nabisco continued to decline, off 25 cents to close at $6.375. Borden closed at $13.625, unchanged. **********Mr. Monks, like some other investors, said he was going to sell his shares. Several stockholders said they were planning no concerted action to challenge the proposed deal. ""What can we do, legally?"" asked Hans Reinisch, a stockholder from Manhattan who has held Borden shares for nine years. ""The cards are stacked."" **********Several institutional investors wondered why Borden's directors had agreed to the deal now, rather than give Erwin R. Shames, the company's chairman and chief executive, a chance to turn it around. According to a person familiar with the board's deliberations, Mr. Shames proposed a last-ditch effort at last Wednesday's board meeting to keep Borden independent, but the board rejected that option on Sunday evening. **********""This board went through four restructuring plans in six years,"" said Nomi Ghez, a stock analyst for Goldman, Sachs. ""Every restructuring brought book value down with charges, and left operations unimproved. Time was running out, the debt level was increasing, and I don't think the board felt it could take the risk of another restructuring."" **********Management's stake in the acquisition has not been worked out, said Mr. Miller, the Borden general counsel, and no talks on the matter have yet taken place with Kohlberg, Kravis. **********A Kohlberg spokeswoman said, ""No discussions have taken place to date on an ownership stake for management in the new Borden, but K.K.R. buyouts typically include management because managers who think like owners make better managers."" **********Executives of both Borden and Kohlberg have insisted that there would be no immediate sale of Borden units or a merger of Borden with RJR Nabisco. But few stockholders or analysts credit these statements. ""They always say they won't touch the company in these situations,"" said Terry Bivens of Argus Research. **********Over time, Kohlberg has tried to realize the value of its assets by cutting costs dramatically, divesting companies of unprofitable operations, and focusing on money-making core businesses. **********""But it's tough to milk the dairy business,"" said Emanuel Goldman of Paine Webber, because it is largely a regional business and highly competitive."

H. Macy & Company out of bankruptcy protection through a merger, Federated Department Stores Inc. will still be able to get its plan through court by January, a spokeswoman for Federated said yesterday. **********""We're not at all discouraged by where we are in this process because of the substantial support we already do have among creditors,"" Carol Sanger, the Federated spokeswoman, said. ""If there's enough support, there should be no problem with the time-table the judge has set out."" **********Burton R. Lifland, the Federal bankruptcy court judge presiding over the Macy case, has made it clear that he wants the case concluded by January. **********On Friday, after two weeks of mediation had failed to produce a consensus among creditors about whether to support a Macy or Federated plan, Judge Lifland ordered Macy to file its reorganization plan as soon as possible, effectively sidelining Federated until Aug. 1, when Macy's exclusive right to file a proposal is scheduled to expire. Concerns Raised by Creditors **********Creditors raised concerns that waiting that long would make it almost impossible for Federated to submit a counterproposal that could be approved by January. **********But Ms. Sanger said that given the support Federated had among creditors, gaining the rest of the necessary approval it would need would be fairly straightforward. **********Still, some creditors said they were considering asking the judge to terminate Macy's exclusivity early. Federated is not likely to consider such a move on its own, although it might participate in senior creditors' efforts because it is one of Macy's senior creditors, people familiar with the case said. **********Ms. Sanger said Federated was ""disappointed but not surprised"" that the mediation process had failed to produce a clear-cut consensus in favor of one plan or the other. ""The idea of getting a consensus in such a short time is difficult, particularly when the creditors' interests are so disparate,"" she said. **********After two weeks of negotiations with all the creditors, Cyrus R. Vance, the court-appointed mediator, told Judge Lifland that neither plan had enough support among creditors to win clear approval under bankruptcy laws. Federated had garnered the allegiance of Macy's influential senior creditors and the committee representing Macy's suppliers and other trade creditors. **********But Macy's bondholders favored Macy's plan, creating a stalemate. The committee representing them contends that the package of stock, warrants, rights and gift certificates that Macy is offering them is valued at $500 million or more, while Federated's offer is valued at $400 million. **********Ms. Sanger said the bondholders' committee was valuing Macy's offer based on the company's future value, not its value upon emerging from bankruptcy. ""We're offering them a position in Federated equity, which trades in the market, so there's no question about what the value of our currency is,"" she said. ""Macy is offering the bondholders a lot of things that most people would value at zero. What the committee is doing is using the premise of higher value to inflate the value of the securities Macy is giving them."" **********Ms. Sanger noted that in 1991 when Federated filed a plan to get itself out of bankruptcy, it only had the approval of its senior creditors. ""We then started to work on the bondholders, and once the momentum got going, we got them on board, too,"" she said. Federated emerged from bankruptcy in 1992, just days after Macy filed for protection. **********Robert M. Miller, the lawyer representing the bondholders' committee, declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement Mr. Vance had asked all parties involved in the mediation process to sign. But one bondholder noted yesterday that a package of securities that Federated had offered to bondholders on May 9 was also overvalued by about 20 percent."

The merry music in the local mall. The kids cooing at Santa. The ho-ho-hos, the bells, the -- ZAP. **********Oh yes, we almost forgot: the crooks getting nailed as they attempt to slither out the door with unpaid merchandise. **********Retail store security systems are working overtime this holiday season, and so, as it happens, are the bulls and bears on the stocks of companies that make the little tags and such that wind up foiling unsuspecting shoplifters. **********But there may be more for the analysts to worry about than which antitheft device catches the most wrongdoers. Several medical journals have published reports that suggest some caution might be warranted by shoppers with pacemakers and other implanted medical devices who pass through the tall metal pillars that emit magnetic frequencies to detect whether a stolen item is making its way out the door. **********To those in the industry -- and even to government officials -- though, the evidence suggests no reason for alarm. ""There is no pacemaker issue,"" said Mike Pardue, chief operating officer at the Sensormatic Electronics Corporation, the larger of two major players in the business. Mr. Pardue's company helps fund continuing research into, among other things, whether electronic security devices have a negative impact on medical devices. So far, he says, the research group has looked at more than 60 examples of pacemakers in a lab environment, getting no more reaction to surveillance systems than would occur from exposure to a conveyor belt motor. **********Several small players compete to supply retailers with electronic surveillance systems, but, for the most part, the American market is dominated by two companies: Sensormatic of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and Checkpoint Systems Inc. of Thorofare, N.J. **********Happily for both players, shoplifting is a growth industry. The $30 billion or so in goods stolen each year create a billion-dollar-plus-a-year business for Sensormatic and its competitors. And the business is expected to pick up substantially, as a result of what's known as ""source-tagging,"" or attaching tiny security labels to hard goods like toiletries right in the factory. That's as opposed to the current process of tagging products at the store. **********This week, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores will recommend the most efficient ways in which to ""source tag"" products. With 32,000 neighborhood drug stores in its membership, any endorsement of a specific company would be a boon to that company's bottom line. Among watchers of Sensormatic and Checkpoint, the consensus at the moment is that Checkpoint is the front runner because its tags are easier to install. **********Whether Checkpoint actually wins the edge in the drug store business remains an open question. But it seems that Checkpoint is coming out a winner on the prickly issue of surveillance equipment and its possible effect on medical devices. **********While nearly everyone involved in studies of surveillance systems emphasizes that there does not appear to be a widespread health threat to users of pacemakers and defibrillators, it would be hard to ignore both studies and anecdotal evidence that at least beg further inquiry. **********The French medical journal Arch Mal Couer said in 1992 that 25 of 35 pacemakers tested developed ""serious dysfunctions"" in experiments with electromagnetic antitheft devices. The medical journal PACE published a study in January 1993 that said ""our study demonstrates that antitheft devices can be dangerous for pacemaker patients."" (""I don't think it's enough evidence,"" Mr. Pardue said of the PACE study.) **********And a study by Siemens Pacesetter Inc. showed more problems with magnetic systems (such as those used by Sensormatic) than radio frequency systems (such as those used by Checkpoint), said Delos Johnson of Siemens. ""But still in my opinion, it's not a significant problem,"" he emphasized. Of those irregularities that were pinpointed in the various studies, the lion's share popped up in magnetic systems. **********Don Witters of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health agrees that ""it doesn't appear to be a major problem."" Still, he adds, there's enough evidence out there that ""we're taking steps to look at this much closer."" **********Those who favor Checkpoint seize on anecdotal evidence that suggest the fewest problems exist in radio frequency-based antitheft systems. The pros at the F.D.A. say, though, that there simply isn't enough evidence to generalize about one system or another given that most of the studies have been done in laboratories -- not on humans. **********So pacemaker patients might not have anything to worry about when they walk through antitheft devices. But there was the case of a cardiac defibrillator patient getting ""inapprpriate shocks"" when the patient operated a radio-controlled model car, the F.D.A. has said in a published report. And then there was the time a fetal heart beat detector picked up radio and C.B. broadcasts instead of heart beats. **********Which is all to say that your grandfather's heart may do just fine when he walks through one of those devices designed to catch a thief. But can somebody do something about that doo-wop music blaring from his chest?"

European companies in crucial industries like automobiles are beginning to report higher sales. Inflation is largely under control. **********Assuming the nascent upturn continues, it would mark the end of a recession that cut short the euphoria that swept Western Europe after the collapse of Communism in the east and the reunification of Germany. **********Political and business leaders here are clearly hoping that a return to economic growth will give European nations a chance to turn their attention from domestic problems back to issues like strengthening the ties among the 12 members of the European Union and integrating the emerging capitalist democracies of Eastern Europe with the West. **********But European leaders also acknowledge that recovery, whatever its magnitude, will not carry away all of the region's woes. **********As President Clinton and the leaders of the world's six other leading industrialized nations -- Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy --gather for a summit meeting opening on Friday in Naples, they will confront a Europe that remains in the midst of economic upheaval. **********Sales and profits may be improving, but businesses continue to lay off workers, sending already high unemployment rates higher, sapping consumer confidence and keeping the political outlook unsettled for leaders in most countries. **********""The recovery is there, but it is still weak and insufficient,"" Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France said in a television interview last week. **********The outlook has not been helped by the recent turmoil in the world's financial markets. The decline in the buying power of the dollar is hurting exports of goods to the United States from Germany and to a lesser extent France as well as Japan. Long-term interest rates have risen sharply this year in Germany, making mortgages and loans for business expansion more expensive. **********Governments have yet to devise a strategy for reducing unemployment and stimulating the creation of jobs, an area in which Europe badly trails the United States, without slashing a social welfare system that most Europeans consider a birthright. **********Though they are making progress, companies have yet to reverse a worldwide loss of market share and prove that European industry, in many cases overstaffed and slow-moving, can remain competitive. **********The single European market, once seen as the key to growth, has not lived up to its promise since the end of the cold war, and plans for a single currency have foundered. Although Germany is shifting its sights eastward, most other Western European nations are still trying to decide whether the emerging capitalist democracies of Eastern Europe are an economic opportunity or a threat. **********""We've reached a critical couple of years in Europe,"" said Suzy Symes, the director of the Europe program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. Signs of a Rebound **********After seeing its economic output decline by 1.3 percent last year, Germany, traditionally Europe's economic engine, is beginning to hum along again. Its economy should grow by 1.8 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, according to projections released on Thursday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based research group financed by the major industrial nations. **********""Growth will be modest, but it's much better than was expected only a few months ago,"" said Rainer Veit, head of the Germany department at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. **********After shrinking by 0.2 percent last year, the Western European economy is expected to grow 1.9 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1995, according to the economic cooperation group. France, Italy and Spain, among others, are projected to resume growth this year, joining Britain, whose recovery is now in its second year. **********Signs of the improvement are apparent all over Western Europe. Fiat, Italy's largest private-sector company, said on Thursday that its sales were up 10 percent in the first four months of the year and that it expects to make a small profit for the full year after suffering its worst-ever loss in 1993. Cie. des Machines Bull, France's largest computer maker, said sales for the first five months of the year were up 14 percent. German Inflation Reversing **********In Germany, the central bank, the Bundesbank, appears to have extinguished the inflationary pressures that arose from unification in 1990. The inflation rate, which was 3.9 percent last year, is projected to fall to 2.8 percent this year and 2.0 percent next year even as economic growth resumes. **********The Bundesbank, which has been cautiously reducing official interest rates despite a rise in long-term rates caused by the turmoil in the financial markets, is coming under increasing pressure from the United States to make further rate reductions to help strengthen the dollar. **********With the immediate strains of the recession ending, Governments and the European Union will have the opportunity to turn their attention to Europe's underlying economic problems, said economists, analysts and business executives. But it is unclear, they said, whether recovery will breed new cohesion and purpose among the Western European nations. Deeper Problems Remain **********""The news is good, even though the economic data do not point conclusively to economic growth,"" Edgar S. Woolard, the chairman of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, said in a speech on Wednesday in Brussels. ""At the same time there is a danger that many in the business and government sectors will sit back and expect cyclical economic recovery to solve deeper problems."" **********In Naples, the leaders of the Group of Seven nations will be able to point to the salutary effects of the agreement they completed late last year to liberalize world trade. **********But the United States and Japan will arrive with little hope of breaking the impasse over reducing Japan's trade surplus. And European industry, which depends heavily on exports, will be watching carefully to see whether the seven nations make a strong commitment to supporting the value of the dollar. **********""Whatever the benefits of the trade agreements signed by the major powers, nothing is possible in the long term unless we achieve true monetary equilibrium that avoids situations like the current scandalous undervaluation of the dollar,"" said Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chief executive of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company. **********The Group of Seven leaders will also discuss ways of creating jobs and reducing unemployment, which stands at 12.7 percent in France, 11.6 percent in Italy and 24 percent in Spain, and is expected to increase in Germany from 8.3 percent now to 10 percent by year-end. **********A distinguishing characteristic of the European recovery so far, in fact, is that it shows few signs of solving unemployment. Although economic recoveries typically do not create jobs in their early stages, this one seems unlikely to spur large-scale hiring even when fully established. **********That is largely because European industry, saddled with the costs of comprehensive social welfare benefits, is in the process of paring back employment in an effort to get its costs down and remain globally competitive. **********Britain, among other countries, will argue at the Group of Seven meeting that the best way to promote creating jobs is to reduce the laws that make it difficult for European companies to hire and fire workers."

It joins units like the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles advertising agency network, the Medicus Intercon International health care agency and Clarion Marketing and Communications, which specializes in sales promotion and direct marketing. **********""We've always looked at ourselves as an interactive advertising agency, even when we had to explain to people what that was,"" said J. G. Sandom, the president and creative director of Einstein & Sandom, whose first name is indeed just J. **********""The strengths that D.M.B.& B. bring to bear in areas like research and programming, and the client contacts it has worldwide, were very appealing to us,"" he added. ""And ultimately, I believe, we share a common vision."" **********That vision, as articulated by Richard V. Hopple, the vice chairman for corporate strategic development of D.M.B.& B., is an acknowledgment that ""this emerging world of interactivity is going to get here at some point in time."" **********""If you accept that fact,"" he added, ""there are various skills agencies don't typically have that are going to be necessary to service client needs."" **********Clearly, big agency companies are accepting that fact with a feverish intensity, clambering aboard the new technologies bandwagon quicker than you can say ""compact disk read-only memory."" **********Their passion in staking claims to a mile or two of the so-called information highway is underscored by D.M.B.& B. being the third agency this week to disclose an involvement with interactivity. **********The Leo Burnett Company said on Monday that it had formed an alliance with Giant Step Productions, a Chicago company specializing in interactive technologies. And yesterday, Bates U.S.A. said it had established an interactive media and research group within its media department, headed by Craig Gugel as senior vice president, and would participate in a test by the IT Network of the Interactive Channel, an interactive cable television service, in the Dallas suburb of Denton, Tex. **********The danger, of course, is that agencies will look back one day and realize they had wasted scarce resources on stampeding into a fad they had mistaken for a trend. **********""Interactive isn't going to go away,"" Mr. Hopple asserted, ""so the need for interactive skills isn't going to go away."" **********D.M.B.& B. is sure enough of that, he said, that it has spent two years and several million dollars exploring the new technologies. Its ventures have included the founding of Advista, a company that sells multimedia advertising and marketing software called Brandview, and Feldman & Associates, a producer of those program-length commercials known as infomercials. **********""In a truly interactive world,"" Mr. Hopple asked, ""who's to say commercials won't be two hours long and consumers won't access them at different points?"" (Imagine, a world in which Susan Powter, ""Amazing Discoveries"" and Lori Davis, Cher's hair-care-products pal, are on for 120 minutes at a time rather than 30.) **********Mr. Sandom also seems certain that interactivity is no Hula Hoop or pet rock, noting ""the benefits inherent in using the technology, such as the higher retention rates that research shows are delivered by interactivity."" **********""The more you interact with something, the more you remember about it,"" he said. ""It's that simple. **********""And this isn't about media,"" he added. ""It's about communicating."" **********For clients like Citicorp, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Merck, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, the New York Stock Exchange, Nynex, Prodigy and the United States Department of Agriculture, Einstein & Sandom has produced what it calls interads, advertising that invites interaction on personal computers. The ads can include sound and moving images as well as text on screen. **********Mr. Sandom, 37, continues in his current capacities at Einstein & Sandom, as will the 13 other employees of the company, which will remain in its office at 6 West 18th Street, near Fifth Avenue, in Manhattan.

A New Governing Body **********China also said it would set up a new political body to govern Hong Kong in 1997. **********Though there is general apprehension about China's intentions in Hong Kong, the standoff between Beijing and Hong Kong's Governor, Chris Patten, has not undermined the colony's otherwise booming economy. Indeed, economic integration between Hong Kong-based companies and their joint-venture partners and investments on the mainland have grown despite the political turmoil. **********However, as the political confrontation developed during the day, Hong Kong's stock market fell 331 points, or 3.1 percent. **********The day of conflict began in the early morning hours, when Hong Kong's 60-member legislative council, after 10 hours of debate, approved by voice vote the first stage of an electoral reform bill submitted last December by Mr. Patten. The lawmakers went ahead despite stern warnings from China's Communist Party leaders that the bill was unacceptable to Beijing. More Than China Will Accept **********Though the first reform bill includes such minor provisions as a change in the voting age, it nonetheless was unacceptable to China because it introduced single-member voting districts for elections in 1994 and 1995. The balloting will place a fully democratic parliamentary body in charge of Hong Kong's affairs for the first time under British rule. **********Chinese objections could not be resolved during 17 rounds of negotiations between October 1992, when Mr. Patten proposed the democratic reforms, and November 1993. Mr. Patten released a ""white paper"" on those negotiations today, prompting Beijing to accuse him of violating an agreement of confidentiality. **********Mr. Patten said he will introduce the more substantive elements of his electoral reform package on March 9. They will be published Friday. These final measures will probably be debated and voted on by summer. **********Mr. Shen, in his statement, blamed Britain for ""the disruption of cooperation between China and and the U.K. on Hong Kong's political system"" and said the fallout would ""inevitably affect"" future cooperation on transition matters, including the financing for Hong Kong's huge new airport project. Abolition of British Institutions **********The foreign ministry statement said the major components of ""the British political body administering Hong Kong,"" including the Legislative Council ""will definitely be terminated together with the end of the British administration"" on June 30, 1997. **********""By that time,"" the statement continued, ""the political body of the Hong Kong special administrative region will be formed according to the decisions of the Chinese National People's Congress and the relevant provisions of the basic law."" **********The basic law enshrines the agreements between Britain and China when the Hong Kong turnover was negotiated in 1984 by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. **********It calls for a ""one country-two system"" ruling formula, in which Hong Kong would become a ""special administrative region"" of China for 50 years before it is fully absorbed. **********Mr. Patten has been careful to chart a dignified course for Britain's retreat, and he reminded the colony's 5.8 million residents today of his precarious political position: ""Her Majesty's government and the governor have said repeatedly that they will not go further, or less far than the people of Hong Kong want them to go."""

H. Macy & Company on Friday, Myron E. Ullman 3d, the chairman and chief executive of Macy, vowed to keep the company independent and whole despite Federated Department Stores' desire for a merger. **********A videotape of the call was made available yesterday, and while Mr. Ullman did not say much that he had not said already, he spoke forcefully and with what appeared to be great conviction, contending that he would be able to keep Macy away from competitors. **********""Macy's is not in play,"" he told Macy's employees. ""Macy's is not for sale. Macy's is not going to be broken up. That's our obligation and our responsibility."" No Interest in a Sale **********He dismissed reports that Dillard Department Stores Inc. and the May Department Stores Company might make a play for Macy. He said he had spoken with executives at Dillard six or eight months ago to tell them that Macy was not interested in selling all or part of its operations to them. **********He said that Dillard's investment banker, Morgan Stanley & Company, called last week to say, ""If we could be helpful, please let us know,"" but that he told them he did not need help. **********But analysts say that Mr. Ullman's ultimate responsibility is to achieve the maximum return for Macy's creditors and that companies like Federated and other department store chains may be able to offer the creditors more than Macy can alone. **********Federated has hammered on that point in its meetings with creditors and in interviews. ""They have to maximize the value to the creditor community,"" Allen I. Questrom, the chairman and chief executive of Federated, said in an interview last week. Federated made an unusual play to combine itself and Macy on Jan. 2, when it bought $449.3 million worth of Macy debt, making itself a creditor and giving it a voice in Macy's reorganization. **********Referring to a merger with Macy, Mr. Questrom said, ""I think they will not go out of their way to make this impossible."" **********Mr. Ullman, however, assured his employees that Mr. Questrom had agreed that Macy alone should develop a plan of reorganization. Under bankruptcy law, Macy, as the debtor, has the sole right to submit such a plan -- at least until March 15, when its period of exclusivity expires. The bankruptcy court can extend this period. **********Macy intends to ask Judge Burton R. Lifland, the bankruptcy judge presiding over the case, for an extension, and Mr. Ullman told his employees on Friday that he expected the judge to grant the request. He did not know how long the extension would be, perhaps three to five months. **********Mr. Ullman said he expected no objections to an extension. ""We don't think we'll get any objections from the creditors because most believe very strongly that the company's business plan is being well executed, that we're meeting our monthly performance objectives each month by month and that we've had constructive conversations with them about the reorganization of the company,"" he said. **********Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant who saw a videotape of the conference call, agreed that Macy would get an extension. **********""Judge Lifland generally has been favorably inclined toward the debtor, and I think it's likely he'll give Macy one more chance,"" Mr. Loeb said. ""The question is how much time he will give them."" **********A major creditor, Fidelity Investments, challenged an extension last spring, but Judge Lifland refused to recognize the mutual fund company's objections because it was not a creditor in name. Other creditors believe that Fidelity, which holds $500 million of Macy's secured debt, is certain to object to any extension past March. Federated, as another major creditor, could also challenge an extension. Holders of secured debt are the most senior creditors of a company in bankruptcy and must be repaid in part or whole before unsecured creditors receive anything. Strong Holiday Gain **********In the conference call, which was videotaped so that Macy's 51,000 employees could see it, Mr. Ullman lifted the curtain on Macy's holiday performance. He said the company's earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow used by bankruptcy analysts -- were $266 million, a 30 percent increase from a year earlier."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/25/business/the-media-business-a-surge-in-advertising-across-the-radio-dial.html,Joshua Mills,1994-07-25,,917,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,A Surge in Advertising Across the Radio Dial,THE MEDIA BUSINESS; A Surge in Advertising Across the Radio Dial," **********Helped by qualitative ratings and research that provide a snapshot of listeners' buying habits, radio advertising has been surging this year at stations big and small around the country. **********Advertising revenues rose 12 percent in May, the last month for which data are available, from May 1993. The gain was the fourth double-digit increase in five months. **********""Radio is taking some business from other media, largely because radio broadcasters have become a good deal more sophisticated in how they market their stations,"" said Tom Moon, the managing editor of Radio Business Report, an industry newspaper published in Alexandria, Va. ""There's less emphasis today on selling by raw audience numbers and more on saying, 'Here's a profile of your consumers, and here's how that matches the profile of our listeners.' "" **********Qualitative ratings might be useful, for example, for a classical music station that is not ranked among a market's top 20 stations in total audience. The profile might show, how-ever, that the station is in the top 10 among people who take at least 10 business trips a year, or among people with graduate-school educations. That information might not help the station attract soup advertising, but it would be useful in courting airlines or makers of luxury cars. Fast-Paced Growth **********As the American economy has strengthened, advertising has increased in all markets and at stations of all sizes, said Gary R. Fries, president of the Radio Advertising Bureau, which is based in New York and is the industry's sales and marketing arm. **********""Radio's recovery started more than a year ago, before the economy was recognized as growing, and it's growing faster than the economy, faster than ad spending in general, faster than most other media,"" Mr. Fries said. **********The bureau conducts a monthly survey of radio advertising in 115 areas around the country, and has found that percentage increases in smaller markets are similar to those in bigger markets, a spokeswoman said. **********Unlike most daily newspapers and the television networks, which seek the broadest audience possible, radio has generally thrived by developing formats that carve out specific pieces of the listening audience. And while the growth of cable television, video games and personal computing has reduced the time that many people spend with traditional media, time spent listening to the radio has actually increased, largely because so much radio listening is done in the car and elsewhere outside the home. **********For many years, radio relied on ratings provided by the Arbitron Company of New York to measure its total audience, and the time spent listening, within broad age groups. These ratings, of course, benefited the stations with the largest audiences and hurt others. Audience Portraits **********As recently as last year, owners and executives of some stations that specialized in classical music or jazz were bemoaning the reliance of media buyers on the raw Arbitron numbers. **********No longer. **********""We used to do body-count research, but now we do qualitative research,"" Mr. Fries said. ""Any radio station can tell you a profile of their listeners."" **********Statistics released earlier this month by the Radio Advertising Bureau show that local and national ad revenues were each up 12 percent in May, and rose an equal amount for the January-May period, compared with 1993.  ""July-August-September looks like the same type of increases, even though summer has traditionally been not as spirited a time as other seasons,"" Mr. Fries said. **********Radio stations can now use software provided by Arbitron to tap into a data base and pull out specific findings. A New York station that wants to seek advertising from northern New Jersey retailers, for instance, can break down the cumulative Arbitron numbers to see just how many listeners it has in New Jersey, and what their demographics are. **********The Arbitron data base, compiled from listener diaries, can divide the audience statistics by age, sex, family status and education. The new software also allows stations to link up with other data bases and obtain census data and spending patterns compiled by other companies.  In addition to Arbitron, a number of small companies offer qualitative research into listening and buying habits. New Programs, New Rules **********The strong ad performance reflects the successful syndication of program hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Howard Stern and Don Imus, and rule changes adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 1992, industry executives and industry watchers say. **********The new rules increased the number of stations a single entity could hold to 30 AM and 30 FM stations, from 12 of each, and allowed one owner to have more than two stations in a single market. **********""The impact has been huge,"" said Gerry Boehme, senior vice president for research at the Katz Radio Group, a company in New York that helps local radio stations court national and regional advertisers. ""You can cut costs, change marketing."" By putting more money into marketing and defining its audience more precisely, a station might even wind up creating a new format, he said. **********At the time of the rule change, some broadcasting critics, and at least one F.C.C. commissioner, said the higher limits would reduce program diversity. **********Not so, insisted Mr. Boehme.

The final tranche is expected early next year. **********The federal government, which owns 51.42 percent of Lufthansa, will not participate in the rights issue. Instead it will sell the 3.9 million shares to which it is entitled along with other shares in its possession to a handpicked group of institutional investors. **********The federal government eventually hopes to reduce its stake in the airline to around 35 percent and set a successful precedent for the privatization of the state telecommunications and railway monopolies. **********""The government is keen to privatize Lufthansa first, but if they're successful, it'll be easier for them to privatize Telekom as well,"" said Klaus Hopke, a German equities analyst at James Capel in London, referring to Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications company. **********Germany will begin to sell shares in Deutsche Telekom in 1996, but banks, brokers and would-be investors are already clamoring for a piece of the action. The Telekom sale is expected to bring in 10 billion DM to 15 billion DM. **********""They have to get Lufthansa off the ground successfully,"" said Reinhard Winkler, chairman of the specialist brokerage Rhine Securities Ltd. in London. ""It's the first privatization in a long time and every major privatization of the German government before has been very successful."" **********With the help of 27 German and foreign banks, Lufthansa has begun soliciting bids from investors for the privatization phase. **********Lufthansa will be using a process called book-building to more or less guarantee a good response. It is the first time that book building is being used in a German privatization. The operation will not be considered successful unless the offering is oversubscribed 150 percent to 200 percent. **********Book-building is when a banking consortium - in this case led by Dresdner Bank AG - collects bids from investors and then allocates new shares according to a basket of criteria designed to select the best overall partners, preferably investors offering a long-term commitment to the company in addition to a good price. **********In previous German government privatizations, a price was always announced in advance. **********The book-building begins Sept. 19 and ends Sept. 29. Rainer Rossmann, a corporate finance specialist at Dresdner Bank, said the partial privatization would be completed by the beginning of October. **********Investors who miss out this time will get another chance to bid next year when the government further reduces its stake in Lufthansa. **********The subscription period for the normal rights issue will be Sept. 20 to Oct. 4."

Why Patience Is the Best Policy"," **********INVESTORS found much reason to rejoice in 1993 as most bonds, stocks and other products generated handsome returns. But many people holding cash-value life insurance policies were less than happy with their performance. **********These policies combine insurance with a savings pot that grows tax-deferred. When interest rates decline, as they have for the last few years, the rate paid on the policies' cash portion declines as well. Some policies that paid 10 percent five years ago are now paying just 6 percent. **********Unscrupulous insurance salesmen prey on policyholders who are dissatisfied with falling rates by offering them a replacement policy and claiming they will be better served -- even though the facts do not bear them out. In the industry, attempting to persuade someone to drop a policy and replace it with another through misrepresentation is referred to as ""twisting."" **********To prevent twisting, some states require agents to provide information on the new and old policies or to notify the current insurer. These laws, however, are very difficult to enforce. **********Policyholders should therefore be skeptical of any recommendation for a replacement policy. ""Never replace a cash-value policy unless you know precisely what you're doing, and almost no one does,"" said James H. Hunt, an actuary and a director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va. **********Twisting has long been a problem, Mr. Hunt said, but some investment climates aggravate it. Until the early 1980's, for example, most cash-value policies were ""whole-life"" insurance,a product combining insurance protection with interest or a dividend credited to the policyholder each year.The dividend on whole life reflects what the insurer earns on its general account, composed mostly of bonds and real estate. Generally, these policies' returns lag behind the market, paying more as interest rates decline and less as rates rise. **********When interest rates and inflation skyrocketed in the early 1980's, the interest paid on whole-life policies did not look attractive. Insurers responded with universal life, a product that separates the insurance from the investment account. Universal life pays interest at current market rates, reset periodically. Although insurers also introduced variable life, which combines insurance with an investment in mutual funds, those policies have been slower to catch on because of the uncertainty of their returns. **********By the mid-80's, policyholders were fleeing whole-life policies for new products, Mr. Hunt said. ""In 1985 and 1986, 50 percent of life insurance sales were replacements of other policies,"" he said. ""The harm that was done then is simply incalcuable."" **********With interest rates now low, some agents are trying to persuade policyholders to switch back to whole life. ""There is a powerful force out there attempting to get people to switch,"" Mr. Hunt said. ""People still don't understand how valuable their old policies are."" **********Replacing policies is a bad idea for two reasons. First, the policies carry a heavy upfront load, or commission, roughly equal to the first year's premium. Second, insurance is a long-term investment. Today's top performer may well be tomorrow's loser. **********The universal-life policies that were hot when interest rates were high now pay about 6 percent. In contrast, many whole-life policies, which did not look competitive a decade ago, pay about 9 percent. **********""I start from the premise that it is a bad idea to replace a policy,"" said David F. Woods, an insurance agent and financial planner in Springfield, Mass. ""The burden of proof is on the replacement."" **********Peter Katt, an independent insurance consultant who analyzes policies for bank trust departments, said in the August issue of the AAII Journal, an investment publication, that ""generally, the replacement of one commission-paying cash value policy with another commission-paying cash value policy is a major mistake."" **********Mr. Katt makes one major exception -- policies from weak insurance companies. In such situations, he may recommend that a client cash in his policy or, if there is a surrender charge, withdraw the cash value as a loan. ""If a company is really marginal, all you need is two really bad stories, and it could tip over,"" he said. **********If the consumer is in good health and insurable, Mr. Katt may recommend a low-commission product from USAA Life in San Antonio, Tex., or Ameritas Life in Lincoln, Neb. ""I wouldn't say that replacement is never warranted, but replacement with a load product is never warranted,"" he said. **********Mr. Hunt, who analyzes the internal rate of return on policies for consumers ($40 for the first; $30 for each additional; NICO, P.O. Box 15492, Alexandria, Va. 22309), said replacement makes sense in fewer than 1 of 10 cases. **********A typical query comes from someone who has a $25,000 policy and needs $250,000 in insurance. ""The agent tells him to drop the old policy and get a new one for $250,000,"" Mr. Hunt said. ""But many of these old dividend-paying whole-life policies are very valuable now. Why not just keep the old one and buy a new one for $225,000?""IT MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYBODY **********DOES every family need life insurance? Not necessarily, said Tim Kochis, a financial planner at Kochis & Fitz in San Francisco. **********Breaking from the traditional approach, his firm tries to determine if clients can get by without such policies. ""We take a very skeptical view of insurance,"" Mr. Kochis said. ""We think it preys on people's fears. We see it as appropriate only to fulfill needs that can't be fulfilled in any other way."" **********For example, someone who owns an old, beat-up car that is used only to drive to the train station may not want collision insurance because the car's value has dwindled and it would not be worth replacing, Mr. Kochis said. The car owner might be better off putting the money in a savings account. ""You might need liability insurance,"" he said, ""but you don't need collision."" **********He applies the same type of reasoning to life insurance. ""We always look first to see if the individual can self insure,"" or absorb the losses themselves, he said, ""because insurance is usually a lousy investment."" **********Mr. Kochis said most of his clients do not need life insurance after they reach their 50's. ""The sum of what they have is enough to provide for their survivors,"" he said. Of course, a policy with a cash value may be worth retaining, and people who have young children and few assets may need insurance. **********In terms of estate planning, he recommends life insurance only if a client has illiquid assets, like a business. ""If you have your assets in stocks and bonds, you're much better off avoiding insurance and using your liquid assets to pay estate taxes,"" he said."

Of the 33 categories of funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, the American fund-data group, all but three were in the loss column as of last week. Only those specializing in Japan soared, up more than 25 percent as a group after three years of dismal performance. **********Not surprisingly in such markets, the few money managers who can boast of beating the averages have used an array of defensive tactics: Many hoarded larger-than-usual amounts of cash; others were nimble enough to be out of the market when it plunged; gold and other commodity-type holdings were another refuge. And the courage to place big bets on a few stocks provided rich rewards for some. **********Consider a new arrival, the Strong Growth Fund, which was up 6.6 percent for the year as of last week, in contrast to an average loss of 5.39 percent for its category. The fund picked up gains in the first quarter in volatile technology stocks, but its manager, Ronald Ognar, cut that position from 25 percent to 5 percent in time to miss the downdraft in that sector, switching over to regional bank stocks as a ""good place to hide."" **********But Mr. Ognar is maintaining a 35 percent cash position. ""It's still time to be defensive because it's just too easy to lose money and stocks aren't dirt cheap yet,"" he said. **********Anthony Orphanos, who runs the Warburg Pincus Growth & Income Fund, also made money on such technology stocks as the chip makers National Semiconductor and Micron Technology, which he picked up when they were out of favor last year. But he's fending off the bears with a hefty 18 percent stake in gold mining companies as well, and maintaining a larger-than- usual 10 percent cash hoard after unloading a third of his high-tech shares. **********Mr. Orphanos, who likes to make big, concentrated bets, is now ""very lightly"" buying financial service stocks like property-casualty insurers Allstate and USF&G, which have fallen as much as 30 percent to 40 percent. ""I'm almost contrarian, buying things that are cheap and have declined a lot,"" he said. **********For sheer bearishness, however, it's hard to beat the iconoclastic Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund. **********""We're extremely defensive and postured for a bear market,"" said Andrew Pilara of the fund's management team. He noted that Paul Stephens, the firm's chief investment officer thinks the Dow Jones industrial average could fall below 3,000 in the next 18 months. The fund has returned 4.6 percent for the year based on an unusually large ""short"" position of nearly 25 percent, calculated to profit when the Standard & Poor's 500 Index tumbles or high-flying stocks like casino shares take a fall. Another 25 percent chunk is in gold mining companies, and the fund was early to buy commodity stocks like Kaiser Aluminum and INCO, a nickel company, both of which have performed well this year. **********As for the disastrous bond funds: The average bond fund is down 4.04 percent for the year. There are two noteworthy performers, although neither qualifies as a typical bond vehicle. **********Northeast Investors Trust, a high- yield bond fund, was boasting a 3.6 percent total return last week, in contrast to a loss of 2.5 percent for the average junk bond vehicle. **********A second successful income play this year was the Franklin Templeton Hi Income fund, which is a currency fund investing in top-rated global fixed income instruments. It is one of three Franklin currency vehicles which have turned in top performances by betting on a weak dollar at the outset of the year."

Sills Jr. won commitments from four companies last year to bring their operations to the downtown office center. **********One new arrival will be the MBNA Corporation, a big credit card company. The company announced late last year that it would build a 350,000-square-foot building on a corner of Rodney Square. **********MBNA, a large Delaware employer, has never before had a presence in the state's largest city. MBNA is based in suburban New Castle County, near Newark. **********Work has begun on the nine-story building. The construction managers, the Bellevue Holding Company of Wilmington, expect the project to be completed by late this year. **********Designed by Heery International Inc. of Washington in conjunction with Homsey Architects Inc. of Wilmington, the building's neo-classical style was chosen to blend with other buildings on the square. **********Long considered the most desirable site in the central business district, Rodney Square is home to the headquarters of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the chemical giant, and the Delaware Chancery Court, where many corporate takeover battles are fought. **********When MBNA completes the building, it will house 1,500 to 2,000 workers in individual banking and support operations. Its headquarters, however, will continue to be in New Castle County. **********The credit card company was able to move so quickly with construction plans in part because of Wilmington 2000, a downtown-development group made up of representatives from the area's most powerful businesses. **********Tax-abatement programs have been the centerpiece of the city's economic recovery efforts. But in the case of MBNA, the city had an additional sweetener. **********Part of the package put together for the company included the donation of $6 million in land on Rodney Square or about two-thirds of the building site. **********The city had become the reluctant owner of the land after another publicly backed real estate deal involving a Wilmington savings institution went sour in 1990. Land had been assembled and buildings razed in the late 1980's to make room for an office tower, but with the downturn in the economy the institution abandoned its plans, leaving the city and another public agency with an expensive and embarrassing hole. **********When MBNA went looking to expand operations, the city saw the land giveaway as a way to recoup some of its financial losses and bring in much needed jobs for disadvantaged city residents. The city even offered to buy the remaining third of the building site from the savings institution for $4.2 million. But Charles M. Cawley, president of MBNA, refused, insisting the credit card company buy it privately. **********Other enticements for MBNA included a five-year tax abatement on the real estate; an additional five years of real estate tax relief of 50 percent, and a five-year break on the head tax, a city tax on employers, which is assessed at $6 an employee a month. **********Even with the tax cuts, the Sills administration estimates the city will realize a $900,000 net gain over the next 10 years from the deal. **********There had been concerns the city central business district would go the way of other deteriorating midsized industrial cities. With vacancy rates in downtown Wilmington at 24.7 percent, the fear was that business would look to other more vigorous markets outside Delaware. **********""We just can't stand by and let the city go backward,"" said John E. Stapleford, director of the Bureau of Economic Research at the University of Delaware. ""It's all to our benefit to see this sort of thing happen. This influx of jobs into downtown is very, very important for everybody."" **********Du Pont announced in November that it would bring 1,500 jobs to its downtown buildings. The Beneficial Corporation, a giant lender that had been based in New Castle County, decided in May that it would relocate its headquarters in a city-state redevelopment project, the Christina Gateway. The American Express Centurion Bank also moved its headquarters from near Newark to the Christina Gateway. **********All three benefited from the head-tax abatement, since any employer who creates at least 100 new positions in Wilmington gets a five-year break on the tax. **********As part of its deal, MBNA also insisted on a commitment by the city that it would move forward with the creation of a business improvement district, similar to those in Manhattan, Baltimore, Philadelphia and other cities. In such a district, property owners agree to assess themselves to pay for supplemental services like extra security, sanitation and marketing. The businesses in the district determine which extra services are necessary. Wilmington 2000 is now working to have the district in operation by this summer."

At this site and the 20 other sites of future stations, huge excavating machines are laying bare stratum after stratum of the many cultures that made Athens a fountainhead of civilization. **********""Here we are in the shadow of the Acropolis, digging five subway stations,"" said William G. Stead, the construction project's general manager, still awed by the thought after more than two years on the job. He referred to the stations being built within the confines of the ancient city, where the archeological finds are the richest. **********Mr. Stead works for an American company, Bechtel International, a consultant for the project. He is more aware than most engineers of the delicate nature of his job. He holds master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in transit engineering and in archeology. **********""I'm not only interested in archeology, I have a passion for it,"" he said in an interview. **********Much has been found to rouse archeological passions. Some finds were unexpected, while others confirmed accounts of Athens written through the ages. **********In front of Parliament, for instance, the digs laid bare a vast public bath of the Roman period that no ancient chronicler had described. The tops of the columns for its steam room, marvelously preserved, lay about two feet under the surface of Amalias Avenue, where the flow of heavy traffic never seems to cease. **********Surprisingly, said Olga Zachariadou, the Culture Ministry archeologist in charge of the site of the Syntagma Square station -- the main hub of the Metro system -- antiquities covered by the asphalt of streets lie closer to the surface than those in fields, where soil accumulates. While there has been some digging under Athens for utilities, there has been nothing before on this scale. **********Constantine Sarris, an archeologist working for Attiko Metro, the project's management company, guided a visitor along the side of the Syntagma excavation. First he pointed out several tall food-storage bins, resembling round stone wells, from the Byzantine era. **********Next came remains of a Roman aqueduct. Beyond, the archeologist showed traces of the dried-up bed of the Iridanos River, mentioned by Plato. Scattered around were tombs of the early Christian era. One yielded the skeleton of a dog, probably buried next to its master. Another contained toys -- terra cotta animals on bronze wheels, Mr. Stead said -- perhaps buried with children. **********An aqueduct from the fifth century B. C. lay near the riverbed. Next to the Roman baths were the remains of a workshop in which bronze statues were cast, probably for the cemetery.  Oil lamps featuring erotic paintings were found in the baths. **********The Culture Ministry is jealously guarding the discoveries for study before allowing the public to see them. Mr. Sarris said the subway excavations would provide grist for doctoral dissertations for years to come. **********So rich are the excavations, Ms. Zachariadou said, that had the Syntagma site been unearthed anywhere but in the center of a city it would never be covered over again. But with the subway tunnels being carved in the rock far below the discoveries, officials decided there was no way to preserve them. **********No one disputes the need for underground transportation in Athens, where prosperity and the resulting population and traffic growth have ruined what used to be the bluest of skies ""80 percent of the year,"" said Elisabeth Papazoi, deputy Environment Minister of Greece. **********Since the 1960's, about one-third of Greece's population has crowded into the capital, which now has at least 3.5 million inhabitants. In 1961, Athens had 39,000 cars. Today it has 1.4 million. Their exhaust gases produce a notorious smog that brings illness and deaths and is rapidly causing antiquities open to the air, like the Acropolis, to deteriorate. **********What the Metro excavations disclose, other than movable objects, is being painstakingly photographed, catalogued and described, then bulldozed for the subway stations. **********City officials see the Metro as essential to reducing traffic. The system is expected to carry 450,000 people a day into the city center and to reduce the number of cars going there by 250,000, Ms. Papazoi said. **********Mr. Stead's sympathies with his fellow archeologists' concerns are tempered by the fact that delays are costing about $600,000 a day. The subway is largely financed by the European Union, which helps finance infrastructure projects for some of its members. **********On this issue, his archeologist's tenderness gives way to the engineer's pragmatic approach. ""It's necessary for progress, so I just don't think of it,"" he said. ""It's like ripping pages out of a book."" But he emphasized that the pages were carefully recorded first. ""We're doing it right,"" Mr. Stead said. **********For some of the archeologists it is more painful. Mr. Sarris said that when demolition time comes, some of the older ones turn their heads, but ""some of our younger archeologists start crying."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/06/world/latest-killing-in-gaza-strip-adds-to-israelis-unease.html,Clyde Haberman,1994-09-06,,851,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Latest Killing in Gaza Strip Adds to Israelis' Unease,Latest Killing in Gaza Strip Adds to Israelis' Unease," **********The killing of an Israeli soldier in the Gaza Strip overnight reinforced for Israelis today that neither their Government nor the new Palestinian Authority has been able to stop recurring attacks by armed Palestinians opposed to peace talks. **********After the latest incident, a drive-by shooting that left one soldier dead and two others wounded, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin cautioned that violence -- and the failure of Palestinian leaders to stop it -- could endanger future negotiations on extending Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. **********The group called Islamic Holy War took responsibility for the shooting. In Gaza, senior Palestinian officials deplored the shooting and promised to chase the culprits and punish them. The police in Gaza said they had arrested a man who had been wounded in an exchange of gunfire during the ambush, but they did not say if charges would be brought against him.  Previous Warnings **********In the four months of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, Mr. Rabin has issued similar warnings about the peril to peace talks. By the same token, Yasir Arafat and other leaders of the Palestinian Authority have affirmed more than once their commitment to rein in Islamic militants. **********Yet for all the tough talk, there has been no end to shootings and knifings inside Israel and in the territories, including Gaza, where Israeli soldiers remain at the borders and around Jewish settlements despite their withdrawal from Arab towns and refugee camps. **********Hours before the Gaza shooting on Sunday, two Jews on their way to the Western Wall were stabbed in the back and moderately wounded as they entered the walled Old City of Jerusalem. Three nights earlier, two men said to belong to the militant group Hamas were blown up in the West Bank, apparently as they were trying to plant a car bomb. A few days before that, Hamas claimed responsibility for the fatal slashing of two Israeli workers at a construction site in Ramle, near Tel Aviv. **********Echoes of other violent acts reverberated in Jerusalem today when Israel announced that its security forces had arrested eight Hamas members suspected in connection with attacks that killed three Israeli civilians in the West Bank in May and July. Among those picked up was a brother of Jibril Rajub, the Palestinian Authority's security chief in Jericho. Frustration Over Violence **********From the start, Israeli leaders have warned that self-rule agreements reached with Mr. Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization did not mean that true peace had arrived. Nonetheless, their frustration over recurring violence has poked through the surface more insistently of late, propelled in part by opposition accusations that the Rabin Government has put Israeli lives in danger with its P.L.O. deal. **********Perhaps not surprisingly, some Israeli officials lay the blame squarely at Mr. Arafat's feet. **********They say they know who carried out the Ramle killings but have gotten nowhere in their demands that the Palestinian police in Gaza hand over the suspects. **********In mid-August, amid some fanfare, Palestinian security forces arrested 20 Islamic radicals after two roadside ambushes that killed one Israeli and wounded six others. More quietly, the militants were quickly released. **********None were believed to have actually pulled the trigger, leading to charges from some Israelis that it was all a public-relations move and complaints from Hamas leaders that they had been made scapegoats in an Arafat attempt to appease Israel. **********Maj. Gen. Uri Saguy, the Israeli Army's intelligence chief, said in an interview published today in the newspaper Haaretz: ""There are things that Arafat has done, and there are many things that he has done for appearances, but everything he has done is not sufficient. Only when he feels a political sword on his neck, or when an Israeli demands that he acts, does he take any measures."" **********Mr. Arafat's defenders say he must walk a political tightrope between asserting his authority and not coming down too hard on Hamas, a potent and popular force in Gaza. **********If so, Israel's leaders have their own balancing act, between demands for a get-tough policy and a perceived need, whatever the risks, to maintain a flow of Arab workers into Israel so that the Gazan economy does not implode. Conspicuously, Israel has not sealed off the territories after the latest killings, an action routinely taken in the past. Its police have rounded up hundreds of Palestinian laborers who entered Israel illegally, but the borders are open for the roughly 30,000 Gazans with legitimate work permits. **********Nor are Palestinian radicals Israel's only worry. **********A young army officer and at least three other Israelis were reported today to have been arrested on suspicion of organizing an armed group to attack Palestinians. Information was scarce because a judge prohibited the publication of details. But the officer, a resident of the West Bank settlement of Qiryat Arba, was reportedly suspected of selling army weapons to anti-Arab extremists with roots in the banned Kach and Kahane Chai movements."

It has been introduced by opponents of the Uruguay Round world trade pact, who seek to brand the agreement as a conspiracy by the political and business establishment against regular working people. **********Now that approval of the pact has been delayed in both houses of Congress for nearly two months, these acrimonious accusations are likely to get even more shrill. **********In the populist version, the heroes of the battle are average Americans struggling to make ends meet and protect their jobs in a rapidly changing world. The villains are foreigners out to undermine American interests, in league with a supposed ""elite"" inside the United States that disdains the needs and rights of the general population. **********The same kind of rhetoric was heard last month on a smaller scale after local supporters of a new Disney theme park in Virginia's horse country blamed ""fat cats"" and outsiders for the project's defeat - and the consequent loss of jobs. **********In the trade debate, the bitterness is apparent nationwide. The White House, both major political parties and the media are accused of conniving to sell out American sovereignty and export jobs to the Third World to swell the profits of multinational corporations. **********Just as the inhabitants of Virginia's Prince William County thought the decision on Disney should have been theirs alone, so the more isolationist Uruguay Round opponents believe that America should assert its ""rights"" regardless of the rest of the world. The level of debate has sunk pretty low. **********Supporters of the pact who appear on television call-in shows are immediately bombarded with insulting telephone calls on the air and deluged with hate mail afterwards. **********Some of this is the coordinated work of right-wing groups that may support former presidential candidates Ross Perot or Pat Buchanan. But it is difficult to gauge their real strength. **********Not all the pact's opponents are waging class warfare. Many have genuine, if exaggerated, fears that freer trade would diminish U.S. sovereignty and threaten the environment. Some, like Senator Ernest F. Hollings, who has single-handedly held up the pact in the Senate, are unabashed, old-fashioned protectionists. **********Astonishingly, there have been virtually no nationwide opinion polls on the Uruguay Round agreement since it was concluded in Geneva last December. The polls that have been taken show widespread ignorance of the subject. **********That ignorance is dangerous, because some pollsters believe it is easy to turn people into opponents of the pact by providing them with very little information - or in many cases misinformation. **********Conscious of these cross-currents, politicians have become increasingly nervous. One reason for this week's decision to delay a vote in the House of Representatives was the reluctance of many members to commit themselves to the pact so soon before the midterm elections. **********But it is likely that popular concern about freer trade will rise as the world economy becomes increasingly global, further fostering class antagonism. **********In the industrial countries, those most likely to benefit from the changes shaking the world economy, particularly the introduction of new technologies, will be the most highly educated. The losers will be the less skilled workers. **********The salary gap between Americans with and without college educations, which had been closing up to 1979, suddenly turned around and widened rapidly in the 1980s. **********So far, however, the Clinton administration has done a rotten job of calming these divisive anxieties - and of explaining the trade pact's vital importance. If the White House had played its political cards more skillfully, the pact would already be ratified. Now it's even more important to disarm the wagers of class warfare before they do worse damage."

They are also getting a law firm. **********The company's legal staff, with about 50 lawyers working on patents alone, generated $521 million in royalty payments last year through threats, lawsuits and negotiations, three times as much as in 1990. **********But some analysts on Wall Street now wonder how strongly those revenues will continue to gush. The company's shares fell $4.625 on the last day of August when a Japanese court ruled that Fujitsu Ltd. had not violated a basic Texas Instruments chip patent. Therefore, Fujitsu does not have to pay royalties on this patent. **********Although the company discounts the damage, investors are wary. Yesterday, Texas Instruments closed at $74.50, down $1.125. The stock reached a 52-week high of $89.50 in March. **********Under several patents, including the one at issue in the Fujitsu case, Texas Instruments has already collected hundreds of millions of dollars from the leading names in Japanese electronics, among them Matsushita, Mitsubishi and Toshiba.  After Fujitsu's victory, these companies may not be so willing to keep paying royalties after their current agreements with Texas Instruments expire, many of them within two years. **********Michael Gumport, a Lehman Brothers analyst, says that a royalty stream once worth $25 a share is now worth only $15 or $20. ""About a third of their royalties would be in jeopardy,"" he said. **********About 60 percent of the royalties of Texas Instruments, which he estimates will total more than $600 million this year, come from Japanese companies. And half of these payments -- or nearly $200 million -- cover the Japanese companies' sales in Japan. These are the revenues that Texas Instruments can no longer rely on, Mr. Gumport says. **********The company is cautious enough about its royalty revenues to exclude them from some of its financial plans and calculations. But they have been crucial to the company's recovery after Japanese competitors nearly squeezed it out of the semiconductor market in the late 1980's. **********Because the royalties are generated with relatively little added expense -- lawyers cost less than new chip plants -- they have become an important source of cash. **********Richard J. Agnich, the company's general counsel, said the royalties had allowed Texas Instruments to speed its research, development and capital spending and assured that the company would reap the deserved returns. **********American rivals have called Texas Instruments a bully, even as many adopt its legal strategy. But Texas Instruments has not been deterred. **********The company now has its own training and obedience program for pit bull patent lawyers.  Electrical engineers spend about five years working for Texas Instruments, then get a company-paid legal education, then return. But investors' worries about the payoffs from these efforts, at least in Japan, became another jolt during what had already been a bumpy summer. Shares of Texas Instruments fell more than six points on one day in July when the company announced record earnings but predicted somewhat slower growth in chip sales for the industry. **********""The stock tends to peak a year or two before its earnings peak,' said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst at Argus Research. ""And the Fujitsu announcement may have a significant impact down the road.' **********Others on Wall Street believe that the two sell-offs have merely created a good chance to buy. ""I think both of them were overdone,' said John Geraghty, a CS First Boston analyst. **********For its part, the company is appealing the Japanese verdict. Mr. Agnich, challenging some Wall Street predictions, expects Fujitsu and other Japanese companies to continue paying royalties under patents besides the one at issue in the Fujitsu case. **********Texas Instruments will start to find it easier to win and enforce patents as the Japanese, under pressure from the United States, revise their patent system, he says. To gain a basic chip patent in Japan, it took the company 29 years."

Another question, of concern to both Muslims and Serbs, was about the Clinton Administration: Would its willingness to go along with the air strikes, albeit under the NATO banner and with a limited goal of protecting the handful of United Nations observers in Gorazde, increase its future military involvement? Or would the raid instead accelerate negotiations for a cease-fire between Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government? **********[ In Washington after the air strike, President Clinton urged the Serbs to agree to a negotiated solution, and said the United States was prepared to use air power again if the United Nations and NATO asked for strikes as they had today. The Pentagon said the F-16's dropped three 500-pound gravity bombs. ] **********[ In Pale, Bosnia, the Bosnian Serb supreme military command issued a strong protest to the United Nations and accused it of taking sides against the Serbs in Bosnia's civil war, Reuters reported. The statement, from the office of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said that further cooperation with the United Nations peacekeeping force ""has been brought under question,"" and contacts with it ""have now been suspended."" It added: ""The peace process is endangered and the responsibility for this lies with the United Nations."" ] **********Ham radio operators in Gorazde, 30 miles southeast of Sarajevo, confirmed the attacks, which occurred at about 6:30 P.M. local time (12:30 P.M. Eastern time), as dusk fell, and the roar of jet planes flying over the town could clearly be heard over the airwaves. **********A local official and a doctor for an aid organization said tonight by ham radio that the Serbian shelling of Gorazde seemed to drop off after the attack. **********A Bosnian Serb general tonight accused the NATO jets of striking civilian targets. **********""NATO aircraft fired four missiles at civilian targets,"" Gen. Milan Gvero, a deputy commander in the Bosnian Serb army, asserted. He added that there were civilian casualties, but he offered no proof. **********United Nations officials said the two F-16C planes, based at the NATO base at Aviano, Italy, were on patrol over Bosnia when the order to attack came from NATO headquarters, which in turn had received a request from the United Nations. The planes were not hit and returned safely to base, United Nations and NATO officials said. The warplanes were visible from Gorazde as they made their bombing runs on the two targets. **********Gorazde is a largely Muslim city that the United Nations months ago ruled a ""safe area."" But in recent days, the Serbs seemed intent on forcing the 65,000 inhabitants to flee, which would set the stage for later Serbian occupation. **********The attack caused jubilation for the Muslim officials in Gorazde, who had almost given up hope. **********""The situation in the town is very calm right now,"" Dr. Olivier Van Bunnen of the group Doctors Without Borders, said, adding that the Serbian shelling had ceased at about 8 P.M. local time. **********Asked to describe the atmosphere in the town of Gorazde after the attack, Dr. Van Bunnen said: ""We could really see the difference in the morale of the population. Everybody was again smiling and was happy to hear this information."" **********The bombing came as the credibility of the United Nations was being severely tested. A Weekend Warning **********For days, United Nations officials here were playing down the Serbian attacks on Gorazde. As late as Saturday night, the commander of the United Nations military force in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, expressed confidence that the Serbs advancing in the Gorazde area would never attack the town itself. But even as General Rose was expressing relative equanimity, he was in contact with officials of the United Nations to authorize possible air strikes. On Saturday, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned that air strikes would be ordered if the Serbs did not stop their offensive. **********Today, instead of slowing their attack, the Serbs stepped up the fighting and shelling. Thousands of panicking Muslims fled their homes in Gorazde while the Serbs pummeled heavily populated areas with the fiercest shelling the town had endured during the entire war, United Nations and Bosnian Government officials said. Reports of Despair **********""Countless howitzer rounds are falling all around the city center and into the south suburbs,"" said a report by United Nations refugee relief officials in the Gorazde pocket. ""The population are either frantic or giving up all hope."" **********""The Bosnian Serb army are advancing on the town visible from our office,"" the United Nations report said. **********""I'm afraid it is on the verge of over for Gorazde,"" said a second report, filed this afternoon, from the Gorazde office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""People are fleeing everywhere and security is at this point the only concern we have now."" **********This afternoon's report said Serbian snipers were firing on United Nations military observers watching the attack from the refugee-relief agency's office in the town. 'Fed Up With Bullies' **********At 4:30 P.M. local time, General Rose made his formal request for the bombing assistance, United Nations officials here said. The United Nations special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, gave his assent 25 minutes later, and the raid was approved at 5 P.M. by the United Nations air operations control unit in Sarajevo. At 5:15 P.M., Adm. Leighton Smith Jr., the chief of allied forces for Southern Europe, approved the air strikes, and the attack began at 6:22 p.m. **********""I think everyone sooner or later gets fed up with bullies,"" said Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, moments after the attack was confirmed by the ham radio operators speaking from Gorazde. ""The United Nations' credibility was on the line completely."" **********""This decision brings back the credibility of the international community as a whole, and especially the United Nations,"" Mr. Silajdzic said. **********Mr. Silajdzic and Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, learned of the decision for air strikes at a meeting late this afternoon with the United States' special envoy, Charles Redman.  Exclusion Zone Sought **********Mr. Silajdzic said he told Mr. Redman tonight that the Bosnian Government would demand creation of an exclusion zone, having a radius of 12.2 miles from the center of Gorazde, from which all Serbian armed forces would have to be removed. **********""We are ready to continue talks as soon as the withdrawal of the aggressors' forces from the exclusion zone,"" Mr. Silajdzic said. **********A similar exclusion zone was established around Sarajevo in late February, when NATO issued an ultimatum demanding that the Serbs withdraw all of their heavy artillery from this area or face air strikes. **********""I think the Serbs' attack on the civilian targets was crucial, especially after repeated warnings and repeated Serbian assurances that they would stop,"" Mr. Silajdzic said tonight. He added that he was not surprised that the air strike was ordered. **********More than 100 people have been killed and 500 wounded in the latest Serbian offensive against Gorazde, which began 13 days ago. In that time, the Serbs have occupied most of the eastern bank of the Drina River, burning at least 19 villages and reaching the outskirts of the town of Gorazde itself. A Coveted District **********This is the third coordinated Serbian attempt to take over the Gorazde pocket since the Bosnian war began two years ago. The Serbs clearly covet Gorazde because it lies along the main highway linking Serbia's capital, Belgrade, with the Adriatic Coast. It also links Belgrade with nearby districts of Bosnia and Herzegovina that the Serbs seized, and from which they drove out the Muslims, early in the war. **********Reports last week by United Nations military observers in the Gorazde pocket said a major Serbian infantry push into the town was not expected until after a piece of strategic high ground, known as Gradina, fell into Serbian hands. The Serbs captured Gradina on Saturday, overcoming formidable Bosnian Army forces said to be entrenched there. **********Gorazde first came under attack by nationalist Serbs campaigning to ethnically cleanse the Drina River Valley in the late spring of 1992. The Serbs lifted their initial attack weeks later, after coming under intense international pressure. **********For months, the Serbs refused to allow aid convoys into the pocket, where the population swelled to 65,000 people after the arrival of some 40,000 Muslim refugees driven from their homes in other parts of the country. About 20,000 of the area's original inhabitants fled early in the war. **********The only connection Gorazde had with the outside world for most of 1992, and into 1993, was over a mountain track, much of it through mine fields and exposed to Serbian sniper fire. **********The second sustained Serbian attack came in May 1993, when Gorazde was finally cut off from the rest of Bosnian Government-controlled territory. The Serbs have never allowed the United Nations to deploy a full contingent of peacekeepers in the Gorazde pocket, even though the United Nations Security Council declared Gorazde a ""safe area"" last spring. The United Nations has 15 military observers presently in the pocket, 11 of whom were allowed by the Serbs to enter last week.

After years of losses, of management travail and doubts about the wisdom of the earthbound company's forays into satellite communications, Winnebago s...",789,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Winnebago Rebounds From Losses,Winnebago Rebounds From Losses," **********Winnebago Industries, the most recognizable name in the recreational vehicle industry, is back. **********After years of losses, of management travail and doubts about the wisdom of the earthbound company's forays into satellite communications, Winnebago says it is back on track. **********After four consecutive years of losses totaling $62.4 million, Winnebago, which is based in Forest City, Iowa, earned $9.2 million last year . And in the first six months of the current fiscal year, which began last September, revenues rose 26.5 percent.Economic Cycles **********The recreation vehicle industry is notoriously dependent on national economic cycles, but Winnebago is doing more than just keeping pace as the economy gains speed, according to Robert J. Evans, an analyst at John G. Kinnard & Company of Minneapolis. ""Theirs is now a story about regaining market share and earnings growth,"" he said. **********Industrywide recreational vehicle sales for 1993 rose 8.4 percent, according to Statistical Surveys Inc., an independent market research firm in Grand Rapids, Mich. Winnebago, the second-largest manufacturer, did even better. Its unit sales in 1993 rose 20.8 percent, to 7,242, and its market share climbed to 17.1 percent from 15.2 percent. The industry leader, Fleetwood Enterprises of Riverside, Calif., slipped to 32.3 percent, from 34.1 percent in 1992. **********In the current quarter Winnebago has begun producing three new models, and the company expects to raise its output this year to 9,000 recreational vehicles, an increase of 24 percent.Auto Racing **********To increase sales, Winnebago is looking at new markets, most notably automobile racing fans. ""We're appealing to a younger segment of the market"" with automobile racing, said Winnebago's president and chief executive, Fred G. Dohrmann. **********Automobile racing is the largest spectator sport in the country, and the sport's fans are regarded as loyal buyers of products that sponsor drivers and their cars. Winnebago has been named the official motor home of the National Association of Stock Car Racing, or Nascar. **********Winnebago is also looking at overseas markets, particularly Europe, where the company has established a distribution subsidiary. The European market will ""equal or exceed the U.S. market when the recession there is over,"" Jerome V. Clouse, vice president and treasurer, said. Within three years Winnebago expects 15 percent of its sales to come from overseas, up from a bit more than 5 percent now. **********For Mr. Dohrmann, 61, a critical part of Winnebago's resurgence involves the quality of its vehicles. A former worker on Winnebago's production line before climbing to the executive office, Mr. Dohrmann is attempting to correct an ill-fated excursion into ""just in time"" production schedules. Such scheduling, much in vogue among manufacturing companies, was intended to deliver vehicles to dealers' lots just as consumer demand for each model was peaking. It did not work well for Winnebago. **********For several years, Winnebago's production was minimal when demand was slack in the fall and winter. As demand increased in the spring and summer, Winnebago added work shifts and put assembly line workers on overtime.Manufacturing Defects **********The result: vehicles filled with manufacturing defects. Parts were missing. Water leaked through window and door moldings. Scratched cabinets and appliances were installed. ""Once the people started working 10 hours, 11 hours a day every day of the week and it went on for months, in a family environment that didn't settle well,"" Mr. Clouse, Winnebago's treasurer, said. **********Winnebago's warranty costs rose to cover the defects, and the company's relationship with dealers, who had to calm frustrated customers, deteriorated. Some dealers, like RV Depot in Miami, the recreational vehicle sales division of Cruise America, the country's largest sales and rental company for such vehicles, stopped selling Winnebagoes. **********To solve the manufacturing problems, Mr. Dohrmann evened out production schedules. And he automated the assembly line. Last year Winnebago's warranty costs were reduced by more than $2 million, which went straight to the company's bottom line. **********Last December Mr. Dohrmann was named chief executive. He became the fourth person to hold the title in the last decade. None of the former chief executives was able to live up to the expectations of John K. Hanson, Winnebago's mercurial chairman, a former mortician who owns 47 percent of Winnebago's shares. **********The list of those dismissed includes some family members. Mr. Hanson's son, John, was one of the chief executives who were let go. And last month Gregory M. Boman, Mr. Hanson's grandson, was dismissed as vice president of sales and marketing."

Johnson, said the negotiations could resume as early as Friday. **********In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher described the talks as ""productive, useful, businesslike."" And he emphasized that Mr. Alarcon's decision to return to Havana ""is not by any means a breakdown in the talks but it's part of the useful talks that are taking place."" **********In Madrid, Cuba's Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, also expressed cautious optimism that an agreement might be possible, telling journalists, ""I think we have not yet exhausted all the talks' possibilities."" **********""Such a dispute cannot be solved in a few days and I think we will arrive at a reconciliation,"" he added. Position Called Moderate **********Members of a group of Latin American representatives to the United Nations who met privately with Mr. Alarcon here last night described his position as moderate and said he told them not to be surprised if, despite all the difficulties, there was an agreement within a few days. **********However, American officials conceded that ""substantial differences"" remained between the two sides, suggesting that after six days of talks here Mr. Alarcon, a former Cuban Foreign Minister and United Nations representative, felt the need to consult with President Fidel Castro directly. **********As usual neither side provided any information about the substance of the discussions, which today took place in the United States Mission to the United Nations after two days of meetings in the Cuban mission and lasted barely 45 minutes. **********But while the United States has offered to expand legal immigration from Cuba in return for Havana's halting the deluge of boat people sailing for Florida, the Cuban Government wants any refugee accord linked to an easing of the 32-year American trade embargo against the island, arguing that the poverty this causes forces people to flee. **********So far, the Clinton Administration has insisted that the negotiators confine themselves to immigration issues, although this leaves the United States team with relatively little bargaining leverage. An Offer by the U.S. **********Initially, the Administration, which under a 1984 agreement can admit up to 27,000 Cuban immigrants annually but has been accepting only 2,000 or 3,000 in recent years, offered to raise this number to 20,000 if Havana clamped down on the boat people. **********Cuba replied that since the United States ought by now to have issued over 100,000 more refugee visas than it has it should first agree to catch up with the target set in 1984. **********The United States then said its earlier offer of 20,000 visas was ""flexible"" and could be raised to around 27,000 a year. **********Cuba also suggested that the United States set a date for discussing the economic embargo and consider reversing the new restrictions President Clinton imposed this summer when he made it harder for American Cubans to send money to relatives on the island or to make visits there. **********h"

But ""through self-examination and self-renovation we can improve NHK's image,"" he said, referring to the broadcaster's organization and its employees. **********To NHK's staff, the message, largely devoid of specifics, was about as riveting as last year's news. In fact, 83 percent of NHK's employees say the broadcaster is behind the times, with 92 percent in favor of change, a recent survey found. **********There is a growing sense of frustration at NHK, one as deep as the broadcaster's unrealized potential. After all, NHK ought to rank among the world's most influential radio and TV networks. Its annual budget, drawn largely from voluntary user fees, is a staggering $5.67 billion. Its 13,260 employees run four national TV channels, three domestic radio networks and a shortwave radio service. Its immense technical labs coordinated development of the world's first high-definition television system, which went on the air in 1991. **********Yet NHK's presence in international broadcasting pales in comparison with the British Broadcasting Corp., a rival whose size and operating structure is most similar to NHK, or the Cable News Network, which began just 14 years ago. Despite its unmatched resources and a network of 27 foreign news bureaus that stretch from Vladivostok to Rio de Janeiro, NHK appears to be retreating from international broadcasting just as the BBC, CNN and other news organizations are making inroads in the region. **********NHK is among Japan's most powerful institutions, offering a quasi-official voice for news and extending its reach through cultural activities into hundreds of communities. But long-term, the home front presents a potentially bigger challenge than that faced overseas: cable and multimedia alternatives to broadcast television are spreading, portending a degree of competition the network has never had to contend with. **********The trend threatens to erode NHK's financial base as viewers question whether they wish to continue making voluntary donations that now range as high as $23 per month. **********""In an era with 100 channels, NHK will just be one of them,"" said Ken Soga, an executive managing director. ""The big problem will be getting people to pay."" **********There is talk of privatizing NHK, scrambling the signal to force subscribers to pay, or spinning off its news division. Nothing has been decided, and little is clear about NHK's direction, except that the current set up with no commercials, no direct government subsidies and no fine for viewers who do not pay fees will not last. **********The situation that is found at NHK resembles that of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. or Japan Airlines. With their positions protected by the government, all developed into huge, inefficient organizations with close government ties. But whereas NTT and JAL were privatized in the mid-1980s and have begun to restructure, NHK remains a public entity, poorly structured to deal with changing technologies and unbridled competition. **********""Public broadcasting is on the way out,"" said Keiji Shima, a former NHK chairman who quit under pressure in 1991. ""The outlook for NHK is not bright."" **********NHK's organizational obstacles are clearest in the network's retreat from the booming international broadcasting arena. Mr. Shima, acting on a widely felt resentment that the global media is dominated by Western concerns, with Western biases, tried to make NHK a player. His vision was the Global News Network, a 24-hour service to which ABC, BBC and NHK would each supply 8 hours of daily programming centering on their parts of the world. **********Aiming to shake up NHK's slow-paced news style, which is long on detail and short on analysis, he took the bold move of hiring foreign journalists to produce programming in English for broadcasts at home and abroad. **********Soon after Mr. Shima's departure, though, Mr. Kawaguchi proclaimed GNN commercially unviable. The editorial role of foreign journalists, which was never fully accepted, has diminished. From October, their influence will be all but over as the main outlet for their work, the show Japan Business Today, goes off the air. **********""Their goal was to eliminate foreign editorial input into NHK programs as quickly and decisively as possible,"" a member of the foreign staff said. **********Paradoxically, the changes come just as the Japanese parliament has revised the broadcast law to allow NHK to sell its programs directly overseas beginning in April. In theory, that would allow NHK to challenge competitors that are operating, or planning, pan-Asian news services. These include the BBC, which runs a 24-hour Asian news service, parts of which are translated into Japanese for local viewers; CNN, the Australia Broadcasting Corp., Dow Jones & Co., and Bloomberg L.P. **********NHK, however, is interpreting the new law not so much as a chance to expand its regional presence as an obligation to refocus its international broadcasting to the needs of 700,000 nationals who reside permanently abroad and the 13 million who visit foreign countries each year. **********Mr. Soga said the main reason for scaling back Mr. Shima's international agenda was that foreign partners were lukewarm to the GNN concept. That makes it unviable because NHK cannot afford to go it alone. **********Unlike its Western rivals, he said, NHK faces a formidable language barrier. Few people outside Japan speak Japanese and translating into English or other languages is a costly, laborious process. Moreover, the legacy of Japan's wartime atrocities has made its neighbors uneasy about an invasion of Japanese television. **********Sensitivity to its neighbors, though, has also put the credibility of NHK's news, and the viability of an international service, into question. Critics charge that the network is soft on issues such as the Tiananmen incident, East Timor or anything else that would offend China, Indonesia or other neighbors."

The company would not disclose how the new additives worked. Additives are chemical compounds put into gasoline to help control the combustion of fuel and to dissolve deposits that foul fuel injection valves and combustion chambers. **********The auto industry, which has yet to evaluate Texaco's new gasoline, had been prodding the oil industry to come up with gasolines that help reduce the deposits and keep engines operating more efficiently. **********""I didn't think it was going to happen,"" David E. Cole, the director of the Center for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan, said yesterday. Cleaner Combustion Chambers **********Mr. Cole, who was hired by Texaco to evaluate its tests of the new fuel, said one of the most difficult problems was to find a way to clean up deposits in an engine's combustion chamber. He and his staff at the university had worked for years on the problem. **********He said the data submitted by Texaco showed that the new additives significantly reduced deposits in the combustion chamber, which means that cars can run smoother, more efficiently and with less emissions. **********Allen J. Krowe, the vice chairman and chief financial officer of Texaco, said the company would charge a premium for its new gasolines when they are offered at its 14,000 stations nationwide on March 1. He did not say how much the premium would be. **********Texaco's old brands will be discontinued and the new gasoline will be sold in all the main octane levels. **********John D. Hervey, the oil analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said he doubted that Texaco, which plans a big marketing effort including television commercials, could gain market share with the new gasoline. Texaco has about 7 percent of the market. **********He said most customers shopped for gasoline by first looking at price, then at convenience and then at brand names.

Tea? All the bananas you can eat? **********Northwest Airlines has scrapped its traditional meal service and now offers a moving buffet on most flights. The passengers on a morning flight, for example, can take as many bananas, bagels or sandwiches as they want. **********The buffet is one of many ways in which airlines are experimenting as never before with new kinds of services that just might help to fill empty seats and improve upon a long streak of losses. Other recent innovations include a bathroom for women only (on Midway Airlines), private showers in the arrival lounge (American Airlines and British Airways), and the boarding of passengers not from the back of the planes to the front, but beginning with the people with window seats (United Airlines). **********To be sure, airlines have long competed on service. Carriers used to boast about the size of the steaks they served, offer draft beer from kegs and mixed drinks at on-board piano bars and supply berths in which travelers could sleep on long flights. But flying is no longer exclusively for the well-to-do, and the range of services has widened to meet the needs of all levels of passengers, who board United States airlines almost 500 million times a year. **********Not everyone appreciates the efforts of the airlines. Mona Doyle, president of Consumer Network Inc. in Philadelphia, which surveys about 5,000 consumers a year for their opinions on retail service, said a growing number of people had been using airline service as a reference point for describing the way retail service in general had deteriorated. **********""The disgruntlement with the personal treatment on airlines is much higher than I've ever heard it before,"" she said. ""It ranks up there with the price of cereal."" **********The pace and breadth of the changes in so many aspects of air travel are seen by industry experts as perhaps the most visible evidence of the impact of deregulation 16 years ago, which has created relentless competitive pressures on carriers and sent them on sometimes desperate searches to find a combination of amenities that will appeal to passengers and earn a profit. **********That goal has proved elusive, as attested by the United States airline industry's $12.8 billion in losses during the last four years. **********In rethinking their service, some carriers are pushing the high end of service even higher. This spring, Japan Airlines installed an electronic massage chair for the first-class passengers on its longest flights. United upgraded its first-class menu last year to include Dom Perignon champagne and beluga caviar. **********Last month MGM Grand Air, based in Los Angeles, started offering its so-called Grand Class on flights between New York, Las Vegas, Nev., and Los Angeles. Like a throwback to service in the era of regulation, MGM Grand Air installed only 34 seats on its Boeing 727 planes, instead of the more typical configuration with 156 seats. **********The meals are cooked on board, rather than in catering kitchens near the airport, and each plane has four meeting rooms. A round-trip ticket between New York and Los Angeles costs $2,846, the same fare charged by other airlines for a first-class ticket on the route. **********Other carriers are trying a different tack, moving to meet the demand by passengers for low fares. Companies like Continental Airlines do not serve meals on short flights, just peanuts or pretzels, and then boast of the changes on the so-called Peanuts Fares flights as a ""less is more"" bonus to passengers: ""It's one of the little things that Continental Airlines is doing to provide you even more airline for your money,"" reads a brochure placed in the backs of seats. **********Sensing a marketing opportunity, Midway Airlines this year offered ""No-Peanuts Fares,"" bragging that by not serving peanuts, the airline was saving passengers 13 cents each on their fares. **********Continental also decided recently to describe the food service on all its domestic flights -- but not on transcontinental trips -- as snacks, rather than meals. That way, the airline said, passengers would be pleasantly surprised when they got something approaching a full meal, like a sandwich and salad, on some routes. **********The airline said it hoped passengers would also not be disappointed when they were offered only peanuts and pretzels on other routes. **********Delta Air Lines recently started reducing the number of flight attendants on some flights to three, from four. But the airline contends that customers have said the service is as good or better because the flight attendants appear busier. **********Airlines are also adding new classes of service and changing decades-old practices. Last month, for example, USAir said it would soon offer a new ""Business Select"" service providing bigger seats and extra amenities to travelers who pay full fares for a coach seat. **********Midway is redesigning each of its planes, so that eventually one bathroom will be exclusively for women.  The revamped bathrooms will be lighter and airier in appearance, the airline said, and will have carpeting and a hand lotion dispenser. **********Southwest Airlines and Delta are testing ""ticketless"" systems. Delta announced this month that it would begin testing a system using a credit card with a computer chip that frequent travelers on its shuttle service would use at the gate before a flight. **********When the card is inserted into an electronic reader, a reservation is made, the flight is charged to the passenger's credit card and a receipt is printed. In the future, the transaction may be done without the need of a gate agent, Delta said. **********This month, United started a new method for boarding passengers on short flights in California. Rather than boarding passengers from the rear of the cabin forward, as is usual, United boards its customers in six waves, beginning with the passengers with window seats on each side of the plane, then those in the middle seats, followed by those in the aisle seats. United said the procedure was faster than others. **********Many passengers are not impressed with all the experimentation. George Brakeley, a consultant on fund raising for nonprofit organizations who has flown about 70 round trips a year for the last 12 years, said there was no doubt that service had worsened in coach class. **********""There has been a slow and insidious decline across the board,"" said Mr. Brakeley, who is based in Stamford, Conn. ""What they are now presenting as dinner is laughable. I can't tell the airlines apart any more."" **********Annual surveys of 90,000 travelers by Plog Research Inc. in Reseda, Calif., suggest that there is a much more modest decline in the way passengers see airline service. In their overall evaluation of their flights, passengers in 1990 gave their trips, on average, a rating of 3.14 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 representing ""excellent."" That has since declined by only 1.3 percent, to 3.10 last year. **********Whether airlines are spending their money wisely on in-flight amenities is unclear. In a survey of business travelers by J. D. Power & Associates, frequent travelers ranked in-flight service as the sixth-most-important consideration in gauging their satisfaction with long flights. They said on-time performance, the planes' interiors, the ability to reserve the seats they wanted, the comfort of their seats, and schedules and ticketing procedures were more important. **********On short flights, however, amenities like food did not play any part in their overall satisfaction with their trips, the J. D. Power survey said. But in other surveys many passengers have said they should be served in-flight meals if the flights occur during meal times, regardless of the length of the trip. **********Industry experts attributed the discrepancies among the surveys in part to the different ways in which the questions were posed. **********Airlines, however, cannot afford to ignore those shifting opinions. Even though price, schedules and frequent-flier miles are more important considerations than service for most passengers, a few extra passengers who might be wooed by a hot shower or better champagne can make the difference between a profitable and an unprofitable flight. **********Donald C. Burr, the founder of People Express, said he believed that travelers in recent years had found many innovations in service unsettling, just as his passengers did in the mid-1980's, when they were asked to pay for coffee and their ticket once they were on board. ""For people who want orderliness in their travel, it just adds stress,"" he said. **********Mr. Burr said that despite the added stress from the service changes at so many airlines, travelers would eventually applaud them. **********""Air travel will become more routinized,"" he said. **********""Maybe."""

""Don't throw it away."" **********Across the mall, members of a rival group distributed lapel pins with the slogan ""No to the E.U."" Among the piles of booklets and bulletins stacked on a table was one illustrated with a cartoon, showing a leering European whale preparing to swallow a tiny Swedish fish. **********In towns and villages across the country, voters will cast ballots on Sunday in a national referendum on whether Sweden should forsake its neutrality and join the European Union in pursuing common economic and political ambitions. **********Public opinion polls suggest that Sweden's 6.5 million voters are having a hard time making up their minds. While voter surveys show those who are opposed to membership slightly ahead of those in favor, experts say the outcome is too close to predict. At least one in four voters acknowledge that they do not know which way they will cast their ballot. **********Political leaders in Sweden have promised that they will abide by the outcome of Sunday's national ballot. Legally, it is Sweden's Parliament that will finally decide whether the country joins the European Union. Voters in Finland and Austria decided to join this year, and membership would rise from 12 to 16 in January if there is also agreement from Sweden and Norway, which has scheduled a referendum for Nov. 28. **********Voters in Norway narrowly rejected membership in 1973, when they were last asked. Much of the opposition then, as now, was centered in the small farming and fishing communities that fear membership will mean an end to economic subsidies. **********Recent public opinion polls suggest that voters in Norway, rich in natural gas and fish, still do not see the advantages in joining the union and are the most likely among the Nordic countries to reject the idea. **********In Sweden, the ballot comes during a period of self-doubt, aggravated by an economic collapse that not only has driven record numbers of people out of work but has also forced cutbacks in welfare benefits. **********Even now, Sweden is hobbled by one of the highest national debts among industrialized nations, 83 percent of gross domestic product, as the Government of Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson tries to cut spending, increase revenue and restore some stability to financial markets. **********Mr. Carlsson regained office only in September, when his Social Democrats defeated the conservative Government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt. Among other things, voters looked to Mr. Carlsson and his party, the architects of Sweden's generous welfare state, to help restore some of the cutbacks that were imposed under Mr. Bildt. **********But Mr. Carlsson, who was Prime Minister from 1986 to 1991, has instead been preaching the need for further trims, coupled with tax increases, if Sweden's economy is going to recover. Earlier this week, campaigning on behalf of the European Union referendum, he warned that a no vote would almost certainly hinder an economic recovery. **********With the specter of higher interest rates and falling stock prices, Mr. Carlsson has said the Government would have to enforce tougher cutbacks on public spending if Sweden refused to join the Europe Union. **********The larger problem for Mr. Carlsson is that his own party, the country's largest, is split down on the middle over Europe, with many leftists and environmentalists strongly opposed to joining. **********On the campaign trail in Haninge, Margot Wallstrom, the Culture Minister, said she could feel the uncertainty among voters.""I can see it in their body language, especially among the women,"" Mrs. Wallstrom said.

And Calvin Klein and Donna Karan are familiar fixtures in the outdoor galaxy, as are Benetton, Bijan and the Gap. **********But what began in the late 80's as a bicoastal phenomenon is becoming a national movement, as fashion brands and retailers of all stripes turn to billboard and bus advertising in smaller markets from Boston to Seattle to avoid the clutter in magazines. **********Fashion's taste for ""out of home"" advertising -- on billboards, on posters in transit stations and on the sides of buses, phone kiosks, skyscrapers, and construction sites -- has become so great, in fact, that last year, for the first time, the retail industry spent more on outdoor advertising -- $152 million -- than tobacco marketers. And the total was double that of the year before, according to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. That does not include spending on transit advertising, the fasting-growing segment of the industry. **********Tommy Hilfiger, the men's wear designer, is perhaps the most-talked- about new presence, putting up an underwear billboard in Times Square in the space that Jockey occupied for several years, a block from the Calvin Klein ad that he seems to be mimicking. Tommy Hilfiger is also on buses in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, and is soon to be on billboards in Boston and Salt Lake City. **********Even Vogue magazine, a leading arbiter of fashion, has acknowledged its rival medium. Currently on buses and phone kiosks in New York, and coming in the next two weeks on a billboard on fashionable Sunset Boulevard, is a new Vogue campaign called ""See You in September"" that uses 11 designers, including Gianni Versace and Karl Lagerfeld, to promote the fall fashion issue. **********While not a first for a women's magazine, it is a first for Vogue. ""Outdoor is not killer expensive and you can really target your audience,"" said Ronald A. Galotti, the publisher. ""We cherry-picked our buses to get certain routes in Manhattan."" **********Neil Kraft, senior vice president of creative services at Calvin Klein, said, ""As people get busier and busier and read less, you have to spend a bigger percentage of your budget on an unavoidable medium like billboard."" . **********Outdoors' popularity has cut into the business of secondary women's magazines, some advertisers say. Ad pages at both Mademoiselle and W, for instance, were significantly depressed last year, though no one can say how much of that may have been a result of the appeal of outdoor. **********But the trend has definitely made desirable outdoor space harder to find -- and restrictive zoning laws do not help -- driving companies that lease billboards into the fast-growing transit market, and in at least one case, into developing new outlets overseas. **********""DKNY and Calvin are buying huge schedules for two or more years in New York, making it difficult to break into the market,"" said Kerri Farley, director of advertising at Bijan Fragrances Inc. in Beverly Hills. ""Good space is really hard to get."" Bijan has advertised outdoors, mainly in the Los Angeles area, since 1987 and is now looking for space in New York. **********Even Calvin Klein complains about the lack of vacancies. ""You can't get a bus; Tommy has them all,"" said Mr. Kraft, referring to the designer's huge purchase of transit advertising this summer. **********While people in the industry say Nike's campaign during the 1984 Olympics here, featuring Michael Jordan, awoke the advertising world to the power of the billboard, most credit Calvin Klein with showing them how to use it as street art. Hoisting the underwear-clad torso of Marky Mark in Times Square two years ago on the same wall where the designer plastered Patti Hansen and Brooke Shields in jeans in the late 70's created such a controversy, and brought so much attention to Calvin Klein, that the company soon was devoting to the outdoors a third of what was estimated to be a $12 million advertising budget. **********There is a groundswell of newcomers, most spending less than one-quarter of their media budgets on the medium. Hugo Boss will make its billboard debut in August at the Queensboro Bridge in New York on a poster that used to be Donna Karan's. Arrow shirts has ""mobile murals"" in New York -- buses painted over with ads, even the windows. Danskin and Barneys New York are also new to the scene this year, and Woolrich and Hot Sox are thinking of getting in. And at least one big cosmetics company is expected to sign on by the end of the year, according to an executive at Gannett Outdoor Network, one of the biggest billboard companies in the country. **********Some fashion advertisers like Rampage, a Los Angeles apparel company, have built their brands almost exclusively outdoors because it gives a big bang for the buck. An industry rule of thumb is that it costs a little more than $1 to reach 1,000 people, compared with more than $3 for radio or newspaper, and more than $7.50 for television. In the high-priced New York market, it costs as much as $20,000 a month to lease a billboard, about half as much a a page in a top fashion magazine. Reinforcing a Message **********Most fashion advertisers use the outdoor medium to reinforce print and broadcast messages, for introducing products, or to reach audiences that may not be well served by other approaches. When Levi Strauss reintroduced women's jeans three years ago, it spent two-thirds of its budget outdoors, though generally it channels only 5 percent of its spending to outdoor media, said Art Neumann, vice president at Foote, Cone & Belding, Levi's agency. This year, Levis is using outdoors to reach the young men that buy Levi Silvertabs in New York. ""We buy phone kiosks and bus shelters outside hip clubs,"" Mr. Neumann said. ""It's hard to reach a young male audience other than through TV, which is expensive."" **********The outdoor advertising companies use computers to pinpoint demographics. Computer-painted vinyl panels, which are replacing hand painting, also attract fashion advertising because they allow the same image in Minneapolis as New York. **********Another factor driving use of the medium by fashion advertisers is that desirable locations suddenly became available as tobacco marketers retreated from one of the last places they could advertise, because of advertising bans, public pressures and tight profit margins. While tobacco companies purchased about 40 percent of all outdoor advertising five years ago, their share shriveled to about 6 percent last year, according to the Outdoor Advertising Association. Making Up the Difference **********Retailers and designers -- the Neiman Marcuses, Home Depots and Tommy Hilfigers of the world -- have more than made up the difference. Last year, advertisers spent $1.6 billion on billboards, up about 6 percent from the year before, not including transit. **********Fashion has been critical to outdoor companies in developing nontraditional outdoor locations like phone kiosks, buses, shelters and rail lines. It has become so hot, in fact, that companies like Patrick Media -- which owns 39,998 billboards nationwide -- are buying regional transit leasing outlets to fill out their product mixes. **********With so many outlets, the trick for the fashion industry now is to keep it fresh. Instead of relying only on a sign to announce the opening of his store on Sunset Boulevard, Kenneth Cole used billboards on top of the store, featuring the shoe designer's one-liners to herald his arrival. On Interstate 405 here, Bijan used an oversized board to introduce its D.N.A. fragrance and added a neon logo in June, so as not to be one-upped by the auto makers who dominate the strips and had done the same. **********And look for more American designers on posters abroad. TDI, which specializes in transit advertising, with contracts in 40 cities, won rights this month to put up posters in 262 bus stations and 4,000 subway cars in a privatization effort by the London Transit Authority. **********The Gap is already there."

And they came just as Federal bank regulators and Congress are debating how to provide adequate protection for the growing number of consumers who are buying these securities at their local banks instead of through traditional brokers or mutual fund companies. **********The findings found this ignorance among those who have actually bought mutual funds at banks and been carefully warned, as well as among bank customers in general. Similarly, last November the Securities and Exchange Commission found that more than 60 percent of those buying money market mutual funds through banks mistakenly thought they were federally insured. Warnings Are Given **********In yesterday's survey, nearly 90 percent of those who bought mutual fund shares through banks said they had been warned that unlike traditional bank deposits these funds could fall in value and that the customer bore all the risk. Despite this disclosure, nearly half of this group still believed that the Government would cover any losses. **********""Consumers are flat-out confused,"" said Chris Lewis, director of banking policy for the Consumer Federation of America, one of the groups behind the survey. ""Consumers place an almost religious faith in banks."" **********The other groups were the North American Securities Administrators Association and the American Association of Retired Persons. The survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates, sampled 1,000 adults who made the financial decisions for their house and who regularly used a commercial bank. **********Nearly $175 billion, or about 12 percent of all mutual fund assets, were sold through banks, according to the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade group. More than one-third of all mutual funds are available at banks. Group Proposes Changes **********In issuing the data, the group also called for a number of changes that were quickly attacked by the banking industry. The group called for ""simple English"" disclosures of risk, a ban on the use of a bank's name or logo on mutual fund products, a prohibition against fund sales in bank lobbies or near deposit-taking activities and greater Government oversight. **********James McLaughlin, a lawyer for the American Banking Association, said that while his group felt that more effective warnings were warranted, he opposed any ban on using the bank's name or lobby, which, he said, would undermine bank marketing and sales efforts. **********""Why should we be discriminated against?"" he asked, noting by contrast, that Merrill Lynch and American Express could use their name on products. ""But what's far worse,"" he added, ""is the prohibition of sales in bank lobbies. This makes it less convenient for our customers."" **********Federal banking regulators are to issue new regulations in early February to address these issues. And the S.E.C. is conducting consumer focus groups on the issue. Congress is expected to hold hearings shortly, and legislation is expected. **********""These surveys suggest that there is a fair amount of confusion over whether these products are Government-insured,"" said Barry Barbash, the S.E.C.'s mutual fund director. ""And we have concerns. But what the answer is, is less clear."""

On Thursday, the Labor Department said the Producer Price Index had risen a stronger-than-expected five-tenths of 1 percent in July, and weak demand at the Treasury's $11 billion bond auction that day had pushed bond yields up 8 basis points. **********Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said the concern about higher inflation numbers and expectations of a fifth increase in interest rates had left the market oversold. **********She said that with the July inflation numbers indicating only a moderate inflation threat, there appeared to be some indication that the Fed could get by with an increase of only 25 basis points in the Federal funds rate, rather than the 50 basis points that had been expected. **********Ms. Schaja said the consumer price figures indicated that even though there had been increases in the basic commodity indexes, price increases had not flowed through to the consumer level yet, an indication that producers might be having difficulty passing along price increases at the retail level. That, in turn, may be an indication that the Fed's tightening might not be as severe as expected. **********Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, mostly because of coffee prices, which posted a record surge of 22.4 percent, and increases in the prices of energy and automobiles. **********The core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, was up two-tenths of 1 percent last month. **********During June, both the overall index and the core rate rose three-tenths of 1 percent. So far this year, the index has risen at a rate of 2.7 percent, the same rate as during the first several months of 1993. **********One reason for consumers' resistance to price increases might be stalled growth in consumer income. In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, were unchanged in July from June, and up only three-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier. **********Yesterday, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose more than expected, to 92.6, in the preliminary August reading, from 89.0 in July. **********Analysts said the expectations component rose to 81.4, from 78.5, and the currenct conditions component jumped to 110.1, from 105.4. Business inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in June, also slightly higher than expected. **********The Commerce Department also reported yesterday that business inventories rose more than expected in June, but traders said it was an old number. **********Tempering the market's reaction to the inflation numbers, a Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, said he was much less optimistic about the inflation outlook, and sent a strong signal that he thought interest rates should rise again. **********An increase may come as early as Tuesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, is to meet."

Backs Companies in Land Cleanups," **********In a ruling seen as generally favorable to thousands of companies with contaminated land, the Internal Revenue Service announced today that the costs of environmental cleanup may be claimed as tax deductions right away rather than spread over many years. **********The decision reverses a so-called technical ruling the agency made a year ago that clouded the issue, brought protests from around the country and led to challenges of an undetermined number of tax returns. **********""This is very favorable,"" said Jerry S. Williford, a partner in the Chicago office of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm. ""It's going to make sure that taxpayers will not get hit with a penalty when they're examined."" **********Most companies appear to be currently taking the deductions, relying on the advice of accountants and their mutual hope that last year's ruling, which was not subject to the same scrutiny and review as the one adopted today, would not stand. **********This means there should be relatively little effect on Treasury revenue, Government officials said. **********While the largest beneficiaries are likely to include the chemical and oil industries as well as utilities and even retailers, specialists said almost any manufacturing operation could make use of the tax benefit **********The I.R.S. did not directly address today two related environmental issues: how to treat the costs of asbestos removal and of leaking underground tanks. **********But accountants said they were encouraged by the tenor of today's decision to believe that these rulings, when they come, would also be advantageous to corporations. **********""It bodes very well for asbestos and tanks,"" said McGee Grigsby, partner here in the law firm of Latham & Watkins. **********But Judith Dunn, the Treasury's deputy tax legislative counsel for regulatory affairs, cautioned that those areas involved ""significantly different issues"" and could not predict when definitive rules would be issued. **********Asked whether companies involved in, say, asbestos removal should take their cue from today's decision on soil contamination, Ms. Dunn said, ""They shouldn't."" Two Areas Detailed **********In its decision today, the Government distinguished between soil remediation, which can be immediately deducted as a business expense, and construction for groundwater treatment, which it said must be capitalized because it represents a permanent improvement to the property. **********""The appropriate test for determining whether the expenditures increase the value of the property is to compare the status of the asset after the expenditure with the status of the asset before the condition arose that necessitated the expenditure,"" the I.R.S. determined. **********This means that restoring land to its noncontaminated condition is deductible as ordinary business expense even if the company itself discharged the hazardous waste. If it knowingly bought land already contaminated by the seller, accountants said, the restoration would presumably not be deductible since the buyer would have obtained a concession in the transaction price. **********Apparently reflecting concern expressed about the cleanup issue by members of Congress, where he formerly served, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was said to have taken a particular interest in today's decision. **********Ms. Dunn said there had been no attempt to elicit views of the Environmental Protection Agency. Some people had accused the Treasury of working at cross-purposes with the agency. **********Today's ruling takes immediate effect, covering cases already in dispute, she said."

But in recognition of the new political realities here, the elite army honor guard that paraded before President Jean-Bertrand Aristide marched without weapons. **********And to a growing number of Haitians, it appears that merely humbling and disarming the military, which has ruled for all but a few months of the last decade, is not enough. A campaign to abolish the armed forces is quickly gaining support among a populace weary of the corruption and brutality associated with the military. **********""They have never done anything but beat us and rob and steal from us,"" said Wilner Desjardins, who sells beverages near the National Palace, echoing a sentiment expressed from one corner of the country to the other. ""We don't want them and we don't need them. The country would be much better off without them."" **********Those sentiments are especially strong among the grass-roots organizations that are the backbone of the Lavalas movement that swept President Aristide to power in the December 1990 elections. After he was overthrown in a military coup in September 1991, it was the left-leaning ""popular sector"" of the Lavalas movement that bore the worst military repression. **********Leaders of such groups say they expect to make big gains in the parliamentary elections likely to be held early next year, capitalizing on the President's popularity and the public revulsion at the three years of military dictatorship that followed his ouster. Then, they say, they plan to push in Parliament for a constitutional amendment or referendum that would abolish the military. **********""The military is on its best behavior now, but that is because the American troops are here to make them behave,"" said one Lavalas leader, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. **********""We have to worry about what happens when the Americans leave,"" he said, ""and many of us think the only way to prevent the Haitian Army from turning back into an army of occupation is to get rid of it."" **********In recent years, nearly half of the Haitian Government's budget has been devoted to military spending. With President Aristide back in power, supporters argue, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has a rare opportunity to divert that money to education, health programs, job creation, communications and road construction. **********That effort received foreign support this week when Oscar Arias Sanchez, a former President of Costa Rica and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, came to the Haitian capital to urge President Aristide and Parliament to free themselves from what he called Latin America's ""main source of instability."" **********In a news conference at the National Palace with President Aristide at his side, Mr. Arias said, ""The Haitian people should not miss this opportunity to get rid of the armed forces, which since 1804,"" the year Haiti won independence, ""have been responsible for more than 24 coups."" **********""The Haitian Constitution is not like the Ten Commandments,"" Mr. Arias also said. ""It can be changed."" **********President Aristide was smiling agreeably as Mr. Arias spoke, but when a Haitian reporter asked if he shared the views of his guest, the President turned enigmatic and dodged several versions of the question. **********In the past, President Aristide has said he favors reducing the size of the armed forces from its recent high of 7,700 members to 1,500 and separating the police force from the army. But he has emphasized reconciliation since he resumed power on Oct. 15, and diplomats say he is reluctant to take any steps that would further alienate soldiers and officers or encourage them to plot against him. **********At the same time, though, the President has taken several steps to weaken the military. On Thursday, Brig. Gen. Bernardin Poisson, who as head of the fire department for the last six years did little to distinguish himself, was appointed Commander in Chief of the armed forces. On Friday a wholesale reshuffling of the high command, military staff and regional commanders was announced at the Army Day ceremonies. **********American officials said President Aristide had reassured them that he believed that the armed forces still had a place in Haitian life. But at the same time, as one American military official put it, there is ""a mood in Haiti to have a loyal force but not a competent one,"" so as to limit the influence of the military. **********American officials have repeatedly said that a slimmed-down and professionalized version of the armed forces has a role in a democratic Haiti. Asked recently why a country that has no external enemies needs a standing army, Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the American Embassy here, said such a force was an essential part of the ""iconography"" of nationhood. **********Mr. Schrager also cited a need to patrol Haiti's extensive coastline and to secure the land border with the Dominican Republic, over which the two countries fought for a century until the late 1930's. **********But an adviser to President Aristide said he believed that the reasons for American opposition to abolishing the army went much deeper. He suggested that Washington remained suspicious of the Lavalas movement, with its leftist roots, and saw the military as a valuable political counterweight. **********""The army is the only institution the United States can control,"" the adviser argued. ""They can finance them, arm them, have intelligence links with them."" **********Asked during a visit here on Friday to comment on Mr. Arias's effort, the United States Army Secretary, Togo D. West Jr., said the issue was so delicate that it was best left to the Haitian Government. **********""Each country has to make that decision for itself,"" he said. ""We're here to help restore democracy."" **********A bill separating the army and the police is expected to be approved by Parliament before the end of the year, and other reform measures are expected to be introduced after next year's legislative elections. But it is the possibility of a referendum that appears to be of most concern to the military and those who do not want to see it abolished. **********""If this issue ever gets to a popular vote, it's going to be curtains for these jokers,"" one diplomat said. ""I don't have the slightest doubt that if they were given a choice, after what this country has been through, at least 70 percent of the population would vote the army out of existence."""

Early last week, the stock was trading above $30. The company's stock also plummeted today in the United States, falling $3.50 (United States), to $14.50, in Nasdaq trading. **********Many analysts here are saying that Cott, while still expanding rapidly, will fall short of its projected growth rate because of increasingly aggressive price cutting by its two largest American rivals, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. Critics Taken to Court **********Cott has also been dogged by allegations that it has inflated its declared profits by using unorthodox accounting practices, and that it is running out of cash. The company rejects the charges as deliberate misinformation put out by short-sellers -- speculators who sell borrowed shares hoping the market price will fall before they have to repay the shares' original owners. **********Cott has even taken some of its detractors to court. A memorandum from a Toronto research firm, Equity Research Associates Inc., questioning the health of Cott's cash flow, prompted a suit by Cott earlier this year seeking $14 million (Canadian) in damages. **********In addition, questions have been raised by Cott's failure so far to issue its annual report for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 29, 1994. The report must include full financial statements and the assurance of its outside auditors, Coopers & Lybrand, that the statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles. **********Cott invited some Canadian and American analysts to its Toronto headquarters yesterday to talk about the company's prospects. A University of Chicago professor, Roman Weil, was brought in to help field questions on the accounting matters. **********The host at the meeting, which was closed to the press, was the company's chairman and chief executive officer, Gerald Pencer, a 49-year-old entrepreneur whose last big venture, Financial Trustco Capital Ltd. was one of the larger Canadian business failure collapses of the last decade. **********According to Jacques Kavafian, an analyst at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., a Montreal brokerage house represented at the meeting, Mr. Pencer and other senior executives acknowledged that the company's growth rate would drop dramatically this year. **********Earnings growth has been as high as 100 percent annually over the last couple of years. ""They now service 50 large supermarket chains in North America,"" Mr. Kavafian said. ""So it's increasingly difficult for them to find new customers."" Mr. Kavafian, whose firm recommended selling Cott stock several months ago, said: ""It's too late to sell now. Our recommendation is a neutral."" A Downgrade on Wall Street **********Although it failed to publish its annual report, Cott issued a news release last week on this year's first- quarter earnings, showing them up 67 percent from a year ago, at $9.6 million (Canadian), or 16 cents a share. Gross profit as a percentage of sales fell to 16.5 percent from 18.7 percent because of soft-drink pricing pressures and lower profitability in its newer bottling operations for private-label beer. **********Some of today's selling may have been touched off by a downgrade of Cott stock by Lehman Brothers from a ""buy"" to ""neutral."" **********""We've lowered our estimates because we think the North American marketplace will be more competitive,"" Caroline Levy, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, said, ""and because Cott's spending to grow its international infrastructure will be higher than expected."""

All three domestic auto makers set November records for sales of pickups, mini-vans, and sport utility vehicles. The General Motors Corporation sold 167,687 light trucks in the United States during the month -- 13 percent more than its previous record November, which was in 1978. **********With one month to go in 1994, the auto makers have already sold more trucks than they sold in all of 1993. And several auto makers, including the Honda Motor Company and the Nissan Motor Corporation, reported that they had already surpassed their total 1993 sales of cars and trucks. **********For the industry, sales climbed 5.4 percent over a strong November last year, to 1.16 million. While car sales edged up 1.4 percent, to 665,187, light truck sales rose 11.2 percent, to 501,428. **********In sum, the auto makers appeared on track to sell more than 15 million vehicles this year, for the first time since 1988, when they sold 15.5 million. In 1993, they sold 13.9 million. The industry's best sales year was 1986 when it sold more than 16 million cars and light-trucks. **********""Sales were better than we thought,"" said David M. Garrity, auto industry analyst for Smith Barney in New York. ""I was very much impressed with what the Big Three were able to do."" **********In particular, Mr. Garrity said, he had expected G.M. to suffer in the month because of truck shortages. That it did not, he said, may indicate that G.M. has worked out some of the components-supply problems that have been dogging it. **********Not that dealers are happy with their inventories. Indeed, the auto industry's second-ranked broken record for 1994 would have to be dealers' lamentations on this subject. ""We can't get enough to sell,"" said Tom Ward, general sales manager at Main Motor Sales in Anoka, Minn. ""It's not just me, either. There's a shortage in general, and more buyers than product."" **********Mr. Ward sells Cadillacs, Geos, and Chevrolets. He said he has not received a single 1995 Cavalier subcompact in two months, and he usually sells up to 15 of them monthly. G.M. has had trouble increasing production at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant that makes the car. **********But, he said, the shortages have helped him sell some cars customers normally spurn, like Chevy's rear-wheel-drive Caprice sedan. **********But some dealers worried that interest rates were beginning to bite into sales. ""Truck sales are up, but the interest-rate increase hurt our new-car sales,"" said Glenn Gardner, vice president and general manager of Rice & Holman Ford in Mount Laurel, N.J. ""They started strong, but new car sales went soft in the last two weeks of the month,"" after the Fed raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a point. **********Industry officials and analysts remained divided on the effect of rising interest rates. **********Thomas J. Osborn, the director of sales and marketing operations planning for the Chrysler Corporation, said that rates would have to climb much higher, perhaps into the teens, before they would begin to cut into sales. But Joel Pitcoff, the Ford Motor Company's market analysis manager, said that some people might be buying now to avoid paying higher rates later. **********""Some of the apparent strength may be pull-ahead from people who expect interest rates to continue to go up,"" Mr. Pitcoff said. **********Mr. Garrity argued that banks' eagerness to make loans would cause them to continue offering good deals to consumers, like letting them borrow with less money down. Further, he pointed out, consumer confidence, like the employment rate, remains strong. **********The seasonally adjusted selling rate for all cars in the month was 8.9 million, compared to 8.7 million in November a year ago, and 8.8 million in October.

Jesse Jackson arrived as a special envoy of the White House to mediate the country's political crisis. **********It was one of the most violent and chaotic days of the yearlong standoff in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. **********The opposition leader, Moshood Abiola, is widely believed to have won a presidential election in June 1993, but the vote was annulled by Nigeria's military leadership. He was arrested last month after declaring himself president on the first anniversary of the vote. **********On the opening day of the treason proceedings in Abuja, the administrative capital, a federal judge denied Mr. Abiola bail and ordered him back to prison pending resumption of the proceedings next Tuesday. If convicted, he could face  a life sentence. **********A peaceful pro-democracy protest during the hearing turned violent when youths set up burning barricades in a main intersection in Abuja. The police opened fire, killing at least 5 people and wounding 15. **********Similar protests broke out in Lagos. Youths looted markets, rampaged through  bus terminals, lit bonfires and barricaded an expressway. Riot police broke up the demonstrations with tear gas. About 50 people were arrested and the Campaign for Democracy, a human rights coalition, said one of its workers was killed. **********Mr. Jackson met with Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, and with Mr. Abiola just before the trial opened. He told reporters later he saw little hope  for a compromise and feared a full civil war. **********""Tension will grow"" and ""become bloody, and then a civil war,"" he said at a news conference later at the United States Embassy in Lagos. ""Rwanda will be child's play."" **********""I did not come to mediate but to bring a message of democracy, a message of  hope,"" he added. ""Fear is crushing hope. Hope must prevail."" **********Mr. Jackson said Washington was considering tough new sanctions against the military Government, including freezing overseas assets. **********He urged the Government to free political prisoners and lift bans on outlawed newspapers. **********General Abacha seized power in November and was a crucial figure in at least  two previous military coups during the past decade. He has dissolved all democratic institutions, jailed dozens of opposition figures and closed newspapers. **********However, he has been unable to halt a crippling three-week strike by oil workers that was launched partly to demand that Mr. Abiola be freed and installed as president. **********After meeting with General Abacha and Mr. Abiola in Abuja, Mr. Jackson flew to Kano in the north to meet with former government officials. **********His return to Lagos was delayed by a strike by air traffic controllers, who joined hundreds of thousands of others who have stopped working to demand Mr. Abiola's release. **********The strikes have led to widespread fuel shortages, halted transportation and  devastated the oil industry, which accounts for 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign  income. **********A country of 90 million, Nigeria is rich in mineral resources.

Along with telephone traffic, British systems are allowed to carry television broadcasts, a field just opening to American companies. **********It is that dual capacity that the operators insist makes their investments so attractive. Yet this year as a number of these companies turn to the markets to raise money to complete their systems, the doubts overhanging the industry are greater than ever. **********""If you read the risk section of the prospectuses you would never invest,"" acknowledged Alan Bates, managing director of Jones Cable Group Ltd. and chairman of the Cable Industry Association. ""It's just awful."" **********Those risks range from extremely unlikely changes in the regulations that now cosset the infant cable industry by barring competition from British Telecom PLC, to the very real threat posed by the rapid growth of satellite television. **********In America, companies like Jones Cable and Cox Enterprises Inc.'s Cox Cable Communications have made fortunes offering television alone. In Britain, for an additional investment in hardware and switching systems of 25 percent, operators figure they can even improve on that performance - doubling their sales by offering telephone hookups as well. **********Yet for all its supposed advantages the British market is proving a tough sell. **********""Our phone penetration is going better than we anticipated, but cable television less so,"" said Larry Carleton, president of TeleWest International, a company jointly owned by the American phone giant US West Inc. and by the cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. **********""People here are used to paying for phone service, not television,"" he said. **********Others note that the American cable industry grew up with advantages that are lacking in Britain. ""Cable in the U.S. was helped by the fact that television in the U.S. was truly awful whereas here we have four fairly good channels,"" said Richard Ryder, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. **********He also pointed out that satellite technology has advanced to the point where relatively cheap dishes can now fit comfortably under the eaves of most houses. **********Worse, the local leviathan, British Telecom, has struck back at the cable operators, announcing that it will soon experiment with a system that it contends will be able to squeeze movies down existing copper wire phone lines. BT aims ultimately to offer a video-on-demand service nationwide. **********The cable operators sniff at that salvo. The Cable Association's director-general, Richard Woollam, calls it ""too little too late."" He asserts that the industry has already achieved critical mass with cables now laid past 3 million British homes and with that number scheduled to more than double in the next two years. **********What is more, specialists pointed out that the modern coaxial cables being buried by the cable companies across the land have 250,000 times the data-carrying capacity of traditional copper wires. ""What is video on demand compared with a system that can potentially offer 500 channels?"" Mr. Ryder asks. ""This is revolutionary."" **********Even revolutions can be hard to sell, though. Mr. Carleton, for instance, acknowledges that his company was on the brink of pulling out of the British market before the law was changed in 1991 to allow cable companies to augment their offerings - and earnings - with plain old telephone service. **********By all accounts the promised information revolution of cable - of householders not only being able to receive 500 channels but also to shop, play games and even have their heart monitored over their own personal access road to the vast new information highway - was a financial nonstarter. **********""When the law changed we went from viewing this market as an interesting laboratory to looking at it as a going concern,"" said Bruce Rabuffo, chief operating officer for Nynex UK. With a franchise that covers 2.5 million British homes, Mr. Rabuffo noted that eventually his British operation could rival in size a large regional U.S. phone company. **********The ability to offer phone service has also provided the cable industry a crucial marketing tool. **********""Cable companies can knock on your door and say, 'Please buy our system and watch more TV,' and people will say 'Why should I; it's all rubbish,'"" explained Bill Dixon, an analyst with Dixon Goodwin & Co. ""The telephone system allows them to get their foot in the door."" And by offering the two hookups for the price of one, a number of cable companies have done just that. **********As the United States moves toward opening up its communications industry, to erasing the regulations that have long legally barred phone companies from entering the television business and vice versa, Britain has become a crucial testing ground for companies on both sides of that divide to hone both their strategies and their technologies. **********""I can do things here that we can still only dream of doing at home,"" Mr. Rabuffo said. **********Moreover for the likes of Nynex and the other U.S. regional phone companies, which are facing growing competition for phone service at home, Britain offers the opportunity to reverse roles and play upstart. **********""Our partners at US West are not only learning the cable television business but what it takes to compete in the telephone business,"" said Mr. Carleton of TeleWest."

Not Necessarily,Will a Falling Dollar Bring Inflation? Not Necessarily," **********Inflation fears fanned by the dollar's fall this week are overblown, many economists say. Despite all the talk about the global economy, they say, the United States is more insulated than most countries against such shocks. **********A popular rule of thumb among specialists is that a 10 percent drop in the dollar against the rest of the world's currencies would add no more than one percentage point to the inflation rate over the next year or two. The rule is based partly on the fact that imports account for only a tenth of all goods and services sold in the United States, so changes in their prices are heavily diluted. **********But some economists now question even this figure, saying that the actual effect may be much less. In fact, they say, it may be negligible for the 3 percent drop in the dollar against the yen and German mark in the last two weeks. **********""There's enough downspin to inflation still that even with this, you still have a good chance of coming in under last year's increase"" in consumer prices, said David C. Munro, a longtime White House economic forecaster who now works for High Frequency Economics in Manhattan. **********Mr. Munro, who is anticipating more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to keep inflation under control, estimated that even a 5 percent fall in the value of the yen and the mark would increase consumer prices in the United States by only four-hundredths of a percentage point. **********Indeed, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, played down the globalization of the economy on Wednesday, during Congressional testimony. ""At this point, we have little aggregate evidence that the increased openness of the United States economy over the past several decades has substantially altered the process of domestic price formation,"" he said. **********Mr. Munro and other economists point out that foreign companies have passed on less and less of their losses from exchange rate movements in recent years, choosing instead to try to keep prices low and preserve their market shares. This means American companies have had less opportunity to raise their own prices. Imports Priced in Dollars **********Economists also note that more of America's imports are coming from oil-producing countries that price their shipments in dollars or from East Asian and Latin American countries that tie their currencies informally to the dollar. **********In the short run, a drop in the dollar against the yen or German mark has little effect on this growing share of American trade, although specialists caution that in the longer term, a drop might provoke Middle Eastern countries to raise oil prices to assure that it still takes the same number of barrels of oil to buy a Mercedes or a Sony television. **********The dollar has simultaneously been strengthening in recent weeks against a few currencies, notably the Canadian dollar, said Jeffrey J. Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics. American imports last year from Canada nearly equaled imports from Japan and Germany combined. **********Moreover, as dramatic as a record low against the yen always seems, the dollar has not really fallen very much in the last two weeks. Inflation depends on the size of the drop, not whether a yen is worth a penny for the first time. So inflation is unlikely to rise just because a dollar now buys 101 yen instead of 104 at the beginning of last week, or buys 1.6 German marks instead of 1.65 marks. **********Yet such calculations, by themselves, are not likely to reassure the Federal Reserve, many economists say. The central bank has already raised interest rates four times this year so as to forestall the possibility of inflationary increases. And like falling bond prices, a falling exchange rate may be a clue that investors, expecting higher inflation ahead, are moving into other currencies first. In that case, most economists concur, higher interest rates are needed. **********""If the falling dollar is the first sign of inflation, like the approaching clouds of a hurricane that you can see if you have a sharp eye, then a little bit of intervention in the exchange markets is not the right response at all,"" said William Poole, a Brown University monetary economist often mentioned as a future Republican nominee to the Federal Reserve.  Big Indirect Effect **********Other economists who rely on big computer models remain convinced that a falling dollar does have a big effect on inflation. They focus not on the direct effect of rising import prices, but rather on the indirect effect that a lower dollar may have in encouraging American exports. Cheaper dollars allow people in Germany or Japan to pay fewer marks or yen for a new Buick, and when the economy is already operating at or near full capacity, as it is now, growing exports could cause the economy to overheat, feeding inflation. **********""The U.S. economy is in a more inflation-prone condition now than it was two or three years ago,"" said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers. ""The vulnerability to inflation from a sustained drop in the dollar now would be greater."" **********But there is little agreement on exactly how vulnerable. While DRI/ McGraw-Hill, in Lexington, Mass., assumes that the indirect effect outweighs the direct effects, Mr. Munro said that the indirect effect was too small even to be measured. **********The strongest consensus is that the falling dollar will most affect Americans who go to Europe or Japan and find the restaurants and hotels much more expensive in dollar terms. ""It's terrible,"" said Patrick J. Conway, an associate professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""I'm leaving on Saturday and I'm lucky, I'm jumping right over Europe and Japan to Central Asia, where the dollar still stands tall."""

Mr. Lager, a member of the search team, said the company is busy screening executive search firms and hopes to find the right person by year-end -- maybe even from among the contest applicants. **********Ronald Morrow, managing director of Smith Barney in New York, who follows the company, agreed that the search is not just fun and games. ""The company is looking for someone talented in marketing, manufacturing and distribution. It is looking for a serious businessman."" Not necessarily a stodgy businessman -- er, person -- however, because the winner must be comfortable with Ben & Jerry's hip style and social values. **********And those who don't get the job? ""Some of them may not be right for the C.E.O.'s job, but they sure would be right for marketing jobs,"" said Mr. Cohen, who will remain chairperson. ""We may not have to advertise for people for the next several years.""A LARGE CONE . . . WITH GRAVY? **********ONE executive who has gotten almost as much mileage from the contest as Ben & Jerry's is Alan Stillman, proprietor of New York City's Smith & Wollensky, a $50 million company that runs the Manhattan Ocean Club, the Park Avenue Cafe and Cite, among other restaurants. On June 23, 10 days after Ben & Jerry's announced the competition, Mr. Stillman published his entry as a full-page advertisement in The New York Times, offering the ice-cream company his services as chief executive. **********""I propose a whole new line of flavors: Red Meat Swirl, Potato Gravy Chunk, Starchie Bunker,"" he wrote.  Mr. Stillman also proposed a merger and a new name: Ben Smith & Jerry Wollensky Steaks and Shakes. **********Since the letter appeared, Mr. Stillman has been deluged with requests for interviews. ""I was not interested in a merger when I published the letter,"" he says. ""I was looking for publicity, 100 percent."" Lately, though, he has started taking the merger issue more seriously. ""I've spoken to Ben, and we've made a date for lunch the next time he is in New York,"" Mr. Stillman says. ""I've already started calling him Ben Wollensky."""

Now they patrol the streets of Tokoza side by side, two of 193 former vigilantes who work this war-shattered black settlement in the blue uniforms of the South African police. **********Despite some resistance on both sides, police officials and the new constables say the hiring of former vigilantes has begun to alleviate two problems at once. It has occupied legions of young warriors who might otherwise have terrorized the populace. And though there are no statistics yet to prove it, they believe it is driving down the fearsome rate of murders, rapes, carjackings and other crimes that bedevil the township. **********So far the program is confined to the cluster of black townships east of Johannesburg where the political gang war was most punishing. **********Col. Ray Harrald, a police spokesman, said 236 veterans of township political gangs had joined the force as constables since September, and another 324 are in training. **********The men and women get six weeks of training in firearms and police procedures, and as junior members of the force are paid about $220 a month for three 12-hour shifts a week. Many, like Mr. Buthelezi and Mr. Masuko, say they plan to go through the advanced training to become full-fledged police officers. **********""I'm the first man from my area to volunteer,"" said Mr. Buthelezi, a 26-year-old who fought with a vigilante unit in Tokoza. ""Some of the comrades thought I was a traitor, but now a lot of them are joining."" **********Initially many of the young street fighters did not want a job that might oblige them to arrest their friends. They were uneasy about being trained by the predominantly white riot police, for years their most bitter enemy. **********Some senior police, in turn, resisted the idea of issuing semiautomatic weapons to former gang members. **********Capt. Jan Huysamen, the Tokoza police station commander, said there had already been two off-duty killings by former vigilantes, including one who used his police pistol to shoot a woman after an argument. **********""We've got the quantity, but not quality,"" he said of his new recruits. But he said that on balance the presence of the former vigilantes, which has doubled the size of his force, has made the township much safer. **********""Any time you get more visible policemen on the streets, it helps,"" he said. ""And these fellows know the community. They can get closer."" **********The former rivals are paired on foot patrols, which assures them free access to most precincts of the township but obliges them to swallow a good deal of past hostility. **********Mr. Buthelezi's scars include not only a shrapnel wound in his left knee, but the memory of watching his younger brother gunned down in their front yard two days before Christmas last year. **********The boy was only 12, but already a political gang fighter himself, when three Inkatha gunmen strolled by the house at dusk. One raised a pistol and killed the boy with a bullet through the neck. **********The man who shot Mr. Buthelezi in the knee and the man who killed his brother now serve alongside him in the police, he said. He has not yet worked up the poise to approach his brother's killer, but he did confront the man who wounded him. **********""I told him: 'What happened some time ago, it's over now. That was wartime,' "" he said. ""Someday I think I will say the same thing to the other one, who killed my brother."" **********The Inkatha veterans also have losses to bear. Mr. Masuko's cousin, a close friend who roomed with him in one of the workmen's hostels that served as Inkatha fortresses, was killed in a shootout with the police two years ago. **********It is too early to say that tensions between political rivals, or between the town and the police, have been resolved. Just this week in a neighboring trouble spot, Katlehong, a mob outraged by a shooting set fire to a police mobile home. **********But the presence of the new recruits seems to have improved the status of police in a community where many have been killed simply for wearing the blue uniform. The police say residents are now quick to call when they see something suspicious, and the police are quicker to respond. **********""We are township kids ourselves,"" Mr. Buthelezi said. ""We know a lot of the people doing the hijacking and the drugs. We went to them and told them, 'Stop, or we'll put you behind bars.' "" **********Tokoza, once the furious front line of the political violence, has taken on an air of normality unknown since the clashes first erupted here in 1990. **********Children walk unescorted to school across areas that were recently famous sniper corridors. Building contractors who long refused to set foot in the township have begun restoring and painting homes blasted by the street wars. Partisans cross enemy lines to play soccer and visit friends. **********""Before, if you passed that side to this side, they would kill you,"" said Mr. Buthelezi, chatting in the heart of former enemy territory, Mr. Masuko's hostel room. ""Now a lot of us come to the hostel, to talk."" **********Although a few months ago it was an article of faith among A.N.C. militants that the Inkatha hostels must be demolished, ""it's not such an issue now,"" Mr. Buthelezi said. With a confidence most Tokoza residents would like to share, he declared, ""Now, the fight is finished."""

The S.E.C. said that more than 150 investors put almost $2 million into partnerships that were unregistered and misused the money. Neither Mr. Moses nor his lawyer returned telephone calls. **********State securities regulators are tearing their hair over the boom in wireless cable fraud, which has been fueled by publicity about the information superhighway and Federal auctions of the airwaves. ""The cons follow the headlines,"" said G. W. McDonald, chief investigator for the California Corporation Commission. ""When there's a real technology, they'll sell investments that look the same, sound the same, but are fronts for fraud."" **********Wireless cable is a technology that is supposed to allow companies to duplicate traditional cable television service without the cost of installing wiring. But, in fact, ""it only works where there are no hills and no big buildings -- the whole thing is founded on sand,"" Mr. McDonald said. **********The investments tend to take the form of partnerships, which are supposed either to buy and sell broadcast licenses or, more recently, to build and operate wireless cable systems. While regulators concede that there may be legitimate wireless cable investments, they think many of these investment pitches are scams. **********The hotbeds of wireless cable promotions are Florida, Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas, regulators say. But many investors are in the Midwest. Indiana has filed a dozen cease-and-desist orders involving wireless cable pitches, and has more investigations under way, said Lisa McCabe, deputy commissioner of enforcement for the Indiana Secretary of State. **********New York has not been known for wireless-cable scams, but if the S.E.C. is right, the scams have been going on here nonetheless. According to the complaint, in 1990, Mr. Moses ran promotions on two local radio stations, WABC and WOR. Callers to a phone number were offered an investment in Microwave Cable T.V. Partners I, a limited partnership that said it planned to buy Federal wireless-cable licenses for rural areas, and sell them to people who wanted to operate the systems. This was supposed to yield high profits with low risk. **********Many of the same investors were solicited in 1992 and 1993 to buy a second partnership, Microwave Cable T.V. Partners II, based on the purported success of the first partnership. **********But the partnerships really spent most of the money on an existing cable TV company in Atlanta, that wanted to start a wireless business, and on a Kansas company that operated radio stations. **********Mr. Moses also used some money to make loans involving affiliated companies and people. One went to a company, ESC Electronics ""to facilitate an investment in ESC by a Moses-controlled entity,"" according to the complaint. The complaint also says that he lent $150,000 to a business associate named Paul Alessandrini. **********Paul Alessandrini Jr. is chief executive of a brokerage firm called the Westfield Financial Corporation. According to Federal records, Mr. Moses was at one time also a principal of Westfield, which has a long history of run-ins with regulators. **********Mr. Alessandrini said he had not received a loan from Mr. Moses or the partnerships. ""One hundred and fifty thosand dollars?"" he said. ""That, I would remember."" **********Federal filings have a lot of information about Mr. Moses that would have interested investors -- including the fact that he served several months in jail in the 1960's for selling stolen jewelry. **********State securities regulators are using such cases to remind the unwary to check out people with whom they plan to invest (in New York, for example, that can be done through the Attorney General's office). And they warn investors to be on the alert not only for wireless cable fraud, but also for what they call the next generation of the scam: interactive video."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/01/business/for-hunts-a-reckoning-is-at-hand.html,Allen Myerson,1994-11-01,,1137,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"For Hunts, a Reckoning Is at Hand","For Hunts, a Reckoning Is at Hand"," **********Eight years ago, the Hunt brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert, pitched their corporations into bankruptcy. Six years ago, they declared personal bankruptcy. **********But only late on Friday did the family of Herbert Hunt finally agree in a court filing to hand over the bulk of his property -- more than $40 million in real estate, with back interest, that creditors say he had fraudulently transferred shortly before filing for personal bankruptcy. In August, Nelson Bunker Hunt's relatives quietly agreed to a similar settlement, worth about $14 million. **********Including previous payments, creditors expect to receive a total of $50 million to $60 million from Herbert Hunt, and perhaps twice that from Bunker Hunt. That is a fraction of the more than $1 billion that creditors, including the Internal Revenue Service, had sought. **********""These were, and still are, the largest personal bankruptcies ever filed in the United States,"" said Steven S. Turoff, the trustee responsible for liquidating the William Herbert Hunt estate. ""It's been a very tedious process."" **********When creditors initially went to liquidate the Hunt brothers' property, they found that the brothers had transferred large portions of their wealth into a tangle of family trusts, partnerships and corporations. **********To the creditors, the Hunt cases, which were brought about by huge reversals in the silver and oil markets, demonstrate how litigious and determined debtors can almost endlessly delay a final reckoning. Some of the lawyers say the brothers are still worth millions each, possibly more. **********Charles M. Tatelbaum, a bankruptcy lawyer and vice president of the American Bankruptcy Institute, a research and education group, said that the Hunts might have succeeded in shielding much more of their wealth had they not faced adversaries as determined and well financed as the I.R.S. ""If one has good legal advice and one wants to throw up roadblocks, one could make it nearly impossible to recover,"" he said. **********The agreement filed in Dallas today is still subject to United States Bankruptcy Court approval after a Nov. 21 hearing. In this case, said Hugh M. Ray, a lawyer representing the Manufacturers Hanover Bank, now part of the Chemical Bank, ""Nothing's a formality."" **********The major task left after court approval would be to liquidate real estate in California, Texas and Arizona and distribute the proceeds, which Mr. Turoff said would probably take until the end of 1996. **********The Hunts have contended that the transfers were matters of tax and estate planning, not attempts to fend off creditors. The brothers and their families admitted to none of the creditors' accusations. ""It's a settlement,"" said Terrell W. Oxford, a lawyer for two of Herbert's daughters and their husbands. ""We denied there was anything to it, but these people need to get on with their lives,"" he added. **********Formally, the Hunts' personal and corporate bankruptcy cases concluded several years ago. In 1990, the brothers, ready with pithy quotes and resigned grins, helped Sotheby's with a worldwide publicity barrage to auction off their hoard of ancient coins and artistic treasures. The sales brought more than $20 million. **********But a series of transactions, some just days before the bankruptcy filings left must of the brothers' wealth beyond the creditors' reach. Several of the partnerships that the brothers set up had names -- Pacwes, Penyen -- that reflected the belief of the family patriarch, H. L. Hunt, that six-letter words beginning with P were lucky. Placid and Penrod were the brothers' two major oil companies. **********Bankruptcy trustees representing the creditors say that the brothers sold property to their families for less than fair value, or paid more than fair value for interests in these investments. Especially in Herbert Hunt's case, investments like raw land were especially difficult to sell. The trustees also note that what the families called gifts for year-end tax planning were actually given by Bunker in February 1988 and by Herbert that July. **********And so, back to court. The two trustees sued more than 100 defendants, including about 9 Hunt children and 27 grandchildren, in June 1991. The Hunts filed so many preliminary and procedural motions, lawyers involved in the case say, that the first depositions were not taken for 14 months. As of the fall, a trial was still at least another year away. **********For all sides, legal bills in the bankruptcy cases have reached $20 million. These costs, they say, probably persuaded the families to settle before, as in Dickens's ""Bleak House,"" the legal wrangling consumed most of the estate. **********After both sides had agreed in principle a few months ago, the Herbert Hunt family settlement was repeatedly delayed, most recently by the insolvency and court supervision of the Confederation Life Insurance Company of Canada, a creditor. **********The I.R.S. will receive 70 percent of the Herbert Hunt bankruptcy proceeds and 80 percent of the Bunker Hunt proceeds. **********Although the current suits directly involve only the brothers' families, some lawyers say that the delays reflect the brothers' own litigiousness, especially Herbert's. After the banks drove their companies into bankruptcy in 1986, they sued the banks, contending that the banks were trying to force them out of business. **********""It really was the fight to make the world safe for capitalism,"" Mr. Ray said. ""Whole airplanes of lawyers flying in and out of Dallas every week."" **********Filings in the cases against the families are thickened by a seven-page list of 108 lawyers and organizations involved and entitled to receive copies of documents. **********Considering the brothers' remaining wealth, they live fairly modestly. Bunker Hunt, who is 68, drives a Cadillac that is several years old. Although he and his brother sometimes have lunch at the Tower Club, atop a downtown Dallas office tower they once owned, Bunker's lunch is often a can of chili poured over Fritos. **********Once probably the wealthiest man in the country, controlling all of Libya's oil, Bunker has been working through a family oil company on deals in places like Qatar, Indonesia and the Philippines. He also lends his name to investment partnerships. ""Outside the United States, the Hunt name is still highly prestigious,"" one associate said. **********Bunker has also become the largest property owner in Anchorage, this person said. He is ""still wheeling and dealing, just on a much smaller basis,"" he said. **********Herbert Hunt, who is 65, had been traveling to Russia seeking oil deals, but one person familiar with those efforts said he might have given up. Herbert, who meanwhile remains a consultant to a family company, is practicing his own brand of frugality. A lawyer involved in the bankruptcy proceedings reports having seen him at Sam's Club, shopping for groceries."

Let Wall St. Handle Derivatives Rules"," **********ARGUING that derivatives are too complex and too risky, some policy makers want more of the same old kind of regulation for dealers of these exotic-sounding financial instruments. However well-intentioned, this is a misguided idea. A much better approach is the cooperative creation, by industry and government, of a code of good business practices in the tradition of financial self-regulation. **********Derivatives are financial tools whose value derives from fluctuations in the value of something else: stocks, currencies, commodities, interest rates. Although some people say these investments are a high-stakes game on the fringes, the market for derivatives is at the heart of the American economy. Derivatives play a key role in the formation of capital and the management of risk, helping governments, manufacturers, hospitals, utilities and fast-food chains deliver the best products and services at the lowest cost. **********But reformers stress derivatives' danger. Some argue that the failure of a major derivatives dealer, whether a bank, a broker-dealer or whatever, might gravely harm the whole financial system. Such fears, amplified by some companies' recent losses from their transactions in derivatives, have fueled proposals for more regulation. **********However, the current regulatory system treats derivatives in a fragmented, inflexible way. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates the financial products labeled futures, while the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees those called securities. This division stems from the past, when securities were capital-raising vehicles; futures were methods farmers used to hedge crops, and never the twain would meet. **********But those days are gone. Some over-the-counter derivatives span those two, formerly distinct categories, and most derivatives do not really fit into either. For example, Ginnie Mae futures, which were created in the mid-1970's, are futures on securities. In sum, the evolution of financial products has not been followed by a regulatory evolution, and the mismatch has created problems. **********One such problem is agency turf-fighting. Instead of regulating the market, Federal agencies have spent time and money fighting each other, in court and out. When I was at the C.F.T.C. almost 20 years ago, I banged my shoe on the speakerphone during a spirited conversation with an S.E.C. official over which agency should regulate Ginnie Mae futures. Thus began a bitter dispute between the agencies, lasting many years, about which would regulate securities derivatives. In the early 1980's some new laws split jurisdiction between the two organizations. But new derivatives products, like swaps, made the arrangement outmoded before the ink dried. **********Fragmented and unclear oversight is another flaw. S.& P. 500 futures and S.& P. 500 options are similar instruments, for example, but the former is regulated by the commodities commission and the latter by the securities commission. Such fragmentation blurs a derivative's nature, too. Foreign exchange options, for example, are securities when they are traded on a stock exchange and commodity options when traded on a futures exchange. Just imagine the confusion surrounding customized over-the-counter products, which are now driving the derivatives market. **********The effects of this system on derivatives are often bad. The system's artificial distinctions create legal uncertainty, hamper and distort the development of new products and encourage self-interested tinkering with product definitions. In the fast-moving field of derivatives, these failings inflict great harm, including chasing the American derivatives business offshore. **********To add more rules to a system that was never designed for derivatives can only enlarge these problems. On the other hand, a complete overhaul of the system is politically unrealistic. The only remaining remedy: derivatives dealers and regulators should jointly formulate principles of good business practice for the industry. **********Consider, for example, reformers' biggest worry: derivatives' risk. One principle of good business practice might hold that new derivatives should be evaluated for risk not only by the people who develop and trade them, but also by an independent group within the company. Another principle might advise that traders -- the first line of defense in managing risk -- be urged to admit mistakes quickly and be fired for hiding them. **********Also, to make sure that a firm monitors its total risk, weekly meetings could be required for its chief executive and its managers. Senior managers should be held accountable for risk practices, too. Another element is the adoption of a risk-capital rule, which sets the capital that firms must have to protect against derivatives' risks. **********THIS code of business principles would encompass many other things -- from risk disclosure to clients and regulators to the role of independent parties who verify that the risk-management techniques work. But most important, and unlike the current regulatory system, the code would be flexible and forward-looking and not driven by labels. It would focus less on categories than on common-sense business principles, and it would look at derivatives dealers by what they do, not by who regulates or does not regulate them. **********But how can such an industry-led regime be enforced? The first answer is that self-regulation is not new. It is a cornerstone of the financial markets, with the securities and futures exchanges performing under this system admirably over many decades. It is a system of the future, too. Recently, with the encouragement and approval of the S.E.C. and its chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., municipal bond dealers adopted voluntary rules for their political contributions. **********Also, if regulators are displeased with dealer behavior under this self-regulatory system, the agency with the closest nexus to the firm can send it a public letter saying so. In the derivatives industry, which depends greatly on client confidence, such a letter is a powerful enforcement tool -- more powerful than 50 enforcement lawyers. **********Finally, the specter of possible regulation will help insure compliance. ""Government should keep the shotgun, so to speak, behind the door, loaded, well oiled, cleaned, ready for use,"" said the late William O. Douglas Jr., the Supreme Court Justice and an early S.E.C. chairman, about the power of government to step in if self-regulation fails."

Embarrassed that invited guests were being chased off, settlement leaders intervened to countermand the soldiers' orders. **********But by then the small incident had underlined a basic reality in this isolated religious community of 27 families: here, a mile east of the Mediterranean and two miles south of populous Gaza City, filled with Palestinians who would love to make Netzarim disappear if they could, even the most ordinary facets of daily life are performed behind an extraordinary security curtain. A Pistol on His Hip **********Buses come and go only with police and army escorts. An electrified fence runs along the sandy stretches that ring outcroppings of red-roofed houses and trailers. Even to leave his house for only a few seconds to throw a bag of garbage into a bin, a young man strapped a pistol to his hip. **********Actually, said Shlomo Kostiner, the town council head, it is not as bad as some outsiders may think. **********""In general, it's more dangerous here than in Tel Aviv,"" he said. ""But it's not the end of the world. You have to be careful. But we don't go around in bullet-proof vests and helmets. You simply have to be careful, and carry guns."" **********Preserving this security curtain is one of the core issues that keep haunting negotiators for Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization as they try to carry out their outline agreement on introducing Palestinian self-rule to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. **********They are already two months late in starting an Israeli troop withdrawal from those areas, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has made clear that no soldier will move until he is satisfied with security arrangements at the borders and on the roads leading to and from the 19 Jewish settlements in Gaza and the half dozen near Jericho. **********In plain talk, Mr. Rabin wants to be sure that he has done all he can to keep Israelis from being shot as they drive from the settlements to Israel proper. **********His inclusion of army commanders in the talks has been criticized by some in his own Cabinet, who protest that the generals have too strong a voice at the expense of political leaders. Some Government officials say that were it not for the military's objections on the tiniest of security details, they would probably have struck a deal by now with the P.L.O. They're Very Orthodox **********Nonetheless, the objections are there, and the Prime Minister heeds them. So does he, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres says, dismissing suggestions that he and Mr. Rabin may be at odds. **********Tonight, Mr. Peres flew to Cairo and began his third meeting in three weeks with Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, to iron out remaining disagreements over security procedures. **********Both sides said this could be the breakthrough session. But they had said that before, only to be thwarted by sudden hitches. And even if they come to terms, Israeli officials say, there are enough outstanding questions about economic relations and self-rule administration to delay a troop withdrawal by many more weeks. **********Any delay would be fine with the families of Netzarim, all strongly Zionist Orthodox Jews, identifiable by the knitted yarmulkes on the men and the headscarves worn by the women. **********Convinced that they are settling land ordained for Jews, they live in isolation -- surrounded by Arab enemies and, although protected by the army, miles from any other Israeli community. They know that many in Mr. Rabin's Labor-led Government see them as a thorn in the collective Israeli side. **********Indeed, some senior officials say that they wish the settlements had never been built because without them, they say, they could have easily swept security issues off the agenda with the P.L.O. **********A lone outpost like Netzarim drives them to distraction, for it requires an outsized army investment of manpower and money -- and risk to soldiers' lives -- to protect a relative handful of people whose religious vision is probably not shared by a majority of their fellow citizens. They'd Have to Invent Us **********But settlers point out that Netzarim was created as far back as 1972, by a Labor Government, and that it had security-based origins, to serve as a corridor from the Negev and the sea. **********Families did not actually move in until 1984. The Likud Party was dominant then, with its call for Jewish settlement throughout the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war. An attempt here at kibbutz life failed. Two years ago, in Likud's waning days, Netzarim became the strongly nationalist settlement that it now is. **********Despite misgivings within the Rabin Government, Mr. Kotiner says the army is glad to have the settlers. ""Generals told us that if we were not here they would have to invent us,"" he said. ""They want to see how the P.L.O. agreement goes. They want to have a presence here as an option, in case it does not work out."" **********To another resident, Shlomit Ziv, Netzarim's existence is a test for the Palestinians. ""They have to prove,"" she said, ""that they can live peacefully next to Jews."""

They are led by Judge Antonio Di Pietro, who said on Thursday that they would seek re-assignment to protest the decree. **********The development shocked many Italians used to regarding the investigators as the crusaders who brought down a corrupt political elite. The crisis sent waves of consternation through skittish financial markets today as newspaper editorials, opposition figures, ordinary Italians and even some of Mr. Berlusconi's coalition partners challenged the edict. Hanging Tough **********The Government's response, though, was to hang tough. **********""If the Government is slapped in the face on this act of courage and if it fails to obtain the support of the majority, it's clear that the Government will pack its bags,"" Mr. Ferrara, a Cabinet-rank official, told a private television station. **********The threat was apparently designed to bring Mr. Berlusconi's fractious coalition partners back into line after some of them said the decree should be changed. Mr. Berlusconi has made similar threats before, apparently calculating that new elections would strengthen his grip on power. **********But politicians and commentators said the latest crisis presented Mr. Berlusconi with the most severe test of his Government's credibility and cohesion since his right-wing alliance won the national election in March. **********The decree that sparked the uproar prevents investigators from ordering the preventive detention of suspects in corruption cases and bars reporters from identifying corruption suspects before judicial inquiries are complete. The measures are depicted by the Government as a protection of suspects' privacy, reputation and civil liberties. **********""I would like to remind all citizens that the decree is a guarantee for all, especially the weak,"" Mr. Berlusconi declared at his news conference today. Major Tactic of Inquiries **********By allowing the authorities in effect to place a suspect in jail until he talked, preventive detention has been a key tactic in more than two years of corruption inquiries implicating thousands of businessmen and politicians in the so-called Tangentopoli -- Bribe City -- scandal. Investigators also began leaking suspects' names, often before formal charges were brought, in an effort to increase pressure on suspects. **********""Preventive detention must go back to being an exceptional measure,"" Mr. Berlusconi said. Italy, he continued, ""has got to be stopped from becoming a police state."" **********The Italian leader also made a personal attack on the investigating magistrates. **********""Some magistrates have become stars,"" he said, ""and they are disappointed if their faces do not appear on TV everyday. So what is easier to get on television than to do something that takes away the liberty of this person or that?"" **********""Putting people in prison had become a matter of course, almost the rule, and this is dangerous because it contradicts the principle of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution,"" he said. 2,000 May Be Freed **********The decree means that up to 2,000 suspects may be freed from prison, and heads off further arrests of businessmen identified in continuing inquiries. One opposition newspaper, La Voce in Milan, said the Government was seeking ""to protect powerful men the magistrates would have gotten to within hours."" **********Mr. Berlusconi's brother, Paolo, is facing trial on corruption charges. While Mr. Berlusconi himself has not been implicated in the scandal, senior executives from his huge Fininvest business empire -- which owns Italy's biggest commercial television networks along with major advertising and publishing concerns -- are under judicial investigation. **********""Forza, Ladri"" -- ""Go, Thieves"" -- said a headline in the opposition La Repubblica newspaper, mimicking the name of Mr. Berlusconi's political party, Forza Italia. **********In a sign of dissent in Government ranks, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, who is a senior member of the Northern League, said the decree on corruption cases had been a ""mistake"" and suggested that the Cabinet decision was not unanimous. He was speaking before Mr. Berlusconi's threat to resign. **********""The Government has given the impression that it wanted to protect its friends,"" Mr. Maroni said. ""That's not the way it is. At least that was not my intention or the intention of almost all the members of the Cabinet."" **********""We cannot accept that the battle against corruption and Tangentopoli should be put to one side so that we can continue to govern,"" he said. Legislative Approval Needed **********The decree must win parliamentary approval within 60 days if it is to be made law. The Northern League leader, Umberto Bossi, himself facing charges of receiving illicit party contributions, said today: ""The decree won't get through Parliament the way it stands now. There's going to be a battle."" **********The third member of the governing coalition, Gianfranco Fini's neo-Fascist National Alliance, also seemed to back away from the decree. ""The decree is not and should not be a whitewash, and so it can be amended,"" Mr. Fini said. **********According to his aides, Mr. Berlusconi bases many of his decisions on private opinion surveys designed to take the national pulse. He may thus have calculated that after endless revelations about corrupt officials and businessmen since February 1992, Italians have tired of the whole affair and would not object to the decree. **********But hundreds of supportive faxes and telegrams arrived today at the Milan Palace of Justice, where the investigators work, and a telephone survey carried out for La Voce said that more than 80 percent among a sample of 627 Italians were against the decree."

Business Feeds the Hand That Bites It"," **********AMERICAN business remains a fierce opponent of high taxes, deficit spending, employment quotas, government mandates and costly environmental and social programs. **********That is the conventional wisdom. But it is wrong. Even though companies' duties to shareholders demand that they take these probusiness positions, many companies do not. While they may spend millions of dollars lobbying against government actions that would hurt business interests, their corporate ""giving"" officers are donating millions of dollars to tax-exempt groups that advocate those harmful actions. **********In fact, many companies give more money to antibusiness groups than to probusiness ones. In its most recent survey of corporate giving, the Capital Research Center found that 125 corporations donated $25 million to nonprofit public-affairs groups in 1991, the latest year for which data are available. For every dollar the companies gave to groups favoring lower taxes and less government intervention in the economy, they gave $3.35 to groups backing policies adverse to business. **********And things may be getting worse. In 1990, a comparable group of companies gave only $2.09 to antibusiness groups for every dollar donated to probusiness ones. And of 76 big companies surveyed both in 1986 and last year, 25 had raised donations to groups favoring antibusiness policies, but just 16 moved in the opposite direction. **********A concrete example of this perverse behavior: more than a dozen companies, including Aetna ($85,000), Ameritech ($25,000), Fannie Mae ($75,000) and U S West ($25,000), are backers of the Center for Community Change, an organization that has pushed for higher corporate and personal income-tax rates. In other words, they are spending money on a quest which, if successful, will mean less after-tax income for themselves and their shareholders. **********This self-destructive pattern persists even within companies' own industries. Primerica, an insurance giant that recently merged with Travelers, donated $115,000 to the Children's Defense Fund, which has been promoting a Canadian-style health system. And for years, leading energy companies have donated to environmental groups that have helped block development of the energy-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. **********In the aggregate, these sums are not as small as they may seem. In the Capital Research survey, the 125 companies donated $2.67 million just to antibusiness environmental groups alone. All told, the companies gave about $19 million to causes inimical to business that year. **********Why do companies engage in this inexplicable behavior? Sometimes, it may just be oversight. There are, after all, about 500,000 tax-exempt groups that solicit from corporations; many companies give modest sums to numerous groups and fail to investigate thoroughly the groups' policies. And sometimes executives authorize these donations for reasons of personal friendship or a desire for social acceptance. **********But we must not accept these explanations. This ""philanthropically correct"" practice is wrong, and the reason is self-evident. When executives support groups advocating policies that will raise the costs of doing business or lower corporate profits, they are failing in their first and foremost duty: to protect shareholders' financial interests. When policies are clearly contrary to those financial interests, whatever the other dimensions of the issue may be or whatever the executives' personal political beliefs, they must heed only that primary responsibility."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/world/flamboyant-frenchman-hauled-before-judge.html,Alan Riding,1994-06-30,,698,,The New York Times,World,Biography,article,Flamboyant Frenchman Hauled Before Judge,Flamboyant Frenchman Hauled Before Judge," **********As a police operation, it went perfectly. Undercover agents ensconced in a nearby hotel monitored the suspect's home for three days until, shortly after dawn today, police officers woke him up, bundled him into a car and, in the midst of flashing lights and wailing sirens, hauled him up before a judge. **********But when it comes to Bernard Tapie, a flamboyant French businessman and leftist politician, nothing is simple. The police were acting on court orders, but for many French his detention was just another example of the political establishment's vendetta against the tousle-haired maverick. As Popular as Ever **********This time, the police acted barely 12 hours after the National Assembly lifted Mr. Tapie's parliamentary immunity so that he could answer charges of business fraud and tax evasion in two cases involving his 240-foot luxury yacht, Phocea. After appearing before Judge Eva Joly, he was released. **********But his legal troubles go further. He also faces charges of defaming a judge and of misappropriating funds from one of his companies, while his soccer team, Olympique de Marseille, was demoted in a match-rigging scandal. Today he was even charged with insulting the police officers who came to arrest him. **********So far, though, his court battles have done nothing to hurt his popularity. Now 51 years old, his political group won 12 percent of French votes in elections for the European Parliament this month. He is also favorite to become the next mayor of Marseilles and he may even run for President in 1995. **********Indeed, the reason that many mainstream politicians of both left and right disapprove of him is the very reason for his growing following -- that he is a self-made man and political outsider, someone whose blunt language and personal charisma appeal to many young and working-class French. **********The son of a plumber who was brought up in a rough Paris suburb and worked as a salesman and pop singer before discovering he had a talent for business, he seems all the more out of place in a political world of highly educated technocrats and machine politicians. **********Unsurprisingly, his enemies call him a populist and demagogue as well as a crook, pointing most recently to his proposal that unemployment -- which affects one in four young French -- be simply declared illegal. Yet he seems to flourish on epithets, apparently convinced that attacks by the political elite merely feed support for him. **********""They can't insult two and a half million people,"" Mr. Tapie said on Tuesday, referring to those who voted for his Radical Movement of the Left on June 12. He was nonetheless stripped of his parliamentary immunity in two votes -- 465 to 10 and 462 to 10 -- in the conservative-dominated Assembly. **********Judicial officials said Judge Joly acted quickly after these votes for fear that Mr. Tapie might leave the country until he acquired fresh immunity from prosecution when the newly elected European Parliament meets July 19. The court impounded his passport and barred him from leaving France for three weeks. Yacht Is Impounded **********The case being investigated by Judge Joly stems from the charge that he evaded taxes by registering the Phocea as a merchant vessel owned by one of his companies and then also used it as his personal yacht. The four-masted vessel was itself impounded last month by creditors. **********Typically, Mr. Tapie responded furiously to the police raid on his Left Bank mansion at 6.05 this morning, reportedly pouring abuse on his captors to the point that he was briefly handcuffed before being taken to Judge Joly's chambers. **********""He was treated like a street urchin or a terrorist,"" said Jean-Francois Hory, the president of the Radical Movement of the Left. **********Noelle Bellone, who heads one of Mr. Tapie's companies, said: ""This is absolutely scandalous. I don't dispute the judicial process, but there are proper ways of treating people."" **********But the Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, said the police were merely carrying out the judge's orders. ""There were noises, name-calling, a little rebellion,"" he added. ""One had to expect some outrage."""

Panetta, and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen appeared before a closed session of the Senate Finance Committee. **********The meeting followed a warning by the committee chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, that if the White House did not present its proposals this week, he would not begin marking up GATT legislation on Tuesday. Passage by year's end would be imperiled. **********""It was a good meeting,"" Mr. Kantor said today when asked about reports that the lawmakers had reacted with reticence. After briefing members of the House Ways and Means Committee, he told reporters, ""We will reach a solid, effective solution to this problem on a bipartisan basis."" **********The Office of Management and Budget estimates that about $12 billion of Federal tax revenue would be lost in the next five years as a result of the accord, which was completed in December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. **********The accord -- also called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT -- would reduce tariff rates around the world. Because of this, the White House has scrambled to come up with a package that replaces revenue lost from American tariffs without raising hackles in Congress. **********Approval of GATT is not a foregone conclusion. The accord is opposed both in substance, particularly the power it gives to a newly created World Trade Organization to challenge American environmental and dumping regulations, and in how to pay for it. Officials think that if they can solve the payment question, they can defuse the substantive concerns. **********The GATT accord will remove or lower many tariffs on imported products. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods, so technically GATT involves a tax cut. In fact, it is the world's biggest tax cut, with 117 nations lowering or eliminating tariffs. **********This creates the budget problem, since under Congressional rules, any tax cut now must be paid for either by spending cuts or with new revenue. **********Administration and Congressional officials provided details of the White House's proposal on GATT financing presented today. **********There would be cuts in farm subsidies and price supports, which result directly from the accord, that would save about $1.7 billion. **********Certain foreign-controlled companies in Puerto Rico would file estimated taxes quarterly, rather than on an annual lump sum, which they said would raise $1.3 billion. Identifiable From Birth **********Some $340 million would come from assigning Social Security numbers to all newborn babies, which would supposedly cut back on fraudulent tax-deduction claims made on behalf of nonexistent dependents. **********A further $3 billion or so would be raised from existing and expected revenue from the Government's pay-as-you-go account. Since the 1990 budget agreement, certain tax increases and revenue cuts have raised more money than anticipated. These funds would reduce GATT's costs. **********Still $1 billion more would come through reforms at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. By strengthening it, the Government estimates that it can reduce its outlays to weak pension funds by $1 billion. **********About $300 million would be raised through voluntary withholding on Social Security benefits and other programs like farm subsidies and crop-disaster payments. The Government would realize this money by a system of monthly withholding, rather than quarterly estimated payments. **********A further $100 million would come from a tax increase on casino revenue from Indian reservations. And $300 million more would be raised by speeding excise-tax payments on cigarettes, alcohol and telephones. **********Proposed changes in how retailers account for inventory would raise $1.1 billion. A variety of smaller items would bring the total to $12 billion. **********The world trade accord is to go into effect no later than July 1, 1995, but the Administration wants it approved this year, which it hopes would encourage other nations to follow suit."

But after he spoke, several State Department officials said the Administration might ease -- but not eliminate -- economic or travel restrictions against Cuba if Mr. Castro allowed more freedom of expression or free elections. Not Seeking Castro's Ouster **********In what several officials said was an effort to reduce the rancor of the exchanges between Washington and Havana, Mr. Christopher also said the United States was not specifically seeking Mr. Castro's departure. **********""What we seek is peaceful, democratic change,"" he said. ""That's our goal. Whether that involves Mr. Castro or not is really up to him."" **********Although many Republicans and Cuban-American groups are urging President Clinton to demand Mr. Castro's departure, several Administration officials said it would be unwise to demand his ouster because that could cause the Cuban leader to take a vindictive approach to the refugee crisis and other matters. **********Mr. Christopher, who cut his California vacation short last week to deal with the Cuba crisis, sought to portray the Administration's policy as a reasonable, middle course between what he described as two extremes -- those seeking warlike measures and those willing to scrap the trade embargo. **********He said the Administration was not contemplating a naval blockade, stating that ""it can lead toward confrontation; it's an act of war."" Those who advocate a blockade, like some Cuban-American groups, are advocating ""extreme positions,"" he said. **********Last Sunday, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, suggested that the Administration might look at a blockade as a way of stepping up pressure on Havana. **********Mr. Christopher denied that the Administration's policy was being driven by domestic politics, even though Florida officials, Cuban-American groups and some Administration officials have said Mr. Clinton's decision to tighten sanctions against Havana was a response to Cuban-American pressures. **********In television appearances today, Mr. Christopher and other officials sought to put to rest skepticism that the Administration would discuss subjects other than immigration at the talks scheduled later this week with Cuban officials. **********The United States and Cuba agreed to limited talks on immigration after Mr. Clinton rejected Mr. Castro's call last week for high-level talks on a range of subjects, including the trade embargo. **********""Migration is at the core of what we have to talk to Cuba about,"" Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff said on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press."" ""We're not going to negotiate broader questions."" **********Mr. Tarnoff said the United States was not interested ""in cutting a deal"" with the Cuban leader. ""What we want him to understand is that he has to deal with the Cuban people,"" he said. ""The United States is not an intermediary between Castro and his people."" Isolate Castro, Floridian Says **********Also appearing on ""Face the Nation,"" Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, agreed that the Administration should not engage in broad negotiations with Mr. Castro. ""It would be like throwing him a lifeline,"" he said. ""It's not what we should be doing. We should be attempting to further isolate this man."" **********Mr. Mack said the Administration should consider blockading Cuba if Mr. Castro continued to let Cubans flee to the United States. **********On the same program, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said ""I can't think of anything more foolish"" than a blockade, asserting that it would isolate the United States. **********Mr. Dodd, chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, backed the idea of broad negotiations. ""No one wants to see this Government perpetuated,"" he said. ""But to suggest somehow that we're just going to allow this situation to persist without trying to find some common ground or resolve these issues diplomatically and politically seems awfully naive and awfully myopic."" **********Administration officials said they were encouraged by a report in the Cuban Government newspaper Juventud Rebelde that Mr. Castro would prohibit children and adolescents from leaving Cuba on unsafe rafts and boats. **********""We are interested in safe, legal and orderly migration, and that's what we want to encourage,"" Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said in an interview.

Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from prices, was 7.23 percent, down from 7.25 percent on Friday. Ahead of reports on producer and consumer prices investors and dealers sharply reduce their trading. **********The Labor Department releases the Producer Price Index for March today. Economists surveyed by the Reuters news service expect the closely watched gauge of wholesale prices to show an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent over all and an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in the core, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components. **********In February, producer prices rose half a percentage point and one-tenth of a percent when food and energy were excluded. That was slightly higher than analysts had expected, and the market rallied. Consumer Report Is Due **********Tomorrow the Government will release the Consumer Price Index for March, which is a monitor of price pressures at the consumer level. The index is expected to be up two-tenths of 1 percent over all and three-tenths of 1 percent in the core. **********Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said that the market was also likely to pay attention this week to the monthly retail sales report tomorrow and capacity utilization on Friday. **********""The retail will give us a good idea of consumer spending and a better line on the gross domestic product for the first quarter,"" Mr. Alexy said. ""Both the retail and capacity numbers probably offer the most potential to surprise the market, so everyone is being careful not to get caught too far out of position."" **********Mr. Alexy said that the market might have become a little oversold on the long maturities, which might have accounted for their rebound in the afternoon, supported by lower commodity prices and gold.  Attention to Fed **********And the market continues to pay attention to comments by Federal Reserve officials. The president of the Federal Reserve bank in Dallas, Robert McTeer, told the Association of Private Enterprise yesterday that he saw the first-quarter gross domestic product growing at an annual rate of more than 3 percent and saw inflation ""behaving well."" **********In the municipal market yesterday, many investors were reluctant to make purchases as long as there was still the possibility of higher interest rates. That is one reason municipal bond prices have been hammered over the last couple of months. **********As a result, few issuers were in the market. The biggest deal yesterday was a $199 million sale by Harris County, Tex., through underwriters led by Dillon, Read & Company. **********The general obligation revenue bonds were initially priced to yield a maximum of 6.40 percent for an issue due in 2020. For shorter-maturity bonds serials were priced to yield from 6 percent in 2008 to 6.30 percent in 2013. An issue due in 2016 was priced to yield 6.35 percent. **********Underwriters said the financing included zero-coupon bonds, which make no quarterly interest payment, but if held to maturity yield from 5.70 percent in 2001 to 6.25 percent in 2007. **********The issue is rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor's, expect for the zero coupons, which are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and are rated triple-A. **********With the municipal market somewhat stablized, New York City priced a $250 million tax-exempt general obligation variable rate issue through J. P. Morgan Securities. **********The debt issue has a 0.95 percent coupon and is offered with various maturity dates and at various prices, with a 10-year noncall provision. Underwriters report the issue is triple-A rated by Moody's and S.& P. because it is insured by Ambac, M.B.I.A. and the Financial Security Assurance. **********At the Treasury's weekly bill auction of new three- and six-month securities, the average discount rates were mixed. The discount rate for a three-month bill was 3.63 percent, down from 3.71 percent last week. **********The rate for a six-month bill increased to 4.03 percent, from 4.02 percent last week and is the highest rate at auction since March 30, 1992, when it was 4.19 percent. **********The following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures)              3-Mo.

North Korea has threatened to attack South Korea if sanctions are imposed. **********Washington's decision to seek the sanctions follows more than a year of on-again, off-again talks in which American officials have sought to coax North Korea to agree to strict controls on its nuclear program. **********""They have triggered this, not the United States or anyone else,"" President Clinton told reporters in Rome today. ""I just don't think we can walk away from this."" **********But even as the Administration vowed to seek sanctions, key elements of its plan remained unclear, including whether China would go along and what steps North Korea would have to take to end any sanctions that might be imposed. **********Administration officials said the sanctions needed to be painful enough to induce the North Koreans to reconsider the decision to proceed with their nuclear weapons program while leaving open the possibility of a diplomatic solution. **********An Administration official, who asked not to be identified, said one plan that has been promoted by Robert Gallucci, the Administration's top official on policy toward North Korea, has two main elements: calling on other countries to refrain from arms purchases or deliveries, and seeking a cut-off in the $600 million to $1.6 billion in annual remittances sent back to the country by North Koreans living in Japan. **********Other possible measures include suspending North Korea's membership in international organizations, cutting off technical assistance and banning non-commercial airline flights. The most Draconian measure would be a full-scale trade embargo, which would ban oil shipments. But the general view among officials is that such a measure would go beyond what China and other Asian countries are willing to accept. **********Senior Administration officials declined to explain their sanctions plan, saying that Mr. Gallucci planned to discuss the proposed measures with South Korean and Japanese officials on Friday. One official said, however, that Washington was still in the process of hammering out its position. **********China's position is important because it wields a veto in the United Nations Security Council, supplies oil and food to North Korea and has a long border with North Korea. Although the Administration has sought to justify its decision to award most-favored-nation trading status to China by saying Beijing's cooperation is needed in dealing with North Korea, it is still unclear whether China in fact would support sanctions. **********In Beijing today, China warned against increasing the confrontation with North Korea. ""At this time, we do not favor the resort to means that might sharpen the confrontation,"" said Shen Guofang, Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a news conference. **********Russia also urged the Administration to move slowly. In Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin said a Russian-proposed international conference should be convened before sanctions are imposed. **********""Today, when no decision has been taken on calling an international conference, it is too early to talk about sanctions,"" Mr. Yeltsin said. **********But Administration officials said that Russia is much less of an obstacle to sanctions than China and that Russian diplomats at the United Nations have been generally cooperative on the question. Other Options Exist **********Even if the Security Council refused to support sanctions, there are some measures that Washington and its allies could take on their own, such as persuading Japan to cut off financial transfers. **********North Korea's threats to retaliate if sanctions are imposed are another worry. Echoing its bellicose warnings that sanctions could be an act of war, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Kim Yong Nam, sent a letter on Saturday to the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, warning that sanctions would ""bring devastating consequences, menacing peace in Asia and the rest of the world."" **********The Pentagon said today that there were no indications that North Korea, which has concentrated much of its 1.2 million-member military close to South Korea, was about to attack. As a precaution, the Pentagon has already shipped Patriot antimissile systems and additional spare parts and other supplies to the area. **********American military officials said the aircraft carrier Independence would leave Japan on Friday for a major exercise near Hawaii. Because of the heightened tensions, military officials were thinking about keeping the Independence west of Midway Island so that it could steam toward Korea if a crisis developed. **********Another way the North Koreans could retaliate is by withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rejecting all constraints on its nuclear program. Despite its dispute with the International Atomic Energy Agency, North Korea has continued to allow monitors to visit its nuclear site to determine that it is not being used to build up a nuclear arsenal. **********At issue is North Korea's refusal to permit international inspectors to examine 300 of the 8,000 fuel rods in its nuclear reactor in order to determine how much plutonium might have diverted in past years. **********The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that North Korea diverted enough plutonium for one or two bombs after it shut down its nuclear reactor in 1989 and that there is a ""better than even"" chance it has actually developed one or two nuclear weapons. **********North Korea has denied this. But in recent weeks the North Koreans began furiously pulling out fuel rods from the reactor at Yongbyon and dumping them indiscriminately into a cooling pond. **********Today, Hans Blix, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, sent a letter to Mr. Boutros-Ghali noting that the North Koreans had removed so many rods that they had made it impossible for the agency to conduct its measurements. Need for Cooperation **********Mr. Blix wrote that the agency's ability to determine whether plutonium was diverted ""has been seriously eroded because of the discharge of the core."" **********""The situation resulting from the core discharge is irreversible,"" Mr. Blix added. **********But Mr. Blix also suggested that there were other ways for the agency to reconstruct the history of the reactor and to try to determine whether plutonium had been diverted. **********""For the agency to be able to verify non-diversion"" by the North Koreans, Mr. Blix wrote, ""it is essential for the agency to have access to all safeguards, relevant information and locations. To achieve that, a paramount requirement is the full cooperation"" of North Korea. **********One way of gaining additional information would be to send inspectors to two nuclear waste sites at Yongbyon. But the North Koreans have steadfastly refused to give international monitors access to the sites. **********Mr. Blix is traveling to the United Nations to meet with the Security Council on Friday, United Nations officials said. **********With North Korea rejecting Washington's earlier conciliatory overture, the matter has become a hot issue for Mr. Clinton, who is being criticized for what some say is a vacillating foreign policy. **********Some American officials say the Administration was obliged to seek sanctions to maintain its credibility. But a comprehensive analysis prepared by American intelligence agencies last year said it was unlikely that sanctions would induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.  Building Second Reactor **********North Korea has been working hard to construct a second, larger reactor and to expand its ability to reprocess plutonium. The fuel that it is now being removed from its reactor is enough to build four or five bombs. **********North Korea's population is inured to economic deprivation. Some trading partners that provide oil for arms, like Iran, are unlikely to be swayed by a United Nations call to action. **********A key question is what exactly the Administration hopes to achieve through sanctions. If they were imposed, would North Korea have to help the atomic energy agency determine whether plutonium had been diverted to get them lifted? Would it need to do more, such as halting the construction of its second reactor and the expansion of its nuclear reprocessing ability? **********Would the Security Council agree to a gradual toughening of sanctions and, if so, over what time frame? **********""The objective is to have North Korea reconsider its position and find it in its interest to move back to negotiations and settle this matter,"" a senior Administration official said."

Political experts here warn that the emerging deals to win its passage could still collapse. But over the past few days the opposition to the bill from the Liberal Democratic Party, which was ousted from power last year after 38 years in office, has begun to crumble. **********A growing number of Liberal Democrats have begun to fear that they will be blamed if the bill fails, and some younger members of the party are leaving it, with more threatening to follow if they are asked to vote against the bill. Meanwhile, Mr. Hosokawa's operatives appear to be stemming a loss of votes from the Socilasts, who are part of the coalition government but fear that the new system will drive them to the brink of extinction. **********For days members of the Liberal Demcoratic Party have been trying to delay the vote, hoping time will run out before the Parliament goes out of session in late January. Today they succeeded in ousting the head of a committee in the upper house that is shepherding the complex legislation through Parliament. But those largely seem to be stalling tactics, and the party is reportedly secretly negotiating with the governing coalition over what final form the electoral districts and campaign rules may take. **********Today a group of two dozen Liberal Democrats charged that ""we must fight a fascist trend"" in Mr. Hosokawa's Government to close debate on the issue and move to a vote, perhaps as early as Jan. 19. But their effort to portray Mr. Hosokawa as incompetent in economic matters, and to link him to scandals, have largely failed. **********The Prime Minister successfully turned back a demand that he pass the budget and a number of major economic measures before returning to political reform sometime later in the year. Then, an effort by the Liberal Democrats to boycott parliamentary debates on the reform bill fell apart, and the party is putting together a last-ditch counterproposal. **********Mr. Hosokawa has been under attack from the left as well. The Socialists, the largest party in his coalition, held their annual convention today and passed by voice vote a resolution to keep supporting the Government despite their sharp ideological differences with the other parties in the coalition. **********There was considerable opposition to the resolution, but by some counts only 5 to 10 Socialists will defect from the party and vote against the political reform measures. The coalition may be able to make up the deficiency by with support from younger Liberal Democrats, eager to show that they are different from their elders. **********""The L.D.P. is fracturing faster than the Socialists,"" one senior government official who is tracking the fate of the bill carefully said today. ""The Socialists want to hang on to their first taste of power after decades in the wilderness, even if it means another compromise of principles."" **********The party has already given up its opposition to opening the rice market, and it is backing away from a number of its positions on foreign policy. **********Mr. Hosokawa has staked his premiership on passage of the bill. It already passed the lower house of Parliament, where the coalition parties are stronger. **********The bill would put sharp limits on the amounts that corporations can donate to politicians or their support groups, which are frequently a means of sidestepping the existing contribution limits. It would also move to a system in which each parliamentary district is served by one representative, instead of the three to five who now represent each area. That system led to a situation in which Liberal Democrats often ran against one another, and competed on their ability to hand out favors rather than on any policy differences."

W. de Klerk's concession speech apparently sparked a heavy barrage of gunfire in Umlazi and the nearby black township of KwaMashu, where supporters of the African National Congress were believed to be celebrating. Shooting in Downtown Durban **********Meanwhile, bursts of heavy-caliber weapons fire erupted in the streets of downtown Durban tonight as several thousand congress supporters also reveled in their party's victory. **********In an interview earlier today, Mrs. Miller said once the final results were announced, violence would almost certainly increase. ""With the winner of the election,"" she said, ""there's going to be jubilation, and the loser's probably going to be uptight about that, and in itself, that will be confrontational."" **********Vasco Shengu, a community development worker in Umlazi, agreed: ""A lot of people are going to be killed, because there's a widespread suspicion here that the elections were not free and fair."" **********Indeed, there were already signs tonight that Inkatha might challenge the results. Earlier today the party submitted a 40-page complaint alleging that the election was seriously marred by irregularities.  Most Violent Region **********Natal province has a fifth of South Africa's population, but is believed to have been the scene of nearly half of the country's political killings in the last 10 years. **********For a brief time last week, as millions of people flocked to the polls, the factional violence and bloodshed that has cursed much of Natal ceased. And many of the people of this sprawling black township dared to hope that the elections might bring lasting peace. **********But within hours after the polls closed, a hand grenade exploded on Grace Ngcongo's front lawn, harming no one but shattering the delicious mood of euphoria she had felt since casting her vote in South Africa's first post-apartheid elections. **********""I really thought things would get better here,"" Miss Ngcongo said. Like most victims of violence here, Ms.  Ngcongo insisted her family was not active in politics. **********Nonetheless, since the first time since they moved here in 1966, they were considering finding a new place. **********""I don't want to take any changes,"" Miss Ngcongo said, ""you can never tell when they might come back."""

A Family Hopes To Net $60 Million By Converting A Boston Property Company Into A Real Estate Trust"," **********THE Beacon Companies, a 48-year-old Boston development, construction and management enterprise, is seeking to transform itself into a real estate investment trust, or REIT. **********The trust would own seven downtown office buildings with 4.5 million square feet, two suburban office parks and a six-building office development in Arlington, Va. **********A filing has been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a decision is expected within a month or so. Until then, Beacon said it could not comment on the filing. But if the offering is made, the trust would be expected to raise about $180 million on the sale of 8.9 million shares, and receive a $125 million line of credit from the Bank of Boston. **********The trust would be one of a few in the country with assets that consist primarily of downtown office properties. **********REIT's are exempt from corporate taxes and trade shares publicly. They must invest virtually all their funds in real estate and return about 95 percent of profits to investors. They are often run by the same owner-management that operated the properties before converting them. **********Two of the properties in the offering proposal -- 150 Federal Street in Boston, completed in 1988 and with 530,200 square feet of space, and the Polk & Taylor Buildings in Arlington, with 890,000 square feet, completed in 1970 -- will be bought if the REIT succeeds. **********The other properties it would own in the Boston area are One Post Office Square, completed in 1981, with 764,129 square feet; Center Plaza, opened from 1966 through 1969 with a total of 649,359 square feet; Rowe's Wharf, three buildings on Boston Harbor opened in 1987 with 344,326 square feet; 175 Federal Street, built in 1977 with 203,349 square feet; South Station, renovated in 1988, with 148,591 square feet; Wellesley Office Park, seven buildings built in 1984, with 559,910 square feet and the Bedford Research Park, five buildings built in 1981, with 336,000 square feet. **********""This is a major test,"" said Steven E. Wheeler, managing director of Copley Real Estate Advisers, an affiliate of the New England, the insurance company. ""As the first office transaction in a market that has touched bottom and is still not at the peak of health, if this REIT succeeds, others will follow in New York and Chicago."" **********Few other office owners seek public ownership because their portfolios are not large enough, they may not have a long, unblemished management history, or they do not want to incur an underwriting fee, like the $13 million Beacon will pay to Merrill Lynch. **********Some owners do not want the scrutiny from the S.E.C. or the danger of seeing stock prices plummet if the trust fails to pay shareholders the anticipated return. **********""You lose control of the enterprise once you sell it and are no longer master of your own destiny,"" said Peter M. Small, chairman of Spaulding & Slye, a big downtown property owner here. **********Beacon owns some property as joint-venture partnerships, which some believe could complicate decision making by the REIT's management. Ten-year leases signed at the high rental rates of the mid- to late 1980's will come due in the next few years. If rates fall, the income generated by a property could drop, dampening investor returns. **********Lower rental income could also worsen problems for a developer like Beacon, which already pays high rates for money borrowed in the 1980's. **********Beacon's founder and top manager, Norman Leventhal, 76, his son, Alan, 41, and son-in-law, Edwin N. Sidman, 51, will continue to manage the properties, which are owned with various joint-venture partners. Also included in the REIT would be construction and design companies owned by Beacon. **********Of the money raised by the REIT, $78.8 million will be used to pay debt on the suburban offices here, One Post Office Square and South Station. **********The family will also own 32 percent of Beacon Office Properties L. P., the tax-exempt operating company that holds the equity interest in the properties and the management, design and construction companies. If the REIT raises the expected $180 million, the family share would be worth about $60 million. **********For the eldest Mr. Leventhal, this could be a good estate planning mechanism. To sell his holdings in this market -- in which rents have fallen 30 to 50 percent and property values as much as 70 percent -- would mean large losses and tax liability. **********Most important, the company would have money to grow at a time when financing for commercial real estate is scarce and expensive."

Tests indicated she did not have plague. **********Earlier, the bacterial infection was ruled out in two other airline passengers who arrived in the United States at Kennedy airport and in Dallas in recent days, the official, Dr. Duane J. Gubler of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said. **********Five additional countries -- Bangladesh, Canada, England, Germany and Pakistan -- have investigated suspected cases among travelers who became ill within a week of leaving India where an epidemic of pneumonic form of the disease has struck in recent weeks. **********""We've been lucky so far,"" Dr. Gubler said in an interview. **********Although the World Health Organization has not advised against travel to India, the United Nations agency in Geneva is about to add New Delhi to its list of plague infected areas because Indian officials have reported four secondary cases there. New Delhi will remain on the list for two weeks after the last case is reported there, Dr. Lindsey Martinez, a W.H.O. official said. **********India has reported 4,780 suspect cases of plague, including 51 deaths, to the World Health Organization. **********Airlines in several countries have suspended flights to and from India and some countries have banned cargo from India. However, there were signs yesterday that several countries were about to ease the stiff controls soon as Indian health officials said the tide was turning against plague. **********Yesterday Dr. Gubler said laboratory tests confirmed that a 12-year old boy in Long Beach, Calif. had developed dengue fever, not plague, 10 days after his return from India.

But Father Aristide is keeping his intentions to himself. **********His only political act today was to sign a decree expressing his agreement with the law on amnesty passed on Friday by the Haitian Parliament. The law fell short of the general amnesty sought by the head of the Haitian junta, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, leaving the leaders of the 1991 coup that toppled President Aristide potentially vulnerable to charges of corruption and murder. **********The failure to win a complete amnesty was a factor in the general's decision to leave Haiti, United States officials said. **********A senior Administration official said that with General Cedras departing for an undisclosed destination, the rest of the military-led government would dissolve this week. He said he thought that cabinet ministers appointed by General Cedras would vacate their offices and that ministers who served under President Aristide would return to work. **********""He has a cabinet, and our hope is that they'll be able to go back to work this week,"" the Administration official said. Some of the 20,000 American troops in Haiti will be ""protecting the functioning of the government, protecting the Parliament,"" he said. **********The resistance to Father Aristide among the Haitian military and police remains strong, so strong that United States forces in Haiti are planning to sweep important government buildings for bombs and booby traps before he returns, State Department officials said today. **********Still, it has been clear since the arrival of American troops permitted some free expressions of political opinion in Haiti that the overwhelming majority of Haitians -- certainly the 67.5 percent of the electorate who voted for him in 1990 -- will be overjoyed to see him back. **********""I am pleased to announce that President Aristide will return home to resume his rightful place this Saturday,"" President Clinton said in his televised speech tonight. ""I also want to caution again, the job in Haiti remains difficult and dangerous. We still have a lot of work ahead of us. But our troops are keeping America's commitment to restore democracy."" **********It is possible that Secretary of State Warren Christopher will accompany Father Aristide to Haiti on Saturday. But a large number of American supporters of the Haitian President also want very much to be on that plane. They include the Rev. Jesse Jackson, several members of Congress and Randall Robinson, whose hunger strike on Father Aristide's behalf this year is widely credited with focusing Mr. Clinton's attention on the Haitian situation. **********From the moment Father Aristide sets foot on Haitian soil after more than three years in exile, he will face the task of building a democratic government in a nation that has never known one. The economic and social foundations of the country are in ruins. **********Within days after his return, a trickle and then a flood of financial and material aid is supposed to descend on Haiti. The United States is setting up a jobs program that in theory will put 50,000 Haitians to work by 1995. **********Fifteen nations have pledged $77 million in contributions that will wipe out most of Haiti's debts to international financial institutions, allowing new loans to flow in."

But in the right setting, rewards like sending pistachios to salespeople who excel may be appropriate and worthwhile recognition tools. **********He goes astray, however, in his ""fast food"" approach to rewards; good recognition strategies cannot simply be plucked from a book and plopped into an organization. Such programs must be carefully designed as part of an overall program. They must be tailored to an organization's specific business strategy, work culture and values and help it achieve specific goals. **********Reward and recognition must be part of fully integrated, dynamic human resources efforts that champion not just the organization but the people who give it life and move it forward.

Within hours, in accordance with longstanding Internet procedures, the humor was copied and passed electronically to friends, electronic mailing lists and discussion groups on other computer networks. **********Eventually, the story reached the talk show host Rush Limbaugh, a frequent user of the Compuserve network, who read it on his nationally syndicated television program as part of his opening monologue. **********Outraged listeners who didn't get the joke got in touch with the Microsoft Corporation, which after fielding complaints for several days issued its own electronic news release on Dec. 16. **********""In response to a ficticious Associated Press story,"" the company's release began, ""Microsoft wishes to clarify that the story has no truth and was not generated by the company."" **********Later that day, The Associated Press -- apparently the real Associated Press this time -- issued its own electronic clarification of Microsoft's clarification. **********""The fake news story purported to have been written by The Associated Press,"" the A.P. release said.

The investment banking firm, which was spun off from the American Express Company in May, said the offer would expire on Oct. 11, although the offer might be extended.

It said it did not expect the adjustments to change full-year results for those years, but did not explain further. **********""While the company cannot at this time evaluate the accuracy of the allegations, it believes that nothing in the allegations will materially adversely affect the company's financial position,"" Woolworth said in a statement. Effect on Turnaround Feared **********Stunned analysts were worried that the developments might delay the continued turnaround of the company. The stock dropped $1, to $17 a share, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, and both Moody's and Standard & Poor's said Woolworth's announcement called the company's financial controls and integrity into question. **********The company's statement did not indicate who had raised the allegations of accounting improprieties. It said the reported irregularities might include the accounting procedures that were forcing the company to restate interim financial results for the year that ended on Jan. 29. **********Howard M. Schilit, an accounting professor at American University and the author of ""Financial Shenanigans,"" a guide to common accounting gimmicks, said the company's statement implied that it might have overstated the value of its inventory. Dr. Schilit and some Wall Street analysts suggested that the restructuring efforts Woolworth had undertaken to bolster its faltering business, including marking down inventory, could be to blame for its errors in calculating its gross profit margin. **********""They've done a lot of things this past year that could inadvertently cause an error,"" said Monroe H. Greenstein, a retail analyst at Lazard Freres. ""I'd be as surprised as the next person if this was anything deliberate."" **********Frances E. Trachter, a spokeswoman for Woolworth, would not address questions beyond one about which board members were appointed to the special committee. ""The company believes that the release speaks for itself,"" she said. **********She declined to name the board members on the committee other than John W. Adams, who is also chairman of the company's audit committee. The company said the special committee had retained the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick as its advisers in the investigation. **********Price Waterhouse is the company's outside auditing firm. ""Whatever has happened, no one is questioning the financial statements audited by Price Waterhouse,"" said Peter Horowitz, a spokesman for the accounting firm. **********The company is restating its interim financial statements, which are typically audited using less thorough tests than those used for year-end audits. **********William K. Lavin, who was named chairman and chief executive of Woolworth last July, was previously the chief financial officer, and apparently some of the reported irregularities occured when the books were under his supervision. Mr. Lavin did not return calls to his office. Confidence an Issue **********""The company is still facing questions about its prospects for a turnaround and the safety of the dividend, but those issues may now become secondary to confidence in management's integrity,"" said Janet Mangano, a retail analyst for Burnham Securities. **********Moody's Investors Services yesterday placed some of the company's long-term debt ratings and its commercial paper rating under review for a possible downgrade. Standard & Poor's, another credit rating agency, put Woolworth on its credit watch list for a potential downgrade and said yesterday that the company's announcement of an investigation had increased the possibility of a stiffer downgrade. **********Ms. Mangano noted that in the second quarter of its last fiscal year, Woolworth had reported a charge of $5 million for bad checks, primarily in its Foot Locker division. ""That's a huge amount for bad checks,"" she said. ""It suggests that controls were not tight enough at the store level and that maybe policies weren't enforced or articulated clearly enough from the top."" Impact on Restructuring **********Woolworth has been taking steps to restructure its faltering business, ridding itself of weak stores and revaluing inventories, but no one expects a turnaround soon. Ms. Mangano and other analysts said the shadow an investigation would cast over the company might further delay improvement in its business. **********For a time, its Foot Locker specialty stores and the Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker spinoffs had buoyed the company with strong sales of athletic shoes. But fashion trends have shifted toward rugged leather footwear, which has depressed the growth in those specialty chains. In the latest fiscal year, Woolworth had a loss of $104 million, or $3.76 a share, compared with profits of $280 million, or $2.14, in the previous year. **********And Woolworth's myriad other specialty chains, which include Afterthoughts, Champs Sports and Northern Reflections, have never really taken off. The company, which had about $10 billion in sales in the year that ended on Jan. 29, has used the strong cash flow of its general merchandise stores to develop a global specialty-store empire. **********Wall Street has been concerned that its weak financial performance would pressure Woolworth to reduce its dividend, which has been its chief attraction to most investors."

Relative calm returned for several weeks after the election in January of a successor, Cyprien Ntaryamira, but fighting resumed in recent weeks with renewed fury. **********""Dozens of bodies have been recovered from two rivers and we are still finding more bodies,"" Jean Karekezi, the director of Burundi's Cabinet, told The Associated Press after violence was reported this past week in the capital, Bujumbura. **********The conflict involves two ethnic groups, the majority Hutus, an agricultural people, and the minority Tutsi tribe, a pastoral people from the north of the country. The Tutsi, who make up about 14 percent of Burundi's six million people, have traditionally controlled the Government and the army. **********Mr. Ndadaye, a 40-year-old banker and the country's first democratically elected President since Burundi became independent from Belgium in 1962, was a Hutu. He had tried to create a broad-based Government, naming 9 Tutsis among his 23 ministers, including the Prime Minister. Mr. Ndadaye cautiously tried to dilute Tutsi control in the security forces and find ways to repatriate hundreds of thousands of mostly Hutu refugees living abroad. He lasted 100 days in office. **********At one point after the coup, when the new Government appeared to have restored a semblance of order and Hutu refugees began to return to their farms, renegade army units renewed the killings. **********The United States suspended its $16 million aid program to Burundi after the coup and later rejected an appeal to send troops there as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission. Instead, it joined other members of the Security Council in asking Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send a fact-finding team, which is now in Burundi."

On Feb. 11, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department ordered Met Life to make the offer to policyholders. The department also fined the insurer $1.5 million for issuing unapproved insurance forms and for misleading sales and marketing that misrepresented life insurance as a retirement plan. Met Life mailed 7,500 letters and expects to send the remainder later this month to policyholders who bought policies between Jan. 1, 1990, and Dec. 31, 1993, Ms. Maleski said.

Of the top 10 gainers in Nasdaq stocks, eight were technology or biotechnology stocks.

The price of the long bond fell 9/32 yesterday, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.39 percent from 7.37 percent. **********The dollar fell yesterday, despite the Fed's interest-rate move, which pays foreigners and other investors more money to hold dollar-denominated assets. Commodity prices were largely unchanged, in part a reflection of traders' more optimistic outlook on inflation in the wake of the Fed move. The Commodity Research Bureau index rose 0.36 point, to 229.53, in part on price rises in lumber, cotton and soybean meal that were offset by falls in pork bellies and coffee. Reaction to Fed Move **********The unsettled market reaction yesterday to the Fed's move stemmed from uncertainty as to how to assess the consequences of the increase. The move is sure to slow the economy further, bolstering bonds and strengthening the weak dollar, at least for yesterday. **********But it would also weaken corporate profits and thus hurt stocks, at least for the short run.

Luce became founding editor of Time magazine. He will succeed Jason McManus, editor in chief since 1988, who will retire Dec. 31, a year before his five-year contract expires. **********Mr. Pearlstine and Don Logan, the new chief executive of Time Inc., will be in charge of defining the company's position in the brave new world of electronic and multimedia publishing while preserving the company's primacy in print. **********As reports began to circulate last month that Time Inc. was about to appoint Mr. Pearlstine as editor in chief -- jumping over at least a couple of longtime editors who had been considered contenders for the job -- anxiety rippled through the company's magazines. Every effort was made yesterday to assure staff members that succession would be orderly and that the culture of Time Inc. would not be damaged. **********Mr. Pearlstine said in an interview that the magazines would continue to be the core of Time Inc., no matter what direction the company decided to take with emerging technologies. **********""I believe strongly that in my working career, magazines as we now know them will be the predominant product of Time Inc.,"" Mr. Pearlstine said. ""I think new media is critically important and will play a very important role, but my own personal belief is that the bulk of circulation and business is going to be magazines and print."" **********Mr. Pearlstine brings to the job 22 years of experience in newspaper publishing at The Wall Street Journal. His magazine experience was acquired during two years as executive editor of Forbes from 1978 to 1980. In 1992, while executive editor at The Journal, he also engineered the successful start-up of Smart Money magazine, a joint venture between Hearst Magazines and Dow Jones & Company, the owner of The Wall Street Journal. **********He resigned from The Journal in 1992. In April 1993, Mr. Pearlstine was named general partner of Friday Holdings, L.P., a partnership formed to acquire, invest in, start up and operate media properties. **********Time Inc. has become a leader among magazine companies in testing the possibilities of interactive and electronic publishing. Its ventures have included on-line services, CD-ROM's, newsletters, and, most recently, Time Daily, a news service that gives computer users quick access to regularly updated news summaries. **********Mr. Pearlstine said he believed that all forms of news media were going through an extraordinary period of upheaval and change, ""where no one I have met has clear answers about the implications of technology or changing markets."" **********After several weeks of poring over the Time Inc. magazines, which include People, Money, Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly and Fortune as well as Time, Mr. Pearlstine said he thought they were ""in pretty darn good shape and delivering first-rate journalism that provides value to readers."" **********Mr. Pearlstine said he did not have a vision of what these publications ought to be, ""but I do have a vision that says, like it or not, these publications will be different."" **********""Even though I believe in the future of print,"" he continued, ""there will be changing demands from the consumer and changing ways of gathering and distributing information. But I believe that at least over the next decade the magazine as we now know it is still going to be the vehicle to drive that business."" **********Mr. Pearlstine was considered an energetic and imaginative editor at The Journal who presided over a number of changes, including going to a three-part paper. **********""He was the best boss I ever had,"" said James B. Stewart, author of ""Den of Thieves,"" who was page 1 editor at The Journal between 1988 and 1992 and is now a contributing editor at Smart Money. ""He had the best intuitive understanding of when you needed encouragement and when you needed support."" **********Yesterday's announcement marks the second time in little more than a month that Time Inc. has chosen a top official without deep roots in the company's culture. Mr. Logan, the former chief executive of the Southern Progress Corporation who became president of Time Inc. in 1992, was appointed chief executive on Aug. 3. **********Mr. McManus, 60, made it clear in a memo to the staff yesterday that he had recommended Mr. Pearlstine to Gerald M. Levin, chief executive of Time Warner, and the Time Warner board of directors. **********In an interview, Mr. McManus said he made the decision in January to resign at the end of the year partly ""for personal reasons,"" but also because ""in this fast-changing world, one of the critical functions of senior management is knowing when to stay and when to go -- and most people stay too long."" **********Besides its magazines, Time Inc.  operates a large book-publishing business, which includes Book-of-the-Month Club; Little, Brown; Warner Books; Oxmoor House, and Sunset Books. Time Inc. revenue accounts for more than $3.2 billion of Time Warner's $14.5 billion total revenues."

In the past 11 years, this Western influenced-African nation has bounced back from the brink of bankruptcy to become, in the minds of some market analysts, a beacon of economic hope for an ailing continent. **********While many other nations on the continent have slipped deeper into debt, further into the quicksand of corruption, and into the ravages of war, Morocco has quietly moved in other directions, analysts add. **********Part of Morocco's plan has been to attract businesses from wealthier nations in Europe, which are anxious to make use of Morocco's burgeoning supply of cheap labor. Their operations have helped to create employment and stability in Morocco. **********Lifting restrictions on foreign investment, privatizing monolithic state enterprises, and making the stock market available to both domestic and international investors alike have also provided boosts for the country's market. **********Morocco's budget deficit, according to a report by Baring Securities, has been reduced from over 13 percent of GDP in 1981, to 1.7 percent by the end of last year, while inflation has also fallen significantly. **********These changes, moreover, have been noticed. Earlier this year, investment guru George Soros met with Faoud Filali - King Hassan's son-in-law and head of ONA, Morocco's leading company - in an effort to purchase a 10 percent stake in the firm. The interest by the noted investor ""Put Morocco on the map for a lot of people,"" remarked Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner for Kleiman International Consultants in Washington. **********Mr. Soros was reported to have paid $40 million for 2 percent of ONA's shares and 15 percent of a financial subsidiary. **********Thomas Caplan, New York-based portfolio manager for Bridge Capital Corp., which runs the offshore First Morocco fund, said that in Morocco, ""The potential exists to multiply one's money."" **********It's not all gravy, however. Mr. Caplan noted that, at present, the Casablanca Stock Exchange has some very illiquid shares. So while particularly well-heeled investors might want to allocate a portion of their funds to a country like Morocco, the market is unsuitable for others. **********For those who can stand the risk, there are three ways to get in - through a country fund (which usually includes Morocco and neighboring Tunisia), an Africa fund with weighting in Morocco, or through the purchase of individual shares. **********Ian Wilson, editor of the Micropal Emerging Market Fund Monitor, noted that of the few Morocco funds now in existence, the Maroc Privatization Fund recently led the pack with a total return of 15.51 percent for the first half of this year. The Casablanca Stock Exchange rose 28 percent over the same period. **********Another possibility is the Atlas Maroc fund, which rose 4.99 percent during the three month period ending June 30. Also of interest, Mr. Wilson said, is the Framlington Maghreb Fund, a closed-end vehicle now being set up. It will be listed in Dublin. **********Jean-Marc DuBois, manager of the Maroc Privatization fund, said he presently has ""a lot of financial companies"" in the portfolio, but noted that he is currently planning to add more shares to the fund later in the year as more privatizations go through. **********Indeed, the current Moroccan plan calls for 112 companies to be put on the block over the next year or two, and is expected to raise about $2.2 billion. The privatizations will add a ""major boost"" to market capitalization, according to a Barings Securities report. **********Those who want to make their own individual stock picks will find there are no Moroccan ADRs listed on U.S. exchanges. However, shares traded on the Casablanca exchange can be purchased by foreigners through international brokers."

Barry Diller, head of QVC, is rarin' to go at 52. He'd worked on programming at ABC and created the Fox network, and he's wanted to get back into prime time -- as witness his failed effort to buy Paramount. Laurence Tisch, at 71, has really treated CBS as an investment and is ready to cash part of it in. But don't think, as David Letterman suggested, that the ""60 Minutes"" stopwatch will now be ""yours for $49.95."" CBS will, however, get a desired foothold in cable. So why did both CBS and QVC stock jump so sharply? Perhaps because, as one CBS executive put it, Mr. Tisch just ""put the money in the bank,"" and now Mr. Diller will breathe life, and growth, into the company. Or perhaps, heaven help us, we're in for another bidding war. (Disney has been mentioned as eyeing CBS.) **********Have Phone, Will Amble  Not long ago, the phone business seemed downright orderly (back when phones had cords and calls traveled over wires). AT&T and its rivals had long distance, the Baby Bells short distance. But then this wireless stuff started, and cable got mixed up in it, and now it's a free-for-all again. AT&T is trying to buy McCaw, the No. 1 cellular company, but Bell Atlantic is determined to take them on. Last week it agreed to merge its cellular holdings with Nynex's, locking up a big chunk of the East Coast, and it's eyeing other alliances across the nation. And as these giants battle it out, the competition should drive down those hefty rates for cellular calls -- and clog the sidewalks with people walking along having very serious phone conversations. Once They Built a Railroad . . .  News about railroads is somehow comforting amid the talk of vast realignments in television, of phone calls swirling through the air. Railroads are so elemental, rolling bits of history. Since deregulation in 1980, though, they've been combining to cut costs, and last week saw two of the biggest join hands. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific (owner of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe) plan to merge in a $2.7 billion stock swap. The new company will have 31,000 miles of track in the Midwest, Southeast and West. The new name's a mouthful, though. Can you imagine Judy Garland singing, ""On the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company""? Blue Cross Joins the Fray  The health care sands keep shifting before our eyes. For 60 years Blue Cross and Blue Shield has been the symbol of nonprofit sprawl, but that approach just may not work anymore. With insurers creating vast alliances, all the managed-care networks need to invest in fancy technology. So last week Blue Cross said, well, profit is O.K. after all -- and allowed its members to shed their nonprofit yokes and sell stock. The move drew some fire, with one critic fearful of seeing ""healthy profits become more important than healthy patients."" And what of battered Empire Blue Cross? Nonprofit is just fine, it said -- surely realizing investors would be scarce anyway. The Intel Variation  Companies adore sports; with America's fixation on bouncing balls and swinging bats and grunting millionaires, any sponsor that shoves its name in front of fans gets big-time visibility. But chess? Uh, we'll just watch some paint dry, thanks. But now comes Intel, which says chess can be turned into a spectator sport, and is sponsoring the Professional Chess Association, led by the world champion, Gary Kasparov. Last week at the Javits Center, Intel assembled top world players, made them move before fans nodded off (maximum game time: 50 minutes), and added in big screens and fancy graphics. The Knicks? How's their pawn center? A Pyramid for the West Side  Most people's real estate dreams are modest -- a first house, fixing a kitchen. But Donald Trump's dreams have always been of a different order. For a decade he's pined to erect a high-rise colossus along the Hudson from 59th to 72d, always to be delayed by debts and doubters. But last week his Riverside South -- 5,000 or so apartments, 16 towers -- suddenly seemed real. A group of Hong Kong investors came up with some big money (amount: unspecified) to get him started, and work could actually begin within a year. It's a ""solid vote of confidence in New York City,"" said Mayor Giuliani. But critics, like the Coalition for a Livable West Side, still aren't cheering. ECONOMY Health Care: The Longest Battle  Has this endless health care battle been worse than Normandy? When Sam Gibbons, who grabbed the House health baton when Dan Rostenkowski was sent to the doghouse, was asked that, he said only, ""It was longer."" But for Mr. Gibbons's Ways and Means Committee, at least, it ended last week, as the panel barely passed legislation that includes two items on the President's must-have list: coverage for all, with employers picking up most of the tab. In the Senate, though, Pat Moynihan and Bob Dole faced off in the Finance Committee on a requirement for employers to pay for coverage, and Mr. Moynihan was soundly defeated. By the time this increasingly partisan jockeying is over, of course, the health industry may reinvent itself to the point that most ""reform"" is redundant.  Cuomo Finds a Soft Spot  ""I can't give money away to make myself popular,"" Gov. Mario Cuomo said in February, referring to some state taxes that retired Federal employees had paid and now wanted back. In the late 80's, it seems, New York made Federal retirees pay taxes on pension income while exempting state workers. The Supreme Court put an end to that in 1989, and then retirees demanded the taxes back that they'd paid from 1986 to 1988, but Mr. Cuomo was balking. Last week, though, he said the state would refund some $62 million -- an average of $6,000 per retiree. The Numbers Never Wilt  School's out, July 4 is upon us: this nation's thinking summer. But still the economic numbers come, like the sorcerer's merciless brooms, so pore we must over these wispy smoke signals. What does last week's batch tell us? A bit of this, a bit of that. New-home sales were strong, consumer confidence hit a four-year high, construction spending posted its third rise. That adds up to economic overheating, imminent inflation. But wait: the leading indicators, which are supposed to sum it all up, were unchanged for the second month -- and that, of course, means cool and steady. So flip a coin, have some designer seltzer, and don't think about it till Tuesday.  Smoke-easies? Not Just Yet  Tobacco companies have been taking out ads raising alarms about cigarettes being banned, but David Kessler, head of the F.D.A., said no such drastic moves are contemplated. In fact, he said, he hopes to avoid big regulatory changes -- in spite of recent disclosures about addiction. It gets tricky, though, because if the F.D.A. declares nicotine an addictive drug -- the almost inevitable next turn in this fast-moving plot -- the legal wheels start turning on autopilot: if it's a drug, the F.D.A. must declare it safe, which is impossible. . . . INTERNATIONAL The Coffee Shock of '94?  Modern life has a handful of essentials. Food, air, fax machines -- and, of course, coffee. So get ready for angry lines at the coffee wagon, alternate-day fill-ups at Zabar's. A cold snap just wiped out a third of the crop in Brazil, which produces a quarter of the world's coffee, and commodity traders reacted as if they'd had a cup too many, sending coffee futures soaring 25 percent in a day, to the highest price in seven years. And even though this was next year's crop, food companies cashed in quickly by raising prices.  Order on the High Seas  For two decades, many nations perched on the earth's land have tried to agree on a law for the earth's water -- a Law of the Sea treaty covering issues like fishing and oil exploration, a recognition that the oceans are a ""common heritage of mankind."" No way, said President Reagan in 1982, saying the pact violated the idea of free enterprise. But last week the Administration said that America would finally sign -- that the pact was friendlier to business now. (Though some conservatives still see too many burdens on business.)"

Apple,1994-01-13,,1110,,The New York Times,World,An Analysis; News Analysis,article,Clinton Looks Homeward,Clinton Looks Homeward," **********Behind all foreign policy there lurks, or ought to lurk, careful political calculation. What the folks at home will not support, the traveling potentate cannot afford to promise. **********So it has been with President Clinton this week, on his maiden voyage to Europe as the leader of the Atlantic alliance. Having seen how quickly American opinion turned sour when the body of an American serviceman was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, to be duly photographed, he is reluctant to make small commitments -- witness the turning back of an American troopship bound for Haiti -- let alone big dangerous ones. No Bold Moves **********Mr. Clinton therefore made no bold move on Bosnia. He issued no ultimatum to the combatants -- do this or we will do that. Instead he and the allies temporized. **********They threatened yet again, as they did to no great effect last August, to use air strikes at Sarajevo, but only under certain conditions and not very soon at that. They added Tuzla and Srebrenica to the list of possible targets, but only pending yet another study of feasibility and suitability. **********Mr. Clinton resisted, likewise, pressures from the East Europeans for full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, obliging them to accept instead the Partnership for Peace, a little-brother status that they did not much like. Russia Has Higher Priority **********One reason is the sensitivity of the Russians. For the moment, at least, Mr. Clinton has given a much higher priority to avoiding offense to the frail forces of reform in Moscow than to strengthening ties to the once-oppressed peoples of the former satellite states that once occupied such a special place in Washington's heart. That reflects the influence of Strobe Talbott, the expert on Russia who has come to dominate this Administration's strategic thinking on Europe. **********But another reason is what membership in NATO means. It is, at bottom, a military alliance, and its members agree to come to the aid of each other if attacked. Expansion would mean the United States was prepared to commit troops to defend Poland or the Czech Republic (and possibly more recent membership applicants, like Lithuania or Romania) if they were attacked. **********Britain's empty guarantees to Poland on the eve of World War II may have been on the mind of Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, when he asked the pivotal question last month: ""Are the United States Congress, the House of Commons, the French Assembly, the German Bundestag solemnly ready to guarantee with the lives of their citizens the frontiers of, say, Slovakia? If not, or not yet, then it would be a deceit to pretend otherwise."" **********President Clinton does not think so, at least not now, and the mood of the country and the Senate would seem to bear him out. He was elected by a country eager to focus on its own problems, not those of the rest of the world, and he has done little to urge it to look abroad, except in terms of economic self-interest. **********Even if the will were there, the means are not. The 100,000 American troops Mr. Clinton promised this week to leave in Europe, no matter what, would certainly not suffice to halt any serious manifestation of Russian expansionism. Dollars are scarce and getting scarcer for the Pentagon. **********""The most effective thing for us,"" an American official said, ""is to try to protect Eastern Europe by encouraging anti-imperialist, democratic tendencies in Russia. The problem is that the United States, or any other outside power, has only very limited influence over events in Russia."" **********But this is a President who likes to have things both ways. So having denied them what they sought, he met in Prague with four Eastern European leaders, led by Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and Lech Walesa of Poland, and came close -- much closer than some of his Western European partners would like -- to telling them, ""Just be patient, and you'll get what you want."" Waiting on NATO **********On Tuesday Jiri Dienstbier, the former Czech Foreign Minister, said in an interview in Rude Pravo, a leftist daily in Prague, ""We must not permit the partnership to remain a sedative or a waiting room in which to await how things turn out in Russia."" **********As if in direct reply, Mr. Clinton said after his round of meetings today: ""While the partnership is not NATO membership, neither is it a permanent holding room. The question is no longer whether NATO will take on new members, but when and how."" **********But when will the right moment come? **********If the American people are not ready to defend Eastern Europe with their sons' and daughters' lives now, when will they be? Surely not until Mr. Clinton or some other President makes a much stronger case than he has so far that the vital interests of the United States are at stake in the independence if these small states. **********If Russia is not to be provoked at any cost, then membership for the Czechs and the others will have to be delayed until Russia has become so stable that even if angered, it would pose no threat to its neighbors. Russian history does not encourage the hope that will happen any day soon. Contemplating a Darker Past **********As Mr. Clinton conceded, ""There is always the chance that the darker past might be re-created."" **********In a way, it already has been, in Bosnia. The failure of the alliance to prevent or even to halt the genocidal war there, in another East European country to which NATO guarantees do not apply, cannot be encouraging to Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic as they contemplate what would happen if they found themselves trapped once more in their tragic geography between East and West. **********After a notably confident performance, Mr. Clinton won plaudits from his Western European colleagues this week, and his own staff seemed feverishly eager to portray him as reasserting American leadership abroad. Along with the usual spin-masters like David Gergen, Secretary of State Warren Christopher joined in the buildup effort, telling reporters he could almost feel America taking charge once again in the Brussels meeting rooms. **********But for all that, there is still no definitive answer to the basic question as to when, where and at what cost the United States will commit its military forces. The Administration has not given its answer, and neither has the public. Until they have spoken, Europe will remain unsettled."

Mitchell, the Majority Leader, who made an impassioned, extemporaneous speech on the Senate floor against those who would have the President unilaterally defy the arms embargo. Fears of Wider War **********Mr. Mitchell said such action would only widen the war, and if that occurred, none of those Senators would be prepared to send in American troops. And yet, he said, they were willing to tell the British and French and other allies, who have troops on the ground, what to do. **********""They are doing what we have been unwilling to do,"" the Maine Democrat said of the allies. ""Their men are being killed. Their men are being wounded. Their countries are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to bring about a resolution to this conflict. And here we are preaching at them, insulting them, telling them, 'You've got to do what we say.' "" **********The Senate is considering an amendment, offered by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, that would order President Clinton to unilaterally end United States participation in the arms embargo. **********Senator Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, introduced his resolution a day after he took the extraordinary step of bringing defense officials from four European countries to lobby in Congress against the Dole-Lieberman amendment. On Wednesday, the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, lobbied the Armed Services Committee behind closed doors, warning that the unilateral lifting of the embargo would severely strain the Atlantic alliance and would force at least the British troops to leave. **********While a handful of Senators shifted their positions, each side seemed only to be stiffening its resolve, and the chief arguments remained. Opponents of American defiance of the embargo say the United States must be concerned about the wider world and whether such a move would rob the Administration of any moral authority in future agreements. **********Supporters say the Bosnians have a right to defend themselves and that the United States should not be party to denying them either that or the right of self-determination. A Muddled Message **********The Senate sent a muddled message in May when it decided by one vote to support defying the embargo unilaterally, then immediately decided, again by one vote, to urge the allies to drop the embargo as well. **********It seemed unlikely today that either side would be able to muster enough votes to send a clearer signal when they vote next week. But both sides did agree that the Clinton Administration needed to show more leadership. **********Even Senator Nunn conveyed the difficulty of the issue, saying of his opponents, ""Morally, they are correct."" But he said the United. States. had to distinguish between vital interests and moral interests, and that so far, Bosnia did not amount to a vital interest because no Senator is willing to commit American troops. **********-------------------- **********New Offensive Urged  SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 24 (Reuters)  The commander of the Muslim-led Bosnian army has ordered a new offensive against the Serbs, Sarajevo's leading newspaper reported today. **********The newspaper, Oslobodjenje, quoted Gen. Rasim Delic as telling officers at a conference in the Bosnian capital on Thursday that he wanted to lead a joint Muslim-Croat drive to liberate Bosnia. **********""So far we have been conducting a defensive war,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Now we are going into phase two, a war of liberation. **********The United Nations reported heavy firing in north-central Bosnia, where Muslim and Serb forces have been fighting in recent weeks. **********In northeast Bosnia, United Nations officials said, Bosnian Government forces were closing in on a rebel Muslim stronghold. **********Western observers said there were signs that Serb forces might intervene to prevent Government troops from capturing the land held by a breakaway Muslim leader, Fikret Abdic, in the Bihac pocket."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/22/business/inflation-concerns-rise-with-commodities-prices.html,Barnaby Feder,1994-06-22,,816,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Inflation Concerns Rise With Commodities Prices,Inflation Concerns Rise With Commodities Prices," **********Many commodity prices are up sharply this year, ranging from coffee and cotton to crude oil, copper and aluminum. The trend toward rising prices fits neatly into the traditional models of what economists expect at this stage of an economic recovery and, if the past is a guide, the prices consumers pay for many goods and services could rise, too. **********What is the main force driving up prices, the fear of shortages or an actual tightening of supplies? And can consumers and manufacturers count on economic models to predict how commodity prices will affect the economy? Such questions, which have no definitive answers, are clinging like the summer humidity to the debate about how strong inflationary pressures are becoming and whether the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates again to prevent the economy from overheating. A Sense of Complacency **********Inflation hawks say investors and business executives have been lulled into a sense of complacency recently by the failure of inflation rates to rise along with intermittent run-ups in commodity prices. They say inflation is bound to gather speed because all the broad measures of commodity prices are rising, not just the most volatile ones like the Commodity Research Bureau's 21-commodity index, which is dominated by agricultural products. **********""We are seeing the strongest upward move since the early 1980's,"" said Anirvan Banerji, a research economist at the Columbia University Center for Business Cycle Research who designed the index of 18 industrial commodities published daily in the Journal of Commerce. **********The index, which tracks the rate of price changes, has risen every month this year and was up more than 15 percent through the end of May, with 15 of 18 items higher than the average for the preceding 12 months. The only item declining was scrap steel, while red oak, which is used in flooring, and corrugated boxes were virtually unchanged. **********Two other indexes, the Goldman, Sachs index of 20 commodities traded on futures markets, and the Investable Commodity Index, which tracks the cumulative returns that investors have received on 16 commodities, also reflect the rising prices. **********""We are in the sweet spot of the business cycle for commodities,"" said Timothy O'Neill, partner in charge of commodity products for Goldman, Sachs. Led by a gain of 32 percent in its energy component and an increase of 28 percent in the industrial sector, the Goldman, Sachs index had climbed 14 percent this year as of Friday. With grain prices falling this week, the index has eased to a gain of 11.7 percent for the year. **********The Investable Commodity Index was up by more than 13 percent through the end of last week, said Scott Manolis, president of Intermarket Management Inc., a money management firm based in Somerset, N.J., that developed the index as a part of its effort to encourage clients to diversify their investments from stocks, bonds and other financial instruments into commodities. The grain selloff this week pared the gain to 11.1 percent for the year. ""We see a three- to five-year upward run coming,"" Mr. Manolis said. **********But many economists say the commodities price trends can be easily misinterpreted. The Commodity Research Bureau's index, which is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc. and is one of the most widely followed by traders and investors, is likely to be especially misleading this year because agricultural products account for so much of its value, including items like coffee and cotton that are in short supply but have little impact on over all inflation. **********The C.R.B. index is also reflecting volatility stemming from unusually low stockpiles of several crops. Fears that a drought in the Corn Belt was developing sent corn and bean prices skyrocketing in early June, but those markets tumbled with recent rains. A bad harvest could send prices and the C.R.B. index soaring above previous levels without significantly increasing the threat of widespread inflation. **********Economists say the other indexes that give less weight to the weather-sensitive agriculture sector are better indicators of inflation but are still suspect barometers of inflation. ""Markets are giving far too much attention to the commodity movements,"" said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist for Prudential Securities. ""The fraction of the economy producing and using commodities is small and getting smaller."" **********And some commodities users say prices are being driven up by investors anticipating shortages, not current market conditions. They say prices are driven up in anticipation of strikes, supply cutbacks or other events that do not occur, then fail to drop again because some investors flee the weak market in Government bonds and invest in commodities on the general belief that prices are headed up. **********""A lot of people investing don't know what they are doing,"" said Sheldon Wolfe, whose trading company in Skokie, Ill., concentrates on scrap aluminum markets."

Masih Homadi peered from the crags of jagged black volcanic rocks where his troops had just taken cover and tried to steady his nerves for another assault. **********As his soldiers, many in plastic sandals and motley uniforms, slammed clips into their AK-47 assault rifles, mortar blasts exploded in the valley below the mountain village of Marqula, and the deep-throated rattle of heavy machine guns echoed across the ravines. **********""The northern forces are just over there,"" the major said, pointing to a sharp peak silhouetted against the fading daylight. ""They have been shelling us for two days, trying to clear either side of the road and then move against us with their tanks. They are slowly moving forward. We are slowly moving back."" **********The predicament of the major's beleaguered southern forces seems typical as the civil war here enters its second week, and the south appears to be faltering under a sustained push by the larger northern army. **********The prize in this war is Aden, once the British bridgehead to colonial India and now the second-largest city and the economic capital of this poor Islamic nation. The sheer cliffs, which plunge into the inky blue water of the Gulf of Aden, frame the prize in a huge crater. The fighting has already left hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dead and wounded. **********The last war here, in 1986, killed up to 10,000 people. In 1990, the northern nation of Yemen and Marxist Southern Yemen merged, but the union was an uneasy one marked by feuds and skirmishes between forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Salih, a conservative military leader, and a Soviet-trained southern army commanded by Ali Salim al-Bidh. Mr. Bidh, who ruled Southern Yemen when it was a Marxist state, was Mr. Salih's Vice President until last year. **********President Salih says the south has mounted an illegitimate rebellion and vows to put Mr. Bidh on trial, while southern leaders complain that they are tired of being dominated by the north. **********Aden, the old southern capital, is the home of the Southern Yemen Socialist Party, and in daily broadcasts from the old presidential palace here, Mr. Bidh exhorts southerners to blunt the advance of the north. With electrical power cut, or only available at certain times of the day, there has been a run on radio batteries so people can keep up with the news. **********The north has mounted a three-pronged assault to capture Aden, and battles are being waged in an arc about 60 miles north of the city. Its airport pounded by northern warplanes and unusable, Aden is cut off to all but a few intrepid ships willing to slip into the harbor. Northern leaders say they are preparing for a final onslaught. **********""Aden will fall within a week, or it will never fall,"" said one of the few Western diplomats who has remained behind. ""But if it does fall, there will be a massacre here. It appears the north is slowly gaining.""  Southerners Grow Gloomy **********Despite official pronouncements of battlefield victories, senior Government officials from the south are increasingly gloomy. **********""For every kilometer the north advances, there are thousands of dead and wounded,"" one minister said. ""The cost of this advance is heavy, and even if the north takes Aden, it will not impose unity by force. The south will keep fighting."" **********The south, with one-fifth of Yemen's 13 million people, has called for a general mobilization, sending streams of cars, trucks and taxis to the front lines with volunteers dressed in traditional skirts known as fouta. **********Boys, some as young as 12 or 13, and grizzled old men arrive with standard equipment, old AK-47's and wads of khat, the leaf that many Yemenis chew to give them energy and blunt hunger, bulging in their cheeks. **********The fighting seems to follow the country's peculiar rhythm. In the afternoons, when Yemenis gather in small groups to chew khat, there are usually battlefield lulls. ""We always get a few hours to chew when things die down in the afternoon,"" Hamid Ali Ahmed, a porter who volunteered to fight on the front, said as he sat perched on a rocky lookout.  North Rejects Truce **********The north has rejected southern attempts to arrange a cease-fire and open a dialogue, saying the south's aim was ""to blackmail world opinion and waste time."" **********Abdul-Aziz Abdul Ghani, a northern member of the Presidential Council, told a team of mediators from the Arab League: ""The rebellious clique in the Yemen Socialist Party's leadership bear responsibility for the flaring up of the military situation,"" the Sana radio reported. **********Neither side, however, appears prepared for war. Communications are poor, leaving commanders wondering where units are and what they are doing. There is often little discipline, with soldiers going home to their villages and then coming back to fight. **********Confusion is as common as violence. Three companies recently sent to join the fighting around Dhala, 60 miles north of Aden, failed to find the unit that they were assigned to join.  The men stumbled upon a northern patrol and began to chat before realizing they were from the north. The two forces then exchanged fire. South's Air Force Superior **********The superiority of the southern air force and the tenacity of the 20,000 troops have so far kept the northern army, with 40,000 soldiers, at bay. **********Despite a bombing run by the north against Aden that destroyed one of the main electrical transformers, there is no blackout. But the wounded often wait several hours to be ferried back to hospitals for treatment. **********The mood remains defiant. The steady stream of bombastic communiques from Aden and Sana, which are intended to bolster morale rather than impart information, seem to have worked. **********""The north will never take the city,"" said Waleed Zeen, a 20-year-old clerk. ""Our army is doing well, and the minute they need us, we will all go join them.

Southern troops have been driven back to Marqula, about six miles south of Dhala. **********The advance appears aimed at the strategic and strongly fortified air base of Anad, 37 miles north of Aden. If the air base falls, foreign military advisers say, then the capture of Aden will be assured.  Troops Seem Demoralized **********The southern troops defending Marqula appear wary and demoralized. Many said they were not prepared for the intensity of the northern assault and blamed outside intervention from the Sudan, Iraq and Eritrea, a common charge leveled by the south against the north. **********""If the north keeps up this heavy shelling, maybe they can make it to Aden,"" Lieut. Hassan Mohammed Hassan said. ""They have foreigners helping them with this advance. They attack with ferocity."" **********Villages between Aden and the front line have been abandoned by a jittery populace, who now sleep in schools and public buildings in Aden. **********Hospitals, short of antibiotics and bandages, are struggling to cope with the huge influx of wounded. In a sweltering corridor of Al Gumhuryyah Hospital here, a dozen wounded soldiers lay on cots covered by green sheets. As doctors bent over one man to change his dressings, he stuffed the corner of a pillow in his teeth to keep from shouting in pain. **********Capt. Musad Defala, wounded in his left arm and neck, lay motionless as the ceiling fan beat lamely against soporific heat. He, like many, said it was the savagery of the combat that most shocked him. **********""They attack us like Nazis,"" he said, ""and they use weapons we did not know they have, like small cluster bombs.

""But nothing will stop it now. Unity is no longer possible."" **********Tribes and families have split over the conflict, and are now tearing themselves to pieces. Prices in Aden have tripled and quadrupled, and there are growing food shortages. It is impossible, for instance, to find tomatoes or onions, which are grown in the north. And the price of potatoes has risen from $1 a kilo (2.2 pounds) to $5. **********Col. Mohsun Abdallah Ali, seated in an office at an army base in Aden that had half of the roof blown off by a bomb, waited as a southern warplane screamed skyward for an attack on the besieging troops. He said his forces would offer stubborn resistance, but he also said he and his men had no stomach for war. **********""Every time I hear a plane take off, it is painful,"" he said.

And it overshadows such well-publicized problems that derivatives have caused at Procter & Gamble, the investment firm of Piper Jaffray and, just last week, the Mellon Bank. **********In a statement announcing the losses yesterday, Robert Citron, the Orange County treasurer, said they were still only on paper. But critics of Mr. Citron's investment policy assert that many of the securities may never recover in value. They estimate that the losses could rise to $2 billion or more. **********""Orange County has joined the ranks of these problems in a big way,"" said Richard Y. Roberts, a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""It's worrisome to the S.E.C. These securities, which were dreamed up more in a boiler room than a conference room, are sold to a broad range of investors and re sprinkled around the country."" **********Orange County is one of hundreds of municipalities, mutual funds, colleges and corporations that tried to increase their investment returns by buying highly complex securities that were, in effect, high-risk bets on the direction of interest rates. As interest rates have risen since earlier this year, the value of these instruments have tumbled in value. **********Derivatives are securities that are linked to underlying assets, either stocks and bonds or financial indexes. The gain or losses on the derivatives depend on the performance of the underlying asset. Derivatives can result in losses that investors may never have imagined. **********The $20 billion Orange County fund included some $8 billion in reserve money for future needs from more than 180 municipalities in California and $12 billion in borrowed funds. **********The largest investors in the fund are the county itself, the county transportation authority, sanitation districts and California cities outside the county. **********Mr. Citron, who did not respond to requests for comment, took some $8 billion in the money of these municipalities, borrowed some $12 billion more, and used it to buy a wide variety of securities that go by the name of floating-rate derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements."" **********As of August, $5.7 billion was invested in floating-rate instruments that decreased in value as interest rates rose. Also, about $7.5 billion was invested in government-agency four-year notes, which have also fallen in value. And some $12 billion was borrowed, in the form of reverse repurchase agreements, which added a high amount of leverage, or risk, to the portfolio. **********The borrowed money, which was pegged to rising short-term interest rates, was used to buy the longer-term government agency notes, according to those who have seen the portfolio. **********""All these securities have lost value and are not worth what they paid for them,"" said Joseph Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer, an industry newsletter. ""This county has taken a market hit. And then they borrowed to do that, so it's even worse."" **********Mr. Citron, in his statement, defended his actions. ""In my 21 years of managing this fund, I have dealt with bear markets and bull markets, and am confident that we can deal with this situation,"" he said. **********The county said it was assembling a team of county executives and securities consultants to develop a strategy to resolve the fund's problems. **********Mr. Citron's actions came under sharp fire in June when he was challenged for the county treasurer's post. He won. But his opponent, John Moorlach, a Costa Mesa, Calif., accountant, made Mr. Citron's investments a campaign issue, calling them ""junk."" Following yesterday's announcement, Mr. Moorlach said: ""The good news is that I was right. The bad news, too, is that I was right. Rising interest rates are the kiss of death for this investment strategy."" **********Merrill Lynch & Company sold Orange County many of the securities in the fund. A spokesman said the firm would experience no losses as a result of the Orange County problems. Merrill Lynch sharesfell by $1.50 to close at $36.50 in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The exact impact of these potential losses on the operations of the 180 municipalities and agencies that put their money into this fund is unclear. The most vulnerable are school districts, including Orange County schools, because they could have more immediate needs for the money. **********Nearly 60 percent of the money was put in on an involuntary basis, and the largest amount came from the county's transportation authority. Mr. Citron's office said yesterday that a number of the municipalities that voluntarily put their reserve money into the fund would continue to do so, although nine said yesterday that they were reviewing this situation. **********The Orange County Sanitation District, which has $400 million in the fund, said it would stay. ""It's not a problem for us,"" said Steve Kozak, the district's financial manager. He said the district has no upcoming needs for the money. **********The fund is not intended to cover continuing municipal expenses. Instead, it is an investment pool where municipalities put their extra cash in order to earn more. **********Karen S. Krop, an assistant vice president at Moody's Investors Service, a rating agency, said that it was having ""ongoing discussions"" with Orange Country officials to review the situation. It is too early to determine, Ms. Krop said, if the agency will downgrade the county's rating as a result of yesterday's announcement. The county's current rating is Aa1, just below the top rating. **********Most of the county's debt is made up of general obligation borrowings, which are backed by the tax payments of county residents. **********John L. Schiavetti, an analyst at Fitch's Investment Services, another rating agency, said that municipalities like Orange County are ill-equipped to make the complex financial analyses required to understand derivatives. **********A warning to this effect was recently issued by the Government Finance Officers Association. ""It's difficult to analyze such high-risk securities,"" Mr. Schiavetti said. ""It takes a lot to understand these things and lots of municipalities simply don't have the expertise."""

Instead, the new wealth comes from a crush of entrepreneurs, large and small, eager to supply gasoline to neighboring Haiti, which has been under a United Nations oil embargo since October. **********Although the Dominican Government has declared its respect for the sanctions, imposed to force Haiti's military to accept the restoration of democracy, the transformation wrought in this border region by the new business of supplying its fuel-starved neighbor cannot be concealed. At Night, Armies Take Over **********By day, the sloping fields that form the banks of the Dajabon River come alive with swarms of Haitians who, scampering homeward by the dozens, clutch as many gallon jugs of gasoline as they can carry. **********By night, Haitians and Dominicans living on both sides of the border say, the traffic is taken over by the two countries' armies, which residents here say trade in larger quantities, from heavily loaded pickups to flatbed trucks carrying fuel by the drum. **********""When it is dark, the gasoline is going from army to army,"" said Tony Joseph, a 25-year-old Haitian. ""They'll cover up their shipments with other goods so you can't see it just like that."" **********In recent weeks, the black-market supply has grown so abundant here and at the two other principal border crossings shared by the two countries that the price of gasoline in Haiti has fallen by as much as a third. **********Still, profit margins remain wide. Haitians, who must wade in the Dajabon River's muddy, knee-deep water to cross the border, buy their fuel from Dominican middlemen for little more than $3 a gallon, selling it back home for $10. The middlemen make a profit of more than $1 a gallon. Vital to the Haitian Military **********Diplomats involved in efforts to restore Haiti's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, say supply points like these have been critical in allowing Haiti's army to resist international pressure to surrender power. **********Supporters of Father Aristide, as well as some diplomats, have long expressed a belief that the Dominican President, Joaquin Balaguer, who never had good relations with Father Aristide, has deliberately allowed the cross-border commerce, to weaken the impact of the international embargo. **********In 1991, Father Aristide criticized the Dominican Republic for employing Haitians in agricultural jobs that he said resembled slave labor. **********""For the Dominican Government, the Haitian military represents continuity,"" said Ruben Silie, a Dominican academic who has specialized in relations between the two countries. ""They know that the army would never make an issue of sugar workers or go and make an international scandal about the treatment of refugees."" **********The oil embargo was imposed in October after officers reneged on an agreement to let Father Aristide, who was overthrown in an army coup in September 1991, return to power. **********Dominican officials have expressed irritation at what they say are efforts to blame them for the failures of international diplomacy. Visiting the southern border town of Pedernales on Thursday, President Balaguer said his country was ""religiously fulfilling"" the terms of the embargo. 'No One Can Prevent This' **********But Mr. Balaguer began his remarks by denouncing the embargo as inhumane, and he went on to say that despite his Government's best efforts, ""no one can absolutely prevent this kind of contraband."" **********Despite protestations by the Dominican authorities that they are doing all that they can to stop the thriving border trade, soldiers can be seen openly taking part in the gasoline business. **********At the Dajabon River, Dominican border guards sit in the shade of storefronts watching as Haitians enter the country illegally, empty jugs in hand, sometimes as close as 100 yards from the official border crossing. Other guards chase the returning Haitians in the fields, charging those they catch about 30 cents a gallon for the fuel the Haitians are carrying home. **********""My money was all gone and I couldn't pay them,"" said Marie Prosper, 18, from the nearby Haitian town of Ouanaminthe, who said she had begun working as a gasoline courier soon after the embargo was imposed on Haiti. ""The guard took my 14 gallons, and I'm going back home empty-handed."" **********Many Haitians said that since the embargo had been imposed, the cross-border gasoline trade was the only viable economic activity that remained for them. ""Without this, we would be dead,"" said Leonie Pierre, 62, whose sons' trade in gasoline gave her the money she needed to come and buy rice and bananas in Dajabon. ""There is no food or work left in Ouanaminthe."" **********In the nearby town of Santiago de la Cruz, the village's main intersection is clogged with a line of Dominican cars waiting to top off their gasoline tanks and fill containers ranging in size from 20 gallons to big drums. **********""The Government pretends that it doesn't know anything about this business,"" said a Dominican market vendor in Dajabon, who insisted on remaining anonymous. ""I can't even say that they are closing their eyes. What is happening here is so open that you have to figure that they want to help Haiti's army."""

Stillman, the securities lawyer who wrote the report. Mr. Stillman had been appointed by the United States trustee in the bankruptcy case to determine whether Leslie Fay's audit committee had thoroughly investigated the matter. **********""BDO Seidman's audit reports on the company's financial statements appear to be misleading and merit further investigation,"" he wrote. **********Leslie Fay has made more than $81 million in accounting adjustments to its 1990, 1991 and 1992 financial statements to rectify false entries that resulted in an understatement of inventories and an overstatement of gross profits. **********Mr. Stillman concluded that senior executives could not have detected the accounting irregularities. But he makes clear that they gave only cursory attention to the financial details of their business. **********Mr. Stillman was appointed as examiner earlier this year after creditors questioned the objectivity of the original investigation into the scandal, conducted by the company's audit committee with the help from Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm representing Leslie Fay in its bankruptcy, and Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm. His report generally confirmed the findings of that investigation. Executives Seen as Uninformed **********Mr. Stillman's report offers the first peek at the audit committee's findings, the results of which have been sealed by Federal Bankruptcy Judge Tina L. Brozman, who is presiding over the Leslie Fay case. **********He reports that the audit committee's investigation concluded that John Pomerantz, chairman and chief executive of Leslie Fay and the son of its founder, did not understand certain financial information. **********The audit committee's examination also found that Alan Golub, the company's president and chief operating officer during the time the fraud took place, did little analysis of budgets and projections, according to Mr. Stillman's report. **********His report also says the executives did not carefully analyze Leslie Fay's financial statements beyond sales reports and accepted financial documents prepared by Paul F. Polishan, the chief financial officer who was dismissed in connection with the case, ""without significant scrutiny."" **********Mr. Stillman recommended that the company further investigate Mr. Pomerantz's knowledge and approval of ""pre-billing"" -- booking sales into one accounting period for goods shipped in the following period, a practice that is not acceptable under general accounting principles. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Stillman concludes that the information given to management was not detailed enough to have revealed the financial manipulation going on. **********Mr. Golub resigned from the company before the fraud was discovered. Following the audit committee's investigation, Mr. Pomerantz, while retaining his role as the company's head, was relieved of any responsibility for the company's financial affairs. **********Leslie Fay dismissed its corporate controller, Donald F. Kenia, who told executives in January 1993 that he had been making unsupported entries in the company's general ledger that caused misstatements in its financial statements dating to 1990. Accountant Inquiry Sought **********Mr. Stillman's report urges further investigation of BDO Seidman's audits of the company, noting that the accounting firm failed to catch improper accounting treatments of some Leslie Fay transactions and allowed entries that did not conform to general accounting standards. **********For example, he concluded that Leslie Fay's purchase of Spitalnick & Company in 1990 and the sale of its Head subsidiary had been improperly recorded. **********Martin McLaughlin, a spokesman for BDO Seidman, said yesterday that the firm had not yet reviewed Mr. Stillman's report. He said most false entries took place in 1992, after the last full audit by BDO Seidman. **********""Leslie Fay has always had the option to consider legal claims against BDO Seidman, but it has not asserted any such direct claims yet,"" Mr. McLaughlin said. ""If it does so, we are able and determined to prove that the responsibility for this massive and deliberate fraud lies with the people who perpetrated it."" Law Firm's Role Investigated **********In addition to a report on the audit committee's investigation, Mr. Stillman also examined the issue of whether Weil, Gotshal failed to disclose potential conflicts of interest, like its representation in other cases of some members of Leslie Fay's board and a large Leslie Fay creditor, Fidelity Investments. **********Judge Brozman did not unseal Mr. Stillman's report on Weil, Gotshal, instead setting a hearing for Sept. 9 on whether it should be unsealed. According to people who have seen the report, it concludes that the firm failed to disclose some client relationships that could pose such conflicts."

Nor are any of them likely to do so. Virtually every security he bought will be worth, at maturity, about what he paid. **********So how did the treasurer, Robert L. Citron, manage to lose $1.5 billion of that money, as the county acknowledged last week? **********The answers lie in the strategies he used in managing the county's investment fund. To put more money to work, the fund borrowed about $2 for every dollar that had been entrusted to it to manage. The fund must pay interest on those borrowings, and that interest bill has risen rapidly this year. **********That part of the loss has nothing to do with derivatives -- securities whose performance are based on the action of simpler underlying securities -- and everything to do with the risk of taking on debt to make investments. **********In the meantime, the interest the fund earns has stayed the same on many of its investments and declined rapidly on others, including some of the more exotic securities that can be classified as derivatives. While those securities will presumably return to face value in a few years, they may not produce enough interest to support the loans Mr. Citron took out to buy them. **********Some of the securities conceivably could go for years without paying any interest. The $1.5 billion of losses refers not to the cash that has flowed out of the fund, but to the current market value of the securities the fund owns. **********The fund cannot now afford to let its customers withdraw money, because its securities are not now worth at market value what it paid, and it would take losses if it sold them. So last week it notified the customers that any withdrawals would carry a 20 percent penalty. Had it not done so, the first customers out would have received their money while later ones took even larger losses. **********What follows is a look at some of the securities Mr. Citron bought and the financing strategies he followed: **********LEND LONG, BORROW SHORT Orange County bought large quantities of Treasury and Government agency securities, mostly with maturities of 5 years or less, with some running to 10 years. It generally financed those purchases through what are called reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, in which the securities, either those that are being bought or others, are pledged to secure loans. Those loans were generally rolled over every three or six months and became more expensive as market interest rates rose. **********For example, in October the fund bought $124.8 million face value of Treasury notes, which paid 4.75 percent interest and matured in September 1998. It paid an average price of slightly more than par value, so it got an effective yield of 4.61 percent. Most of the money it spent on the bonds came from borrowing through six-month reverse repos. **********At the time, the going rate on such six-month loans was 3.31 percent. So at the start, it could finance the entire transaction and get a profit of 1.3 percent -- or $1.6 million -- a year. That money was added to the profits of the fund and helped it to pay above-market yields on the money invested with it. **********Unfortunately, as short-term interest rates rose, the profit vanished. Now the rate on such loans is about 6.75 percent. At that rate, the investment loses about 2.1 percent -- or $2.6 million -- a year. And those losses will continue if short-term rates do not fall. The fund could sell the Treasury notes and close out the position, but if it did it would get just $112.8 million at current prices, suffering a capital loss of $12 million. **********STRUCTURED NOTES One of Wall Street's most versatile recent inventions is the structured note, in which the issuer -- usually a Government-related agency like the Federal Home Loan Banks or the Federal National Mortgage Association -- pays interest rates that vary and are based on formulas that can be quite complex. The notes, a form of derivatives, are often tailored to meet the needs of a buyer like the Orange County fund, and are devised by investment banks like Merrill Lynch or Paine Webber. **********Normally, the agency would immediately engage in an interest-rate swap with the investment bank, so that it would pay a floating rate about one-fifth of a percentage point less than a short-term market rate, the three-month London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. That left the investment bank with exposure to the opposite risk being assumed by Orange County, a risk it presumably hedged by using other derivative securities. **********The terms of the structured notes varied widely. In some cases, the county got a promise of rising interest rates for three years, followed by rates at a formula that could cause rates to decline, perhaps to zero, if market interest rates rose. In that case, the fund was effectively betting that short-term rates would not rise. In other structures, it agreed to be paid a rate based on the difference between short-term and long-term rates. In that case, it was betting that long rates would remain much higher than short rates. And in at least one case, the formula was tied to German interest rates and was a bet that those rates would fall. This year, all those bets have been losers. **********Consider two examples of the structured notes the fund owns: **********In one case, Orange County bought $100 million of Federal National Mortgage Association stepped inverse bonds in February, just after the Federal Reserve tightened credit for the first time this year. The bonds promised to pay 7 percent interest until May and then to pay a rate of 10 percent minus the three-month Libor rate. The rate the bond paid fell to 5.1 percent in May, to 4.9 percent in August and to 3.9 percent last month. Beginning in 1996, the rate will rise to 11.25 percent, minus Libor. The notes mature in 1999, when Orange County will get its $100 million back. **********The notes do not trade, because Orange County owns the entire issue. But if they were sold, they would now trade at a substantial discount to the face value. They were a bet on falling interest rates, and that bet has so far not worked out. **********In another example of a structured-note deal, Orange County in July 1993 bought $100 million in dual indexed bonds, whose interest rate will fluctuate on the difference between the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds and the six-month Libor. The bonds, issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, mature in July 1998. They promised 6 percent interest the first year, with the rate then reset every six months. The formula is the rate on 10-year Treasury notes minus the six-month Libor rate, plus 3.1 percentage points. **********Last July, the rate was reset at 5.065 percent. If current market interest rates remain unchanged until the rate is reset again in January, the new rate would be 4.2 percent, well below the rate the fund is paying to borrow money. **********In buying these notes, Orange County bet that the spread between short-term rates and long-term rates would stay the same or get larger. Instead, it has shrunk. Were short-term rates to become higher than long-term ones, the rate Orange County gets could fall to zero. **********On the other hand, these bonds can be bought back by the Federal Home Loan Banks any time the rate is reset. So if the banks find that they are paying a rate they deem too high, they can simply buy back the bonds at par. **********This issue also does not trade, because no one except Orange County owns it. But with the spread between the short and long rates having been cut in half since issuance, it would also trade at a discount if Orange County decided to sell."

Then it occurred to the company that few people opened their sunroofs even once when it was that cold outside. **********To cut costs, the required testing has been reduced to 500 times at a temperature of only 4 degrees below zero. **********The modification might seem trivial, but it is part of a broader change of mind-set that is sweeping through Japan's largest car company and through the rest of the nation's auto industry. After years of building fancier and more expensive cars, Japanese auto makers are being forced to move back toward less expensive vehicles with fewer frills and less obsessive attention to detail, a shift that they contend will not compromise basic quality or reliability. **********""With excessive standards, we designed over-engineered cars,"" said Akihiro Wada, a senior managing director at Toyota. A few years ago, he said, ""we had a philosophy that as long as we made good-quality vehicles, no matter how expensive they were, people would be satisfied."" **********Now, however, the first expression out of a Japanese auto executive's mouth is likely to be ""value for money."" In a sense, Japan's automobile companies, which first made their mark with low-priced but reliable vehicles, are returning to their roots. **********The new philosophy has found its expression in a series of relatively inexpensive vehicles that have been introduced in Japan in the last few months and have done quite well. **********Toyota's new small sport-utility vehicle, known as the RAV 4 and made on a lightly automated assembly line here, is considered to be the first embodiment of the new approach by Japan's largest car company. Other newly introduced inexpensive cars that have done well include Mazda's Familia, known in the United States as the Protege, and some versions of Nissan's Sunny, known as the Sentra in the United States. **********The auto companies are reacting to changes in Japan's automobile market. Sales of new cars here have declined for three years, though there are signs that the downturn is ending. With Japan still in an economic slump, people here are looking for less expensive cars than they sought during the boom of the so-called bubble economy in the late 1980's. **********But the same lessons will be applied to the models sold abroad, where Japanese cars, especially at the low end of the market, have become less competitive in the last two years, in part because the Japanese yen has become more expensive in relation to the dollar. The cost-trimming may become apparent with the redesigned 1995 Mazda Protege and the 1996 Honda Civic. **********""Now the Japanese are realizing that despite the yen being at 98, they still have to have a substantial presence in the low-priced car market,"" said Chris W. Cedergren, senior vice president of Auto Pacific Inc., a consulting firm in Santa Ana, Calif. He said that while Japanese small cars were at least $1,500 more expensive than comparable American models, the new models to be introduced starting next year would erase the price gap. A Jolt of 'Neon Shock' **********In the American market, Japanese auto makers took their eye off the low end as they moved into luxury and sports cars. In part, that was because voluntary restraints on Japan's exports to the United States in the 1980's encouraged the companies to use their limited allotment to sell expensive cars, not low-priced ones. **********But now, the markets for luxury and sports cars are sluggish. And Detroit, helped by the rising yen and its own revamping, has mounted a new attack at the low end with cars like Chrysler's Neon. **********""We had what we call Neon shock,"" said Luke Bierens, an engineer at the factory here in the city where Toyota has its headquarters and where the RAV 4 is built. He said that when engineers took apart the new Chrysler subcompact, they found Toyota used as many as 10 components in places where Chrysler used one. **********Another reason for a return to basics is that much of the new demand for motor vehicles will come from developing nations in Asia and Latin America, where most people cannot afford expensive cars. **********Whether Japan can still compete in the low end of the market is open to question. Some of the new inexpensive cars achieve their lower prices not only through true cost-cutting, but also by leaving out popular equipment like radios or air-conditioners. **********Many executives and analysts here say it will be difficult or impossible to cut costs enough to make Japan's exports competitive at 100 or 95 yen to the dollar, especially with Japan's tradition of lifetime employment. That means manufacturing will continue to shift to the United States and other countries. Danger of Cutting Too Much **********Moreover, there is a risk that skimping too much could undermine the Japanese industry's most precious asset: the reputation for reliability that gave Japanese cars an edge in the United States. **********""I'm afraid the quality will be less,"" said Akira Oshikawa, an independent industry analyst and former official of the Japan Auto Parts Industries Association. **********But auto officials insist that they will retain the quality. ""We are not lowering the standard for the customer,"" Mr. Wada of Toyota said. ""We are just lowering the excesses."" **********To cut costs, companies are reducing the number of models they offer and the number of varieties of each car. Japanese car companies offer dozens of steering wheels for some models in their home market in an effort to satisfy each customer's preference, an option they are limiting. **********For instance, for the new Camry introduced in Japan this year, Toyota is offering only 44 possible variations of models and basic equipment, compared with 66 for the previous Camry. The total number of parts in the car dropped to 2,300 from 3,900. **********Other cost savings will be achieved by sharing parts among different models rather than designing each part from scratch, from revamping the research and development process and pressing the parts suppliers for lower prices. **********Because it takes four years to develop and build a new model, and the cost-cutting efforts have been under way in earnest for only two years, the full results have not yet been seen. But some of the models coming out achieve partial cost savings. Sorry, No Radio **********The new Mazda Familia has a base price of 970,000 yen, or $9,700, which in Japan is inexpensive. The new cars are priced about $300 to $900 less than the previous generation of Familias. The company achieved the lower price by reducing the number of models offered, making parts common to different models and eliminating some features, like the radio, in the basic model. **********In the United States, the same Mazda car, known as the Protege, is going on sale at prices starting at $12,000. The list price will range from the same to $400 less than the previous model, despite the yen's rise. **********Nissan has developed a new two-door version of its low-end Sunny, with a base price of less than 900,000 yen, or $9,000. On Aug. 24, it introduced a new Cefiro sedan, a mid- to high-range car, at prices 5 percent lower than the previous generation's. **********Nissan has not announced the price for either car in the United States, where they will go on sale next year. But it has been aggressive in pricing other models in North America. **********The base model of the new Nissan Maxima, which was introduced this year, costs at least 6 percent below the price of the previous Maxima, despite the fact that it is being exported from Japan while the yen is strong. **********Some American critics contend that Nissan is ""dumping"" cars -- selling them below cost to gain market share. Nissan said it had cut costs by sharing the Maxima's platform with another model, changing to a simpler suspension and eliminating frills like a keyless locking system. A Low-Priced Hit **********But the most-talked-about vehicle in the new low-price category is Toyota's RAV 4, considered one of Japan's first ""post bubble"" automobiles. It has a base price in Japan of 1.6 million yen, or $16,000, compared with prices of at least 2 million yen, or $20,000, for most larger sport-utility vehicles. **********Toyota has been selling more than 5,000 of the vehicles a month since the RAV 4 was introduced in May, far exceeding its monthly target of 2,000 units. Orders from Japanese buyers have backed up into November. The vehicle is also being exported to Western Europe, and Toyota is considering whether to produce it in the United States. As an import, the RAV 4 would face a 25 percent American tariff because it would be classified as a truck. **********The basic model has no air-conditioner, no tilt steering wheel, and only an AM radio. There are fewer alternatives offered than in the past -- only 10 steering wheel choices, for instance. **********Many parts are shared with other Toyota models. The steering wheels come from the Celica; the buttons for optional power windows from the Corolla, and the engine, transmission and front suspension from the Japanese version of the Camry. In all, 20 to 30 percent of the car's components are shared with other vehicles, said Keiichi Kanda, a manager at the Motomachi plant, where the RAV 4 is made. Ten years ago, Mr. Kanda said, there was almost no sharing of components among models. Simpler Assembly Process **********Costs have also been cut by simplifying the assembly line, which is not as automated as those in some plants built by Toyota in the late 1980's, when the auto maker was bedazzled by technology and the cost savings it promised. **********""We went along with the cover story,"" said Mikio Kitano, the manager of the Motomachi plant and a Toyota director. ""We tried to do everything by machine."" But the savings proved elusive, he said, because the equipment cost so much. **********The less complex RAV 4 assembly line cost only a third as much to build as the one in Toyota's most automated factory, the Tahara plant. Truck-type models also tend to be less expensive to assemble than the more elaborate luxury automobiles. **********At Tahara, where the Lexus is made, Toyota tried to use machine-vision systems to guide robots in aligning the tires so the lug nuts could be fastened. Here at Motomachi, a round piece of plastic juts out of the center of the wheels. The big hole in the tire's center slides onto the piece of plastic, guiding the tire into place. **********And while at some modern factories, cars ride on special dollies that can be raised or lowered depending on the task to be performed, at Motomachi it is the height of the workers that is adjusted, by raising wooden platforms on the floor."

Sundays. The show, a consistent disappointment to NBC by creative standards, opened last fall to enormous ratings success but has since declined. In its time slot, it trails the longtime CBS hit, ""Murder, She Wrote"" and is in a close battle with a new ABC series, ""Lois and Clark."" **********But NBC executives argued here that ""Sea Quest"" is winning a more important race. They said advertisers are paying more for commercials on ""Sea Quest"" than on ""Murder, She Wrote"" because the NBC show is so appealing to young adults. **********That demographic advantage, the executives said, showed why NBC and CBS are going in opposite directions in the prime-time competition: NBC up, CBS down. Creative Disappointment **********Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, said ""Sea Quest"" has fallen short in almost every creative area. ""We need stronger character development,"" he said. ""We need better storytelling."" **********But he said the show has been an enormous economic success because advertising time is sold not on the basis of the most viewers, but the right kind of viewers. He cited Nielsen statistics covering ""viewers per viewing household"" or V.P.V.H., which measures the number of viewers in specific age groups in a show's total audience. **********In one important demographic group, viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, ""Sea Quest"" has a V.P.V.H. of 106, the second highest in prime time after NBC's ""Seinfeld,"" with 107. That means that for every 100 households tuned in to ""Sea Quest,"" there are 106 adults ages 18 to 49 watching the show. ""Murder, She Wrote,"" which attracts a much older audience, is watched by just 42 young adults per 100 households. That is the lowest in prime time. **********For that reason, Mr. Littlefield said, the 60th-ranked ""Sea Quest"" is selling for higher prices than the 7th-ranked ""Murder, She Wrote."" He declined to specify the prices. **********David Poltrack, the senior vice president of research at CBS, said his network never sells ""Murder, She Wrote"" or other prime-time shows on the basis of the 18-to-49 group. He said that it uses a slightly higher range, 25 to 54, and that more advertisers are accepting it as a benchmark. **********Mr. Poltrack also said NBC was ignoring the appeal of ""Murder, She Wrote"" to higher-income viewers. He suggested that ""Sea Quest"" had been declining so much in overall ratings that it was unlikely to be renewed for next season. Reflecting NBC's Direction **********""Sea Quest,"" for all its creative disappointments, is emblematic of NBC's programming and business strategy, Mr. Littlefield said. He said the ratings of ""Sea Quest"" had stabilized and that NBC had found some overall ratings momentum. It is the only network to climb both in household ratings and ratings among younger viewers. **********Preston Beckman, a vice president of programming for NBC, said the network is starting to cash in on this growth because, unlike CBS, it does not have to offer advertisers free commercials to make up for shortfalls in the ratings guaranteed to them before the season began. ""We're overperforming,"" he said. ""We don't owe anybody anything."" **********Mr. Poltrack said CBS would use the Winter Olympics to satisfy all ad shortfalls. ""We have no problem with make-good ads,"" he said. All Eyes on CBS **********Since the season began, NBC executives have been talking almost as much about the shortcomings of CBS as they have about their own successes. Several executives conceded that they wanted to shift attention toward CBS and away from NBC, which has been criticized for a ratings collapse over the last five years. **********Mr. Littlefield justified the harsh assessments of CBS by citing comments from CBS executives over the last two years about NBC's conducting ""fire sales"" of its best programs as its only means of attracting viewers. (NBC achieved enormous ratings with finales of programs like ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Cheers."" ) **********CBS has suffered setbacks recently, including its loss of rights to National Football League games to the Fox network starting next fall. **********""I think what CBS is facing is extremely dramatic,"" Mr. Littlefield said. ""We already have outstanding ratings with younger viewers on Sunday. We want more eyeballs. The network with the biggest household ratings is going to be hurt by the loss of football. That should be to our advantage."""

""Each business unit and office has been doing their own reassessment, and several have made small, selective staff reductions where appropriate; others are still in the midst of the review process."" **********Goldman did not say how many bankers would be laid off, but an executive confirmed that a report in the latest issue of Investment Dealers' Digest, a weekly trade magazine, indicated that a total of 45 was in the ballpark. **********Like other Wall Street firms, Goldman, Sachs incurred large trading losses earlier this year when interest rates began to rise, sending bond prices plunging. **********Goldman, which made a record pretax profit of $2.3 billion last year, is the last major partnership on Wall Street. Several Goldman executives have indicated that its performance has been so poor in the fiscal year ending Nov. 25 that partners will see their shares decline for the first time since the early 1970's. **********Goldman, which has expanded rapidly in recent years, employs more than 9,000 people throughout the world. Senior executives now acknowledge that they allowed the firm to grow too quickly. Last month, layoffs were announced in Goldman's commodities and bond trading divisions. **********Such cuts are not unusual on Wall Street, Gary Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive-search firm, said. ""For the last several years, Wall Street firms have been cutting their staffs between 5 and 10 percent to make room in areas where they anticipate a greater volume of business and to de-emphasize businesses that they think won't be as busy in the coming year,"" he said. **********But the latest cuts come at a time of unusual turmoil inside Goldman. Since Stephen Friedman, the managing partner, announced his resignation in September, several other experienced partners have followed suit. Many were encouraged to leave in order to make room for a record number of younger executives who will be elevated into the partnership's ranks next month. **********Last week, Mark O. Winkelman, the partner who supervised the commodities and foreign-exchange trading, abruptly announced that he would retire as a general partner at the end of this month. Mr. Winkelman, who has been a key figure in recent years, was angered after losing out in the contest to succeed Mr. Friedman. **********In addition, Moses Tsang, the partner who presided over the rapid growth of Goldman's Hong Kong office, announced his retirement last week. **********The heavy turnover presents a challenge to Jon S. Corzine, who will succeed Mr. Friedman as senior partner next month. **********According to a former executive who requested anonymity, morale is low. Last year, when Goldman, Sachs registered record profits, he said, Goldman management told employees that they would receive relatively small year-end bonuses because Goldman needed to husband its resources for a difficult year. But now that such a year has arrived, Goldman managers have indicated that bonuses will be reduced substantially anyway. **********""Almost everybody I know at Goldman is grumbling,"" the executive said."

The inauguration was free of violence, but it did nothing to ease political tensions. **********The calm that prevailed in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 430 miles southwest of Mexico City, also marked the first political victory of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Mr. Zedillo, who took office a week ago, had insisted that Eduardo Robledo Rincon, the candidate of the ruling Insitutional Revolutionary Party, be inaugurated despite threats from rebel leaders in Chiapas that such an action would be interpreted as breaking an 11-month-old cease-fire. **********I came to Chiapas for peace,"" Mr. Zedillo said after the ceremony, which was held in the City Theater instead of the state congressional chambers for security reasons. Hundreds of heavily armed federal troops surrounded the huge white building on the eastern end of this capital city and only PRI loyalists, many bused in by the party, were allowed to get anywhere near. **********A few hours later, the defeated candidate, Amado Avendano Figueroa, unofficially took office in an improvised swearing-in ceremony in front of 3,000 to 4,000 supporters and declared that he would run a parallel government recognized by the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army. **********Mr. Robledo, a former senator from Chiapas, pledged to reform the state constitution, tighten electoral laws, strengthen the judicial system and insure that the state legislature fairly represents the interests of the one-third of the population that is Indian. **********He named an Indian, Jacinto Arias, to head the state office of indigenous affairs, and a member of the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, Eraclio Zepeda Ramos, as secretary of government. **********He also repeated a pledge he made Tuesday night to resign if the Zapatista rebels agreed to end hostilities, and promised that his term will represent a new era for Chiapas. **********""Starting Jan. 1, nothing has been the same in Chiapas,"" he said, referring to the date on which the Zapatistas launched their rebellion. ""I aspire to insure that nothing will be the same after today."" **********Mr. Avendano also promised change as he received a ceremonial baton of power from a Chiapas Indian in a cloud of incense and the heavy sound of a drum. Mr. Avendano, a lawyer and editor, was the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party last August. By official count, he received 35 percent of the vote, but his supporters and the rebels say there was widespread fraud that cheated their candidate of victory. **********""We are starting from zero,"" he told several thousand supporters in front of the state administative building. ""We don't have money to buy a table or a chair."" He said he would form an itinerant government modelled after the government-in-hiding of President Benito Juarez while the French controlled Mexico in the mid-19th century. **********The demonstrators called Mr. Robledo's swearing-in illegal, and they denounced the opposition party member who joined Mr. Robledo's Cabinet as a traitor. While scattered demonstrations in support of Mr. Avendano were reported throughout the day from various parts of Mexico, nothing was heard from the Zapatistas or their leaders in the Lacandon Forest. **********The rebels threatened to take up arms again if Mr. Robledo took office. But in recent days the oratory has been tempered, and Mr. Avendano was careful today not to incite the crowd. **********""The police and soldiers there are not murderers,"" he said, pointing to dozens of riot troops protecting the state buildings around the plaza. ""They are Chiapanecos, like us."" **********State and federal officials did nothing today to prevent Mr. Avendano from proclaiming himself governor, and analysts said they expect the Government to continue to tolerate his presence for the near future. **********What was not immediately clear is how the Government can solve some of the tough social and economic problems that have plagued Chiapas and fueled the rebel insurrection. Old religious rivalries between Catholic and Evangelical Indian groups have often spilled over into violent confrontation and thousands of acres of farm land have been illegally seized by peasant groups."

Now the Sao Paulo and Rio exchanges are Latin America's fastest-growing stock markets, attracting foreign investment at the rate of $1 million an hour. **********Cheap stocks, an American passion for emerging markets and a recovery for Latin America's largest economy are making Brazil's markets boom. 'Significant Earnings' **********From an anemic volume of $16 million in daily trading three years ago, the Sao Paulo exchange now has daily trading volumes averaging $350 million. In the same three-year span, Telebras, the state-controlled telephone company and the exchange's most heavily traded stock, has appreciated 1,500 percent in dollar terms. ""In the short term, this could be a bubble that comes down,"" said Wayne A. Perkins, vice president for equity investment at Chemical Bank's affiliate here, Banco Norchem S.A. ""But in the medium and long term, Brazil can't fight world history. There will be significant earnings coming out of this country in a few years."" **********Not for the faint-hearted, however. Brazilian markets are notorious for their volatility. Over the last five years, Brazil's roller-coaster markets have suffered 50 percent drops on four occasions, said Stephen Rose, president of Stephen Rose & Partners, a London brokerage firm specializing in Brazil's markets. **********One news weekly, Manchete, reflecting widespread distrust among local investors, said, ""Stock Markets: At the moment of decision, all caution is too little."" **********Indeed, stocks could skid this fall, experts say, when portfolio managers often sell to take year-end profits. Markets may also get the jitters if political polls strongly favor Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a Socialist labor leader, in Brazil's October presidential election. **********Still, many analysts interviewed this week predicted continued growth. Latin America's other major markets have maintained their levels since the growth spurts of the early 1990's. In Brazil, many analysts believe that the current run-up is for real. **********""The market could grow another 100 percent in 1994,"" said Roberto Serwaczak, director of sales and trading in Sao Paulo for Baring Securities do Brasil. Of Brazil's nine exchanges, Sao Paulo accounts for 85 percent of trades, while Rio lags behind with 12 percent. **********The fashion for emerging markets has put Brazil, with an economy 50 percent larger than Mexico's, firmly in the sights of overseas portfolio managers. **********""The Brazilian market is the cheapest in Latin America,"" said Tamzin Hobday, director of Latin American research for Baring Securities Inc. in New York. ""Last year, we saw a lot of money going to Southeast Asia. This year, we should see a lot of that money going into Latin America."" **********Based on Baring's analysis of the ratio of stock market prices to the book value of the shares, Brazilian equities average a bargain basement 0.8. Elsewhere in Latin America, by contrast, countries that have already undergone stock market booms have ratios that are much more pricey: 4.5 for Chile and Peru, 3.4 for Argentina and 3.1 for Mexico. **********Growth stocks for 1994 could include Telebras; Marco Polo, a bus manufacturer, and private steel companies like Usiminas and Acesita. Because Brazilian banks usually profit handsomely from high inflation, which Brazil has had in spades, analysts recommend buying Banco National, Bradesco and Itau. Last year, Brazil's inflation rate was a stunning 2,500 percent. **********Only four years after opening Brazil's markets to foreign investors, about 1,000 foreign mutual funds invest here, estimated Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange. For American investors, popular funds include the Brazil Fund, and the Brazilian Equities Fund, both of which hit their 52-week highs this month and are trading at double or better than their prices a year ago. **********Foreign investors, overwhelmingly American, are encouraged by the general direction of Brazil, a capitalist behemoth with an economy larger than Russia's. **********Despite a recent radical cut in import tariffs to an average of 14 percent, Brazilian industry has proved to be agile and competitive. Brazil's imports surged 25 percent last year, to $26 billion. Nevertheless, an increasingly efficient export sector gave Brazil a $13 billion trade surplus. **********Over all, Brazil's economy grew by 5 percent, the highest since 1986. Industrial productivity in Sao Paulo grew by 6 percent, and foreign car makers announced plans to invest $1 billion a year through 1997. Brazilian businessmen formed almost half a million new companies last year, 15 percent over the 1992 level. **********""Brazil's problem is not the private sector,"" Mr. Vidigal of the Sao Paulo exchange said. ""Brazil's problem is the public sector."" **********A modest privatization program is picking away at a huge state sector. This year, the Government is to auction off 32 midsized companies, largely petrochemical producers. With no company expected to sell for over $100 million, the list leaves untouched the three sacred cows of Brazil's state sector -- Telebras; Petrobras, the state oil company, and Electrobras, the state electric company. In March, Congress is to start reviewing Brazil's constitution, a process which could lead to the privatization of these state monopolies. **********Brazil's small investors hold only $1.2 billion in local mutual funds -- 1 percent of the $120 billion held nationally in savings accounts. Because of this lack of liquidity, the huge presence of foreign money could moderate future downswings. **********""It would be very difficult for domestic savings to absorb the foreign investments,"" said Daniel Dantas, managing director of Banco Icatu, a private investment bank here.

Electricity, water and telephone services have been cut in much of the country. Gasoline and diesel fuel are in short supply. Schools and businesses are closed and many Yemenis have fled to remote villages. **********Sana, the capital of this nation of 13 million and the main city in the north, displays an eerie stillness. Rumors of new attacks, advances and defeats sweep the shuttered marketplace and downtown squares, where a few Yemenis gather near the piles of uncollected garbage. Army trucks packed with troops race past, kicking up clouds of dust. **********""We hear stories of 20,000 northern troops being killed in the fighting to take Aden,"" said a 32-year-old engineer, who like most Yemenis refused to be identified. ""Then we hear this isn't true. There is no reliable information. We switch the radio from the station in the north to the station in the south. We do not know what to believe."" **********The war pits 40,000 soldiers loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a northerner, against 20,000 troops led by his southern rival and Vice President, Ali Salem al-Beedh. The battles center in the inhospitable mountains and ravines 20 miles outside of Aden. **********The rivalry between north and south reached a peak in the 1980's, when Yemen was a focus of cold war tensions over the fact that Southern Yemen, then a separate country allied with the Soviet Union, allowed the Russians to set up a military base.  But as the Soviet bloc collapsed, Southern Yemen merged in 1990 with Yemen, the northern area, while holding on to its distinctive identity as the leftists remained the principal arbiter of power. **********Despite Yemen's nominal unity, southerners, who control an area twice the size of the north but have a fifth of the population, chafed under what they said was northern domination. Southerners also resented having to share their oil reserves, which account for a third of the modest 320,000 barrels that Yemen produces daily. Backed Iraq in Gulf War **********Yemen's economic difficulties worsened with its decision to back Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. Saudi Arabia, angered by the lack of support, expelled a million Yemeni workers and cut off foreign aid, costing Yemen billions of dollars in workers' remittances. **********The nation's first multiparty elections were held a year ago, resulting in no clear-cut advantage for either side. But the principal parties of the north and the south won enough seats to form a Government together. Their attempt at unity collapsed, however, when the southerners accused the northerners of shutting them out of power and assassinating 150 of their leaders and activists. **********Yemen never lacked for weapons, which can be found on sale at open gun markets. The country has an estimated 50 million guns, four for every man, woman and child. The country's largest tribe arms its followers with assault weapons, rocket launchers, machine guns and even mortars. **********Indeed, Western diplomats said the role of Yemen's many tribes would be crucial in sustaining the conflict. For example, the Hashed and other northern tribes could mobilize as many as 100,000 men to fight their rivals in the south, they said.  'It Will Be a Mess' **********""There is a lot of tinder for a complete breakdown and anarchy,"" said the head of an international relief agency that has remained in Sana. ""This is not a war just between two armies facing each other along a line, but a patchwork of tribes and militias, some of whom are loyal to the south and some to the north. It will be a mess."" **********According to reports by Western diplomats, northern troops have surrounded southern army camps in the north and butchered everyone inside. At the same time, southern forces have fired a half-dozen Scud missiles toward Sana and northern war planes have repeatedly struck Aden, inflicting heavy damage on the airport and some oil plants. **********Antiaircraft fire rattled in angry bursts throughout Sunday night in the capital. And small-arms fire echoed down the streets, despite a 9 P.M. curfew. **********Most foreign countries, including the United States, have advised their citizens to leave. French warships and planes have evacuated 1,400 French citizens from Yemen in the past four days. And Italian, German and American planes have shuttled in and out of Sana, flying out another 1,500 foreigners. **********Italian and American soldiers armed with assault rifles stood on the scorching tarmac of the Sana airport this afternoon. The engines of their C-130 transport planes rumbled in a noisy chorus as they waited for 200 Europeans and Americans, each holding a small suitcase, to walk up the back ramp of the aircraft. **********The forlorn foreigners quietly boarded, many clutching small children. The soldiers, jittery about renewed air attacks, scanned the light blue sky, which was streaked with whisps of white clouds.  Skirmishes Since August **********The nation's rival leaders, Mr. Saleh and Mr. Beedh, openly feuded as early as last August, when there were military skirmishes between their supporters. Mr. Beedh retired to Aden, the old southern capital, and refused to cooperate with the north, taking all the southerners who worked for the Government with him. **********In the next eight months both sides bought as much as $200 million in arms, Western diplomats said. Mediation sponsored by the United States and Arab countries failed. **********Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, who was in Yemen trying to mediate when the fighting broke out, told reporters in the United Arab Emirates today that he held out little hope for a peaceful settlement. **********Referring to Mr. Saleh, he said: ""He spoke in very strong terms about not being able to continue with what he called the Communist leaders.  Honestly, I do not believe he was listening fully to all my messages."" **********Abdel Aziz Abdel Ghani, the most powerful northern political leader after the President, dismissed calls for outside mediation. ""This is a problem between Yemenis,"" he told reporters today. ""It will be solved in a Yemeni way. There is no room for foreign intervention in Yemeni affairs."" **********Each side has boasted of great victories. Northern leaders and the Sana radio reported great military gains, saying northern soldiers were three miles from the center of Aden. But southern leaders said their forces had decimated the elite Amaliqa brigade that was moving on Aden. ""The Amaliqa has been destroyed,"" the southern Yemen radio said. **********Western diplomats in Sana, who have not been allowed near the fighting, said that the northern troops, after initial gains, appeared to be bogged down some 20 miles from Aden. ""Both sides are making outrageous claims,"" a European diplomat said. ""If the north does not take Aden quickly, the conflict could turn into a bloody war of attrition."" **********The fighting has also unleashed widespread looting and reprisal killings. Several people in Sana said southerners had been dragged from their homes and lynched by mobs. **********""These things are even more frightening than the war,"" said a geologist. ""We all say we are not that afraid, but anyone who can leave is getting out."""

Is Trying to Extend the Cease-Fire in Bosnia"," **********Warring factions in the conflict that has convulsed Bosnia and Herzegovina for 33 months continued today to inch toward a four-month cessation of fighting, which United Nations mediators hope will be a prelude to a political settlement of the war. **********Seeking to conclude the accord by this weekend, the senior United Nations commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, met in Sarajevo with the Vice President of Bosnia, Ejup Ganic, then traveled to nearby Pale for talks with Bosnian Serb leaders. **********Sporadic combat continued around the northwestern town of Bihac, but the rest of the country was calm as both Government and Bosnian Serb forces continued to observe the cease-fire negotiated last week by former President Jimmy Carter. **********""I don't think there's been a cease-fire in my time here that's held as well as this one,"" said General Rose, who has commanded United Nations troops here for 11 months. ""I think that's an indication of good intentions and of goodwill toward the peace process."" **********Leaders of both sides echoed the General's optimism. **********""I hope that if we have a cease-fire in Bihac and a withdrawal of Croatian Serb troops from the area, we can proceed further and come to a cessation of hostilities,"" Vice President Ganic said. **********The Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Radovan Karadzic, reported that negotiations were ""going very well."" **********""We expect the U.N. to discuss it with the Muslims and then we can go, let's say, to Geneva or a ship in the Adriatic Sea and sign it solemnly,"" Dr. Karadzic said. ""I hope this will be done before Jan. 1."" **********United Nations officials in Zagreb said they were expecting the chief United Nations envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, to attend any signing ceremony. The officials said they expected any signing to take place in Sarajevo, but Dr. Karadzic seems to prefer another venue. **********A Bosnian Government official said in Sarajevo that Mr. Akashi would travel to Sarajevo on Saturday morning in an effort to clinch an accord on a cessation of fighting. The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters that Mr. Akashi would seek to bridge ""serious differences"" between the two sides. **********""He has some work to do if there is going to be a deal by Jan. 1,"" the official said. **********If the accord is signed, mediators will then face the more daunting challenge of persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept the comprehensive peace plan proposed earlier this year by the five-nation ""contact group,"" which consists of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. **********The Muslim-dominated Government has already accepted the plan, which would give it and its Croat allies control over 51 percent of the country's territory and Bosnian Serbs the remaining 49 percent. Bosnian Serb leaders have complained that the land apportioned to them under the plan is militarily indefensible and economically unproductive. **********The self-appointed Bosnian Serb parliament, meeting in Pale on Thursday, approved a statement saying its side was ready to enter negotiations ""based on the existing plan."" That language fell short of what negotiators want. They have presented the contact group plan as a finished document not subject to change, and insist that the Bosnian Serbs accept it as it stands. **********In the Serb-held region of Croatia today, Serb soldiers fired machine-gun bursts at two United Nations military observers and then forced them to lie on the ground while they were interrogated at gunpoint, the United Nations spokesman, Thant Myint-U, reported. **********Mr. Thant Myint-U said the observers, a Ghanian and a Jordanian, were following a Serbian convoy ""at a discreet distance"" when they were fired upon. The observers turned back but were chased by Serbs, pulled from their vehicle, searched and interrogated before being released. **********""We consider this completely unacceptable behavior,"" Mr. Thant Myint-U said."

Yet usually Americans like few ads they see and love even fewer, if any. **********Occasionally, though, beyond the wildest dreams or schemes of advertisers and agencies, without their help or hype, an ad becomes more than popular: it becomes part of the popular culture. **********Millions of people spontaneously and simultaneously seize upon a phrase, a character or a song from an ad and talk about it, joke about it, even ask to see it again. Examples include the commercial in which a doubting youngster named Mikey surprisingly liked Life cereal and the campaign in which a smarmy salesman named Joe told unbelievable lies about Isuzu cars and trucks. **********""It's the most peculiar thing,"" said Charles Rath, executive vice president of marketing for Wendy's International Inc., who experienced a particularly forceful version of the phenomenon a decade ago when a skeptical old woman named Clara Peller bellowed, ""Where's the beef?"" **********""I'd like to have you believe I was so astute as to have thought through"" the reaction to the spot, he added. That reaction included T-shirts, bumper stickers and then-Vice President Walter F. Mondale asking the meat-seeking question of Gary Hart in a debate. **********""But I don't know how you'd ever build that into a strategy,"" Mr. Rath said. ""There's every effort every day to try to go out and manufacture something that works like this, but if you try too hard, you can't."" **********Currently, there are two instances of the public anointing ads with approbation: ***********In a series of humorous television spots for Bud Light beer by DDB Needham Chicago, an actor named Eddie Jemison portrays a brash but foolish impostor who finagles his way into plummy situations by proclaiming ""Yes I am!"" to anyone rightfully doubting his identity. ***********In a commercial for Diet Coke by Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, a group of female office workers ogle a bare-chested construction worker, played by a model named Lucky Vanous, as he takes his daily Diet Coke break. **********""We really had no idea it would be so successful,"" said Jim Schumacker, Bud Light marketing director at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, adding that the impostor's popularity ""exploded"" after CBS produced a parody version during its coverage of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament -- and President Clinton spoke the character's catch phrase to open one CBS broadcast. **********Steve Jackson, vice president and management representative on the Bud Light account at DDB Needham Chicago, compared the ""runaway hit"" status of Mr. Jemison's character to Spuds MacKenzie, the Bud Light ""party animal"" of the 1980's. **********""When the public votes like that,"" Mr. Jackson said, ""you want to continue the character."" So Mr. Jemison is appearing in a fourth commercial that began running last week, pretending to be a woman so he can play in a ladies-only pool tournament. **********The response to Diet Coke's role reversal has included innumerable free reruns of the commercial in news coverage and waves of attention for Mr. Vanous, who is declared one of ""the 50 most beautiful people in the world"" in the May 9 issue of People magazine and has a small part in tonight's episode of the NBC sitcom ""Wings."" **********""Neither I nor anyone else had any idea the commercial would cause this stir,"" Mr. Vanous said. ""I've done some 20-odd commercials and this was the one that stopped everybody."" **********Now Diet Coke and Bud Light face a problem: What next? Too often, the benefits bestowed by these lucky ads are dissipated by overexploitation and failure to plan effective follow-ups. **********""The trick is letting it develop on its own,"" said Mr. Rath of Wendy's, which suffered a severe sales slump after mismanaging the ""Where's the beef?"" hoopla. He said the company served up ""very transparent"" sequels that ""always failed."" **********""And you have to figure out how to keep it out in the public eye, to keep the interest up,"" he added, ""but not too much to kill it."" For instance, he said, Wendy's is deliberately ""pulling back"" on requests for outside appearances by R. David Thomas, its founder, so that ""we have a good chance of keeping alive for another two, three years"" its current hit campaign, by Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., featuring him. **********Coca-Cola's difficulty is that beefing up Mr. Vanous's role would contradict the premise of the Diet Coke campaign, which was deliberately centered on everyday situations to break the brand's dependence on a skein of stars. **********""We're thrilled with the response,"" Nancy Gibson, Diet Coke worldwide brand director with the Coca-Cola Company, said, ""but it was not our intent to make him a spokesperson or to feature a celebrity in the ads. Part of the power of Lucky is that he's an everyday guy."" **********That's why the company is chary of making a sequel, even though People chides, ""Come on, Coke,"" in its article about Mr. Vanous. **********Executives at DDB Needham Chicago are considering ""new ideas for the impostor,"" Mr. Jackson said, ""perhaps having the character not be the only person in our advertising saying 'Yes I am!' and having other people try to get a Bud Light by taking on the character of someone else."" **********That would not displease the impostor. **********""It would probably be their wisest thing to pass on the line,"" Mr. Jemison said. ""That would be more interesting"" than endless appearances by the impostor, he added. **********""It somehow seems wrong to me to milk it,"" he continued. **********Yes it does."

The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.93 points, to 792.12. **********Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said he saw a continuation of the pattern of a modest rally followed by a modest retreat for the next few sessions. That has been the pattern since Feb. 4, ""Fed Friday,"" when the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term rates a quarter point. **********""I'm still bullish, but the bull is 42 months old,"" Mr. Goldman said. ""He goes up two, then down one and takes a nap."" Sees an Upturn **********As for a further correction, Mr. Goldman, in the minority among analysts, said he believed that the market had already touched bottom. Last Wednesday, he noted, the Dow hit an intraday low of 3,756.04, down almost 6 percent from the Dow's Jan. 31 peak of 3,978.36. **********The Dow industrials were mainly dragged down by economically sensitive stocks. Allied Signal declined 1 3/8, to 77 1/8, and Alcoa fell 3/4, to 74 3/4. **********No single company dragged down the broader Standard & Poor's 500. But soft-drink companies like Coca-Cola, electrical equipment companies like General Electric, and oil companies like Atlantic Richfield all declined modestly in moderate trading. **********The market started out puzzled yesterday. In a speech on Monday night in Baltimore, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, said that facile economic forecasters were assuming that short-term interest rates would be ""three something."" **********That ""three something"" was interpreted by bond traders as a low probability for another rate increase and therefore an opportunity to buy. Bond prices rallied in the morning, yields fell, and stocks climbed when the New York Stock Exchange opened at 9:30 A.M. **********Both the stock and bond markets have been vigilant about inflation because it hurts the value of bonds and raises the borrowing costs for corporations and thus hurts stocks, too. 'Three Something' Remark **********But shortly before the stock exchange opened, the ""three something"" remark was being described by a Fed spokesman as an offhand bit of levity, which puzzled bond traders, who have been hanging on Fed officials' every word. **********With that clarification, bond traders and began to sell bonds, with the yield ending the day at 6.86 percent, up from 6.79 percent on Monday. **********""If that's Mr. Lindsey's sense of humor, he should never be a stand-up comic,"" Mr. Goldman of A. G. Edwards said. ""But I guess that just means that even a Fed governor is human."" **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index yesterday fell 0.59 point, to 258.48, on moderate volume of 298.1 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,174 to 944. The American Stock Exchange market value index declined 1.38 points, to 467.68. **********The most active stock yesterday was Synoptics Communications, a developer of computer networking equipment, at a volume of six million shares. The company had prospered by linking computers made by different manufacturers, but recently inventory has been swelling and order rates low. Analysts yesterday trimmed the company's earnings estimates. Synoptics closed down 1/2, to 24, in Nasdaq trading."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/17/world/sweden-s-rightist-coalition-seen-as-facing-defeat.html,William Schmidt,1994-09-17,,827,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Sweden's Rightist Coalition Seen as Facing Defeat,Sweden's Rightist Coalition Seen as Facing Defeat," **********As Sweden prepares for a national election on Sunday, the message from every major public opinion survey seems clear: Prime Minister Carl Bildt's tenure as the head of the country's first rightist coalition Government in decades appears to be entering its final days. **********His four-party coalition has been a casualty not only of Sweden's economic crisis -- double-digit interest rates and Europe's most crippling budget deficit -- but also of nostalgia among voters for the salad days of the nation's cradle-to-grave welfare system. Since he took power in 1991, Mr. Bildt's reformist zeal has been aimed at reducing many of those benefits, as a way to trim soaring Government expenditures. **********In his place, voters are almost certain to install Ingvar Carlsson, the 59-year-old former Prime Minister and leader of the rival Social Democrats, the socialist architects of the big-spending state welfare system that was once the envy of the world. Yet even if Sweden lurches back to the left, as expected, Mr. Carlsson and his colleagues are unlikely to be the government many disgruntled voters are hoping for. **********Even if they do return to power, the Social Democrats have made clear that they will continue to cut spending rather than restore programs dismantled by Mr. Bildt, a 45-year-old reformer who set out to do to Sweden what Margaret Thatcher did in Britain -- slash Government budgets and privatize Government enterprises. **********In recent weeks Mr. Carlsson has been confronted by anxious financial markets, including an usual public campaign by the executives of Sweden's largest public corporations, warning that Sweden cannot return to its old policies without risking the flight of investment capital. The country faces economic disaster, said Peter Wallenberg, Sweden's top industrialist, unless a ""chainsaw"" is taken to the national debt and the budget deficit. **********For his part, Mr. Carlsson has promised to reduce spending by some $8 billion over the next four years, although critics have attacked his plans to increase some tax rates to offset spending cuts. **********But the tempering of Mr. Carlsson's socialist oratory has not set well with many voters. **********""There are a lot of people who want to go back to what we had before, and they are disappointed the Social Democrats are not promising to do that,"" said Olaf Sandertsoon, an editor of Dagens Nyheter, one of Stockholm's main newspapers. **********A month ago, polls showed voters prepared to give the Social Democrats at least half the ballots cast, suggesting that Mr. Carlsson might win a parliamentary majority outright for the first time in three decades. Today, public opinion polls give them 44 percent of the vote, still the largest block among Sweden's seven parties, but not enough to govern without the help of a coalition partner. **********To secure control of more than half the votes in Sweden's 349-seat Parliament, Mr. Carlsson is most likely to seek out a partner near the middle of Sweden's political spectrum like the centrist Liberal Party, now a member of Mr. Bildt's Government, rather than seek out his traditional allies on the left. **********It is not only economic imperatives that are pushing the old socialist alliance toward the middle, but also European politics. The Swedes are scheduled to vote again in November, this time to decide whether or not to endorse Sweden's application to become a member of the European Union. **********Mr. Carlsson and Mr. Bildt both endorse membership, but both the Green Party and the Left Party are opposed, which means that Mr. Carlsson cannot realistically ask them to join his coalition should they earn enough seats to get into Parliament. **********At present, public opinion surveys suggest that the Greens are undergoing a kind of political resurgence, driven in part by voters who have deserted the Social Democrats because of their cautious approach to welfare or their endorsement of the European Union. **********Pre-election surveys suggest meanwhile that Mr. Bildt's former coalition, which held more than half the seats in the last Parliament, is likely to win just over 40 percent of the seats among them, or less than the Social Democrats alone. **********In many ways, Mr. Bildt was a victim of bad economic luck. Shortly after he took office in 1991, his economic reform plan was overwhelmed by Europe's worst recession since World War II, driving up unemployment and widening budget deficits. Although exports and industrial production have swung upward and unemployment has dropped, economic recovery and investor confidence remain uncertain. **********""Sweden was like a ship out of control, and Mr. Bildt needed more time to stop it and get it going in a new direction,"" said Paul Tufuesson, a church music director who stopped to hear Mr. Bildt campaign on Wednesday in this southern coastal town. ""I only hope we don't swing back too far left, because it will make things worse."""

MARIO FELIBERTY, medical director of the Kemper Corporation's life insurance operations, began complaining to superiors in late 1992. He was feeling pain in his arms and hands from long hours of typing evaluations of claims by policyholders and other reports. By last summer, his doctor had ordered him to quit work. He had surgery on both hands and endless hours of therapy. But his hands, now dry, red and swollen, are still weak, intermittently spastic, and always painful. **********The specialists Dr. Feliberty has seen say he has symptoms of a rare, incurable condition known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It might have been caused by the typing or by the operations intended to help him. **********This spring, Dr. Feliberty said, Kemper told him his job was being eliminated. The 53-year-old former heart surgeon now despairs of finding significant medical work elsewhere. ""Employers cannot legally turn me down because my hands are so damaged, but they find a way,"" Dr. Feliberty said. ""My career is over."" **********Like millions of workers injured on the job each year, Dr. Feliberty has filed a state workers' compensation claim in the hope of recovering most of his medical costs and lost wages. But with his family now depending on disability payments under an insurance policy that pays only 60 percent of his former salary, Dr. Feliberty decided to take his case to the Government. **********He complained to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that Kemper had violated his rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which forbids job discrimination against people with permanent disabilities. Last week, frustrated by the lack of a settlement, he asked the agency for permission to sue Kemper under the terms of the new act. The potential payment is much more than he could get under workers' compensation -- up to $300,000 in compensatory and punitive damages for injuries, plus attorneys' fees, lost wages, lost future earning power, and lost pension benefits, according to Dennis Hesser, his attorney. (Kemper declined to discuss the case.) **********Dr. Feliberty and scores of others who have filed complaints under the disabilities act since it went into effect in 1992 are seeking to add yet another weapon to a growing arsenal of legal strategies being deployed by workers who say that they are suffering from repetitive strain disorders and that they deserve better compensation and other remedies like retraining programs. The growing legal challenges, along with a sharp rise in the number of such disorders reported, could rapidly raise the price that business ends up paying to address this problem. **********There's more coming if OSHA has its way. The Federal agency plans to impose on offices, retailers, construction sites and factories a new regulation aimed at forcing all types of businesses to cut the risk of repetitive strain disorders. **********Business representatives in Washington are skeptical. ""This has the potential to be the most expensive regulation ever to hit business, without doing much good,"" said Mark Stuart, a lobbyist on health matters for the National Association of Manufacturers. **********Repetitive strain disorders still represent a small percentage of workplace injuries and illnesses -- just 4 percent in 1992, according to Federal statistics. But the number is growing rapidly and extending to new lines of work as more Americans rely on computers. **********So far the vast majority of repetitive strain cases have been handled through workers' compensation hearings. But the use of other legal forums is growing quickly. In addition to claims under the new disabilities act, injured workers have: *********** Sued I.B.M. and more than 100 other makers of electronic equipment; *********** Persuaded the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state agencies to demand improvements on behalf of groups of workers; *********** Pursued claims based on various state laws protecting workers. **********""A business can face a quintuple whammy,"" said Christopher Bell, a Washington lawyer who is an expert on the disabilities act, as he recounted the various legal actions that could derive from a single injury. ""Actually, it could be more than that in some states."" **********Eager to avoid a situation in which the number and variety of cases grows to rival the legal quagmire involving asbestos, many companies have adopted ""ergonomics"" programs in which equipment and work routines are redesigned to better fit employees. Wal-Mart, for example, has begun introducing new checkout counters developed by its suppliers after consultation with Wal-Mart employees. Among the 25 or so adaptations are extra laser scanners to reduce the amount of lifting and stretching required to position items so that the price can be read electronically. **********But Government policy makers and labor representatives say that regulations are needed to hasten and expand such changes. ""We see a rapid escalation in the injuries caused by a mismatch between workplace design and the physical capacity of the workers doing the jobs,"" said Joseph Dear, the Assistant Secretary of Labor who heads OSHA. He has pledged to have a proposed rule published by the end of September. And, he said, there are feasible steps that businesses can be directed to take to reduce the incidence of repetitive strain disorders. **********""Corporations have been becoming more aware of ergonomics without regulation, but it's been too slow a process,"" said Neal Taslitz, president of the Backcare Corporation, an ergonomics consulting firm in Chicago that has been advising Dr. Feliberty. **********Business representatives fear the rule will impose burdensome paperwork. They also doubt the Government can come up with rules precise enough to be clear but broad enough to be reasonably applied universally. **********Skeptics say the rapid increase in the statistics merely reflects more awareness throughout industry of repetitive strain problems and incidents in high-profile white-collar professions like journalism, not an epidemic. OSHA's intention to regulate has also been criticized by those who say that poor ergonomics typically has far less to do with the problem than do poor posture, poor physical conditioning and obesity, as well as ""psychosocial"" factors like whether an employee likes a boss or is under stress at home. **********""The work itself plays a minuscule role,"" said Dr. Peter Nathan, a Portland, Ore., hand specialist who has studied keyboard workers with carpal tunnel syndrome, a relatively rare but widely discussed nerve disorder that causes numbness and pain in the hands, among other symptoms. **********The battle comes as the range of people affected by repetitive strain disorders seems to be widening. Such injuries have long plagued laborers like butchers, bakers, assembly-line workers and construction workers. During the 1980's, large new groups of workers using computers and other new electronic equipment began reporting similar ailments. Among them: telephone operators, supermarket checkers, and journalists, including several hundred employees of The New York Times. **********Federal statistics for 1992, the latest available, put the number of reported private-sector cases of repetitive strain disorders (which OSHA calls cumulative trauma disorder) at 282,000, up from just 30,000 in the mid-1980's. Most ergonomics experts think the number is much higher and that, with tens of millions of workers spending long hours at computers, the number will only swell. **********""I hate to use words like epidemic, but I see it everywhere,"" said Dr. Emil Pascarelli, a New York City physician who has treated several thousand patients. ""There will be a rise in middle-management injuries as these people spend more time at keyboards,"" he said, when asked whether Dr. Feliberty's case reflected a broadening of the problem. Dr. Pascarelli said his clients in New York include stockbrokers, investment bankers, lawyers and owners of small businesses. **********One lingering question is whether the ergonomic improvements that lawsuits and regulations would encourage would make much of a difference. **********Case in point: The Communications Workers of America, whose members include 450,000 workers at video display terminals, says that at least half of them display some symptoms of repetitive strain problems and anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent in various jobs have been found to have such disorders. The union has found no evidence of a decrease in the number or severity of such disorders when ergonomic programs addressed the equipment, furniture and design of workplaces without also changing operating practices that workers find stressful, like having supervisors monitor the number of keystrokes each worker makes in a given period or requiring long work periods without rest. **********""There's no funding for the kind of studies that would really establish the role of various factors,"" said David LeGrande, the union's director of occupational safety and health. **********Such uncertainty will only intensify the battles, including ones on the following four fronts: OSHA Regulation **********OSHA has put its effort to draft a broad ergonomics regulation on a fast track. In the past the Federal agency reached agreement on ergonomics programs with certain industries, like meatpacking, under a general mandate to protect worker safety. However, that mandate, according to judges asked to rule on complaints, leaves OSHA with the burden of identifying ergonomic shortcomings and then proving that feasible remedies exist if companies fight back. OSHA has had trouble meeting that challenge. **********The regulation Mr. Dear envisions would shift to business the burden of identifying ergonomic risks and remedies. Once the proposed rule is published, OSHA would have to receive and respond to public comment. Lobbyists figure a final regulation could begin to take effect as early as 1996. **********Mr. Dear said OSHA would not dictate specific ways that businesses must change their equipment or work practices. Instead, companies would have to identify situations in which there is a high risk of injury from strains building over time, such as tasks that require workers to work long hours at keyboards without relief, repeatedly stretch for something or lift heavy objects. **********He said the proposed regulation would also spell out new rules for reporting strain disorders. Finally, businesses would be required to develop a program to make changes based on their surveys of ways to reduce the risk, and prepare evaluations of their results. **********Proponents of regulation say that business has little to fear because OSHA has neither the resources nor the desire to micromanage workplace ergonomics. Instead, they say, a good regulation will force businesses to educate themselves and workers to the importance of ergonomics. They say such a process would result not in big new costs but in huge savings, by reducing injury rates and improving morale. **********Backers of regulation cite a study by Dr. Janie Vale, clinical director of the Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health at the University of West Virginia Medical School, of a Tyson Foods poultry processing plant in Monett, Mo., that reduced its workers' compensation expenses to $1,000 from $106,000 in two years through a comprehensive ergonomics and medical management program. Others achieving impressive results with programs that go beyond mere changes in equipment include U.S. West, L.L. Bean and several insurance companies. **********But cost is not the only worry business executives have. They also wonder how a new OSHA rule would fit with state and private standards. So far, Mr. Dear's approach sounds a lot like that being developed by California's counterpart to OSHA, but until both standards are finally published, no one knows how they will dovetail. Businesses are also monitoring a voluntary standard being developed under the sponsorship of the National Safety Council for approval by the American National Standards Institute. The institute is a nonprofit organization that sets standards often recognized by courts as good business practice. The Disabilities Act **********NONE of the debate leading up to the passage of the disabilities act or early efforts by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to implement it anticipated that it would be a new battleground for repetitive strain cases. As of March, the latest month for which figures were available, Dr. Feliberty was one of 59 workers who had filed repetitive strain claims under the act with the commission. **********Under the act, a worker cannot sue an employer without the commission's approval. In April, five reservations clerks at the Pittsburgh office of U.S. Air received such permission and filed their suits. If their cases prove successful, lawyers say, the number of such claims could soar. **********The act applies to all businesses with 50 or more employees and will be extended to those with 25 or more employees next month. **********One encouraging note for plaintiffs: Janice Goodman, a microfilmer at the Boeing Company whose job required her to place papers under a camera lens and push a button to photograph them up to 14,500 times a day, was awarded $1.2 million by a court in the state of Washington after complaining that her employer had violated provisions of a state disability statute resembling the new Federal law. The Equipment Suits **********THE highest-profile litigation to date has been the more than 2,000 complaints, including some from employees of The New York Times, filed against equipment makers. More than 100, including I.B.M. and AT&T, have been named in at least one suit. The manufacturers have been accused of, among other things, negligence or willful wrongdoing in failing to warn consumers that their products could be harmful. Some plaintiffs have asked for tens of millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive awards. **********So far, the equipment makers have won the handful of cases that have been tried, but plaintiffs' attorneys say that each trial brings out more information that puts defendants in a bad light, and that such information will one day reach the level needed to persuade juries. They are hoping that recently discovered papers showing that some of the equipment makers trained their own employees to avoid injuries while using the equipment -- without passing that advice on to customers -- will be admissible and convincing. Worker'ss' Comp **********LABOR LAWYERS say that workers' compensation payments for repetitive strain disorders vary widely among the states. Workers' compensation generally pays for approved medical expenses and a percentage of lost wages; it is not meant to cover pain and suffering. But some states resist paying out anything for most repetitive strain disorders, arguing that it cannot be proven that they originate in the workplace. Some calculate from charts assigning a set value to each body part and adjusting downward to reflect what percentage of utility the injured part retains. **********The labor lawyers say that as the number of claims grows, the trend even in generous states like California has been to find ways to limit their impact on the workers' compensation system. In that state, for example, business this year won a $16,000 ceiling on how much it must spend on rehabilitating an employee or accommodating his or her injury with workplace adjustments. **********In some states where full disability payments are modest, employers have had an incentive to classify injured employees they don't care for as permanently disabled in order to remove them from their jobs. That tactic may become less common, labor law experts say, because it could leave the employee with a discrimination claim under the Federal Disabilities act. MANY VARIETIES, ALL PAINFUL **********REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY, the nerve disease suffered by Dr. Mario Feliberty, is one of scores of distinguishable medical conditions that some doctors have linked to the stress of repetitive motions in the workplace. Some patients have as many as 10 nerve, muscle and circulatory ailments caused or worsened by such work, according to Dr. Emil Pascarelli, co-author of the recently published ""Repetitive Strain Injury"" (John Wiley & Sons). **********Common muscle and tendon disorders include tendinitis (tears in tissue connecting bones to muscles), myofascial damage (tenderness and swelling from overworking muscles), and tenosynovitis (irritation of the boundary between the tendon and the surrounding sheath, which can lead to swelling or painful friction when tendons move). **********Cervical radiculopathy (compression of disks in the neck) often develops in workers who hold a phone on a shoulder while typing. Epicondylitis is an elbow ailment, known in its most common form as tennis elbow. **********Nerve disorders include carpal tunnel syndrome, perhaps the most publicized repetitive stress injury although it is relatively uncommon. Swelling inside the tunnel created by bone and ligament at the wrist can put pressure on nerves passing through it, leading to pain, tingling and numbness. **********Thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when swelling of tendons and other soft tissues restricts circulation, causing pain, numbness, weakness in fingers and hands, and coldness. Constricted blood vessels can also contribute to Raynaud's Disease, with symptoms including pain and tingling. **********The disorders cross medical specialties, making it hard for sufferers to find doctors who are familiar with all of them. There are disagreements on the best therapy in some cases; in others, the preferred therapy for one syndrome is the opposite of that for illnesses it resembles. RSD, for example, can be mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome but can be worsened by the operation often used to treat the latter."

The company says it wants to stay independent, but security analysts dream of a juicy takeover deal. **********They say the company, based in Morris Plains, N.J., is a relatively weak drug maker, not big or profitable enough to stand alone. Its 1993 sales were $5.79 billion, of which $2.11 billion were drugs. **********Takeover fever swept the drug industry last month after the hostile $8.5 billion opening bid for the American Cyanamid Company by the American Home Products Corporation. The collapse of the Clinton Administration's proposals for drug price constraints also spurred interest in the stocks, which had been in the doldrums for months. **********Larry Feinberg, a partner at Oracle Health Investors, a securities management fund, said he ""backed the truck up to load drug stocks"" after the American Cyanamid deal. He said Warner-Lambert and the Schering-Plough Corporation, also relatively small, ""could go for really big prices."" **********Nine United States drug stocks in a Paine Webber Securities listing gained 13 percent in August, more than three times the 3.8 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. Warner-Lambert jumped 28 percent in the month, reaching a high of $86.75 on Aug. 30 before slipping back. Warner-Lambert rose $1.50 yesterday, to $82.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Shares of the Upjohn Company and Marion Merrell Dow Inc., which says it is seeking strategic advice from investment bankers, also soared on takeover speculation. All three had problems after patent expirations and price-slashing competition for main products: Upjohn's Xanax anti-anxiety drug and Halcion for insomnia; Marion Merrell Dow's Cardizem heart drug, and Warner-Lambert's Lopid, to lower cholesterol levels. **********Of the three companies, Ronald Nordmann of Paine Webber said he liked Warner-Lambert the best, but when the price rose last week, he downgraded the stock slightly to ""attractive,"" from ""buy."" **********Warner-Lambert's strength is the consumer products division, including over-the-counter drugs, new versions of its venerable Listerine mouthwash, the recently acquired Wilkinson Sword wet-shave line, chewing gum and candy. **********""The confectionary and over-the-counter business is quite strong,"" said Carl J. Seiden of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. **********Paul Brooke of Morgan Stanley & Company called the company ""a conglomerate that is valued on"" its lowest part, the pharmaceutical business. **********If it can stave off a takeover, Warner-Lambert can look forward to new drugs, possibly including seven that are in late-stage testing. It plans to seek Federal approval for milder, nonprescription versions of Wellcome's Zovirax, an anti-viral treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and Glaxo's Zantac, a blockbuster anti-ulcer drug. **********But Jack Lamberton at NatWest Securities suggested time was running out. ""If they don't restructure, a hostile bidder will come along,"" he said, predicting Warner-Lambert would have to sell or spin off to shareholders the pharmaceuticals, consumer products or confectionary units. **********Mr. Lamberton conceded that ""the pieces will be weaker than the whole,"" unless one of the units attracted a buyer, but ""breaking the company apart will release shareholder value."" **********George Shields, a Warner-Lambert spokesman, said the company preferred to keep the three divisions intact while it waited for new drugs from its pipeline, starting in 1996. **********But Mr. Lamberton insisted that ""most shareholders would prefer to get their capital gain now, rather than two years from now."" **********One logical bidder might be Glaxo Holdings P.L.C. of Britain, which has nearly $4 billion in cash. Glaxo's Zantac, the world's biggest-selling drug, may have to scramble soon for managed-care customers lured away by new low-priced generic versions of SmithKline's Tagamet. ""Zantac is headed for a cliff; Glaxo has to do something,"" Mr. Feinberg of Oracle Health said."

When he emerged from the murky waters of the Potengi River, he reported a catch too big for his rowboat: a twin-engine B-25 bomber. **********Patrick Muller, a French scuba diver, confirmed it after a day of underwater exploration. ""It's an American B-25 all right, almost completely intact,"" he said. ""The plane was down there for 50 years, and then this guy snags it in his net."" **********Half a century ago, this coastal city on Brazil's northeastern bulge was frenetically following the World War II call by President Roosevelt to become a ""Trampoline for Victory."" Today the base is a shadow of its former grandeur, but Brazil is trying to take advantage of the 50th anniversary of D-Day to renew interest in its history. **********The busiest American air base in the world in the first half of 1944, the twin strips of Parnamirim field at Natal handled a landing every three minutes as troops and cargo were ferried across the South Atlantic to feed campaigns in Italy, Africa, Russia, Burma and China and the looming invasion of Normandy. **********The closest point in the Americas to Africa, this equatorial city provided a year-round jumping-off point for the limited-range planes of the era. A alternate northern route, through Newfoundland and Greenland, was blocked for weeks at a time by winter weather. **********""It was tremendous operation,"" Abe Cohen, 75, an American veteran now living in Rio de Janeiro, recalled of his days as an air-traffic controller. ""We had hundreds of planes and thousands of men going through there every day in peak periods."" **********Half a century ago, this bustling American military city had enough barracks and tents for 6,600 soldiers, a weekly newspaper, and a big Post Exchange supplied by Latin America's first Coca-Cola bottling plant. **********Today the base is a pilot training center for the Brazilian Air Force. On a recent afternoon, a visitor to the old U.S.O. open-air theater startled swallows nesting among stage lights that once illuminated shows by Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart. Fallen mangoes littered the grass around a New England-style chapel, built in 1943 with an aircraft warning beacon atop its steeple. The only jeep to be seen on the base was a dune buggy carrying Brazilian airmen for a weekend at the beach. **********In the early 1940's, in an ultimately successful effort to win Brazil over to the Allied side, the United States built airfields and Brazil's first steel plant.  A generation of military friendships forged here allowed for a close alliance between Brazil and the United States. **********Today Brazil is trying to resurrect the World War II alliance in the name of the region's modern international nexus: tourism. **********Last year, for the first time since the World War II air ferry shut down, Natal inaugurated its first scheduled international flight -- to Rome. Officials in this city of 650,000 people hope to attract Americans by dusting off the almost forgotten wartime link. **********Later this year a Historical Museum of World War II Aviation is to open, drawing on equipment left behind by the Americans, including a B-23 and a B-25. A jeep used by President Roosevelt and President Getulio Vargas of Brazil when they met in Natal in 1943 will also be displayed. **********Photographs will capture some of the 1940's figures who passed through here: Eleanor Roosevelt, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Harry Hopkins, Charles Lindbergh, Jack Benny, Ernie Pyle and Tyrone Power. **********The cast of Axis spies who turned Natal into a Brazilian Casablanca will be less visible -- the German nun who routinely talked her way past guards at the docks and shadowy Brazilian fascists who always seemed to cruise their motorbikes past the port when troop transports dropped anchor. **********""The local police were sharply criticized for the negligent way they treated suspected Axis agents,"" Clyde Smith Jr., an American professor who lives here, wrote last year in his Portuguese-language history of the base. **********For Brazilians old enough to remember the American presence, unpleasant memories of air-raid drills and bomb shelters have largely given way to happier images of G.I.'s knocking down Cuba libres at the Wonder Bar. **********""I learned to dance the swing,"" Maria Lucia da Costa, now a great-grandmother, recalled as she served homemade cake to an American visitor. ""The boogie-woogie was great. The American parties had everything."" **********Her husband, Fernando Hippolyto da Costa, a retired Brazilian Air Force colonel, chimed in with a list of American contributions to local culture: ""Rayban sunglasses, American cigarettes, canned beer, greased hair, and wearing shorts."" **********Protasio Pinheiro de Melo, who taught Portuguese at the base, recently wrote a book on ""North American contributions to Rio Grande do Norte life."" Relaxing on his palm-shaded veranda, he ran down his list: ""Kissing girls in public, drinking out of bottles, dancing the jitterbug, calling everyone 'my friend,' and wearing sport clothes."" **********""When the Americans came here, they found a small town with a lot of prejudices,"" Mr. de Melo said of Natal, which 50 years ago had a population of 40,000. ""Girls couldn't go to parties without chaperones. We had to wear coats and ties at the cinemas."" **********Pointing to a picture of himself solemnly wearing a coat, tie and hat to a G.I. volleyball game in 1943, Mr. de Melo added with a laugh, ""I must have 80 ties in the closet that I never wore again."""

More recently, the Hewlett-Packard Company became a third investor in Taligent. **********To succeed as an alternative to Microsoft, Taligent must win the commitment of other software companies, which are now deciding where to invest as they develop new software technology. 'Object'-Based Software **********Taligent offers designers reusable components called objects that can be hooked together to create computer applications. A number of systems have begun to incorporate object-oriented programming, including the Nextstep system developed by Steven P. Jobs of Next Computer Inc. Mr. Jobs recently struck an alliance with Sun Microsystems Inc. **********And Microsoft has already developed its own object-based system, known as Cairo. The company has said that it will make programming for that software compatible with its current Windows software, which already includes some object-oriented features. **********Microsoft executives have said that new software approaches would have difficulty gaining wide industry support because most software developers are now working in the Windows architecture. **********""The train has already left the station,"" said Jim Allchin, the Microsoft software designer who is in charge of the Cairo effort. **********But industry analysts have said that Microsoft faces some handicaps because its strategy requires any new system to remain compatible with its earlier software. An Uphill Struggle **********So Taligent must struggle to win converts. Today, during a panel discussion at a computer industry conference, only one developer raised his hand when members of an audience of more than 500 were asked if they planned to use the system. **********Joseph M. Guglielmi, chairman and chief executive of Taligent, said that 60 developers were already planning to work with an early release of the Taligent system, which is due out later this year. He said he planned to expand that group to 100 by the time the development kit was shipped. **********Taligent is basing its strategy on developing a layer of software that will run on operating systems on I.B.M., Apple and Hewlett-Packard computers, Mr. Guglielmi said. He said that Taligent would also be compatible with Microsoft's current Windows object-based software. **********But Taligent is hoping that its approach to software modules, called Frameworks, will be sufficiently compelling to attract a set of developers on its own. **********In the demonstration today, Taligent executives showed how it was possible to use Frameworks to quickly build a custom application that appeared on the screen. **********The Taligent system uses a new on-screen organizational system -- which the company labels as ""people,"" ""places"" and ""things."" Extensive use is made of icons representing familiar office objects like telephones, fax machines and business cards."

H. Macy & Company out of bankruptcy, the company's board yesterday submitted two proposals to Cyrus R. Vance, the court-appointed mediator in the case. **********The board, which has split over how to value Macy, is scheduled to meet again today, people close to the company said yesterday. Macy is to present its plan of reorganization to creditors Wednesday. **********The informants said that Mr. Vance, the former Secretary of State and mediator in the Bosnian war, would not make a choice between the two plans, or seek to wring a compromise. Instead, they said, in a meeting after the board's session Mr. Vance urged Myron E. Ullman 3d, chairman and chief executive of Macy, to forge a consensus among the directors. Company Chairman vs. Tisch **********Mr. Ullman, backed by two board members who represent the GE Capital Corporation, is promoting a plan that would value Macy at $3.5 billion. But Laurence A. Tisch, chairman and chief executive of the Loews Corporation and of CBS, and Macy's most influential outside director, is pushing for a plan valuing the company at roughly $4 billion. **********Harold Williams, another outside director who is president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, also prefers a higher valuation, creditors say. **********Whether these valuations were in the plans submitted to Mr. Vance could not be determined yesterday. **********Creditors were widely split, as well. Fidelity Investments, which owns about $500 million of Macy's secured debt -- roughly 21 percent -- issued a statement yesterday supporting the plan put together by Macy's management that values the company at $3.5 billion. But Fidelity reiterated a warning that it would explore other options if Macy's board voted in favor of a higher valuation. **********Other secured creditors have expressed similar concerns about putting a higher value on the company. However, bondholders and suppliers, whose claims are not backed by collateral, contend that the senior creditors are proposing a deliberately low valuation of the company so that their claims are repaid in part with stock in a reorganized Macy. Stock Can Have Advantages **********In many recent bankruptcy cases, the stock has ended up being far more valuable than the secured creditors' original claims. **********All the arguing over how much Macy is worth is part of the bankruptcy process, lawyers noted yesterday. Unlike bidding for a solvent company, where the highest bidder usually wins, the value of bankrupt companies generally boils down to what the most creditors can live with. **********Reaching consensus, however, can be grueling. Investment bankers have come up with valuations for Macy ranging from $2.8 billion to more than $4 billion. Question of Collateral **********There were signs yesterday that the combatants were shifting their focus to another area of contention, the value of the collateral underlying Macy's secured debt. If unsecured creditors can show that the real estate and other assets backing the senior creditors' claims are worth less than they were originally, the difference is then treated on the same terms as an unsecured claim. **********Bondholders argue that the Blackstone Group, Macy's financial adviser, lacks experience valuing real estate, and therefore its analysis of collateral values is flawed. **********""A number of the secured classes are under-collateralized,"" said Robert Miller, the lawyer representing the bondholders. ""Blackstone is not capable of valuing real estate. They have no real real estate group."" **********Secured creditors are satisfied, with some minor reservations, with the Blackstone collateral analysis."

But the militarily critical situation was in Gorazde, where the allies gave the Serbs until 2:01 A.M. local time Sunday (8:01 P.M. today, Eastern time) to pull their forces back 1.9 miles from the center of the city, allow free access to its 65,000 mainly Muslim refugees by United Nations forces, relief convoys and medical teams, and permit medical evacuations. **********The murderous, barbaric attacks against the defenseless civilians of Gorazde are an outrage,"" said the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner on Friday. ""Still today the shelling has continued. Half measures will not do. It is now up to the Bosnian Serbs to heed these demands, or they will face serious consequences."" **********Hours after the NATO decision, Bosnian Serbs were reported still to be shelling Gorazde. But in Belgrade, the special United Nations representative, Yasushi Akashi reported late Friday night that after 10 hours of negotiations, the top Serbian leaders, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, agreed to a cease-fire around Gorazde to begin at noon local time today (6 A.M. Eastern time). **********Mr. Akashi said the Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons that could hit the city, and that United Nations forces and relief workers could enter the city. But the United Nations envoy reported no Serbian agreement to withdraw all Bosnian Serb troops to the 1.9-mile limit stipulated by NATO, and it was uncertain whether this might prove a major obstacle. **********Friday's NATO council meeting, held by ambassadors representing the 16 members of the alliance, discussed a Clinton Administration proposal that called for a tougher military response to the continuing Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde, which have produced enormous destruction of buildings and killed at least 600 people in the city. **********The allies gave the Serbs until 2:01 A.M. Wednesday (8:01 P.M. Tuesday, Eastern time) to pull all their tanks, artillery pieces, mortars, multiple rocket launchers, missiles and antiaircraft weapons out of the 12.4-mile zone around Gorazde. Other Zones Included **********And, responding to a request from the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for authorization to call for air power to protect the other ""safe zones,"" as well as Gorazde, the allies agreed to allow military commanders to bomb heavy weapons and support facilities such as fuel and ammunition depots in all of them immediately if the Serbs launch attacks on them or mass heavy weapons inside a 12-mile radius of any of them after next Wednesday. The other areas are centered on Tuzla, Zepa, Bihac and Srebrenica; Sarajevo was covered by a separate ultimatum in February. **********The United States did not, however, get allied backing for an American proposal to let NATO military commanders decide what targets to strike without having to get United Nations approval. **********NATO officials did not specify what military targets would be hit beyond the heavy weapons -- tanks, artillery pieces, and mortars -- they have had authority to strike, if the United Nations asked them to, since last summer. Asked if there could be raids on bridges that carry Serbian reinforcements and supplies across the Drina River to the war zone, the American representative to NATO, Robert C. Hunter, said, ""only military targets,"" deliberately leaving them unclear. **********Officers in NATO's Allied Forces Southern Europe command in Naples said Friday night that they expected to receive a detailed list of targets from the alliance's military committee. Limited to Bosnia **********A sliver of Montenegro, which is part of the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav federation, would have been within the 12.4-mile circle around Gorazde, but NATO excluded it from the zone. Also excluded were bits of Serbia that would have fallen within the Zepa and Srebrenica zones. NATO officials here said that to strike targets outside Bosnia would widen allied involvement in the war. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Thursday that strikes against military objectives in Serbia might be considered later. **********NATO Governments, all facing mounting pressure from their constituents to do something besides just stand by and watch the slaughter in Gorazde, seemed to be hoping that the threat of wider bombing would persuade the Serbs to stop their offensive against Gorazde, just as a NATO ultimatum in February brought a halt to the shelling of Sarajevo. **********Pressure from the European allies on the United States to continue parallel efforts to reach a diplomatic settlement remained strong at Friday's meeting, which was held in NATO's headquarters outside Brussels. The allies also called on the Bosnian Government forces in Gorazde not to try to use NATO protection to launch a military offensive of their own. **********NATO officials said that Russia, whose leader has called for a summit meeting of American, Russian, U.N.United Nations and European Union negotiators within the next month, would be kept closely informed of Friday's decision. **********American officials here described the decision on Gorazde as the direct result of a Clinton Administration initiative. **********The United Nations has imposed a trade embargo on Serbia for its support of Serbian nationalist attacks on Croatian and Muslim areas of Bosnia since 1992, but the United States did not succeed in winning support from the allies to lift the arms embargo on all of what used to be Yugoslavia for the Bosnian Muslims. **********And despite an American attempt to short-circuit United Nations control over air strikes, NATO's commander in charge of air operations over Bosnia, Adm. Leighton Smith of the United States, will still have to agree on specific targets with the senior commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, before he can launch any air attacks, NATO officials said. **********U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali himself would have the right to approve the first strikes around Gorazde if the Serbs did not comply with NATO's conditions, Mr. Worner said. ""But after talking with him many times in recent days, I have no doubt that we will get it if the conditions we have stated are not met,"" he added. **********Military officers also said that they anticipate that they could agree on broad lists of targets with their United Nations counterparts. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali told him that he would immediately convey the terms of NATO's decision to Serbian authorities, Mr. Worner said, and the United States would inform Russia, which has repeatedly disapproved of air strikes and said it might pull its peacekeeping forces out of Bosnia if the violence escalates. **********United Nations forces did call in limited NATO air strikes last week on Serbian tanks and other weapons that were threatening their positions, but did not have authority to ask for bombing to prevent the attack on Gorazde itself, even though it was one of the six ""safe areas"" designated by the United Nations last May. **********Nor did President Clinton favor such authority, until now. **********""Last night President Clinton decided enough was enough,"" Mr. Hunter said Friday. ""Many people thought that the Bosnian Serbs were going to try to get in ahead of a NATO decision, so last night the President decided not to wait."" **********""This is not a tit-for-tat operation,"" Mr. Hunter said, though he declined to specify any of the targets that might be hit. Mr. Boutros-Ghali, in a letter to NATO five days ago, asked for authority for air strikes against ""artillery, mortar positions or tanks in or around the above-mentioned safe areas."" **********NATO military commanders can now strike against a broad range of military targets as long as the chief United Nations commander in Bosnia agrees, without the need to come back to NATO political authorities in Brussels for approval, Mr. Hunter said. If they wanted to strike additional targets in Serbian territory or elsewhere they would have to request approval from allied political authorities. **********Greece, which claims special relations with the Serbs and is closer to them than any of the other allies, dissociated itself from the decision on Gorazde but did not block it, the same stance it took on Sarajevo in February. **********Mr. Worner said that concerns by countries with large numbers of troops in the U.N. peacekeeping force -- Britain, France, Canada and Spain for example -- were part of the reason for the time it took to work out the terms of the guarantee for the other safe areas. Russian political sensitivities may have been another. BALKAN UPDATE **********In BRUSSELS, NATO warned the Bosnian Serbs to halt their attacks on the Muslim town of Gorazde and pull back their troops and arms there or they would face air strikes. The allies threatened similar strikes against Serbian military targets within about 12 miles of every other Muslim ""safe area"" in Bosnia. **********A senior United Nations official announced in BELGRADE that the Bosnian Serbs had agreed to a cease-fire in GORAZDE and to pull back heavy weapons. But there was no immediate sign of a truce in the town, where Serbian forces pounded neighborhoods with artillery and shellfire and launched new infantry assaults. **********In WASHINGTON, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he had approved a recommendation that diplomats' families be withdrawn from the American Embassy in BELGRADE to avoid exposing them to the risk of Serbian retaliation."

Grachev told reporters after meeting with Secretary of Defense William J. Perry at military headquarters. **********But General Grachev also warned of possible snags, saying, ""Since we are a great power, we have a large number of tasks."" **********One impediment could come from the Communist and nationalist parties, who have always opposed military cooperation with NATO and who solidified their informal coalition earlier this week to oppose the embattled President, Boris N. Yeltsin. Opposition Is Harsh **********Vladimir P. Lukin, a former ambassador to Washington who heads the foreign affairs committee of the lower house of Parliament, likened the NATO plan to submitting to rape. **********Secretary Perry, who came to Moscow to discuss arms control, said Washington was prepared to contribute $100 million next year for Russian, Ukrainian and American companies to build housing for Russian troops as part of a defense-conversion plan. **********And in a sign of close military cooperation, Mr. Perry plans to tour four former Soviet republics and visit once super-secret Soviet installations, including the Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan and an SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile site in Ukraine. Over the last two years, the United States has set aside $800 million to help the republics transport and destroy thousands of nuclear warheads. **********But that cooperation, embodied by the NATO proposal, has not been welcomed by Mr. Yeltsin's opposition. ""Russia joining this program is like when a rapist, having cornered a girl, gives her a choice,"" Mr. Lukin said of the proposal. ""Either she can just give in or he will have her anyway."" Perry Offers Assurances **********Russia signaled its willingness to ally with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization when such links were first proposed, in part because Moscow did not want to be left out while its neighbors made similar agreements. ""Whether we want it or not,"" said a top-ranking diplomat, Yuri Ushakov, ""the program will go on without us. **********Mr. Perry went to the lower house to meet some of its leaders, seeking to assuage their worst fears about his mission. He noted later, ""There's a lot of feeling in Russia, especially among the ultranationalists, that these conversion programs are a Western plot to disarm the nation."" **********The United States has viewed an informal NATO alliance, which it calls Partnership for Peace, as an alternative to a strictly military pact that could clear the way to full membership. Russia, which has opposed the expansion of NATO, clearly sees the plan as a way to gain leverage and help shape the relationship between its former satellites and the West. **********And that is an argument Mr. Yeltsin's supporters eagerly promote. **********""Like any compromise, Partnership for Peace is a fluid structure and lends itself to various interpretations,"" said Yuri K. Nazarkin, a top official at the Russian Security Council. He warned that even if Russia stayed away, NATO could expand. ""On the other hand, our accession to this program would enable us to sway the future evolution of this program according to Russia's nationalist interests,"" he added. Edginess in Moscow **********Moscow has warned the former Warsaw Pact countries and the former Soviet republics against joining NATO, arguing that Russian nationalists would interpret such a step as a provocative attempt to encircle Russia. Throughout the debate, Russia has been increasingly insistent that it be treated by its former enemies and its neighbors as the region's great power. **********In an effort to be sensitive to these raw nerves, United States officials have said that of course Russia has a unique role in any new European security network. A senior Defense Department official traveling with Mr. Perry said the Secretary had assured Mr. Grachev that Moscow would have ""a large and important role in the partnership."" **********Mr. Perry also took pains to credit Russia for its efforts in brokering peace in Bosnia. **********And Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, who is regularly baited by nationalists for being pro-Western, seemed to be addressing his opposition when he said that while all new associate members of NATO are equal, Russia ""is a great power with its own interests."" **********Those comments were a milder echo of an article he wrote in Izvestia last week warning Washington, ""Russia can only be treated as an equal partner and not as a junior partner."""

A Lot of Pressure **********""It was a very-high-profile transaction,"" Mr. Berry said. ""There was a lot of pressure on Thorn EMI to prove they didn't pay too much. There was a lot of pressure on Virgin to prove we were worth it."" **********There was also considerable pressure on Mr. Berry to make the deal work, and so far the evidence suggests he has. **********He slimmed down Virgin and cut its costs, as EMI required, by consolidating its sales forces, merging its two labels in the United States into the Virgin label and eliminating its music publishing division. At the same time, he oversaw an ambitious and successful release schedule that included ""janet,"" Janet Jackson's first album under her new contract with Virgin. **********So strong have been the album sales of Virgin that it ranked as Britain's No. 1 recording company by that measure last year. And in the United States, where the company is trying to build its presence, its market share, while still modest, more than doubled last year. **********Mr. Berry said he got as much cooperation as he could have hoped for from EMI and its chief executive, James G. Fifield. EMI, the world's third-largest recording company and the largest division of the London-based Thorn EMI conglomerate, told Mr. Berry that it wanted to maintain Virgin as a separate international music label capable of increasing its presence in the United States and other key markets outside Britain. **********Perhaps more important, Mr. Berry said, conservative EMI, which also owns the Capitol, Chrysalis and EMI labels, made no effort to meddle with Virgin's entrepreneurial culture. **********""It was a bold decision to make,"" Mr. Berry said. ""Since then it's been incredibly hands off. Fifield could have panicked, but he let me get on with it, and he let Virgin get on with it."" **********The results have pleased both Virgin and EMI. **********The strong showing from the Janet Jackson album, as well as successful releases from Meat Loaf, UB40 and Lenny Kravitz, among others, brought Virgin a market share of 10.9 percent in Britain last year, its strongest showing so far. **********Because the company did not initially operate in the United States, it licensed its acts to other record distributors in the American market and has only gradually been able to build up its release schedule. Its market share in the United States from March through December 1993 -- the first nine months of its fiscal year -- was 3.1 percent, more than double its share in the comparable period a year earlier. **********Thorn EMI has stopped releasing separate details of Virgin's operating results, but for the six months ended on Sept. 30, Virgin earned an operating profit of $54 million. That compares with an operating profit of $89 million for the fiscal year ended last March 30 and suggests a sharp profit rise. **********Later this year Virgin will release albums from the Rolling Stones, the group's first for the label, Steve Winwood and Simple Minds. **********""Virgin as a distributor is unique in that they work as entrepreneurs, and they're willing to take chances,"" Allen Kovac, Meat Loaf's manager, said. ""They're dedicated to their people and their artists, and they don't look constantly at their quarterly bottom line."" An Unaccustomed Limelight **********With Virgin and many of its rock and pop acts thriving, Mr. Berry has been thrust more into the limelight. It is an unaccustomed spot for the 42-year-old executive, who almost alone among recording industry heavyweights seems to have little interest in -- or flair for -- self-promotion. **********But within the industry he is increasingly winning a reputation as an astute executive. **********""Ken Berry is one of the smartest, most knowledgeable people, especially on a worldwide basis, in this business,"" said Trudy Green, Janet Jackson's manager. **********One of Virgin's biggest successes last year was Meat Loaf's comeback album, ""Bat Out of Hell II."" Virgin distributes the album everywhere except in North America, where the record was released by MCA, and has already sold more than 4.4 million copies in those non-American markets, a phenomenally successful performance for an American artist who had not had a hit in 15 years. **********Mr. Berry said the most important factor in the success of any album was the music itself. But marketing can clearly play a big role in how many copies are sold, and in Meat Loaf's case, Mr. Berry and his team started working on promoting the album nine months before it was released last summer. He backed it with a substantial marketing budget -- Virgin declined to say how much -- and the involvement of top personnel around the world, who got the album radio play and developed promotional programs. **********""They had an uphill battle with Meat Loaf,"" Mr. Kovac, the manager, said. ""They stuck with him and never looked over their shoulder. They have the tenacity to go for big stakes and not worry about losing."" Big Stones Contract **********Indeed, Mr. Berry has raised eyebrows in the industry a number of times for his risk-taking. In 1991 he signed the Rolling Stones to a three-album contract reportedly worth as much as $45 million, a huge amount, some industry executives said at the time, for an aging band. The deal also included rights to 17 Stones albums released between 1971 and 1990. The group's first album for Virgin will be released this summer. **********The same year, Mr. Berry negotiated a three-album deal valued at as much as $50 million to lure Janet Jackson to the label. It was then, and remains, one of the biggest contracts ever in the record business, and was widely viewed as a big gamble by Virgin on an artist who had yet to prove she was worth that kind of money. It was also seen as something of a gamble by Ms. Jackson, who could have gone with other labels that are more established in the United States, her most important market. **********But ""janet,"" the singer's first album under the deal, has been a sufficiently big hit that it has quelled most of the gossip, having sold more than eight million copies. Mr. Berry, for one, said he never had any doubts. **********""She's very serious about her career and willing to work very hard at it,"" Mr. Berry said of Ms. Jackson. ""You don't need a record company to put pressure on Janet Jackson. She does it herself."" **********Mr. Berry's latest gamble is trying to establish Virgin as a big force in the United States. To do so, he has hired a widely respected executive, Phil Quartararo, to run the American business."

But it reserved a formal decision until the end of the week, leaving unclear how Mr. Clinton proposed in the meantime to address the threat to Gorazde, whose 65,000 residents have suffered a brutal bombardment for nearly two weeks. **********Russian officials have been humiliated by the Serbs' refusal to honor promises to halt their attacks, and Mr. Clinton postponed his news conference for nearly two hours in order to make his case to President Boris N. Yeltsin. Mr. Clinton acknowledged that Mr. Yeltsin remained skeptical of air strikes, but he said he expected to see ""the United States and Russia working together."" **********With the details still under discussion, Administration officials say Washington is willing to take part in an international conference on Bosnia, as proposed by Russia and France. But they made clear that the Administration's top priority is to win approval from the North Atlantic Council, NATO's governing body, when it meets again in Brussels, probably on Friday. **********To help overcome wariness from military officials at both NATO and the United Nations, Mr. Clinton today reversed course and said Washington would pay its share of the cost to send 6,500 more troops to the Balkans. **********That would satisfy a request from Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, the United Nations commander in Sarajevo, whose request for 10,000 troops was abruptly scaled back by the Security Council early this month when the Administration said it could subsidize only 3,500 of them. U.S. Troops? 'No,' He Said **********But the President responded with an emphatic ""No!"" when asked whether he had reconsidered his steadfast objection to dispatching United States ground troops. **********Exactly what conditions Mr. Clinton proposes to attach to new ultimatums remain unclear, and Administration officials expressed particular uncertainty about how NATO might compel the Serbs to withdraw; two small NATO attacks last week had little effect. **********But Mr. Clinton pointed to NATO's success in February at compelling the Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons from Sarajevo, and argued that the new policy could succeed. ""It is a much clearer thing,"" the President said of the new plan. **********As outlined, the proposal would allow NATO to launch broad air strikes explicitly to defend the Muslim enclaves, rather than relying on the narrower pretext of protecting United Nations peacekeepers in them. **********Administration officials said today that Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had told Mr. Clinton on Tuesday that a determined effort by the Serbs to overrun a safe area could not be stopped by air power alone, and the President acknowledged that today. **********But the officials said the President and his aides had concluded that the deterrent effect of an ultimatum could force the Serbs to turn from bombardment to the bargaining table. **********Mr. Clinton said he had no illusions that the new approach would guarantee success. But he said, without elaboration, that ""if the Serbs continue their aggression in an irresponsible way, then there are other things that can be done."" The Other Choices **********Among the options presented to Mr. Clinton was to press ahead with efforts to lift the arms embargo that has left the Bosnian Muslims at a perilous disadvantage. That is the course favored by Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, both of whom expressed disappointment that the President had refused to take such a step now. **********While Mr. Clinton held out the prospect that he might push for such a course if Serbian attacks do not end, he expressed fear that unilateral action by the United States, in violation of a Security Council resolution, might encourage other countries to flout sanctions the United Nations has imposed on other nations. **********But the Senate is on record as favoring an end to the embargo, by a vote of 87 to 9, and Senator Dole said tonight that he would introduce legislation on Thursday that would force the Administration to act on its own. **********""It is high time for the Clinton Administration to begin listening to the views of Congress on this issue, which are strong and clear,"" Mr. Dole said.                     --------------------       More Troops Needed **********SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, April 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary of Defense William J. Perry said today that under President Clinton's proposal, ""additional United Nations peacekeeping forces will be needed to go into the safe-haven areas."" **********But Mr. Perry, at a news conference, would not say how many troops would be needed. **********Mr. Perry also described the new plan as broader in scope than the one used in February to end the Serbian shelling of Sarajevo. While the Sarajevo plan called for an attack on weapon emplacements, under the new strategy ""related targets could be attacked, including ammunition dumps and supply areas,"" he said."

Solzhenitsyn returned from 20 years of exile today to a land he described as ""tortured, stunned, altered beyond recognition,"" proclaiming faith that his countrymen would one day ""find a ray of light."" **********His hair thinner and his face more crinkled, but his prophet's beard fuller and his eyes as lively as when he was forcibly bundled out of Russia in 1974 at 55, Mr. Solzhenitsyn joyfully hugged his son Yermolai and friends waiting on the tarmac of the Vladivostok airport. He accepted the traditional welcome of bread and salt from two women in folk costume before being engulfed by reporters and security men. **********With two of his sons, and his wife, Natalya, at his side clutching a large bouquet, Mr. Solzhenitsyn was still smiling and waving 40 minutes later as he arrived in the waning light of the long northern evening in the main square, paradoxically named the Square of the Revolutionary Fighters, which overlooks a tangle of masts in the main port. **********The writer who won the 1970 Nobel Prize and drew the wrath of the Soviet state for his intense and graphic descriptions of Stalinist labor camps in which as many as 60 million Soviet citizens perished had finally come home. **********A crowd of many thousands had gathered for his scheduled arrival at 7 P.M. But delays en route from Anchorage caused Mr. Solzhenitsyn to arrive at 9:30 P.M., by which time a stiff wind and intermittent rain had shrunk the throng to about 2,000. **********Wearing his trademark safari jacket, Mr. Solzhenitsyn mounted a small makeshift platform crowded with local dignitaries, including the Russian Orthodox Bishop of Vladivostok, to read a brief statement ""to my countrymen."" **********""I know that your present life is extremely and unusually harsh, entangled in a myriad of mishaps; and that there is no clear future for you or for your children,"" he declared. **********""These 75 years have been very hard, including these most recent times,"" he went on. ""But our people who have suffered so much deserve to see the light. I bow to you in respect and admiration."" **********""Thank you, Aleksandr Isakievich!"" shouted a man waving a copy of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's epic chronicle of the labor camps, ""The Gulag Archipelago,"" as the writer stepped down. **********""Thank you, but it's Isayevich,"" Mr. Solzhenitsyn answered with a grin, correcting the patronymic. **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn, who spent eight years in Stalin's labor camps in the 1940's and 1950's, is the last major dissident of the 1960's and 1970's to return to Russia. A Special Event **********The comings and goings of other dissidents whose names were once spoken only in whispers have become commonplace in the new Russia. But Mr. Solzhenitsyn's return was a special event -- because of his delay; because of his uncompromising abhorrence of the Communist system and his almost mystical passion for Russia; because of the mystique that developed around his reclusive life in a heavily wooded estate in northern Vermont; because of the impassioned pronouncements he issued from time to time on the fate of Russia and the failings of the West, and because, unlike the other former exiles, he always intended to return to stay. **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn delayed his return to complete what he considers his major life's work, a huge multi-volume history of the Russian Revolution called ""The Red Wheel."" He has said in interviews that he has no further plans for major works, though he may return to writing short stories. **********To many of his admirers, his unchallenged masterpiece remains the short novel ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"" a tale of a day in a labor camp whose publication in the Soviet Union in 1962, during Khrushchev's anti-Stalinist campaign, first announced Mr. Solzhenitsyn as the premier writer of the gulag. **********He soon fell afoul of the Soviet authorities, and none of his major works -- ""The Gulag Archipelago,"" ""The First Circle,"" ""The Cancer Ward"" -- was published here until Communism collapsed. It was the publication of the ""Gulag"" in the West in 1973 that led to Mr. Solzhenitsyn's forced exile in February 1974. A Dramatic Route **********The manner of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's return was appropriately dramatic. Unlike the others, who slipped quietly into Moscow, he chose to return from the east, traveling from Vermont to Anchorage, Alaska, and then by Alaska Airways to Vladivostok via Magadan and Khabarovsk. **********From Vladivostok, the eastern gateway to Russia, Mr. Solzhenitsyn intends to travel slowly across the vast expanse of the country on the Trans-Siberia Railway, 5,778 miles and seven time zones to Moscow. Local aides said he had not yet decided when he will leave or where he will stop. **********He chose the route, he said at a news conference in Anchorage, because until now he has known Siberia ""only from the window of a prison railway car."" He said, too, that he wanted to travel across the land ""to meet and listen to local residents, so as to test or revise my own judgment"" about the state of Russia. **********There was also the more mundane fact that the house in which he hopes to live in a rural patch of Moscow remains unfinished, and it is not yet clear where he will live once he reaches the capital. With Wife and Youngest Son **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn traveled with his wife and his youngest son, Stepan, 20, a student at Harvard. His oldest son, Yermolai, 23, arrived a day earlier from Taiwan, where he is studying Chinese. The other son, Ignat, 21, a concert pianist, remained in the United States with Mrs. Solzhenitsyn's mother, Yekaterina Svetlova, who will join them later. **********Mrs. Solzhenitsyn's son by her first marriage, Dmitri Turin, died of a heart attack last month while she was in Moscow making preparations for the return. All family members except Mr. Solzhenitsyn took United States citizenship. **********Yermolai and Ignat both spoke flawless Russian, as does Stepan. In an hourlong interview on Vladivostok television on the eve of his father's arrival, Yermolai spoke of his father's hopes and his own ""to use the gift of upbringing and education I received in the West to somehow help Russia's fate."" **********During the first refueling stop in Magadan, a northern city that was once the center of the most brutal chain of Stalinist labor camps, Mr. Solzhenitsyn bowed low and touched his hand to the earth in a gesture of remembrance for the untold thousands who perished. Honoring 'Millions of Victims' **********""With reverence I pay my respect to the soil of Kolyma in which we buried many hundreds of thousands, even millions, of prisoners,"" he said. ""In the tumultuous wake of today's political climate, these millions of victims have too casually been forgotten, both by those whom this carnage passed over and, needless to say, by those who perpetrated it. **********""Today we find ourselves in the middle of a flood,"" he said, ""but we would do well to remember that the flood waters sprang from that carnage."" **********That statement echoed a theme on which Mr. Solzhenitsyn is likely to wield the greatest moral authority in his new life in Russia: a growing forgetfulness about the Stalinist terror even as the country becomes increasingly embroiled in economic and political chaos. Another is the belief shared by many nationalist intellectuals that the Russian nation's unique spirituality and character were warped by 75 years of Communism and must be renewed for the country to move on. **********On the square in Vladivostok, a shouting questioner asked Mr. Solzhenitsyn whether he believed in the revival of Russia. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""It will be difficult, it will not come soon, but it will.""  The People's Will Evoked **********He then recalled the ""Time of Troubles"" in the 17th century, when Russia was nearly brought to its heels by political chaos and Polish invaders, and, he said, the Russian people -- ""not the tsar, not the boyars"" -- rose to free the land. **********""What great initiative we had then, what popular will!"" he continued. ""Our people are quite wrongly reproached for lacking initiative. We have it, but we often succumb to apathy; we lose faith in ourselves. In reality our fate is in our hands, starting with every step, with every small choice."" **********""The turn our life will take depends on us, and not on the decisions bestowed on us from somewhere on high, somewhere in Moscow,"" he added. **********""That's true,"" murmured many in the crowd. **********His comments echoed other indications from Mr. Solzhenitsyn that he will be critical of the authorities. He and his local organizers repeatedly insisted that his arrival was a ""private event,"" a point they underscored by lodging the Solzhenitsyn party, with their copious luggage, in a typical Soviet-era Intourist hotel rather than accepting a Government guest house or using one of the new, more luxurious hotels. No Moscow Official on Hand **********No official from Moscow was on hand for the arrival, though a clutch of local dignitaries, led by the Deputy Governor of the Primorsky Region, met Mr. Solzhenitsyn at the airport. But for all the drama of his return, not many seemed to expect Mr. Solzhenitsyn to become a major political force. **********The writer himself reiterated in Anchorage that he would not accept or run for any government position. In recent weeks, the Russian press has carried a lively and not always flattering debate on the importance of his return and on the beliefs espoused by the writer, and the television news tonight treated his arrival in Vladivostok respectfully but not particularly prominently. **********Out in the Square of Revolutionary Fighters, reactions ranged from the antagonism of a handful of die-hard Communists to curiosity and sympathy. Among the handful of placards, most focused on local political problems, which include a vicious political struggle between a recently ousted mayor and his foes. **********In the clutch of Communists gathered under a red flag was a 54-year-old woman who would give only her first name, Galina. ""I don't consider him an honorable man,"" she snorted. ""He hid in the labor camps so as not to fight. I read that in the paper."" Mr. Solzhenitsyn in fact fought as a Soviet Army officer in World War II. Many Liberals Have Soured **********Many liberal intellectuals, while acknowledging the historic power of his works, have soured on Mr. Solzhenitsyn because of his nationalist stance and did not consider his return to be of major importance. **********""His arrival now is exaggerated as an event,"" the liberal former Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil K. Popov, said in an interview. ""He has come back a little too late."" **********Right-wing nationalists, for their part, resent the support Mr. Solzhenitsyn expressed for President Boris N. Yeltsin during the shelling of the Parliament building last October. Conspicuously absent among the greeters in Vladivostok was Stanislav Govarukhin, a nationalist film maker who made a documentary on Mr. Solzhenitsyn in Vermont last year, and whose cameraman, Yuri Prokofiev, was the official organizer of the writer's arrival. **********Many ordinary Russians who might have clandestinely read ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich"" and ""The Gulag Archipelago"" 20 years ago and admired their author have moved past the point at which the return of the old rebel is much more than a happy event or a glimmer of hope. Doubts About Influence **********""I don't think that anything can change and that Solzhenitsyn can have an impact on the situation in Russia,"" said Andrei I. Altochan, a student at the Vladivostok University. ""I read 'Gulag,' and I think he's a genius, but I doubt he can change anything in political life."" **********But there were those who remembered the impact of ""Gulag"" and believe that its author could still be a healing force. One was Aleksandr A. Alyokhin, 30, a member of the merchant marine, who said: ""If such people as Solzhenitsyn return to Russia, there is hope for its renewal, the renewal of its spiritual life. I think if Solzhenitsyn returns, the Gulag will not return."" **********Ivan N. Sashko, a 47-year-old worker on the Trans-Siberian Railroad, said: ""I am personally glad that he came back to his fatherland. That means he can and will help Russia. We have no leader. Of course he can't become a political leader, but maybe in a moral sense, in a pastoral sense, he can."" **********""I read 'Gulag' when I was a soldier in the army and a convinced member of the Communist Party,"" Mr. Sashko added, ""and I found nothing wrong, only truth."""

The two transactions were reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal and USA Today, following trade reports. **********By adding Thomas Cook's American operations to its own, American Express would sharply increase its share of the United States market. And the purchase of Cook's international corporate business would be the latest in a series of foreign acquisitions American Express has made in the last two years.  Giant to Be Created **********According to Travel Weekly, an industry publication, combining United States operations of American Express, the largest travel agency in the country, with Thomas Cook, which is third, would create a travel industry giant with gross sales of more than $10 billion, more than three times as large as the Carlson Travel Network, the nation's second-largest travel agency. **********American Express shares were unchanged at $30.25 yesterday, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********No one would officially acknowledge yesterday that a deal had been completed. Nancy Muller, an American Express spokeswoman, said, ""These rumors have been out for a very long time in the trade press, and it is American Express's policy not to comment on rumors."" She also declined to comment when asked if American Express planned to hold a news conference Monday to announce the transaction. **********A telephone call to Mr. Paresky at Thomas Cook's offices in Boston was not returned. **********Thomas Cook Ltd. was acquired by Westdeutsche Landesbank of Germany in 1992. Mr. and Mrs. Paresky acquired the lease on Thomas Cook's 385 American travel offices in 1992 from the estate of Robert Maxwell. **********Mr. Paresky's licensing agreement expires in 1999. Although the sale of the United States business to American Express was subject to approval by the Thomas Cook Group Ltd., the Peresky operation was essentially independent from the parent. **********American Express will not acquire Thomas Cook's traveler's check business. **********An addition of Thomas Cook's corporate business would come after purchases by American Express of two Australian agencies in the spring and last year's acquisition of Nyman & Schultz of Sweden, one of Europe's largest travel agencies.  Market Share at Issue **********In the face of declining air fares, which have hurt commissions, American Express has little choice but to seek a greater share of the market, analysts said. **********""This is a market share issue,"" said Samuel Liss, an analyst with CS First Boston. **********""As the airline rate structure continues to decrease, and this year it is estimated to be down by anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent from 1993 levels, it is critical for them to offset that with additional market share,"" he said."

He runs Jimmy's Face to Face Tours, a business that takes visitors and locals -- the curious, the righteous and those too afraid to go in alone -- into the country's most famous township. **********His customers learn that Soweto is not a Zulu word or Sotho word with ancient spiritual meaning, but a government acronym that stands for Southwestern Township. It has 3 million to 4 million people speaking nine different languages and is more than what you see on television, he says. **********He drives past Vista University, the township's community college, past the signs for Perseverance Dressmaking School and Papi's Soweto Dairy, to show his customers one of the places where the middle class people live. **********""People take pride in their houses,"" Mr. Ntintili says on a street of pastel bungalows. ""They may be crowded and small on the inside. But on the outside they look nice. You don't need to be rich to be clean."" **********Nearly every yard has big boulders by the curb that make the place look like Bedrock, where Fred Flintstone lived. They are there for a reason, Mr. Ntintili said ""During apartheid, drivers chased by cops would try to take a corner and go into your yard and hit your house,"" Mr. Ntintili said. ""This was the best way to protect yourself."" **********He drives past people running a dry cleaner out of an old trailer and a barber meticulously cutting a man's hair under a shade tree by the dirt road. Everywhere, there are rows of vendors selling oranges and apples and bananas. **********""You can see the spirit of entrepreneurship,"" Mr. Ntintili said. ""But the people do not want to take a chance. If you put an orange here to sell, they will put an orange here to sell. Because they think you are making money."" **********The minivan stopped by one of the township pharmacies. It was the shack of a medicine man waiting for customers, his merchandise of powders and oils set out in old whiskey bottles lined neatly on a mat. **********""The python snake oil is for problems of the ear,"" Mr. Ntintili said matter of factly. ""The bark is made into powder for stomach and kidney ailments. The incense is to drive the evil spirits out. He has something for potency, too."" **********""Let me have a kilo of that,"" one Danish businessman said, joking. **********The highlight of the tour is the drive along celebrity row in Soweto's Beverly Hills, called that not because it looks like the one in California but because it is hilly and the houses are bigger than the two-room houses the government first built. **********Rounding the corner by a wall bearing the chalk-scrawled words, ""Kill the Boer, Kill the Farmer,"" the minivan came upon the walled brick compound of Winnie Mandela, who is often away in Cape Town serving as Deputy Minister of Culture. Up the hill and around the bend is Nelson Mandela's old house from the days of the struggle, a tiny brick house and ringed with fence posts in black, green and yellow, the colors of the African National Congress. **********Across from the old Mandela house is Archbishop Desmond Tutu's white adobe-style mansion with its high wall and electric wires. **********""Why does Bishop Tutu have an electric fence around his house?"" a tourist once asked Mr. Ntintili. **********""We would rather have a live bishop than a dead bishop,"" came the reply. **********The minivan was stuck behind a funeral procession -- this being Saturday, the day of funerals and weddings -- when the group reached the part of Soweto most familiar to Western eyes. It was a squatter camp with creaky tin shacks, barefoot children playing near burning heaps of trash, and the occasional homemade flag flapping from the rooftops of the fortune tellers. **********""This is what you see on T.V. when they show you Soweto,"" Mr. Ntintili said. ""Everybody you see is minding his own business, doing his own thing, making sure he gets his next meal."" **********There have been times when violence has broken out in the middle of a tour, but Mr. Ntintili said he had never lost a customer and knew the place too well to take people into dangerous situations. **********Besides, a little rock-throwing or protest makes for a better tour, he said. ""They have a chance to get good pictures,"" he said. ""They can go home and say, 'We saw it live.' """

The German blitzkrieg, Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Midway all demonstrated that air power, a side show in World War I, was crucial to victory in World War II. **********Aviation captured the imagination of American generals, inventors, industrialists and the public alike in those dark war years, in a way few industries have, before or since. Aircraft went from being expensive toys to weapons of liberty overnight. Schoolchildren avidly studied recognition silhouettes and knew the names and strengths of dozens of planes. Pioneers of flight like Glenn Curtiss, Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin found themselves at the helm of burgeoning empires. And almost anyone who knew something about planes -- mechanic, stunt pilot, engineer, factory foreman -- could start a company and hope for a Government contract. **********By D-Day, 50 years ago tomorrow, American factories were turning out about 250 warplanes a day, compared with 10 a day in 1938, the year before the war began in Europe. By war's end, the United States had built 300,000 aircraft, and the aviation industry was the biggest in the country by dollar volume of output. **********This prodigious production was instrumental in sweeping the Axis air forces from the battlefield by the summer of 1944. Indeed, only with such air superiority could Allied commanders allow the biggest invasion fleet ever assembled to set forth toward Normandy. **********But while plane manufacturers helped win the war -- and a big place in the wartime economy -- many found the peace that followed to be a dangerous time. **********Aviation had already proved itself an industry of booms and slumps. After World War I, the War Department canceled aircraft contracts so abruptly that the industry shrank by 90 percent in less than a year, and many producers were forced into mergers or receivership. Civil aviation was just catching on when the stock market collapsed in 1929, causing more consolidation. **********When it was clear the tide in World War II had turned, twice-burned aviation veterans started planning for peace, and persuaded the Federal Government to cut back a little more gradually this time around. Some companies went under anyway, some made fortunes or lost them pursuing civilian markets, some followed advancing technology into helicopters, missiles and space hardware, and some made a living out of the smaller but still substantial military market. But few made it as far as 1970, let alone 1994, without changes in name, ownership, management or focus -- or all four. **********The end of the cold war triggered yet another round of consolidation, which culminated in Northrop's purchase of Grumman this spring. Widespread layoffs in the industry even claimed the jobs at Douglas Aircraft of a son and grandson of Donald Douglas, founder of the company, by then a division of McDonnell Douglas. Today, almost all the famous, romantic names from the skies of D-Day are drastically altered or gone. **********The industry has changed in many other ways as well. Military airframe construction -- putting a plane together from components made in-house or by others -- is now a low-volume business with a handful of very expensive planes built each year, and the companies that remain often work together. Two survivors -- Boeing and McDonnell Douglas -- still have significant civil aircraft programs, though McDonnell is hard pressed to make any money at it. Two others -- the combinations of Northrop, Grumman and Vought and of Lockheed and Convair -- do business almost exclusively with The Customer, as those in the industry often refer to the various arms of the Federal Government, and with friendly governments overseas. **********The chart below traces in simplified form the fates of the major prime contractors for military aircraft from World War II to today, highlighting important mergers and some famous planes along the way. **********For simplicity, the chart draws a distinction between airplanes and helicopters and concentrates on planes, because helicopters played a negligible role in World War II. From a business point of view the distinction is less meaningful now. And the chart for the most part ignores the growing role and interconnectedness of subcontractors. But it gives a broad picture of the drastic depopulation of military aviation, in waves, since D-Day."

Its main opposition, the anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces, had 25.6 percent. Of 49 parties vying for the 240 seats in Parliament, four other small parties appeared likely to win representation. **********""This is a victory for the country,"" Mr. Videnov said tonight. ""We can solve the problems."" He has described the party's approach as the way forward, rather than a return to the past. **********In many ways, Mr. Videnov, who has marshaled his power in the last two years, is a direct political descendant of Todor Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria as a Communist leader for 33 years until 1989. **********Mr. Videnov, who had a reputation as a young hard-line apparatchik, became leader of the Socialist Party after Mr. Zhivkov's lieutenant, Aleksandur Lilov, was pushed out in 1992. **********The Socialist Party, the main supporter of the ""non-party"" government of technocrats that was in power from December 1992 to September this year, is less inclined toward a market economy than the ex-Communists who have won elections in Hungary and Poland. Popular support for radical changes to the economy is far weaker in Bulgaria than in Hungary or Poland. **********The core of the Socialist Party support comes from the three million retirees who make up a disproportionately large share of Bulgaria's 8.7 million population. The party, which was well disciplined for election day, also appealed to young people, many of whom are unemployed. **********Opinion surveys have shown widespread disgruntlement with the economy, which is one of the least privatized in Eastern Europe. But the surveys show that more than 70 percent of the people blamed the anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces for the problems, rather than the former Communists who have wielded more power in Parliament. **********Western economists here say the former Communists will begin to prop up the ailing heavy industries that for the last five years have had rapidly declining output but have not laid off workers or begun restructuring. The party is also unlikely to give peasants their own land. **********The party favors closer ties to Russia, a country for whom there is some reverence here rather than the fear that is prevalent elsewhere in Eastern Europe. There will be efforts to recapture at least some of the huge past trade with Russia; more than 70 percent of Bulgaria's exports went to Russia before 1989."

Wells, the special envoy appointed on May 20, plans to urge the Sudanese Government to allow an increased flow of aid to sustain the 2 million people in Sudan's rebellious south and 1.3 million in the Government-controlled north who rely on food aid. **********American officials admit that their diplomatic efforts are unlikely to end the decades-old conflict between the Islamic Government based in the capital, Khartoum, and the Christian and animist rebels in the south. Nonetheless, these officials say it is important to press ahead with diplomatic efforts because of the magnitude of the crisis there. **********""This is just about the most complicated task there is,"" a State Department official said. ""It's more difficult than Somalia."" **********Malnutrition has reached emergency levels because of a serious drought and because of the Government's spring offensive, which has impeded the flow of relief and forced huge numbers of people in the southern Sudan to abandon their farms. **********According to the Agency for International Development, 400,000 of the Sudan's 28 million people have become refugees in neighboring nations as a result of the 11-year-old war, while another 700,000 have been displaced internally. Some officials fear that 280,000 people will starve in the Sudan -- more than the number who died of malnutrition in Somalia. **********In addition to visiting Khartoum and the rebel-held South, Ms. Wells plans to go to the four countries that are seeking to broker a peace plan in the Sudan: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Kenya. Those four countries sponsored unsuccessful talks two weeks ago, and no new talks are scheduled until late July. **********The main success of those four countries has been in persuading the Sudanese Government and the rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, to set up corridors to help relief efforts get through. **********About the only ray of hope seen by American officials is that the Government may feel pressed to end the war because Government troops have suffered so many casualties and the war has wreaked havoc on the north's economy. **********Washington's complaint with the Sudan goes far beyond the Government's spring offensive, which has included bombing of camps with displaced people. The United States is also angry about the Sudanese Government's support of terrorist groups. **********Having put the Sudan on its terrorism list, the United States treats Khartoum as a junior member of the rogue states that include Iraq and Iran. American officials say the Sudan has received many of its weapons from China while Iran has financed much of those purchases. **********According to Administration officials, Ms. Wells's message to the Sudanese Government will be to stop sheltering terrorist organizations nad to stop human rights abuses. **********Ms. Wells, a former Ambassador to Zaire, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, is refusing to comment on the Sudan situation until after her trip."

The ones they wanted to raise went up only grudgingly. But others zoomed skyward. **********Call it the case of the misbehaving yield curve. Short-term rates have moved less than the Fed seemed to have wanted, while long-term rates rose more. Moreover, rates on corporate and municipal bonds have risen more than those on Treasuries. **********None of this is what was forecast, either by the Fed or by most private economists. The logic was that with inflation obviously not a big threat, a Fed tightening would reassure investors and bond rates would not go up nearly as much as short rates. **********In fact, the rise in short rates has been almost grudging. The Fed has pushed up the Fed funds rates -- the rate banks charge on loans to each other -- by three-quarters of a percentage point. But three-month Treasury bill rates have climbed only about three-fifths of a point, and the increase in the rates that banks pay to savers has been much less than that, in some cases well under half a percentage point. Meanwhile, rates on longer bonds are up one percentage point, and in some cases more. **********Both the bond and stock markets have taken big hits since the Fed acted. But last week both markets took the latest Fed tightening with more aplomb than they had the previous two. That may reflect the lack of alternative investments. Mutual funds are seeing less cash flow out because the banks, confronted with uninspiring loan demand, see no reason to bid up for funds. Instead, they hope to push up their profit margins a bit -- a fact that may yet help to give new life to bank stocks. **********On the other side, the rise in long-term interest rates reflects a number of market realities. When rates started to rise, a lot of managers with leveraged bets on lower rates had to sell, and sell fast. A few years ago, accounting rules let banks hide losses on bonds, not to mention mortgage loans, when rates turned up, as long as the bonds were not sold. Now, as the economist Henry Kaufman points out, such losses are generally reported in any case, so there is less incentive to hold on when the bond market turns down. **********Mr. Kaufman argues that the way rates are behaving is unlikely to have much impact on the economy, and he is probably right. A new recession would be much more likely if short rates were in danger of getting above long-term rates, and the fact nothing like that is happening is very good news. **********That hasn't stopped some on Wall Street from starting to worry that the Fed is going to keep tightening until it strangles economic growth. Evidently, they believe that while low interest rates took a long time to help the economy, higher ones can quickly kill it. **********Such fears will eventually be proved wrong. When that happens, don't be surprised if the stock market mounts a big rally as investors conclude that higher interest rates are no problem. By the time that rally ends, alas, rates may be something to fear. But not now."

Eisner, and its late president, Frank G. Wells, long before Mr. Wells's death in a helicopter accident this month. **********Faced with a weak economy, declining profit growth, flops at the box office and troubles at its theme parks, notably the Euro Disneyland debacle in France, Disney needed a tuneup if it was to continue to sparkle. **********""We were reinventing ourselves before Frank's death, but this tragedy has forced us to speed up the process,"" Mr. Eisner said in a recent interview at Disney's headquarters in Burbank. ""I think you have to reinvent yourself almost every seven years or so, as businesses mature and situations change."" Foreign Markets a Focus **********Like other film studios and entertainment companies, Disney will focus on cultivating foreign markets, which represent the highest potential for growth, Mr. Eisner said. Reinventing Disney will also include exploring new technologies and expanding the responsibilities of the company's senior executives, many of whom will assume duties held by Mr. Wells, he continued. **********Under Mr. Eisner and Mr. Wells, who were hired in 1984 to revive a languishing Disney, the company saw its annual revenue rise from $1.5 billion to $8.5 billion in a decade and its stock value increase 1,500 percent. **********The growth was fueled by the rapid expansion of theme parks, resorts, retail stores and film and television production, but such remarkable gains are now proving harder to sustain than ever before, even with the magic of ""Aladdin's"" genie. **********With Disney's revenues approaching $10 billion a year, and competition growing in the theme park and animation businesses, it will be far more difficult for the company to achieve the 20 percent annual earnings growth that management has projected over the next five years, industry analysts say. **********""Walt Disney's success is based on a very simplistic approach: the filmed entertainment division comes up with new characters that are then used by the rest of the company to create a broader line of products,"" Christopher P. Dixon, an analyst for Paine Webber, said. **********""But the big challenge of the 90's will be to take their brands and expand them into markets overseas and different venues,"" Mr. Dixon said. **********That will involve the international expansion of the company's three major divisions: theme parks, filmed entertainment and consumer products. ""During the first 10 years of this job we focused predominately on growing the domestic businesses,"" Mr. Eisner said. ""Now we have to start over again in places like China and India and develop new products for these markets."" **********As an indication of how important international expansion is to Disney's future, Mr. Eisner said that ""non-American born"" executives would play a much more important role in the management of the company. ""I think you will see names in our top management that are hard to pronounce as time goes on,"" he said. **********Disney has already made significant headway in expanding its consumer products, publications, movies, videos and television programs in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America. Today, Disney has 16 offices serving 45 countries. **********But Mr. Eisner's new international concentration comes after a disaster in Disney's most visible foray into Europe. From its inception, Euro Disney has lost money, hurt by Europe's recession and the company's misjudgments of European tastes. **********Disney, which owns 49 percent of Euro Disney, banned alcohol at the park, offered visitors European food and fancy table settings, and expected them to patronize the hotels and gift shops. But many Europeans shunned the park or spent as little as possible there. As a result, Euro Disney lost nearly $1 billion in its first year and Disney's profit fell 63 percent. **********Now Disney is allowing wine and beer to be sold, and the company has cut back the number of traditional restaurants while adding American-style fast-food operations. In addition, the company is offering some room discounts to attract visitors to the hotels. **********""We know that Americans don't want us to open a French restaurant in New York or Los Angeles that serves a double patty cheeseburger, and that the French don't want us to come over there and do crepe, and the Germans don't want us to serve Knackwurst and Sauerkraut,"" Mr. Eisner said. ""They want us to do what we do."" **********After Mr. Eisner threatened last year to close Euro Disney, creditors granted him a debt restructuring that will buy the project time to turn around. **********""Maybe I am just stubbornly optimistic or arrogantly insensitive on the creative side,"" Mr. Eisner said, ""but I think the park is the most fantastic product ever done by this company. A hundred years from now people will wonder how did this ever get built."" Additional Losses Seen **********Still, Euro Disney executives have said that they expect the park to post a loss this fiscal year, and that it will not show any significant revenue growth before 1996. **********The theme park business is highly dependent on the health of world economies and consumer confidence. And with a weak economies in Europe and California, operating profit at Disney's theme parks in the first three months of this year fell 3 percent to $152.3 million, mainly because of a decline in overseas visitors to Walt Disney World in Florida and a drop in attendance at Disneyland after the California earthquake. **********Judson C. Green, president Walt Disney Attractions, said that despite the recent declines, he expected overall park attendance and revenues to rise, ignited by the planned opening of new gates, rides and attractions. Still, Mr. Green said, Disney is cutting operating costs at the parks and aggressively pricing its hotels. **********While no decision has yet been made, Mr. Green said that Disney was seriously considering building a theme park in the Far East, perhaps somewhere in the Pacific Rim. The company has also looked at building parks in Australia, South America and elsewhere in Europe, but ""the politics and economics have to be right before we make a major move,"" Mr. Green said. Consumer Produces Expanding **********Already, Disney's consumer products division, which oversees licensing, retailing, publishing and records, is expanding broadly throughout Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia. Last year the division had operating income of $356 million, up 26 percent over the previous year. **********A major contributor to the success of the consumer products division was the Disney stores, which sell everything from Mickey Mouse watches and Dopey cookie jars to Disney shirts, hats and jewelry. **********Barton K. Boyd, president of Disney Consumer Products, said that there are 268 Disney stores, and the company plans to open at least 70 new stores a year. This year alone, Disney plans to open 100 stores in France, England, Germany, Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and the United States. The Disney Store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris is the company's top grossing store. **********""We are moving slowly and patiently to China,"" Mr. Boyd siad. ""The grandparents remember the Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, and it won't take long before for their grandchildren to come to know them, too."" Gains From Film Division **********Despite numerous box-office flops in the past year, Disney's filmed entertainment division continues to post strong gains, buoyed by the popularity of Disney's animated features and robust home video sales, both domestically and overseas. **********Disney Studios produces movies under three labels: Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures. Walt Disney Pictures produces animated features like ""The Little Mermaid"" and family-oriented features. Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures produce more mature films like ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Sister Act."" **********Disney is expanding is presence in the international film and television market. Its animated films are a huge success overseas and have been translated into 25 languages. Disney's total box office last year was $644 million. **********The company is also pursuing local programming partnerships. It has 35 Disney Clubs and other Disney programs that are broadcast internationally. **********Disney's filmed entertainment division is still highly profitable, even though the studios have produced numerous movies of late that have been financial and critical disasters, leading to the removal this week of Ricardo Mestres as president of Hollywood Pictures. Hollywood had some box-office successes, like ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" and ""The Joy Luck Club,"" but the label had many more bombs, including ""Blame It on the Bellboy,"" ""Born Yesterday"" and ""Guilty as Sin."""

Fyodorov and former Economics Minister Yegor T. Gaidar -- the task of the Russian team was particularly arduous. **********But Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, widely regarded as lukewarm about market reforms and an antagonist of Mr. Fyodorov, rose to the occasion. **********""Russia will not turn back,"" Mr. Chernomyrdin, the former boss of the Soviet natural gas industry, told the conference, attended by about 2,000 Western executives and politicians.  'No Backpedaling' **********""There will be no backpedaling,"" he said. ""I know what socialism is all about. There will be no going back to it."" **********Just a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Chernomyrdin declared, ""The period of market romanticism is over."" **********Even if there is no return to socialism in Russia, there seems to be every prospect of a return to galloping inflation. Mr. Chernomyrdin could scarcely contain his agitation when it was suggested that the chairman of Russia's Central Bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, is widely known as the worst central banker in the world. **********Mr. Gerashchenko likes to pump increasingly worthless rubles into shoring up loss-making state industries and farms, a policy that fuels inflation. But the Prime Minister insisted that the central banker was eminently qualified, as well as eminently likable. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin conceded that inflation would rise to 20 percent by June, from the current 12 percent a month, but he expressed hope that it might dip to between 15 and 18 percent a month by the end of the year. He did not explain how this would be achieved. **********Mr. Fyodorov, who quit after President Yeltsin turned to a conservative Cabinet to halt the advance of nationalists, disagreed. **********""We are likely to have a short-term disaster and we could lose a lot of time,"" he told the conference. ""The question is how long, how soon will President Yeltsin have the courage to change."" Nearing Hyperinflation? **********Mr. Fyodorov suggested that inflation, increased by a flood of central bank subsidies to state industry, would rise to 35 percent a month by the summer. Such a rate would be close to hyperinflation, which is widely considered to begin when inflation reaches 50 percent a month. **********This prediction was clearly irritating to Mr. Chernomyrdin, who made no secret that Russia needs the second installment of a $1.5 billion International Monetary Fund adjustment loan as soon as possible. **********But Lawrence H. Summers, the United States Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said international support for Russia would not be forthcoming unless reforms and ""the mechanisms to preserve a stable currency"" were in place. **********The Russians, while conciliatory to Western business executives, did not hide a new national defiance aimed at demonstrating back home that the country is no pawn of the West. **********The hard line was best represented by Arkady I. Volsky, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who defended the investment of large sums into state industries and farms to preserve jobs. He said: ""Money does not make money. Goods make money."" **********Mr. Volsky has clearly not worked with George Soros, the New York money manager. But then Russia, for all its protestations here, is toying with an economic course that defies the prescriptions of Western capitalism."

Moreover, the QVC alliance saddled BellSouth with a worthless option to buy large amounts of QVC stock at what is now twice the market price. **********BellSouth's telephone regulators in the company's principal states of Georgia and Florida continue to be among the toughest in the country. In January, for example, the Florida Public Service Commission ordered a $300 million rate reduction phased in over three years. **********Meanwhile, competition in BellSouth's main business of providing local phone service seems imminent. Already Florida has the largest number of telecommunications competitors for specialized business services of any state. Fourteen so-called competitive access providers have announced plans to compete in Florida and seven are in operation. And a challenge by a big regional Bell, like one recently proposed by Southwestern Bell in Bell Atlantic's territory, could hit BellSouth. **********Assessing BellSouth's competitiveness, Jack Grubman of Salomon Brothers recently rated the company as the second-worst regional Bell, trailing only Nynex. He cited high costs, high prices and the likelihood of intense competition in local phone service, which made up 85 percent of BellSouth's 1993 revenue of $15.9 billion. **********Still, Mr. Grubman's views are a distinctly minority opinion and a growing number of analysts see BellSouth as probably the most misunderstood of the regional Bells. **********""Nineteen ninety-four is going to be a bang-up year for BellSouth and so is next year,"" said Guy W. Woodlief, a telecommunications analyst with Dean Witter. **********The Institutional Brokers Estimate Service recently surveyed analysts and came up with a mean estimate for BellSouth's full-year 1994 earnings of $4.05 a share, compared with $2.08 a share, after a special charge. Analysts' consensus estimate for 1995 is even better at $4.42 a share. **********Michael Elling of Oppenheimer calls the company ""one of the most rewarding stories this year."" He cites, among other things, the fastest 1994 growth rate of any regional Bell or GTE for adding telephone lines. BellSouth's growth rate is 3.9 percent, compared with a low of 2.3 percent for Pacific Telesis and the second-highest growth rate of 3.6 percent for Ameritech. **********Mr. Elling says BellSouth stock will be worth up to $70 a share by the end of the year. Yesterday, it closed at $59.50, up 50 cents. **********Moreover, Mr. Woodlief of Dean Witter said, domestic cellular telephone operations were adding record numbers of customers, and he saw even more growth in international cellular operations. **********The exception to the positive assessment is Mr. Grubman of Salomon Brothers. While other analysts focus on immediate earnings, Mr. Grubman says investors should ignore the next two years because later is when the trouble will begin. ""BellSouth is going to have a few easy quarters,"" he said, ""but who cares?"" **********BellSouth took a $1.1 billion restructuring charge last year and plans to reduce the number of employees per 10,000 telephone lines from 42 workers this year to 33 by 1996. **********But Mr. Grubman worries that cost-cutting, while necessary, will do little to improve BellSouth's long-term performance because every dollar saved in costs does not translate into profits. As competition increases, BellSouth will have to cut its prices and its costs simultaneously, hurting profits and cash flow. **********He reasons that since BellSouth charges some of the highest prices in the country for its service, it will be one of the most attractive targets for competitors bent on offering lower prices. BellSouth has revenue per telephone line of $59.50, the second highest after Nynex's $60.67. **********If investors are not quite as polarized as analysts, they are cautious. After trading as high as $62 a share following the first-quarter earnings report on April 21, BellSouth's shares have fallen back to a trading range. Both thes 50-day moving price average and 200-day average have not budged from the high 50's."

Fisk fish restaurant here is a bustling place where herring is served with brisk Scandinavian efficiency. Its clientele is affluent, its waiters good-humored. So when the uncontrollable sobbing of Ermin Sestovic begins, his anguish is doubly shocking. **********Mr. Sestovic is a Bosnian Muslim, a refugee in Sweden. At a recent lunch, he was recalling his father, Ruzdija Sestovic, who has disappeared. This disappearance, after arrest by Serbian nationalists more than two years ago, has spawned a terrible grief, more intractable than bereavement, because it is tinged with a tenuous hope. **********""I hope my father is alive,"" Mr. Sestovic, 24, said. ""Some days, it seems good that I don't know anything. But then I realize I have to know. Because there is a block inside me. I cannot concentrate. When I am happy, I feel I do not have the right to be. I want to know."" **********The story of the Sestovic family is one of ordinary people caught up in a madness beyond their control, of refugees cast upon an unreceptive European Continent, and of pain so devouring it seems certain to spawn further Balkan conflict if it remains unassuaged. **********Long overshadowed by the war itself, the question of the missing is now coming to the forefront of negotiations between the Bosnian Government and the Serbs. In recent talks on a four-month cease-fire, the issue blocked a draft agreement on an exchange of prisoners. The Muslim-led Government wants information on the missing that the Serbs refuse to yield. **********Sobs continue to grip Mr. Sestovic. He buries his head in his hands. Waiters pass. Cutlery tinkles. Plump herrings are dissected. Businessmen discuss Swedish exports. The gulf separating the Bosnian war from the rest of Europe -- and at the same time their inextricable proximity -- are palpable. **********Three hundred and fifty miles from here, on the bleak eastern outskirts of Berlin, Mr. Sestovic's mother, Muska, sits in a hostel for people displaced by the Bosnian war. So far, the total is 2.7 million. She cries a lot. Her one solace is that she has been dreaming often of her missing husband: a sign, she believes, that he is alive. ""I cannot believe Ruzdija is dead,"" she said. **********The disappearance of Ruzdija Sestovic is not unusual. On a computer list in Sarajevo, the Bosnian Government now has the names of more than 16,000 Muslims, including that of Mr. Sestovic, who have vanished after arrest by the Serbs since the Bosnian war began in April 1992. **********This figure is higher than most estimates of the number of ""desparecidos,"" or disappeared, in Argentina between 1976 and 1983. The comparison is not inappropriate. Borrowing techniques used in the ""dirty war"" waged by Argentina's military junta, Serbs arrested most of the missing Muslims in their homes while pursuing a goal of ethnically pure Serbian territory in Bosnia. **********Often, as in Argentina, the Serbs would explain to desperate relatives that the Muslim civilians were being taken away on a routine matter for ""a couple of hours."" This is what Mrs. Sestovic was told when her husband was dragged from their home in the eastern Bosnian town of Vlasenica by three masked Serbian soldiers just before midnight on June 20, 1992. He never returned. **********As yet, however, nobody is ready to take responsibility for what has happened. **********""Past experience suggests that it can take up to 10 years for disappeared individuals to appear,"" Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, said in an interview. ""We also have missing -- 7,000 Serbs from Sarajevo alone. I do not know this individual, Sestovic. But many of the missing Muslims have left. Some are even in Pakistan."" **********Dr. Karadzic continued: ""Ethnic cleansing was not our policy. It happened because of fear. Fear and chaos. I was not informed on a daily basis of what was happening in the first months of the war, although we got some information from our troops and police. But the fate of men like Sestovic was beyond our control."" **********What happened to Mr. Sestovic suggests otherwise, however. It is a story of systematic oppression and arrest by identifiable Bosnian Serb authorities who had decided to get rid of all Muslims, if necessary through their disappearance. Muslim and Serb  Politics Overrides Personal Affection **********Ruzdija Sestovic, age 52 if he is alive today, moved from his native Montenegro to the eastern Bosnian town of Milici in 1966. A bauxite mine, Boksit Milici, was just beginning operation, and Mr. Sestovic was employed to operate earth-moving equipment. **********Milici, about 13 miles east of Vlasenica, is today a medium-sized town that does not hide its debt to bauxite, the principal ore in aluminum. **********The supermarket is called Boksit. The bus station is called Boksit Trans. There is a Boksit sports center. The dowdy high-rise blocks scattered around town house Boksit workers. But back in the mid-1960's, when Mr. Sestovic arrived, it was a village. The mine had no more than 70 employees. **********Among them was a Serb named Rajko Dukic, who was destined to play a central role in the life of Ruzdija Sestovic. Their parallel and then sharply divergent lives reflect a central trend the Bosnian war: the conversion of friends and neighbors into foes. **********A mining engineer born in Milici, Mr. Dukic joined the mine in 1967. Twenty-three years later, he was to be a founding member of Dr. Karadzic's nationalist Serbian Democratic Party. Indeed, he was the first president of the party's executive committee, and the man who ordered the erection of the first barricades in Sarajevo in March 1992, after the shooting of Serbs at a wedding there. **********But politics is one thing, personal affection another. Mr. Sestovic, a Muslim, was Mr. Dukic's friend and longtime colleague. This memory now seems to haunt this highly successful Bosnian Serb businessman. **********""I feel very sorry for Mrs. Sestovic, and I think often of the people who disappeared in this unfortunate time,"" Mr. Dukic said, sitting in the Belgrade office of an import-export company called Boksit Trade that grew out of the mine. ""Mr. Sestovic was a very good worker and a very good man, respected by everyone. When I met him, nobody wondered who anyone was. If you were a good man, your religion or nationality was irrelevant."" **********Mr. Dukic shook his head. He now divides his time between Milici and Belgrade. With the mine immobilized by the war, Boksit Trade has taken to selling Ray-Bans, Reeboks, Sony Walkmans, Sony Trinitron televisions, Johnny Walker whisky and other accoutrements of the Belgrade nouveaux riches who have prospered in the war. **********For more than two decades, Mr. Dukic and Mr. Sestovic worked together closely at the mine. The business diversified into timber, hotels, poultry and restaurants; the number of employees rose to 3,000, and sales reached $100 million a year. Ruzdija Sestovic took charge of the maintenance of mining equipment, married a local Muslim woman and had children. **********""We lived very well,"" said Ermin Sestovic. ""Although Milici was always mainly Serb, we had no problems. In fact, most of our friends were Serbs."" Dividing Lines  New Parties And New Fears **********By 1990, however, such friendships were beginning to be suspect. Yugoslavia was already gripped by the nationalist politics that would lead to its dismemberment. In Bosnia, the most ethnically mixed of the Yugoslav republics, political divisions were being drawn along ethnic lines with the formation of nationalist parties. **********The first to be founded, in May 1990, was the Muslim nationalist Party of Democratic Action, of Alija Izetbegovic, now President of Bosnia. Mr. Dukic remembers going to the inaugural party meeting in Vlasenica in June 1990. **********""It was very frightening,"" Mr. Dukic said. ""Izetbegovic was there, but Muslim religious leaders did most of the talking. The message was that the Drina River from Zvornik to Foca had to be dominated by Muslims. They said it was time the Muslims were released. I wondered: released from what?"" **********Mr. Dukic, as a prominent local businessman, addressed the meeting. He said he told the crowd that their Muslim leaders were offering them a return to the 15th century, apparently a reference to Ottoman Turkish domination. **********""I felt the smell of danger in the air,"" Mr. Dukic said. A month later, he and Dr. Karadzic founded the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party. Battle lines had thus been drawn. **********Ruzdija Sestovic, his family says, took little or no interest in these new political currents. Like almost all Muslims, he dutifully voted for Mr. Izetbegovic's party in Bosnia's only election, in December 1990. But he never joined the party and never went to a mosque. His passions were cars and the mine. **********By the second half of 1991, however, with fighting raging in Croatia after its secession from Yugoslavia, politics in the small town of Milici had become impossible to ignore. **********As the only Muslims in an apartment building full of Serbs, the position of the Sestovic family became increasingly uncomfortable. They were pointedly excluded from meetings of Serbian residents in the basement. Serbian insignia appeared everywhere; nationalist songs became daily taunts to the Muslims. **********""I felt frightened,"" Mrs. Sestovic recalled. ""So I persuaded my husband to swap flats with a Serb called Ratko Kandic who lived in Vlasenica. Because Vlasenica, unlike Milici, had a Muslim majority, I thought we would be safer there."" **********The swap took place in October 1991. At the same time, Mrs. Sestovic said, her husband was dismissed from the Boksit mine company for being a Muslim. ""Ruzdija had a disagreement with Mr. Dukic, and he lost his job,"" she said. ""The Serbs said there were too many Muslims in the company. They were all dismissed."" **********Mr. Dukic disputes this account. He said the Sestovic family moved from Milici to Vlasenica two years before the Bosnian war because there were good high schools there -- a claim dismissed by Ermin Sestovic and his mother as a lie. (The children were too old for school by then.) Mr. Dukic also insisted that Muslims were never dismissed from the mine. **********In Vlasenica, the Sestovic family tried to remake their lives. Their daughter, Nada, opened a hairdressing business called Salon Nada. Ermin, who had been working for a year in a cafe in Rogatica, found a job as a waiter in a restaurant called Panorama. **********Both the salon and the restaurant offered insights into the increasingly menacing mood of the local Serbs, especially after Bosnian Muslims and Croats voted for independence from Yugoslavia in February 1992 in a referendum boycotted by Serbs who naturally wanted to maintain their links to Belgrade. **********Nada noted how Serbian women who used to frequent her salon were packed off to Belgrade by husbands and fathers who seemed to know of imminent war. **********Ermin heard talk of guns being delivered from Serbia to Serbs' homes. On April 5, 1992, he saw Serbs collecting weapons from a truck near the restaurant. **********Mr. Dukic insisted that Serbs were only acting in self-defense. **********""Like other Serbs, I felt threatened,"" he said. ""In March 1992, a Muslim gang kidnapped one of our buses at the mine and tried to take over the explosives in the storage room. We had 20,000 kilograms of explosive in there, so it was lucky they failed."" Broken Family  Children Gone, Father Jailed **********When war broke out, the next day, the Serbs were already heavily armed, the Muslims virtually without weapons. Convinced by the arrival of weapons that the time had come for Muslims to leave Vlasenica, Ermin Sestovic confronted his mother and father on April 7. Relations with his father had been clouded by a bitter argument over whether Ermin should be allowed out at night -- a fact that now haunts the young man -- but a much larger crisis now brought the family together. **********""I told my parents, let's get out of here,"" Ermin recalled. ""I said, how we are going to defend ourselves? I urged them to come to Zagreb, where one of my mother's sisters lives. But my father said nothing can happen here. We're all together. We're with people we've known a long time. They can't hurt us."" **********Like many Muslims, the Sestovic family was deluded by the conviction that danger could come only from outside -- that is, from some kind of a Serbian invasion. The notion that their neighbors could kill or imprison them seemed impossible. **********""We hesitated,"" Mrs. Sestovic said. ""We had our flat, our hairdressing salon, even our Serbian friends. We had not done anything wrong."" **********Their sense of invulnerability was reinforced by the fact that they had become friendly with Mr. Dukic's brother-in-law, Mladen Cojnic, and his wife Spomenka, who lived downstairs. This Serbian couple told them not to worry. **********In the end, the family reached a compromise: Nada and Ermin would leave, their parents would remain in Vlasenica. On April 10, Ruzdija Sestovic borrowed a friend's Volkswagen and drove westward out of town toward Kladanj with his two children. **********He drove them to Tuzla. Their parting turned out to be the last time Ermin and Nada saw their father. ""I blame myself now for not bringing my parents -- I should have forced them,"" Ermin said. ""I feel I did not spend enough time with my father. I feel bad about the row that we had. I was always out with my friends. Now, nothing except having my father back is worth anything."" **********For the elder Sestovices, life in Vlasenica quickly became infernal. Units of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army encircled the town in late April. Escape became impossible. Serbs were given weapons, Muslims were terrorized. **********The couple never left their apartment, where their young niece and nephew, Vahda and Salih Ibisevic, had been entrusted to them by parents convinced that their own eastern Bosnian village was more dangerous than Vlasenica. What food they needed was bought for them by friendly Serbs, particularly the Cojnic couple downstairs. **********For a while, until lines were cut in late May, their children could reach them by phone from Zagreb. ""I remember the last time,"" said Nada, 22, who is now with her mother in Berlin. ""My mother started to cry on the phone. My father said just two words: save yourselves. He could hardly talk."" **********On June 20, just before midnight, there was a violent knocking on the door of the Sestovic apartment. Three men barged in, Mrs. Sestovic said, wearing black masks and gloves and armed with knives and automatic weapons. They pointed their guns at Ruzdija, who raised his hands. **********Mrs. Sestovic recalls the following conversation. One of the Serbian intruders said: ""We have to take your husband to the police station for two hours, just to sign a document saying he will exchange this apartment for one in Kladanj."" Kladanj was, and remains, under Bosnian Government control. **********An argument followed over whether Mr. Sestovic should be allowed to put on his shoes. Eventually this concession was granted, and he was led away at gunpoint by the three men. Mrs. Sestovic tried to call the Cojnic couple downstairs, but discovered that they had left for Belgrade. **********After a sleepless night pacing the apartment, Mrs. Sestovic went to see a Serbian friend, Ranko Ivanovic, who lived in Vlasenica and had worked at the Milici mine. Mr. Ivanovic advised her to seek help from the Serbian chief of police, a man named Sokanovic. **********Mr. Sokanovic, who could not be reached recently in the closely guarded town of Vlasenica, received Mrs. Sestovic in his apartment at about 10 A.M. on June 21. **********He asked his wife to make some coffee and then accepted a bribe from Mrs. Sestovic, who says she gave him 1,000 German marks (about $640 today), a gold necklace and three gold rings. In exchange, she says, she hoped for Ruzdija's release. **********The police chief pocketed the bribe, she said, and offered to take Mrs. Sestovic to see her husband at the police station. She found him, she recalls, in a windowless room crammed with about 50 Muslims. They were able to talk briefly. **********After this meeting, Mrs. Sestovic said, Mr. Sokanovic posed a question: Would she rather that her husband went to the city prison or to the Susica concentration camp, established on June 1 in a former military warehouse in Vlasenica for the confinement of large numbers of local Muslims? **********""I said I wanted my husband to come home,"" Mrs. Sestovic recalled. **********In her recollection, Mr. Sokanovic replied that Ruzdija Sestovic's release was impossible because orders had been given by the Bosnian Serb authorities to remove Muslims from Vlasenica. He recommended, however, that Mr. Sestovic not go to the Susica camp, ""because people are being killed there."" **********For almost a month after this, Mrs. Sestovic was able to bring food to her husband daily in the Vlasenica prison. Other Muslims there were being severely beaten, but Mr. Sestovic was spared, apparently on Mr. Sokanovic's orders. **********She particularly remembers her husband's giving her his wedding ring for safekeeping and saying: ""Even if we die, at least we know our children are safe. We cannot be sorry."" **********He also suggested that his wife try to make contact with Mr. Dukic, whose influence could surely save the Sestovic family. But with the roads barred and telephones cut, Mrs. Sestovic could not reach Milici, just 13 miles away. **********Mr. Dukic says now that he had no idea what was going on in Vlasenica, went there only once after the war began, and learned only recently of the Susica concentration camp ""from foreign newspapers."" Refugees  What Happened To the Father? **********On July 19, 1992, there was another knock on the door of the Sestovic apartment. This time it was a young Serbian neighbor, Goran Viskovic, who pointed a Kalashnikov at Mrs. Sestovic and her terrified niece and nephew, who were then 19 and 13. He was flanked by four other armed men whom Mrs. Sestovic did not know. **********""I said to Viskovic, you know me, you know my husband,"" Mrs. Sestovic recalls now. ""How can you do this to me?"" **********She says Mr. Viskovic replied: ""That time is over. I no longer know you. You chose your Alija Izetbegovic. Where is your Muslim President to help you now?"" **********Then, she says, Mr. Viskovic forced them out of the apartment. Outside, he pointed his weapon at Mrs. Sestovic and made her lie down on the road. Then he ordered her to crawl along the street as he kicked her repeatedly. Finally she and the two teen-agers were pushed into a small bus filled with Muslims and taken to the Susica camp. **********Conditions at the camp, where a former Serbian guard has said up to 3,000 Muslims were killed over four months, were appalling. **********Mrs. Sestovic is particularly haunted by the memory of seeing two men -- Durmo Handzic and Izmet Dedic -- beaten to death, by recurrent nightmares about another Muslim whose ear was progressively sliced off on four consecutive nights by Serbian guards and by the recollection of the commander of the camp, Dragan Nikolic, holding up a cigarette butt and saying, ""This is now worth more than all of your Muslim lives put together."" Mr. Nikolic has been indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. **********After 10 days in the camp, Mrs. Sestovic and her niece and nephew were bundled onto a bus along with other women and children and driven up toward the front line about 10 miles from Kladanj. On the way, however, a group of Serbian soldiers blocked the road. **********They lined up the passengers outside the bus. Then, Mrs. Sestovic said, the Serbs took 13 young women, aged between 14 and 20, including her niece, Vahda Ibisevic, to one side. A soldier said, ""We'll make nice little Serbs with these girls."" **********Miss Ibisevic was led away, along with the other young women, never to be seen again. Hers is the second disappearance in the Sestovic family. **********The ensuing 30 months, from August 1992 until now, have been a time of great suffering for the family. Attempts to find Ruzdija Sestovic or Vahda Ibisevic through the Red Cross, Bosnian newspapers and the United Nations have all proved fruitless. **********Red Cross and United States officials say they believe that almost all the missing are dead. **********Mrs. Sestovic spent several months in Tuzla, in northern Bosnia, after being released from Susica. She hoped that her husband might appear there as part of a prisoner exchange. **********Ermin, her son, did odd jobs in Zagreb until March 1993, when he joined the ranks of the 121,000 people from the former Yugoslavia who have sought asylum in Sweden. This asylum has now been granted. **********But by the time Ermin Sestovic tried to get his mother and sister to Sweden in the late summer of 1993, the border was in effect closed. **********So instead of Sweden, Ermin Sestovic flew his mother and sister to Germany, where more than 400,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia have fled. He raised the money to do so by going to a mosque for the first time in his life -- in Goteborg, Sweden. There Pakistanis gave him the money he needed to get his family to Berlin in September 1993. **********Now, Ermin lives alone in the central Swedish town of Vajvo, where he has been given a small apartment rent-free for 18 months and a monthly allowance of about $350 from the local authorities. **********He is trying to study Swedish and English, but his concentration is poor. He is torn, he says, between the desire to go back to Bosnia and fight, and a sense that his first duty is to look after his mother. He has applied for his mother and sister to be granted Swedish residence permits, but even such applications for families to be reunited take several months or more. **********""I have no idea what to do,"" he said. ""The only idea I have in mind is to bring the family, including my father, together again. After that, it might be possible to start from scratch."" **********In Berlin, Mrs. Sestovic is surrounded by other Bosnian refugees in her hostel. Cigarette smoke, Turkish coffee and early-morning liquor reproduce something of Bosnia in the cold former Communist suburbs of the city. **********Nada has married another Muslim refugee, Ramo Avdic, from Bijeljina, and they have a month-old daughter, Almedina. Nada makes a little money by cutting hair in the hostel. **********All the Sestovic family believe that Rajko Dukic can help them gain the essential knowledge of what has happened to Ruzdija Sestovic. In an interview in Belgrade, Mr. Dukic circled for a long time around Ruzdija's fate. **********The businessman's conscience was clearly nagging him because, in 1988, when Mr. Dukic was briefly detained in Belgrade on embezzlement charges, Mr. Sestovic traveled to the Yugoslav capital to try to obtain his release. Thus he has a debt to the Muslim friend who had disappeared. **********First Mr. Dukic said he believed that Mr. Sestovic might have reached Tuzla. But told that Mrs. Sestovic had waited there for many months, he later conceded that this was very unlikely. Then he told the story of another Muslim employee of the Milici mine, Mehmed Mlaco, who had been a friend of his. **********""I looked for Mehmed Mlaco for many months, and I found out that he was taken by a paramilitary group between Vlasenica and Kladanj and killed,"" he said, adding that inquiries about missing people ""are delicate because there are these war-crimes trials."" **********Then he gathered himself and said: ""Look, Ruzdija Sestovic was an innocent man caught up in uncontrollable things. There were a lot of paramilitary groups in the Vlasenica area, and they were killing Muslims. I feel very bad for Mrs. Sestovic, and if I can do anything to help the family, I would like to."" **********He paused and added: ""There was no reason at all for Ruzdija Sestovic to get killed. Tell his wife I send my regards and I will try to find out more."""

Leighton W. Smith, the American who commands NATO forces in Southern Europe, said 39 aircraft from the United States, Britain, France and the Netherlands had taken part in the attack against the Udbina airfield in Croatia. **********The base was used three times in the last two weeks by nationalist Serbs to send aircraft -- some carrying napalm and cluster bombs -- against the Muslim-held Bihac area of Bosnia, 22 miles away. **********The NATO bombing was the largest air raid in Europe since the end of World War II and the biggest mounted by the alliance since it was established in 1949 to counter Soviet military power. With it came a warning to the Serbs that the United Nations and NATO were prepared to use force again if provoked. **********Michael Williams, a spokesman for the United Nations peacekeepers here, said that ""in a raid of this size there must certainly have been casualties."" There was no immediate estimate of their number. **********At the request of United Nations military commanders, the raid did not hit Serbian planes at the airfield. This gesture of restraint reportedly gave some NATO officials misgivings. **********But Admiral Smith said the commander of United Nations forces in the former Yugoslavia, Lieut. Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle of France, had insisted that aircraft not be hit. **********""This is a limited strike,"" the admiral said. ""We clearly could have taken those aircraft had we chosen to, but we have a dual United Nations-NATO key."" **********The French Defense Ministry issued a statement saying that ""after neutralization of the ground-to-air defenses, the runway, which was the raid's main objective, was put out of action."" **********The Clinton Administration's repeated calls for big NATO air strikes against the Serbs, combined with its refusal to put American troops on the ground, have caused persistent tension with British and French officers in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia. **********Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, and General de Lapresle justified their request for the NATO air strike today on two main grounds: the threat to civilians within the Bihac ""safe area"" from the Serbian air raids and the plight of more than 1,000 newly arrived United Nations troops from Bangladesh trapped in the area and fast running out of food. **********All allied planes returned safely to their bases, despite what officials described as initially intense antiaircraft fire. NATO officials said American F/A 18 fighter-bombers, F-16 fighter-bombers, F-15 fighters and F-111 bombers had been used in the raid. They were accompanied by British Jaguar bombers, French Jaguars and Mirages and Dutch F-16's. **********The raid amounted to a declaration that NATO will now act with more resolve, and a calculated gamble that the Serbs can be bombed to the negotiating table. Four pinprick air strikes this year against Serbian ground targets appeared to achieve little except to irritate the Pentagon by their tentative nature. **********The attack today also papered over, at least temporarily, the sharp differences that have emerged within NATO over the Clinton Administration's decision to stop enforcing a United Nations arms embargo against the Bosnian Government. The move has been criticized by France, Britain and Spain. **********But the risks of the bombing are high. The raid did nothing in itself to break the Serbian encirclement of the Bihac pocket, which remains acutely vulnerable and short of food. And more than 10,000 United Nations personnel are working in the Serbian-held parts of Croatia, all of whom are now potential targets for reprisals. **********Milan Martic, the leader of the ethnic Serbs who have occupied close to a third of Croatia since they went to war in 1991 to resist becoming part of an independent Croatia, issued a defiant statement: ""Bombing of the Udbina airfield is an insolent and vandalous act, which we have not provoked at all. This will certainly not contribute to the establishment of peace in this region."" **********Mr. Akashi, the United Nations official, said he had spoken to Mr. Martic today and tried to explain that the raid had been a ""necessary and proportionate response"" to the Serbian attacks on Bihac. **********But Mr. Akashi added that ""it was implicit in my remarks that force could be used again"" if the Croatian Serbs did not cease their active support for attacks on Bihac. **********In general, Western officials were at pains to emphasize the limited scope of the raid, saying that only runways, antiaircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles had been destroyed and that no attempt had been made to hit Serbian planes. **********""Our intention was to try to limit collateral damage,"" Admiral Smith said. ""We did not want to go outside of the airfield area, and we wanted to limit the number of the people on the ground who might be casualties as a result of the strike."" **********Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, said the raid was a justified response to the threat to Bihac, but did not represent any taking of sides. ""We don't see a military victory for one side or another in this war,"" he said, ""and we are not involved in helping one side or another to a military victory, as we think that is impossible."" **********With United Nations peacekeepers vulnerable on the ground, the aim of such statements is clearly to convince the Serbs that reprisals are unjustified and negotiation the only solution to the war. **********But in the past, the Serbs have proved deaf to such appeals, responding to much smaller NATO actions with harassment, hostage-taking and general obstruction of United Nations operations in Bosnia. **********""I hope that today's NATO air attack will deter any further attack on the Bihac safe area and its surroundings or on United Nations personnel within Bihac,"" Mr. Akashi said. **********He received authority on Saturday from the United Nations Security Council to use NATO air power on Croatian territory. Previously such authority was confined to Bosnia. **********The current Serbian assault on Bihac came in response to a successful offensive late last month by the V Corps of the Muslim-led Bosnian Army. The Bosnian soldiers, in their most successful advance of the 31-month-old war, seized at least 75 square miles of land east of Bihac, but have since lost almost all of it to a Serbian counterattack. **********Initially, United Nations officials were hesitant as to how to respond to the Serbs' counterattack, because it could be argued that it was a reasonable response to a military setback in a war. **********But the use of napalm and cluster bombs against civilians and the relentless tightening of the Serbian noose around Bihac eventually tipped Mr. Akashi toward calling for NATO action. **********Still, he acknowledged today that the United Nations position as peacekeeper in a war remained awkward. ""We are in a very sensitive and delicate situation,"" he said. ""If we did not act, we would be viewed as incompetent and spineless. But if we acted too vigorously, we could provoke an escalation leading to tragic consequences. We try to tread this narrow path."" **********In the past, treading this path had led to conflict between United Nations officers preoccupied by their soldiers' security on the ground and American-led efforts to use NATO air power decisively to help bring peace to Bosnia. At Udbina today these tensions were partly overcome, but the basic tension remains. **********The Bosnian Government welcomed the raid and called for more NATO action to halt the attacks on the Bihac area, where about 180,000 Muslims live. **********""All we ask from the United Nations and NATO is to protect our borders,"" said the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic. ""The Serbs are attacking across the Croatian border from a United Nations protected area. Their tanks are effectively enjoying United Nations protection while Bosnia still has an arms embargo imposed on it. This is completely absurd."" **********Renegade Muslim forces loyal to a businessman, Fikret Abdic, have joined Serbian nationalist troops in the attack on the V Corps, advancing from the north toward their former stronghold of Velika Kladusa while other Serbian units have attacked from the east and south. **********[ ""None of the problems around Bihac have been resolved by today's air strike,"" said one United Nations official in Sarajevo, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ""The military assessment is that the attacks on the Bihac enclave will continue."" **********[ The official said United Nations military analysts expected the Serbs and rebel Muslims fighting in their ranks to try to cut the Bihac enclave into three pieces and bottle up the Bosnian Army's V Corps inside the Bihac safe area. **********[ There was no talk of NATO air strikes to stop the ground or artillery attacks on Bihac, he said. ] **********The NATO warplanes used today flew from bases in Italy and on the British aircraft carrier Invincible in the Adriatic. They were supported by air-to-air refueling aircraft, American airborne command and control aircraft known as Awacs and reconnaissance planes. **********It is notable that because the air raid today did not take place in Bosnia, it did not involve Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia. Of late, General Rose has been a persistent opponent of the use of NATO air power against the Serbs. **********The NATO raid came as the war throughout Bosnia intensified, with a Bosnian Serb missile attack on the city government building in the capital, Sarajevo, heavy sniper fire throughout that city and Bosnian Serb shelling of the northern city of Tuzla.

The ban on flights was imposed by the United Nations and is enforced by NATO. **********After renewed artillery attacks on Sarajevo and the air raid on Bihac, Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, announced that his Government would call on the United Nations Security Council to examine what he implied were the international military force's failure to protect the United Nations-designated ""safe areas"" in Bosnia. **********But the evidence that at least one of the Bosnians' recent wounds was self-inflicted seemed certain to harden the resistance of United Nations military officials here, who have been complaining for months that the Bosnian Government is trying to draw the peacekeeping force and NATO into what would amount to a support role for the Government. **********""We're not going to get sucked into fighting their war for them,"" said a senior United Nations military officer. ""We're here as peacekeepers."" **********United Nations and NATO officials today practically ruled out any military response to the shelling incidents or the air attack. ""At this stage, I don't think there is going to be any direct military action,"" said Lieut. Col. Tim Spicer, a United Nations military spokesman. **********While there is no doubt that the vast majority of shells that have fallen on Sarajevo in the last 31 months have come from Bosnian Serb artillery, the question has been raised repeatedly whether the Bosnian Government has occasionally fired on its own people and tried to blame the Bosnian Serbs. **********The United Nations has provided details of earlier crater analyses, including one that showed the Bosnian Army had shelled Sarajevo's airport, which is controlled by the United Nations. But none of the analyses disclosed before today have ever implicated the Bosnians in shelling their own territory. **********Without providing convincing evidence, and even when it was clearly an untruth, Bosnian Serb leaders have asserted since the first days of the war here that Bosnia's army has repeatedly fired on its own people to win support and prompt the United Nations Security Council to lift an arms embargo that, until only recently, kept Government troops badly outgunned. **********Some United Nations military officials, insisting that their names not be used, have also told journalists and diplomats that the Bosnians have shelled themselves before. Their accounts include a story of a secret, never-released crater analysis that supposedly proved that the Bosnian Government was responsible for the explosion in a Sarajevo open-air market that left 68 people dead on Feb. 5. **********But today the United Nations Military Force here produced what appeared to be the most conclusive proofs ever of such an incident. **********Using photographs, charts and maps, a French artillery specialist, Lieut. Col. Jacques Lechevallier, demonstrated at a press briefing that two shells that fell on the Sarajevo neighborhood of Kosevsko Brdo on Tuesday afternoon had to have been fired from territory controlled by the Bosnian Army. **********""These two shells could not have come from the other side of the confrontation line,"" said Colonel Lechevallier, arguing that they were fired from a position somewhere east of the point of impact, well within Bosnian Army lines. **********Colonel Lechevallier did not state explicitly that the Bosnians intended to shell themselves. But he said it was his opinion that it was not possible that the shells landed on Bosnian Government territory only because they were mistakenly fired short of their intended target. **********""We've reported the scientific facts,"" Colonel Spicer said. ""You can draw your own inference."" **********Colonel Lechevallier said the mortar shell that killed two children in the same neighborhood earlier on Tuesday was fired from a Serbian position near the confrontation line on the northern edge of the city. **********""We have indicated to both sides that we wish to address the question of deterioration of the situation,"" Colonel Spicer said, referring to a call for a face-to-face meeting between top Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Army commanders by the United Nations military commander in Bosnia, Lieut.

But Bosnian Serb politicians appeared fearful of granting too much authority to Dr. Karadzic, a hawk who has rejected international pressures to make peace. **********The Bosnian Serb assembly reconvened this morning at its stronghold in Pale, just east of Sarajevo, to debate declaring a formal state of war against the Muslim-led Bosnian Government and allied Bosnian Croats. Such a declaration would empower Dr. Karadzic to act without approval from the assembly. **********""It's a serious decision,"" said Alexa Buha, the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled foreign minister. ""We don't want to do it too fast. We are concerned with the response and the mood of the people and the international community."""

He said that they were private meetings, not the sacrament of confession, but that he was still prohibited by church law from disclosing what was said. **********The Bishop did say the Arrellanos, who are brothers, revealed nothing about  the killing of the Cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, at the Guadalajara airport that the authorities did not already know. **********Last year the Government offered rewards of five million pesos -- about $1.5  million -- for the capture of each of the Arellano brothers. **********Church-State Relations **********The meetings between the Bishop and the brothers, first disclosed by Excelsior, a Mexico City daily, have raised serious questions about church-state relations. In September 1992, Mexico and the Vatican resumed formal relations after 128 years of official separation. Since then, however, there have been continuing conflicts, the most dramatic of which has involved the rebellion in Chiapas. **********This month, two federal legislators accused the Catholic church of providing  money and support for the rebel movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Army, and several times since the uprising began in January critics have accused Catholic priests of aiding and even leading the armed revolt. **********Tensions also rose in May 1993, when Cardinal Posadas Ocampo was shot and killed while he sat in his white Ford Marquis at the Guadalajara International Airport. The official version of what happened is that the Cardinal was mistakenly identified as the drug leader Joaquin (Chapo) Guzman by rival drug gang members. Mr. Guzman, whose nickname means Shorty, has since been captured. **********But many doubts about the case linger. The assailants were able to board a jet at the airport with high-powered rifles and other arms and land safely in Tijuana without being stopped by the authorities. **********Explanation Is Rejected **********The Cardinal's replacement, Archbishop Juan Sandoval Iniguez, has publicly rejected the official explanation and recently said he had information that could change the course of the investigation, although law enforcement officials said they had not yet received anything new. **********In an interview published in Excelsior, the wife of Benjamin Arellano, Ruth Serrano de Arellano, said that the Cardinal had actually been confused with Ramon Arellano and that the Arellanos had been falsely accused of the murder. **********Speaking from a home identified as being in Los Angeles, she said her husband and brother-in-law had asked the Bishop to intercede with the authorities on their behalf. She said he had heard their confessions and absolved them. **********In a statement, Bishop Prigione said a Tijuana priest, the Rev. Gerardo Montano, brought the Arellano brothers to see him in Mexico City last December and January, even though there was a nationwide manhunt on for the two. **********Bishop Denies Confession **********""As I am accustomed to do with people, I received them in private and listened to them,"" the Bishop said in the statement. He denied that he had heard their confessions. He said that he had encouraged both brothers to tell the police what they knew, but that in accord with canon and civil law, ""I am obliged to keep secret that which people confide in me in private."" **********According to Benjamin Arellano's wife, however, the Bishop went to see the law enforcement authorities and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. **********According to some interpretations of the Mexican Constitution, Bishop Prigione is bound by civil law, and although he enjoys diplomatic immunity as the Vatican's envoy he still is prohibited from becoming involved in the internal affairs of Mexico. Thus, according to the interpretation, he technically violated the law and could be prosecuted."

The contract gave Acclaim the rights to convert two popular coin-operated video games, Mortal Kombat and N.B.A. Jam, to a format that home video-game machines can play. By some estimates, as much as 75 percent of Acclaim's revenue comes from products licensed from WMS. **********Mr. Brecken said that while Voyager was profitable, investors and shareholders might be wary of the acquisition because the comic-book business had a lower potential for growth than the video-game business. Mr. Brecken said last week that Acclaim would have a difficult time replacing revenue from Mortal Kombat and N.B.A. Jam.                    --------------------       Deal with Sega **********OYSTER BAY, L.I., April 7 (Reuters) -- Acclaim said today that it would create its first arcade video games for Sega Enterprises Ltd.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/19/business/at-kidder-peabody-where-trading-went-awry.html,Floyd Norris,1994-04-19,,1126,,The New York Times,Business Day,An Analysis; News Analysis,article,"At Kidder, Peabody, Where Trading Went Awry","At Kidder, Peabody, Where Trading Went Awry"," **********Kidder officials, who spoke yesterday on condition they not be named, said the ""profits"" he reported reflected what amounted to accrued interest that would never be received. Those profits would vanish within months or even days. But by then, they said, he would have reported more such trades, and profits. **********Whether, or to what extent, the Kidder account is accurate is hard to evaluate. Mr. Jett, who has an unlisted telephone number, could not be reached yesterday. And Kidder executives, amplifying press releases from them and from General Electric on Sunday night, said they were perplexed by some aspects of the case.  Bond Prices Were Down **********They said that it had appeared that Mr. Jett's department had lost $90 million to $100 million in real trades, apparently in the first quarter. But they were not sure how that happened. **********""We don't even know if the losses were just bad trading,"" said a Kidder official. ""It appeared to most people that he did not have exposure to the bond market."" **********In the first quarter, bond prices sank as the Federal Reserve tightened credit, and such losses would be expected if the firm had a large position in bonds. But if it did not have such a position, the losses would be harder to explain. It could have come from any of a number of complicated strategies, like an incorrect bet on the relationship of, say, interest rates on 10-year Government bonds to 30-year bonds, or on the spread between rates on Treasury securities and those issued by Government agencies. Kidder Officials Unsure **********That Kidder officials were unsure, even yesterday, of the nature of the real trading seemed to indicate that the management information systems were inadequate. It appears that Kidder officials focused on the net profit of the department, not on individual types of trades, so the phony trades, asserted by Kidder, managed to obscure the other losses. **********In that regard, this is not a case of a trader concealing his bad trades, a practice known as ""hiding the tickets"" reporting losing trades. **********""He hid the effects of the tickets, not the tickets themselves,"" a Kidder official reported. **********The purported phony trades were said to be listed as ""forward"" trades, in which Kidder supposedly agreed to give a basket of securities, known as ""strips,"" to the Federal Reserve, and receive back from it an equivalent Treasury bond, at a date in the future ranging from a few days to as long as three months. **********When the Government sells a Treasury bond, for example the 30-year bond sold last August, paying 6.25 percent and due in August 2023, it promises that for each $1,000 bond it will pay $31.25 each February and August, and then $1,000 in August 2023. Bond dealers can sell off the individual payments to different holders, a process known as stripping. **********They can also put the bond back together -- a process known as reconstituting the bond, or simplay as a ""recon"" -- by accumulating rights to all the remaining payments, and trading those rights to the Fed. Kidder said Mr. Jett asserted he had agreed to make such exchanges in the future. **********It is hard to see why such transactions should have been recorded at all, at least not until they were actually done. Essentially such a trade is the equivalent of giving a roll of 40 quarters to a bank and getting back a $10 bill. The bank will do that trade any time you want, and the profit, if there is one, could come only from buying quarters at a discount, which is not easy to do.  On Reconstituting Bonds **********Similarly, the Fed lets bond dealers strip or reconstitute bonds whenever they wish. They can tell the Fed they plan to do so at a particular date, but there is no more penalty for not doing so than there would be from a bank whose customer brought in fewer quarters than expected. ""This was not a real forward trade,"" a Kidder official said. **********The ""strips,"" as the individual payments of principal and interest are called, will normally rise in value over time, as the actual payment grows closer. So the ""forward"" price for such a coupon payment -- the price that you would have to agree to pay for it to get it a few days or a few months from now -- will be a bit higher than current prices. **********Kidder would record that it had agreed to sell the set of strips to the Fed for the forward prices, and take a profit because that figure was higher than the current market price for the strips. At the same time, it would record that it had agreed to ""buy"" the reconstituted bond at its forward price for it. There would be a small, equally phony ""loss"" recorded on the bond part of the trade, but the net of the two was a reported profit. In fact, nothing had happened at all. **********That reported profit would vanish as the actual date scheduled for the supposed trade approached, and Kidder would then, it appears, create new ""profits"" by putting on more such trades in the future. A Profit Would Vanish **********How small was the profit? Kidder officials told of one recorded forward trade, for an $8 million principal payment, that provided a ""profit"" of $2,215. That profit was to vanish over six days. To get the kind of phony profits Kidder says Mr. Jett accumulated, it would be necessary to report such trades for many billions of dollars. It is not clear why Kidder failed to pick up such huge stated positions much earlier than it did. **********It is sometimes possible to make small profits buying up the strip payments and reconstituting the bonds, just as it is sometimes possible to make money doing the opposite and stripping the bonds. That depends on the relative demand for bonds and for the strips, which are sold to customers who will need money at a specific time, like retirement. **********Effectively, however, if Kidder's accusations are true, Mr. Jett made it appear that he had made such profits, without having done so."

Rather, public concerns about global warming, the ozone layer and the health hazards of dirty air are quietly changing the rules of the market. Switzerland, which voted last month to require trans- Alpine trucks be transported by rail, was an appropriate backdrop to the fair, which began May 10 and runs until Sunday. **********The adoption of California's stringent air- quality standards by the District of Columbia and 12 Eastern states suddenly makes toy- like electric cars look serious. These regulations will require 2 percent of new cars sold in 1998 to be exhaust pollution-free, rising to 10 percent by 2003. **********Additionally, the U.S. government proposed last autumn to provide military research to Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. in exchange for the Big Three automakers producing cars with high fuel economy. It is likely that these vehicles will be electric. **********European companies such as PSA Peugeot Citroën SA and Renault, meanwhile, are already producing workable models. In February, Daimler Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz unit and SMH Société Suisse de Microélectronique & d'Horlogerie SA announced an agreement to co-produce an electric car known as the Swatchmobile. Japan has also made a commitment to electric vehicles, promising 200,000 on the roads by the year 2000. **********Potential in the developing world is best exemplified by China, whose vast market, growing economic might and polluted cities make it a prime target. The Chinese, however, seek to develop their own electric cars. At the Swiss show, a delegation from the Norenco industrial complex met with electric-carmakers and distributors, such as Ligier of France, Eco-Drive and Horlacher of Switzerland, and Solon of Sweden. **********""The Chinese delegation came to see what electric-car manufacturers are now offering,"" said Henri Payot, president of the European association of electric-automobile manufacturers. ""Their plan is to buy a special chassis from Japan and build on it with European technology and electronics."" **********Electric cars' relatively slow speeds of 70 to 100 kilometers (43 to 62 miles an hour) may have little bearing on their suitability for urban transport, a key market. But their limited kilometers-to-the-battery (60-100 kilometers) and long recharging times remain discouraging. Symptomatic of what is still a cottage industry, prices are high at $15,000 to $35,000 and after-sales service difficult. **********""It is hard for small companies to support maintenance,"" said Mr. Payot. ""You cannot afford to service one car in Geneva, one in Lausanne and a third in Paris. The business doesn't work that way."" **********But manufacturers are eager to produce solutions. Scholl Sun Power, the Swiss distributor of the French company Ligier, announced it would lease rather than sell batteries with its cars. ""Problems in the past with batteries that didn't live up to expectations are over. The new leasing program allows owners to calculate use accurately,"" said Pierre Scholl. **********While the Geneva Automobile Show spotlights the future potential of electric cars, an exhibit by Compagnie Industrielle & Commericale du Gaz of Switzerland offers a different and more immediate option: natural gas. The exhibit itself was easy to overlook. In a sea of futuristic shapes and glossy finishes, its converted 1.4l Renault looks decidedly sober, like a World War II jeep at a sports car race. **********But the car works and it is cheap. For under $3,000, the Swiss company's kit converts a car to run either on natural gas or to alternate gas and standards gasoline. While not zero-emission, the converted car makes sizable cuts. Tests carried out by Compagnie Industrielle under the eye of the Swiss authorities show that the natural-gas car produces 20 percent less carbon dioxide than conventional cars, 85 percent less carbon monoxide, 93 percent less nonmethane hydrocarbons and 97 percent less of the volatile organic compounds responsible for ozone depletion. **********The Swiss authorities approved the technology just two months ago, said Geoff Bates, the New Zealand engineer who has been in charge of the project for the past three years. **********""The first year, we studied all available conversion kits on the market. None of them were very good so we spent the second year working with a Dutch company to develop and improve a kit and the third year working with a German catalyst manufacturer. The Swiss paperwork alone took two years and if the company wants to distribute to the EC, we will have to start the whole process over to enter that market,"" he said. **********Mr. Bates drives a converted car. ""When I'm in town, I flip a switch to use the natural gas tank and if I am on the highway, I switch back to gasoline. While maximum speed is less than that of the unconverted car, its autonomy range is impressive. For gasoline use, it is that of the normal car, while the natural gas tank can reach 200 kilometers. When the two systems are combined, the converted car can go 800 kilometers without refueling."" **********Compagnie Industrielle wants to see natural gas pumps at service stations in the same way unleaded gas pumps are common throughout the United States and Europe. The company is trying to interest Swiss retail outlets keen on a ""green image"" to invest in the pumps. But for now, small compressors plugged into home gas lines refuel the cars overnight."

Robert Monneret, a French member of the United Nations peacekeeping force, stood in a snow-covered field and peered grimly at the weapons through binoculars. **********""My mission,"" he said, ""is to survey the Serbian weapons and prevent any use of them. For us, it would have been much easier to regroup these artillery pieces and mortars in a U.N. collection site lower down, but the Serbs say they have orders not to budge from this position."" 'Still Negotiating' **********Lowering his binoculars, and glancing up with a hint of concern at two NATO F-14 Tomcat fighters sweeping overhead, Sergeant Monneret added: ""We are still negotiating with Serbs to try to insure the regrouping of the weapons, which are spread over quite a wide area right now."" **********The messy situation at Tilava, a few miles from the Serbian barracks in the Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica, illustrates the way in which the United Nations and NATO have shown flexibility toward the Serbs even as they and President Clinton insisted that there would be no extension or modification of a NATO deadline that expired at 1 A.M. today. **********Technically, it seems that the Serbs' Tilava battery -- the eight mortars, four 122-millimeter field guns, two multiple-rocket launchers and four anti-aircraft guns -- should be liable for NATO air attack. NATO's ultimatum calls for the withdrawal of any heavy weapons or ""regrouping and placing"" under United Nations control within a 12.4-mile radius of the city center. **********But these Serbian weapons in the hills to the south of Sarajevo are within the designated zone and have clearly not been regrouped at any of the eight sites controlled by the United Nations. They have not even been regrouped in the fields where they stood, and are now scattered over an area of about one square mile. **********""The guns are operational,"" said Sergeant Monneret, who heads a platoon of about 30 French soldiers that set up camp today on the Tilava hillside. ""But we try to keep them under our visual control. What is not yet clear is if the Serb commanders are really willing to move them, or if this is a small reserve in case of a Bosnian Muslim attack."" Serbs Get Benefit of Doubt **********Both Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, and Sir Michael Rose, the British lieutenant general commanding United Nations forces in Bosnia, have been prepared to give the Serbs the benefit of the doubt because, they say, heavy weapons not already withdrawn or handed over will be soon. They have cited bad weather and the difficult terrain as causes for delays. **********At a news conference today in Pale, Radovan Karadzic, the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs, also blamed the weather. **********""There are a few pieces stuck in the snow,"" he said, ""but those pieces are under U.N. control, and as soon as conditions permit, we will put them in U.N. sites."" **********He added that ""more than 50 percent"" of Serbian heavy weapons had been withdrawn beyond the zone, rather than placed under United Nations control. **********But the weather, which has improved over the last two days, does not explain the situation at Tilava. **********Referring to the weapons there, Sergeant Monneret said, ""If they'd agree to move them, I'd escort them to Lukavica barracks anytime."" **********The French platoon spent the night of the NATO deadline in their vehicles or in Serbian houses near the guns. The Serbian soldiers who man the guns are still on duty and, the French soldiers said, their leaves have been canceled. **********The platoon, which plans regular patrols of the widely scattered weapons, is now settling into tents and has no idea how long its mission will last. **********As Sergeant Monneret talked, the F-14's swooped ever lower over the Serbian guns, descending to about 1,000 feet with a deafening and intimidating roar. ""If they dropped a bomb it would amaze me,"" Sergeant Monneret said with the tone of a soldier accepting his fate. ""But in any case, if they do, we're pretty badly placed."" **********If NATO has refrained from dropping bombs, it is clearly in part because United Nations officials are convinced that the momentum of the Serbian withdrawal, the Bosnian Muslim hand-over of heavy weapons and the current cease-fire can be built into a wider settlement for the Bosnian war. **********But Dr. Karadzic flatly rejected the terms of current peace talks, which call for a union of three republics -- Muslim, Serbian and Croatian -- in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Too Late for a Single State? **********""I think it is too late to talk about a union of three republics,"" Dr. Karadzic declared. ""We are separate ethnic groups and we are separate states. Why should we make some hybrid creation that would not work? It is not a good solution."" **********While the Bosnian Government has repeatedly adjusted its negotiating stance, it appears clear that it will not accept the carving-up of Bosnia and Herzegovina -- at least not without gaining substantially more or better territory. **********The Serbs have offered to cut their current share of the territory to about 50 percent, but today Dr. Karadzic appeared to retreat from that position, saying: ""We control 72 percent of the land, and we own 64 percent. We are ready to go below 72 percent, even below 64 percent, but cannot give away traditional Serbian territories."" **********Asked what would be done with the arms removed from the Sarajevo area, the Bosnian Serbs' leader said they would not be used for further attacks. **********""We will use the arms only in defense,"" he said. ""We have more territory than we intend to keep, so why should we make any offensive?"""

Another Survey Consulted **********But the rally faded as quickly as it started, as hints of inflation reappeared in another Government report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's February Business Outlook Survey. A jump in oil prices added to the reversal. **********While long-term interest rates are now the highest since early August, analysts said they did not see them moving as high as 7 percent as long as economic growth does not surge. But the selloff yesterday did indicate to others that there is little chance of the yield falling to 6 percent until traders and investors are assured that inflation will remain in check. **********""What the bond market is telling us, is that it remains fearful of potential new inflation,"" said Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, a division of Gruntal & Company. ""And since the outlook is clouded about what happens next in the economy, the easy answer for investors is to sell."" **********Mr. Battipaglia said he believed this period of volatility would not have dire consequences. ""I think the market is probably establishing a new level of equilibrium, with the yield on the 30-year bond, I think, trading between 6.25 percent and 6.75 percent."" **********Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said he was surprised by the market's selloff yesterday. He said he was always concerned when markets sold on bad news and ignored good news. He said he saw the yield on the long bond in the second quarter at least lower than yesterday. **********Mr. Crandall said he did not rely too much on the price index from the Philadelphia Fed because it covered only the early part of February and might have been affected by last week's crippling East Coast storm, which could have contributed to the rise in material prices. **********""The last time the market reacted the same way was in early February when the Purchasing Managers Index also showed sharp price gains,"" Mr. Crandall said. ""Investors' reaction to the data today perhaps was as much a response to the memory of the P.M.I., than to the number."" **********The price of the 30-year bond fell a point and 4/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped from 6.45 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 10-year note also fell sharply with the yield ending at 5.98 percent, up from 5.88 percent. The yield on the two-year note was 4.47 percent, up from 4.40 percent. **********Since the Fed raised short-term interest in early February, traders and investors had been trying to divine whether long-term rates would continue to rise or stabilize on the belief that the Fed would keep inflation in check. But because many analysts now think that the rally of 1993 is over, there is a tendency to pay more attention to bad news. **********Another concern is whether the trade dispute with Japan will push up consumer prices here. ""The Japanese are a very important reason for why we have low inflation,"" Mr. Battipaglia said. ""Their products are very much a part of the consumer-buying pattern and any increase in tariffs or lower trade limits raises prices."" Trade Deficit Shrinks **********Other favorable news yesterday included the December merchandise trade data, which showed that the trade deficit shrank to $7.41 billion from a revised $9.68 billion, mostly because of surging exports. **********On the Consumer Price Index, the market consensus was for an increase of three-tenths of a percent in January. But when it turned out to be unchanged, many traders and investors concluded that any additional move by the Fed to raise short-term rates could be delayed. **********Traders said the early morning rally was fueled solely by the index, which appeared positive throughout. The core rate, excluding food and energy, rose a modest one-tenth of a percent. This was below the two-tenths of a percent increase in December, which itself was revised downward from the previously reported gain of three-tenths of a percent. **********Some economists said they did not think the unchanged consumer index would effect the Fed's monetary policy. This is because the January data was, in part, the result of a new method of calculating seasonal adjustment factors that sought to get rid of the sharp -- and usually misleading -- jumps in prices over the last several years in the reports for January, February, March and April. **********As a result, investors turned to the inflation data in the Philadelphia survey for signs of how price trends were moving in February. Analysts at MMS International said the Philadelphia data on overall business conditions appeared to be distorted by the weather, as inventories surged and delivery time rose, while shipments and employment fell, all consistent with the impact of severe winter weather. **********But it was the rise of the price index in the Philadelphia report thatdrew concern and cut short the rally set off by the Consumer Price Index. **********In when-issued trading yesterday the two-year note to be auctioned next week was being offered at a price to yield 4.54 percent, while a five-year note, was offered at a price to yield 5.49 percent."

It also accused the committee of waging a disinformation campaign. **********The company contends that any negative votes ""were not solicited or procured in good faith."" **********Peter D.

A company letter asked shareholders to support the plan. **********The committee raised several objections to the plan, including that the sale of the money transfer business was inadequate."

On one side are the people who voted last Sunday for Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon and are confident that his six-year presidency will bring the village some of the things it needs, like more paved streets and perhaps even a small factory. **********On the other side are the people who voted against Mr. Zedillo and the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has governed Mexico for the last 65 years. They are people like Avelina Marquez Hernandez, a 34-year-old tortilla maker who thought that Mexico would finally demand a new Government. **********""We had heard that on Sunday there would be a big change,"" she said. ""We heard that people were going to act differently, that finally there would be some dignity for the small people. But unfortunately it didn't happen, and for this I am deeply saddened."" Reaching the Opposition **********If Mr. Zedillo is to heal the country's political wounds, his administration will have to address the aborted dreams of the 50 percent of the voters who supported the opposition. **********People in this village 25 miles from the capital say Mr. Zedillo and his party will have to keep up public handouts, yet avoid higher taxes on small businesses and the emerging middle class. The Government will have to subsidize local corn crops while continuing to open up the country to free trade. It will have to stroke the party faithful, while tolerating an expanding opposition. **********The vote last Sunday will provide political scientists with grist for years to come as they try to explain why Mexico seemed so close to making a radical change but at the last minute refused. They will theorize about the record voter turnout -- almost 78 percent -- and why that turnout, instead of working against the ruling party, helped the party win. **********A study of isolated spots like Rio Frio might help show them how unclear the mandate for change was for some people.  Bucking the PRI Tradition **********Even in a PRI stronghold like this, however, there were some poor people who dared to say, ""Enough!"" **********Rita Suarez was not among them, but she said her 23-year-old son Oscar was. ""Why am I going to lie, I voted for the PRI,"" she said as she mopped the tile floor of San Diego de Alcala church. The church was built within the shell of one of the largest buildings on an hacienda that was taken over by peasant families after the 1910 revolution. **********""It's a tradition from before my own ancestors,"" she said of her vote for the PRI. ""We don't know how to read, so how can we know anything else? But all my children know how to read, and Oscar, he's 23, and he only needs a few more courses to finish high school. He voted for PAN,"" she said, referring to the conservative National Action Party. **********Exit polls conducted by private firms last Sunday showed that as their level of education rises, Mexicans tend to support the PRI less and less. Students in particular went for the PAN candidate, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, who came in second in the near-final vote tally. **********On the other end of that scale are Mexicans like Dona Maria Oclica. Nearly 80 years old, wrapped in a blue shawl, only three wobbly teeth left in her mouth, she said she had voted, as always, for the PRI. ""Because I can't read, the only ones I vote for are the PRI,"" she said. ""I walk to the voting place, and someone shows me how to mark the ballot.""  Why Bother to Vote? **********Some people in Rio Frio said they were not happy with the PRI. But why bother voting against the party if the party is going to win anyway, they asked. On election day, they said, some people still asked themselves: What if someone finds out how I voted, and I am passed over the next time a title is given to some land, or I try to get my children into school? **********Agustin Reyes, 33, lumbered down one of the Rio Frio's muddy streets carrying a long-handled ax he had just used to chop wood. **********Mr. Reyes has lived in Rio Frio all his life, as his father and his father's father did. He said he voted for the PRI. And with the exception of a few more classrooms, he said, there really is not much else the village needs. ""It's a good life,"" he said, ""neither good nor bad. Normal. And we just continue."" **********Some Rio Frio residents have never been to Mexico City, but they all recognize the PRI Government's handiwork. The handful of streets that are paved were paved with money from the Solidarity anti-poverty program. The local PRI committee provided T-shirts, caps and plastic buckets with Mr. Zedillo's name on them. **********""With the help of our Government, we have been improving our lives little by little,"" said Jose Anastasio Baltazar, the 24-year old former commissioner of Rio Frio's peasant commune. He said that about 80 percent of the 10,000 people here voted for the PRI, and that many would continue voting for the PRI, ""until God decides to take away our lives."" **********The shacks and mud alleys of Rio Frio climb treacherously up the mountainside. Mr. Anastasio said people have lived here for more than 200 years: it was already well established by the middle of the last century, when, as the legend goes, Mexico's only full-blooded Indian President, Benito Juarez, stopped by to wash his hands, giving the small river and later the village their name. **********Those who live on the hill have so little that they have hardly noticed whether their economic situation has changed during the last six years. That, too, confirms the results of exit polls, which found that those who did not feel they were worse off than before tended to favor Mr. Zedillo. **********But down at the foot of the hill, where the old federal highway crosses through town, the merchants and restaurateurs have felt the economy tighten.  'A Little Deceived' **********Lorena Juarez Reyes just opened a new cafeteria a few months ago and has a five-month old baby daughter. She finished high school and plans someday to attend a university so she can become a teacher. Her husband is a bus dispatcher. **********""It's going to be almost impossible for this PRI to really change,"" said Mrs. Juarez, 21, explaining why she voted against the PRI. ""Right now, I feel a little deceived. What we've got for the next six years is the same old donkey, it just looks a little different."" **********The pace of life in Rio Frio is ancient, with the the daylight determining the schedule of nearly every man and animal. As the light starts to fail, the sheep return from grazing, the old people shuffle home and Mrs.  Marquez stuffs the last ball of corn dough into the tortilla-making machine she installed in a new shop a month ago. **********""In the end you know, I didn't vote,"" she said. ""I couldn't. I was working and it got late, but when they saw me coming they shut down the voting place because they knew I would vote against the PRI."""

But she and thousands of others in western Ukraine, where the Catholics were the dominant religious group before World War II, cannot use some of the churches they believe are rightfully theirs. **********""Our fathers built this church and many churches like it in western Ukraine,"" Mrs. Semenjuk, a retired teacher, said, gesturing toward the handsome, tin-domed edifice in whose shadow she was about to pray. ""After the war it became an Orthodox church, and I went only a very few times. We are happy we can pray again as Catholics, but we would like our church back."" **********The religious revival that accompanied the fall of Communism in the former Soviet Union has been particularly strong in Ukraine, where from 1946 to 1989 Russian Orthodoxy was the only approved church. Stalin allowed the Orthodox Church to operate, as an instrument of state policy, to help maintain control over Ukraine. **********""In the old Soviet Union, Ukraine was the most religious place,"" said Frank E. Sysyn, the director of the Ukrainian Historical Research Institute at the University of Alberta in Canada. But the post-Communist religious awakening has also been accompanied by divisions and competition, he said, as believers argue over which religion contributed most to the independence of Ukraine. **********The Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine has splintered into three Ukrainian Orthodox churches, two with allegiance to patriarchs in Kiev and one with allegiance to Moscow. **********At the same time, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which was forcibly dissolved by Stalin in 1946, is flourishing again. While many priests died in concentration camps and believers were persecuted, it was the biggest underground church in the former Soviet Union. Rites were administered, priests ordained and bishops consecrated secretly during these years. **********The Ukrainian Catholic Church was established at the Union of Brest in 1596, when western Ukraine was part of the Polish-Lithuanian state. The Ukrainian Catholics follow the Eastern Orthodox Rite but profess allegiance to the Pope. **********Once the Ukrainian Catholic Church was allowed to operate by Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1989, the Primate in exile, Myroslav Cardinal Lubachivsky, returned to great acclaim. **********He had been head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in the United States, based in Philadelphia, and was elevated to Rome to head the Ukrainian Catholic Church before returning. St. George's Cathedral in Lviv was transferred back to the Catholics by the Orthodox Church. **********""I found you can't kill the spirit; neither God nor religion is dead,"" the Vicar General, Iwan Dacko, who serves as the Cardinal's secretary, said as he sat in a room of the Cardinal's residence surrounded by valuable paintings and gilded furniture.  ""We are experiencing a renaissance of religious life in this part of the world. The foundations were here. We found a hierarchy of 10 bishops working as laborers."" **********When Mr. Gorbachev allowed the Ukrainian Catholic Church to operate again, an estimated five million believers -- about 10 percent of Ukraine's population -- were allowed to worship in a church again. **********But it has not quite worked out that way. In dozens of small communities with only one church building like this town 22 miles northeast of Lviv, Orthodox and Catholic priests, backed by parishioners, are battling over who has the right to use the church. **********In other villages, Orthodox congregations have agreed to share the church, with each religion holding its services at a different time. Or new churches are being built so both religions can be accommodated. **********But arguments persist, with fights over keys to churches and accusations of break-ins. In a town east of Lviv, Orthodox followers used a parade of tractors last year to block Catholics on their way to church. **********Inside the church here, the Orthodox priests are standing firm. ""Our fathers were Catholics under Poland, and in Ukraine we have been Orthodox,"" Vasil Karpa, a 74-year-old assistant to the priest, said as he prepared incense. **********""We are now the Ukrainian Orthodox independent church, with allegiance to Kiev,"" he said. ""The Poles were very hard on us, educating us in Polish, and from the East the Russians forced their language on us. We feel we contributed a lot to the independence of Ukraine, and in this church we want to be independent from Moscow and Rome."" **********The Vicar General said that about 450 Ukrainian Orthodox priests had transferred to the Catholic Church since 1991 and that more than 200 new priests had been ordained. **********The question of who has the right to village churches is especially contentious, the Vicar General suggested, because in places with few diversions, the church is the focal point of community life. **********""Yes, there are places where there are controversies, and there have been cases where the police were called,"" the Vicar General said. ""But it's not that traumatic. We haven't had a religious war. Look what's happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Armenia and Georgia. We must be grateful there has been no bloodshed."""

Connie van Rensburg, the spokesman for this base north of Pretoria, where most of the former African National Congress guerrillas are being sorted and tested by officers who sometimes despair of instilling military discipline. **********Still, no one was quite prepared for the latest hitch. Today, when Joe Modise, the former guerrilla commander who is now Mr. Mandela's Minister of Defense, helicoptered in to meet the troops, 4,000 of the former guerrillas -- more than half the contingent -- were AWOL, in their eighth day of a boycott over pay and status. **********The strike is the worst crisis yet in a clash of cultures that has cast embarrassing doubt on Mr. Mandela's effort to create a stable, legitimate military -- a showpiece, and an important underpinning, of the country's new democracy. **********Ultimately, 27,000 guerrillas from the African National Congress and the smaller Pan Africanist Congress are to be merged with the old army, a force of 65,000 in which the enlisted men are mainly black volunteers but the officers are overwhelmingly white. **********With the South African police still badly tainted by their lingering devotion to apartheid, the military -- widely regarded as more professional and less reactionary -- has been Mr. Mandela's first instrument of order. **********The merger with the guerrillas is supposed to complete the army's public rehabilitation by breaking the white monopoly on the officer ranks. It is also intended to occupy thousands of unemployable former guerrillas who might be dangerous loosed on civilian society. **********The problem is, how to combine a starched and spit-shined, Afrikaans-speaking, conventional army with a polyglot band of underground insurgents whose military engagements consisted mainly of sabotaging electric power stations and blowing up army jeeps. **********To the chagrin of the former guerrillas, who say they signed up for the new force anticipating equal benefits and status, the answer has been to absorb them into the regular army, often at ranks and pay levels far below what they feel they deserve. **********""A person has spent a lifetime working in the liberation struggle,"" said Johnson Mlambo, the deputy president of the Pan Africanist Congress. ""Now they are being assessed by what they consider to be their former enemy."" **********""It's as if we're just scrap soldiers,"" said Liberty Mmela, who spent 11 of his 30 years in the A.N.C. underground and is now awaiting a new assignment here. **********The former insurgents are given ranks by a board consisting of one officer from the old army, one guerrilla commander, and a British military observer who serves as a tiebreaker. **********While they await their assignments and training, the soldiers languish for months in dirt-floored tents, eating food they describe as dreadful, receiving $8 pay a day, and wondering if the delays are intended to drive them away. **********""There are files that just mysteriously disappear,"" said Peter Madubane, an A.N.C. guerrilla company commander who has been waiting more than five months for the final piece of paper that will make him a major in the new army. **********Encouragingly for Mr. Mandela, the dissident soldiers say the friction is not primarily a matter of racial hostility. Of about 20 black soldiers interviewed outside the base here today, all but one said the white officers may be authoritarian but do not seem to be racists in their behavior. **********The anger of the anti-apartheid veterans, in fact, is directed less at the white officers than at their former guerrilla leaders, like Defense Minister Modise, who they assert have betrayed them by failing to defend their interests and by reneging on promises of readjustment pay. **********What their superior officers see as lack of discipline, the former guerrillas say, is often the stress of readjusting to life in the civilian underclass after years in exile or underground. **********""Some have been away for 20 years, some for over 30 years,"" said Willie Nkonyeni, a colonel in the Pan Africanist Congress guerrilla force. ""They come back, and they are not earning anything. They bring back a mouth or two or three to feed. Some have come home to places where there are no longer any homes."" **********Col. Johan J. Kritzinger, who was sent in three weeks ago to straighten up the mess at this base, said the army makes allowances for such domestic problems, but has little patience with the former guerrillas' penchant for protest. **********""They think they are still in the old domain, where they can, by means of pressure, obtain certain objectives,"" the camp commander said in an interview. **********He conceded that the military bureaucracy had moved slowly, but said he had drastically streamlined the procedure. The most serious delays now, he said, are caused by protesting soldiers. **********The latest walkout began when most guerrillas failed to return from a routine leave that ended Oct. 5. Instead, dissidents marched on Government buildings with manifestos listing their demands for better pay and treatment. Some called on the Defense Minister to resign. **********Today some of the protesters were trickling back to base, lured by news that Mr. Mandela had agreed to visit them next week and hear their grievances. But there was no sign that either side had relented. **********""I don't see how Mandela can wave a magic wand on this one,"" said Jacklyn Cock, a sociologist and military critic who often advises A.N.C. officials. ""Creating a new army is by far the most difficult aspect of creating a new society."""

Losses for both airlines were narrower than in the similar quarter of 1992, in part because of lower fuel prices, improved productivity and an increase in traffic in November during the strike by American Airlines' flight attendants. United competes with American at O'Hare Airport, Chicago's and the nation's busiest field, and Delta has a hub along with American at Dallas-Fort Worth. **********""They're getting there,"" said Kevin C.

The statement obliquely warns the Government in Pyongyang that it faces a trade embargo if it does not cooperate. **********The statement represents a compromise between the United States, which had favored sending this message in a weightier Security Council resolution, and China, which wanted a milder statement. **********After the United States and China reached their compromise, the Council approved the statement. **********Senior United States officials said tonight that they had no assurance from either China or North Korea that North Korea would agree to the completion of the nuclear inspection. **********Nor is there any certainty that China will agree to any punitive action against North Korea if the Pyongyang Government still refuses to comply with today's statement. **********But the officials argued that the Clinton Administration's strategy for dealing with North Korea's suspected breach of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is back on track. **********If North Korea agrees to let the inspectors complete the work they started earlier this month, and exchanges envoys with South Korea, Washington will hold a third round of high-level talks with North Korea. **********But after the vote, the North Korean representative at the United Nations, Pak Gil Yon, said that the statement ""won't help solve the nuclear problems"" and that North Korea had ""nothing more to show"" to the inspectors. The only way to resolve the problem, he added, was through negotiations between North Korea and the United States. **********At those talks, the United States hopes to persuade North Korea to open two secret sites where it may have been working on nuclear weapons by offering the North new economic ties and eventually diplomatic recognition, which would end North Korea's nearly total diplomatic isolation. **********The third round of talks was to have started in Geneva March 21. But the United States canceled the meeting when North Korea prevented the completion of the inspection, a survey that North Korea had originally agreed to. **********This forced the inspection team to send the whole dispute to the Security Council, saying it could no longer guarantee that North Korea is not manufacturing plutonium. **********Such processing would violate North Korea's obligation not to develop nuclear arms under terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Pyongyang has signed. **********Tonight's statement calls upon North Korea to let the inspectors finish their work ""as a step in fulfilling its obligations"" under the agreement it reached in February with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and thus ""honoring nonproliferation obligations of the Treaty."" **********The statement also implicitly set a six-week deadline for compliance by asking the atomic energy agency to report whether North Korea agrees to the follow-up inspections. Such a follow-up is required within six weeks of the completion of the inspection that was interrupted. **********The statement asks China, which is North Korea's only ally, to maintain its ""dialogue"" with the Government in Pyongyang, meaning that it should continue to encourage North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions in the military field. **********Finally, and most crucially, the statement warns North Korea that ""further Security Council consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of the I.A.E.A.-North Korean safeguards agreement."" **********United States officials said this was an implicit threat to impose a trade embargo on the North unless it agrees both to allow the completion of the inspection and to open the two secret sites to inspection."

""This kind of car has long been my dream,"" he whispered, half to himself. **********But such dreams are becoming elusive even for the country's burgeoning entrepreneurial class. **********Since autumn, rising import duties have pushed the typical retail price of that Caprice to more than $50,000, from $25,000, as the total tax rate on G.M.'s cars in Russia has jumped to 166 percent of the wholesale price, from 25 percent, and a key tax break for individuals was eliminated. **********With more than a dozen dealerships in Russia, G.M. seemed to have a solid foothold in this risky but enticing new market in late 1993. Now, the company's beachhead feels like quicksand. ""Our sales have slowed to a trickle,"" Louis Sande, vice president of the GM Overseas Distribution Corporation, said late last month. Indeed, sales are off by half at the G.M. dealerships in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev run by Trinity Motors, said Mark Thimmig, Trinity's general manager. **********That sinking feeling is spreading to other American companies, as well as those from other countries, as the Russian Government has stepped up the use of import duties to protect domestic industries from the first wave of competition they have faced. **********The tariffs have been levied on a broad range of goods, with varying effect. Some are potential deal killers. A 50 percent duty on airliners, which amounts to roughly $30 million on a Boeing 757, is jeopardizing the Boeing Company's long-term prospects in Russia. And a 23 percent duty on food-processing equipment and seeds is holding up a $30 million processing and distribution project in Vladivostok run by TPC Foods Inc. of Seattle. **********Other tariffs are small enough to be swallowed, but not easily. A 15 percent duty imposed last month on most imported food has sparked enough of an outcry from distributors and local officials in Moscow and other cities to force the Government to reconsider the levy. Russia is a country that cannot feed itself and relies on imports for a sizable portion of its food supply in major cities. Any price increase is particularly painful these days because Russians now spend most of their wages, which have fallen to an average of $85 a month, on food. **********The increasing reliance on duties is just one more twist in Russia's herky-jerky path to a market economy, a path marked by policies that seem reasonable to bureaucrats but often wind up doing more harm than good. In this case, the bureaucrats were trying to protect jobs, raise tax revenues and push importers into building factories in Russia. Instead, they have alarmed already jumpy investors, infuriated consumers, encouraged domestic inflation and given a boost to smugglers at the expense of tax-paying importers like G.M. **********The quagmire has led Russian and American executives to suspect the bureaucrats of an ulterior motive: coveting the power they lost with the end of the state monopoly on trade. **********One American sugar trader, John Farley, reached that conclusion from Russia's decision last month to impose a 20 percent tax on sugar imports, even though only half the demand for sugar is being met by domestic refiners. ""The Russian Government doesn't care whether the guy on the street gets his sugar,"" said Mr. Farley, a principal in the Briery/ Farley Company in Los Angeles. **********Under pressure from Russian consumers, and from the Clinton Administration in the person of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, President Boris Yeltsin has ordered the tariff schedule reviewed. So far, Mr. Brown has salvaged Boeing's first sale into the Russian market -- of four planes -- with a promise of a one-time exemption from the new tariff on airliners. But Boeing hopes to sell far more for use in Russia. **********OFFICIALLY, the tariffs were intended to help stop a free fall in Russian industrial output, which dropped 25 percent from January 1993 to January 1994. Factories have slashed staff and production in response to rising prices, strangling taxes, a prime interest rate of about 200 percent and foreign competition. **********Meanwhile, since the collapse of the Soviet Union two years ago, numerous American companies have poured goods into a nation of empty stores. The nature of the trade has been transformed, as huge Government grain purchases have given way to thousands of private deals in food, consumer goods and equipment. **********American auto and truck sales to Russia jumped from less than $5 million in 1990 to $171 million in 1993, according to the Commerce Department. And last year, imports of American chocolates leapt to $76 million, from just $3 million in 1992. The numbers are still relatively small, but they represent dramatic openings to a huge new market. **********""This is the biggest market that will develop in our lifetime,"" said James Walker, until recently the first general manager of Trinity Motors and now a consultant to Trinity in Russia. ""Russian entrepreneurs are making a profit and they're spending it -- some of them, thankfully, at our place,"" he said before the higher tariffs took effect. **********It was precisely such success by foreign companies that bred jealousy and fear among old-time Russian industrialists, and led to protective tariffs. Their products are often of poor quality, and inflation rates of 2,000 percent in 1992 and 1,000 percent in 1993 drove prices close to or even beyond those of competing imports. **********FOR example, Russian chickens are so scrawny that Westerners joke they are slaughtered by starvation. Yet they now retail for about $2 in Moscow, not that much less than Western chickens. Traders soon figured out they could haul chickens from the United States and sell them for about the same price as Russian chickens at a profit, said Richard Schindler, TPC Foods' man in Vladivostok. **********In fact, American chicken imports to Russia soared to $80 million in 1993, from $16 million in 1992, according to the National Broiler Council, a trade group based in Washington. **********Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest poultry producer, says its Russian exports have been running at four to five times last year's level and may exceed 250 million pounds this year, without a single staffer in Russia. Virtually all of this business is coming from Russian entrepreneurs calling Tyson in Arkansas, its home base, and paying cash, said Archie Schaffer, a spokesman. It is too early to tell if the new tariffs will significantly cut into sales, he said. **********The influx of foreign competition was foreseen by reformers in Mr. Yeltsin's Government, who hoped it would force Russian producers to become efficient and profitable. Instead, directors of factories and collective farms flexed their political muscle and ousted reformers in favor of men who back their pleas for protectionist tariffs and subsidies. **********In many ways, however, the higher tariffs are backfiring. Instead of undercutting foreign goods, Russian producers appear to be using the tariff increases to raise their own prices. **********""We would rather buy Russian,"" said a frustrated Yuri Solomatin, chairman of Moscow's GUM department store, where more than half the windows now gleam with foreign products for lack of domestic alternatives. ""It is wrong to strangle imports if Russian factories can't supply the market domestically,"" Mr. Solomatin said. Prices on imported goods at GUM have jumped 30 percent since Jan. 1 because of higher taxes. **********The higher tax rates are also failing to increase Government revenues, as they simply inspire more tax avoidance, legal and illegal. For example, taxable sales of G.M. cars at Trinity Motors were strongest when the taxes amounted to only 30 percent in 1992, Mr. Walker said. Once they started rising, customers tried harder to qualify for numerous loopholes. Now that the loopholes are closed, few are buying. **********Many of the remaining sales are to tax-exempt diplomats, said Mr. Thimmig, Trinity's current general manager. Even then there are problems. Trinity must pay more than $20,000 in duties when a car is imported and ask for a refund if it is sold to a diplomat, he said. But when the refund is paid in rubles weeks or months later, it is worth far less, because of falling exchange rates. **********Many products are simply smuggled past notoriously corrupt border guards. Last year, $10 billion in imports got into the country that way, according to a recent International Monetary Fund study. **********Americans also reject the Russian theory that higher tariffs will spur them to invest in local factories without first learning the market through importing. In Russia, that kind of leap is even more difficult to make than in the West, said Tom Fore, chief financial officer of Allen & Associates International Ltd., an investment and trading company in Washington. His company postponed plans for a pharmaceutical factory in Russia when it realized there was no distribution system to buy the plant's output. Instead, the company decided its first step had to be importing medicines and creating its own Russian marketing company to sell them. **********At this point, after several years of increasingly prohibitive tax laws, many investors are becoming leery of Russia. Richard Watkins, a Houston oil executive, is so frustrated with Russian bureaucrats that even if he could obtain the exemptions from import and export tariffs that he needs for a refining project, ""I wouldn't be confident they would be honored."" **********As a result, he doubts his company, Taurus Energy International, will risk more money on a plan to buy up petroleum residue from Russia's inefficient refineries, process it in modern European plants and ship the resulting gasoline and other products back to Russia. **********Yet Mr. Farley, the sugar trader, remains optimistic about doing business in Russia, and is even sanguine about the sugar tax. ""We don't get too worried about it, because we think they'll change it,"" he said, noting that Russia still runs by whim more than legislation. ""Who knows what they'll do next week?"""

Shareholders Hail Changes At Beatrice"," **********Large shareholders of TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., the closely held foods company, said yesterday that they supported the change in the company's top management, which was announced on Wednesday. **********After just a year as the chairman and chief executive, Jean S. Fugett Jr. will step down. Loida Nicolas Lewis, the widow of Reginald F. Lewis, the company's founder, will become chairwoman on Feb. 1. TLC Beatrice said Mr. Fugett had intended to serve in only an interim capacity. **********Analysts and some shareholders, however, speculated that Mr. Fugett, a former professional football player, had been pushed out, or at least encouraged to leave, by shareholders dissatisfied with the company's weakening financial performance. **********TLC Beatrice ""needs someone with experience and connections, especially in dealing with European customers,"" said Margaret Schell, an analyst at Jefferies & Company in Chicago. **********TLC Beatrice, while based in New York, does most of its business in Europe, where recession and currency fluctuations have contributed to a decline in revenues. For the first nine months of 1993, revenues fell 1.4 percent, to $1.2 billion. **********""I don't know if it dawned on the company that it needs management help or if it is disappointed with operating results,"" Ms. Schell said.Death of Company's Founder **********Mr. Fugett took control of TLC Beatrice -- the nation's largest black-owned business, with sales of $1.6 billion -- following the death of Mr. Lewis, his half-brother, on Jan. 19, 1993. **********After Mr. Lewis died it was assumed that ""Mrs. Lewis would take a more active role"" in TLC Beatrice, a company spokesman said yesterday. Mr. Fugett felt that with Mrs. Lewis ending a year's bereavement, it was an appropriate time for her to become chairwoman, the spokesman said. Mrs. Lewis, a lawyer, controls about 55 percent of TLC Beatrice's stock. **********The company has begun a search for a new chief executive. No deadline has been set for filling the position, the spokesman said. **********Shareholders supported the change in management. **********Mr. Fugett is ""an unproven person in running a food company the size of TLC Beatrice,"" said Gerald B. Unterman, president of GEM Capital Management. GEM manages Oak Tree Partners L.P., which owns about 280,000 shares of TLC Beatrice. Call for a New Strategy **********After Mr. Lewis's TLC Group bought the Beatrice International Food Company in 1987, the company's performance improved, Mr. Unterman said. But now a ""strategy is needed to be put in place to bring the company forward,"" he said. **********Some shareholders think that strategy should include taking TLC Beatrice public. Last December, a group of shareholders announced plans to sell some of their shares to an investment banking firm, which would then underwrite the shares for sale to the public. **********A person familiar with that plan said that Atwell & Company, a Palm Beach, Fla., firm run by former employees of Drexel Burnham Lambert, intended to sell at least some of its 554,210 shares. Atwell did not return a telephone call. **********If all the shareholders sold their stakes, about 9.2 million shares would be traded. The Lewis estate would still be the majority shareholder. **********Mr. Unterman said some shareholders became upset last year when Mr. Fugett disclosed plans at the company's annual meeting to bid for the Baltimore Orioles, the baseball team, and to explore opportunities to buy other nonfood-related businesses. ""It didn't make sense to us,"" Mr. Unterman said. TLC Beatrice never made a bid for the Orioles."

Take Gould's ""Birds of Great Britain"" as an example. **********""It is a lovely 19th century book of bird pictures, not very rare, but because of its beauty it is still an attractive investment and recently fetched $60,000,"" said Stephen Roe, head of the London book department at Sotheby's, the auction house. **********But the book trade in general disapproves of collecting old books as an investment. This trend led the Antiquarian Booksellers Association, the British trade body for dealers in rare books and manuscripts, to issue a two page statement in 1993 which advised against ""the purchase of antiquarian books purely for investment purposes."" **********Yet as Laurence Worms, owner of the London dealership, Ash Rare Books, pointed out: ""I endorse the ABA position. This is not, however, to say that it is impossible for collectors - and long- term needs to be stressed - who with a mixture of knowledge, enthusiasm, luck, determination and expert help, do very well indeed."" **********The key phrase in that statement is ""expert help."" Most serious collectors use at least one bookseller to help build up their collection. The dealer will keep an eye out for books suitable for his client at book fairs and auctions and buy them up - generally at their own risk - for the collector. **********Stock turnover in Ash Rare Books, located opposite the Bank of England, occurs about twice a year, but a lot of books that are bought for specific customers are gone in a couple of days. **********Mr. Worms, 46, was recently elected to the ABA committee to bring some young blood in. ""Antiquarian booksellers are young till they are 80,"" he wryly admitted. **********Although John Maggs is far from 80, he did join the family bookselling business in 1947. **********The Maggs' London store has that welcoming, musty odor of old books. It is unusual in still being family-run, as most booksellers tend to change hands every generation. **********Perhaps this is due to the rather severe apprenticeship. Mr. Maggs described his own thus: ""I spent my first 10 years collating. There I was, shut up in a room with a great pile of purchases. One got rather weary."" **********Collating, in layman terms, means checking that a book has all its pages and is complete in every way. Although for the first time this year a university course in antiquarian bookselling is being inaugurated, it is difficult to see how this can take the place of painstaking apprenticeship. **********Mr. Worms pointed out that the postgraduate diploma would at the very least help would-be booksellers in mastering the enormous number of reference books necessary to look up and research books. At his small store, there are already over 1,000 reference books, often with miniscule print. **********""You must beware that the book is complete, that it is the right edition- sometimes the second edition is better than the first- that if it is a colored book it has not been doctored up and if, for example, it was dedicated by the author to someone important"", said Mr. Maggs. **********He also pointed out that another of the many important details that affect a book's value is whether it forms part of a collection.In general, say dealers, books from a collection are more valuable. **********A fundamental question is whether to buy from a dealer or an auction house.One advantage of dealers is that they can, if pressed, give a warranty as to a book's authenticity.But, as Southeby's Mr. Roe said: ""Catalogues are clearly written and point out faults.If new to the business, always have a look at what you are buying."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/world/aristide-s-stand-on-invasion-is-seen-as-reflecting-distrust-of-us.html,Howard French,1994-07-18,,782,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Aristide's Stand on Invasion Is Seen as Reflecting Distrust of U.S.,Aristide's Stand on Invasion Is Seen as Reflecting Distrust of U.S.," **********It has become a predictable refrain. Each time the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is confronted with questions about military intervention in his country, he replies with a wince that Haiti's Constitution bars him from calling for such an action. **********But as the Clinton Administration builds its case for the use of force in removing the military leaders who overthrew Father Aristide, the exiled President's position has come under increased scrutiny. And as this has happened, many experts have said that Haitian law alone cannot explain Father Aristide's coyness. **********More than concern over the legal implications of calling for a foreign intervention to restore him, experts in Haitian affairs say Father Aristide's reluctance to authorize intervention grows out of an intense distrust of the United States, and a wariness of offending his countrymen's deep-seated nationalism. **********Critics of American policy toward Haiti, including American diplomats working in the country, say that just as Father Aristide looks first to his own domestic political considerations in dealing with the question of intervention, Washington has recently begun to emphasize human rights abuses to bolster its case for possible military action.  Leeway in Constitution **********Legal experts say that Haiti's Constitution speaks only vaguely on the question of foreign military intervention, and that the document leaves ample leeway for a legitimately elected head of state, like Father Aristide, to call for foreign assistance in putting down a coup d'etat. **********""Aristide's constitutional arguments are somewhat cute, and one has to have sympathy with him under the circumstances, but he clearly has the authority to seek foreign help under international law,"" said Robert Goldman, a law professor at American University in Washington who has dealt extensively with questions of national sovereignty and foreign intervention. **********Aides to Father Aristide acknowledge that ambivalence toward the United States plays a powerful role in shaping his positions on intervention. But they and other critics of American policy say the suspicions are justified by Washington's erratic policies on Haiti since the President's overthrow nearly three years ago. **********""The United States has no history of restoring popular governments,"" said Robert White, a retired American diplomat who advises Father Aristide. ""He doesn't want to give a total green light to the United States to occupy Haiti. Once he is back, he wants to be able to say, 'I enjoy popular support and don't require your long-term presence here.' "" **********When Father Aristide first suggested early this year that most Haitians would welcome a ""surgical strike"" to remove the country's military leaders, his aides note, he was publicly scolded by Administration officials, who called his remarks ""unhelpful."" **********Similarly, while Father Aristide and others have long decried widespread human rights abuses in Haiti, American officials have persistently sought to play down the dimensions of the problem, even going so far as questioning the reporting by the United Nations and human rights groups on Haiti as distorted or politically slanted to help the exiled Haitian leader's cause. Suspicions of U.S. Rise **********Although Washington's current attention to abuses is seen as long overdue by critics of American policy, for many the sudden official concern on this question has increased suspicions toward the Administration. **********""We have been hitting our heads against the walls for two and a half years trying to get Washington to speak out about the human rights situation in Haiti, but there has been no willingness to do this for fear of losing justification for sending boat people directly back to Haiti,"" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. ""Now that they are thinking about intervention, the Administration is seizing upon repression as a justification."" **********Although in the last week Administration officials have seemed to rival each other in deploring what they have recently been calling the rapid deterioration of human rights in Haiti, Mr. Roth said the situation, although awful, had changed little from earlier this year, when the United States Embassy in Haiti was sending cablegrams to Washington characterizing reports of rampant abuses as highly exaggerated. **********""In most of the places I've been there has been a consensus of the sources I've spoken with that the situation has been basically calm, but with a fairly pervasive atmosphere of intimidation,"" said an officer at the American Embassy in Haiti this week who dissented from the alarming noises from Washington over rapidly multiplying human rights violations. **********An American human rights worker in Haiti who has harbored many frightened Haitians was even more blunt. ""We don't want to be used as an excuse for an intervention,"" the worker said. ""They are playing games."""

The New Marketing: Sell and Socialize"," **********DURING the last few years, many companies have begun to develop more personal, long-term bonds with customers. Variously called relationship marketing, database market ing and one-to-one marketing, the approach is a sharp departure from the mass marketing that has long been the norm. **********Clubs, newsletters and frequent-buyer reward programs are common features of this form of marketing, but new ideas are hatched every day. FNA Financial, a Canadian company catering to professional women, donates to worthy causes as do many other businesses. But when FNA buys tickets to fund-raising events, executives do not get them as perks. Instead, the tickets go to customers, who use them to network with other career women. **********Some enterprises are going further. They are forging customer bonds that bear some traces of genuine social activity, both between a company and its customers and among the customers. In other words, the new personalized marketing -- an essentially economic development -- shows some signs of having sociological effects. **********Consider the baby-food division of Nestle, in France. Because nearly everyone in France takes a long summer vacation, often spending much time on the road, the company has built rest stops for young families along the main French roads. **********Open from June 26 to Aug. 31, these attractive roadside structures are adorned with the company symbol, the blue teddy bear called ""Ptipo."" Babies are served free samples of Nestle baby food at any time of the day. Trained hostesses -- the company employs 64 -- dispense assistance and free diapers. In all, these centers are a bona fide social gathering place, and they are not small. Last summer, the company distributed 600,000 baby meals during 120,000 roadside visits. **********Or consider Toyota's relationship with Germans who buy its top-of-the-line car, the Lexus LS 400. In 1991, Toyota hosted a ballooning excursion restricted to LS 400 owners and featuring an overnight stay at a castle in Baden-Baden. Fully 54 percent of LS 400 owners asked for more information after receiving their invitation. **********The following November, Toyota sent every German LS 400 owner a free bottle of that year's Beaujolais before any other Germans got it. Some months later, the company invited LS 400 owners to a gourmet outing in Engadin, Switzerland; every course of the meal was served at a different elegant restaurant. About 2 percent of German LS 400 owners paid for the weekend trip. **********Toyota sends its LS 400 owners surprise gifts, too -- a reminder to make a seasonal clock change (complete with an elegant, correctly set Lexus clock), and a letter scale that incorporates an increase in postal rates. Each communication makes owning an LS 400 part of one's self-image. **********Then there is Harley-Davidson, whose Harley Owners Group boasts 200,000 members worldwide. Charging $35 annual dues after the first year, which is free, the club has an insurance program, travel agency, emergency roadside service, tuition reimbursement for safety courses, two magazines, member competitions and 750 lively local chapters that hold meetings around the globe. **********As this list suggests, the Harley-Davidson club is more than just an in-name-only assemblage of people who have purchased the same product. It has many aspects of a social group, from friendship to romance. **********There are other examples. The Utne Reader, a bimonthly general-interest magazine, assists in the formation of subscriber discussion groups called Utne Neighborhood Salons; the salons have 20,000 members who pay dues. Japan's largest cosmetics concern, Shiseido, has a credit card with a meaty 20-page monthly newsletter, a 400,000-circulation magazine for Shiseido users and a discount club to which 10 million Japanese women belong. Like Nestle in France, Shiseido in Japan has become more than a purveyor of products; it is an institution on which customers rely for help about a vital aspect of their lives: beauty. **********Of course, all these developments are marketing strategies at root. They aim not to create new sociological forces but to earn profits. (And they do. Since taking this approach in 1985, the Nestle baby-food division has gained 20 percentage points in market share.) **********But if personalized marketing continues to grow, then common product ownership may become a basis for getting together just as hobbies and fraternal organizations are now. Such links between products and socializing are not new, of course -- look at Tupperware parties -- but in our future they may loom much, much larger."

But developing countries, backed by the managing director of the I.M.F., Michel Camdessus of France, pressed for an allocation of $52 billion. The Group of Seven considered the higher figure inflationary. **********The Camdessus camp also wanted at least some aid to be distributed in a broader fashion, so that all poorer countries would get an immediate injection of monetary reserves. **********The aid under discussion takes the form of Special Drawing Rights, an international credit unit developed in the 1970's as a substitute for the dollar and sometimes called ""paper gold."" The rights are held by countries in their monetary reserves and entitle them to draw foreign currencies from the I.M.F., thus strengthening their creditworthiness and enabling them to buy more foreign goods. **********But only about $28 billion of the rights have ever been created, and they have conspicuously failed to replace the dollar as an international reserve currency. **********American and other European officials appeared deeply angry tonight with Mr. Camdessus, whom they blamed in part for the impasse, saying he had encouraged the developing world to press for a much bigger allocation than the Group of Seven agreed to yesterday. **********""Camdessus miscalculated, whipping up third world expectations,"" said Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clark, after the meeting. **********The finance ministers did agree to allow former Communist and certain developing countries greater access to I.M.F. credit in the future but left the details to be worked out. And they failed to agree on a way to extend and enlarge the special lending program the I.M.F. set up to help Russia and other former Communist nations develop market-based economies. **********The negotiations could resume at the finance ministers next meeting in April, but several ministers were cautious tonight. One European said, ""We are in no hurry"" and insisted the Group of Seven would want assurances in advance that developing countries were ready to accept the group's point of view. **********France also angered the United States during today's difficult negotiations by adopting a somewhat ambiguous position in the dispute, officials said. **********While Finance Minister Edmond Alphandery of France gave nominal backing to the Group of Seven stand, he did not conceal from other ministers that France had favored a larger sum. **********In the view of the United States and a majority of the Group of Seven countries, the expansion of international capital markets already provides adequate credit for developing nations, and the creation of too many Special Drawing Rights would only stoke the fires of world inflation. **********Because the former Communist countries and some poorer developing nations did not participate in earlier special rights allocations, and because they are short of reserves, the United States and its allis proposed that the aid under discussion be skewed in their direction. **********But such a special distribution would have taken a year or so to arrange because it requires a change in I.M.F. rules subject to ratification by parliaments of member nations. **********While much of the dispute focused on the arcane world of Special Drawing Rights, it also represented an attempt by Mr. Camdessus and the I.M.F., which manages the Special Drawing Rights plan, to increase their importance in the international monetary system by raising the quantity of new reserve units held by the world's central banks."

Strum, publisher of the Enthusiast, wants it to match or pass the circulation, advertising power and editorial influence of the Spectator. Both magazines, redesigned and fatter, were reborn in October. **********Mr. Strum faces an uphill battle. The six-year-old Enthusiast, with a declared but unaudited circulation of about 75,000, grew from 7 to 10 issues a year, and could eventually go to 12, he said. The 14-year-old Spectator, with an audited circulation of about 122,000, publishes 20 issues a year. An Influential Target **********Mr. Strum says he has the financial resources to compete with the Spectator, now widely considered the most influential wine magazine. Its editor and publisher is Marvin R. Shanken, the chairman of M. Shanken Communications in Manhattan. **********Both publishers declined to provide full financial particulars of their privately held companies. Mr. Strum put 1993 pretax revenues of his Wine Enthusiast Companies, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., at $38 million to $40 million, almost entirely from the sale of wine accessories. Mr. Shanken said the revenues of M. Shanken Communications, which publishes a number of consumer and trade journals, exceeded $20 million. **********Mr. Strum, who says he is investing $2 million to upgrade the Enthusiast, is gambling partly on readers' disaffection about the Spectator's new identity. Some wine purists complain that the Spectator, in redefining itself as a life-style magazine, has shed its old wine-and-food emphasis. **********Disputing this perception, Mr. Shanken said coverage of wine had increased 47 percent in the first six issues of the revamped Spectator, compared with the corresponding issues of 1992. He also said the new issues rated 58 percent more wines. **********In a leap from semipopulism, the Spectator has recently offered articles about Paris (with onion soups rated on a 100-point scale); the cuisine of Alain Ducasse, the Monte Carlo chef; the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena, Calif., and collectible Venetian glass -- turning its back on wine lovers with thin wallets, its critics say. **********Mr. Strum said of the Spectator: ""It has become elitist and narrow. It no longer meets the need to educate the consumer, to expand consumption."" He said his magazine would woo this ""silent majority"" with more news and practical advice. **********Far less polished than the Spectator, the Enthusiast emphasizes only wine and food, with an editorial style that is a mix of sophistication and wide-eyed earnestness. Recent articles have focused on inexpensive California wines and Washington State wines but also on expensive and rare vintages of Krug Champagne. A Challenge Discounted **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Shanken said that ""the Enthusiast is not a serious contender or threat."" **********Citing an outside survey, the Spectator's advertising prospectus says the median household income of its typical subscriber is $111,500. The comparable figure for the Enthusiast, based on a questionnaire to subscribers, is $82,500. **********In his quest for greater market share, Mr. Strum is relying on his large data base of casual and affluent buyers of wine cellars and accessories, and on the name recognition fostered by 15 years of mailing Wine Enthusiast catalogues. He said he mailed 12 million catalogues in 1993 and projected 15 million this year. All the catalogues, geared to various markets, will advertise the magazine. **********The Enthusiast has signed three new critics. They are Robert M. Parker Jr., publisher of The Wine Advocate, a newsletter; Dan Berger of The Los Angeles Times, and Terry Robards, a Spectator columnist for 10 years. Steve Heimoff, who wrote Spectator articles about wine collectors for four years, has also joined the opposition. **********Because many consumers buy wine magazines primarily for the quantity, breadth and dependability of wine ratings, the Enthusiast plans to increase this coverage and has created a West Coast tasting panel. **********Mr. Strum said he hoped to match or overtake Wine Spectator's circulation of 122,024 by mid-1995. But Mr. Shanken has his own goal for circulation: 300,000 subscribers by 1998. ""We've never had a year with declines in advertising and circulation,"" Mr. Shanken said. **********Mr. Strum said that Wine Enthusiast expected to join the independent Audit Bureau of Circulations ""in June or July at the latest."" He broke down the distribution of the December-January issue this way: 36,822 copies to paid subscribers, 8,100 in newsstand sales, 22,857 free copies to catalogue customers who placed a $200 minimum order, and 7,211 given free to the wine trade. **********The Spectator, in dropping from 22 to 20 issues a year, held its subscription rate to $40 but raised its cover price to $2.95 from $2.50. The Enthusiast went from 7 issues for $17.70 to 10 issues for $29.95; a single issue still costs $2.95. **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Strum said of the Spectator: ""Twenty issues is gluttonous, overkill. People can't read that much about wine. It does a disservice to advertisers."" **********Mr. Shanken said his magazine's ""high renewal rate,"" which he would not disclose, contradicted that view. **********Neither publisher has formal journalism training. Unlike Mr. Shanken, who monitors the Spectator's editorial process closely, Mr. Strum concedes that catalogues aside, he is a freshman in the field and that he defers to William R. Tisherman, the Enthusiast's editor in chief. **********America's wine industry is hoping for a donnybrook. ""With two competing magazines, we'll sell more wine,"" Joseph Heitz, a longtime wine producer in the Napa Valley, said."

Until, that is, I read ""Fashioning Top Pay to Fit New Regulations"" (Executive Life, Jan. 9). **********The cat is now out of the bag. It is the new tax law that is at fault. C.E.O.'s and other company executives who receive multimillion-dollar yearly compensation will have to have their remuneration trimmed, unless the company institutes a performance-based compensation system. Which in plain English means: Downsize, close branches, fire people and thereby increase the profitability of the company. **********This sort of American captalism puts C.E.O.'s in the company of Charles Keating, say, or Michael Milken as the most prominent redistributors of wealth, in conformity with the drive by President Ronald Reagan to do a Robin Hood in reverse: Take from the poor and give it to the rich. **********Things were different during the Great Depression, at least in regard to some companies. Spread the work opportunities was the principal concern at General Electric under the direction of chairman Gerald Swope and president Owen D. Young. Automation can wait for better days, when there is again full employment. **********Keeping the G.E. family intact was more important than short-term profits. The workweek was reduced from 6 days to 5 1/2, to spread the work. Then it went to 5 days, then to 4 1/2, to 4, to 3 1/2. But they would not fire anyone. The proudest day in my life came in June 1947 when I received word from G.E. that I was hired, accepted as a member of the family. **********How different are things today.

W. de Klerk deployed more than 3,000 troops in the province on March 31 to enforce the emergency decree. And at this rate, analysts here say, April's toll is likely to match or surpass the record number of 311 politically related deaths reported in Natal last month. **********Much of the bloodshed has been attributed to political and economic turf wars between supporters of the African National Congress and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.  But as the killings here graphically demonstrate, even neutral individuals are vulnerable. **********Complicating matters further, Ndwedwe is in the heart of KwaZulu, a part of Natal Province designed by apartheid for the Zulus, and considered a stronghold of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which is boycotting the elections. Perhaps not surprisingly, so far there has been virtually no political campaigning here by any party, and campaign posters and banners are conspicuously absent. **********""Inkatha wanted to send a strong message by killing those people in Ndwedwe,"" said an election observer in Durban who asked not to be identified. ""They wanted to make it clear that anybody who goes into their territory is risking their life, and that's going to make it awfully hard to find people to man polling booths or monitor the elections."" **********The eight men, between the ages of 18 and 25, were distributing pamphlets explaining the country's new Constitution. The pamphlet's were printed by the Transitional Executive Council, a multiracial body that was created in December to create as fair a political climate as possible until democratic elections are held. **********Andy Cox, the owner of Natal Pamphlet Distributors, said all of the victims except the driver were part-time employees who had already traveled throughout Natal, Transkei, parts of the Orange Free State and southeastern Transvaal. They were not affiliated with any political party, he added. **********The eight men killed were among 11 people traveling in a minibus van. The driver of the bus and two others managed to flee the attack in this hamlet, about 50 miles north of the eastern port of Durban. **********Thulane Ngcamo, 22, one of those who escaped, said they were talking to a group of people at the Tokomelo primary school when its headmaster, who is also believed to be a local Zulu chief, approached them and asked what they were doing. **********The headmaster then sent the driver, under armed escort, to a police station for further interrogation, while the 10 other men were taken into the school. Mr. Ngcamo said an armed gang of about 18 men and boys, who identified themselves as Inkatha supporters, then began to taunt them, accusing the pamphlet distributors of belonging to the African National Congress. **********""They then started to beat us with everything they had,"" Mr. Ngcamo said. ""When we asked them why you're beating us, they said, 'You won't admit that you belong to the A.N.C.' "" **********The 10 men were then forced to undress, tied up, pushed out of the classroom window and taken into the brush behind the school where they were hacked to death. Two of them were able to flee. **********The driver, meanwhile, was ordered to stop en route to the police station, and his vehicle was set afire, but he managed to escape."

TO BE EXTRADITED TO U.S. FOR TRIAL,EX-CHIEF OF B.C.C.I. TO BE EXTRADITED TO U.S. FOR TRIAL," **********Reviving the stalled investigation of one of the largest global frauds in history, Federal prosecutors announced today that one of the two top executives of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International would be extradited to the United States to stand trial on criminal fraud charges. **********As part of an agreement with the ruler of Abu Dhabi, who had been the largest shareholder of B.C.C.I., American investigators will also be given, for the first time, broad access to the bank's secret records and to 10 other former bank executives who had been inaccessible. **********Prosecutors described the settlement between the United States and Abu Dhabi, a Persian Gulf emirate, as an enormous breakthrough that would open a new window on the bank scandal. In particular, the deal could bring investigators a big step closer to answering the troubling question of how much influence B.C.C.I. wielded in American political and intelligence circles. Questions About U.S. Regulators **********As much as $20 billion that had been officially on the bank's books vanished in the summer of 1991, when bank regulators around the world shut down B.C.C.I.'s operations and accused it of fraud. Ultimately, more than $12 billion is believed to have been lost by depositors. The scandal also raised significant questions about why American regulators, who had long had evidence of problems at the bank, failed to act quickly. **********Under the agreement, Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's chief executive and its second in command, will be extradited to the United States within four months to stand trial on Federal and New York State charges. Mr. Naqvi, who has been under house arrest in Abu Dhabi since shortly after the bank was seized two and a half years ago, is said by investigators to have extensive knowledge of B.C.C.I.'s dealings with many foreign governments over the last 20 years. A Lawsuit Will Be Dropped **********In exchange, Abu Dhabi's ruler, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, has been assured that he will not face criminal or civil charges in the United States and that a $1.5 billion lawsuit against him will be dropped. It had been filed by the trustees for First American Bankshares Inc., a banking company in Washington that had been secretly and illegally owned by B.C.C.I. **********The agreement was reached on Saturday in Geneva after secret talks between representatives of Abu Dhabi and the Justice Department, the Federal Reserve Board, the Manhattan District Attorney's office and lawyers for First American. Portions of the deal were first reported today in The Washington Post. **********Since the bank's collapse, there have been a growing number of reports about the bank's close ties to a wide range of officials, including former President Jimmy Carter; former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young; Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican, and Clark M. Clifford, an adviser to four Democratic Presidents who was Secretary of Defense under Lyndon B. Johnson. **********None of the officials have been accused of wrongdoing except for Mr. Clifford, who had headed First American. But the 86-year-old Washington lawyer was never tried because of his poor health. Two months ago, after Mr. Clifford's protege, Robert A. Altman, was acquitted of fraud charges, a New York state judge dismissed the charges against Mr. Clifford. **********The Central Intelligence Agency has acknowledged that it used the bank for routine activities, which it has never spelled out. The bank has also long been identified as the leading financial institution for the illegal drug-smuggling activities of Panama's former leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, and as a vehicle for concealing and moving illegal cocaine profits for the Medellin drug cartel. **********But law-enforcement officials around the country have long said that an understanding of the bank's full range of activities has been elusive because top executives and records were abroad and unavailable. Some investigators, however, have said that B.C.C.I.'s influence may have been overstated. Foreign Policy Problem **********While it remains to be seen how much new light will be shed on one of the most intriguing and complex scandals of modern times, the settlement with Abu Dhabi at least resolves an awkward foreign policy problem for the United States Government. For more than two years, Federal and New York prosecutors have been investigating the head of a foreign government that has long been considered an American ally. **********B.C.C.I. was run by Pakistani managers, chartered in the banking havens of Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands, and had offices in 70 countries. It was shut down in July 1991 in a worldwide swoop by banking regulators. At the time, 77.4 percent of the bank was owned by Abu Dhabi, which also had sizable deposits in it. **********The Governor of the Bank of England, which led the enforcement action shutting the bank's doors, said one reason it was closed was that representatives of the majority shareholders were involved in the fraud. Facing the possibility of civil and criminal charges in the United States, Sheik Zayed had insisted that he had done nothing wrong and had been misled by the bank's executives. **********Liquidators have been unable to find much of the shadowy bank's assets, which were reported at $20 billion shortly before the shutdown. Investigators have characterized the scandal as perhaps the largest financial fraud in history. **********In addition to agreeing to surrender records and make available the former bank executives now under his control, Sheik Zayed, who is one of the wealthiest men in the world, will also give up claims arising from the case and make payments that total almost $500 million. **********Some of the money will go to an international fund to compensate the depositors of the bank who lost money and to pay for prosecutions in the United States, including the actions against Messrs. Clifford, Altman and Naqvi. As much as $50 million will also go to First American. **********The settlement has three significant financial elements: ***********Abu Dhabi agreed to forfeit $91 million that had been frozen in the United States when B.C.C.I. was closed. Half of that money will go to the fund for the worldwide victims of the bank and half will go into a fund to be used, at the discretion of the Attorney General, to pay for the costs of Federal prosecutions and investigations and other matters. ***********Another $220 million loan that Abu Dhabi had made to First American will be forgiven. The loan, which with interest is now worth $236 million, was made to avert a potential failure of First American. ***********The Abu Dhabi Government's 37 percent interest in First American, which is valued at about $170 million, will be taken by the Federal Reserve. It is from this money that the $50 million will be provided to First American in settlement of its lawsuit against Abu Dhabi. **********""The Abu Dhabi parties and the U.S. authorities have entered into an agreement to bring the true B.C.C.I. wrongdoers to justice and expedite compensation to innocent depositors of B.C.C.I.,"" said Middleton A. Martin, a Washington lawyer for the Sheik and other Abu Dhabi interests. ""The agreement shows my clients' confidence that the cooperation which will result will assist in identifying and bringing the wrongdoers to justice and will demonstrate, once and for all, that they were indeed the largest victim of the fraud perpetrated by the wrongdoers."" **********For more than 20 years, Mr. Naqvi had been the deputy to Aga Hasan Abedi, the top bank executive and founder of B.C.C.I. Mr. Abedi is said to be in ill health in Pakistan. American officials say they cannot extradite him. Both Mr. Naqvi and Mr. Abedi have been indicted by Federal and New York grand juries on charges of fraud, theft and money-laundering. In addition to bribing foreign officials and bankers, Mr. Naqvi has been indicted on charges of helping the Medellin cartel to launder millions of dollars in cocaine profits in the 1980's. Bribes Cited **********Federal and Manhattan prosecutors have said that regulators and central bankers in at least 10 nations have taken bribes from B.C.C.I. They identified the following nations as those where bribes were given: Pakistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Congo, Zambia, Argentina and Peru. **********Mr. Naqvi, 59, a native of Pakistan, is regarded as the central figure in the bank along with Mr. Abedi. He has been on trial in Abu Dhabi for his role in B.C.C.I. But Gerald M. Stern, the Justice Department's top negotiator during the settlement talks, said in an interview today that Mr. Naqvi would be returned to the United States within 120 days regardless of the outcome of the Abu Dhabi trial. **********The Justice Department did not disclose the identities of the 10 other former bank officials in Abu Dhabi who will be interviewed by American investigators. **********""This agreement is significant because we now have the No. 2 man that we have been seeking for many months and full access to all the files relating to B.C.C.I.,"" said Mr. Stern, the special counsel for Financial Institution Fraud at the Justice Department."

[ Transcript, page A8. ] **********As a token of renewal, Mr. Mandela promised that an amnesty would soon be announced for ""various categories"" of prisoners. **********He lavished praise on F. W. de Klerk, the President who collaborated with him in negotiating the end of white rule and who today took the oath as one of Mr. Mandela's two Vice Presidents in a unity Government. **********In a post-inaugural visit to the 50,000 ordinary citizens celebrating on the lawn far below the Government buildings, Mr. Mandela held Mr. de Klerk's hand aloft and hailed his predecessor as ""one of the greatest reformers, one of the greatest sons of our soil."" **********For the day, at least, blacks and whites were united by the mutual strain of taking in the recently unimaginable: **********There was Fidel Castro on his first visit to the country that tried to pulverize his army in Angola, the only one among the scores of dignitaries singled out by the crowd for lusty shouts of ""Viva!"" **********And Muslim and Hindu prayers broadcast into the air of what has been the most rigidly, officially Christian of capitals. **********And the Navy band in dress whites entertaining the inaugural dignitaries with a Zulu migrant labor song. **********And finally President Nelson Mandela, now Commander in Chief, reviewing the defense force that was built, in large part, to prevent someone like him from taking power. **********When nine Mirage jet fighters streaked overhead as part of an aerial salute, the citizens assembled on the grass sent up a roar, it seemed, out of a new feeling of custody rather than at the thrill of high-speed machinery. **********Mr. Mandela's ascent has been virtually inevitable, at least since last July when negotiators cinched the dates for the first elections open to all races. **********In the elections that finished on April 29, the African National Congress won more than 62 percent of the vote, earning 252 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly that elected Mr. Mandela on Monday without opposition. **********Mr. Mandela, whose Xhosa name, Rolihlahla, means ""someone who brings trouble on himself,"" knows well enough the difficulties he has taken on in maintaining the richest economy in Africa while satisfying the promises inherent in his triumph. **********Still, today was a last occasion to contemplate the distance the country has traversed before it looks ahead. **********Four years and three months ago -- just midway through the Bush Administration -- Nelson Mandela was serving a life sentence for trying to overthrow the Government. Today he heads it. **********He became President on a stage erected in the reddish sandstone crescent of the Government building that overlooks Pretoria and, beyond, the hulking monument to the great inland trek of the Afrikaner Voortrekkers. **********Mr. Mandela is a President who comes to power preceded by a myth, already embodied in liberation songs that swelled spontaneously in the waiting amphitheater: ""Nel-son Man-DEL-a! Nel-son Man-DEL-a!"" **********He arrived, an hour behind schedule, between two of his daughters, and listened to the swearing-in of his two Vice Presidents, Thabo Mbeki and Mr. de Klerk. **********When his own turn came, he eagerly began his oath before the Chief Justice prompted him. Salute by Guns and Aircraft **********After he spoke, the cannons thundered a 21-gun salute and buzzing formations of helicopters and aged warplanes passed overhead. **********The guests arrayed in the autumnal sun included 45 heads of state, plus an American delegation headed by Vice President Al Gore and including Hillary Rodham Clinton. Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II of England, attended, as did Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations. **********So did James Gregory. Mr. Gregory was Mr. Mandela's warden for two decades, first at the Robben Island Prison and later at Victor Verster Prison, and they became so close that after Mr. Mandela was released the jailer retired out of boredom.  ""Life had become empty for me,"" Mr. Gregory told a Johannesburg newspaper. Castro and Arafat Welcomed **********World figures long shunned here as Communists and sponsors of guerrilla insurgency, like Mr. Castro and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, arrived today to more enthusiastic welcomes than the Americans received. **********At an inaugural lunch in the residence called the Presidency, Mr. Mandela introduced the Cuban leader to Mr. de Klerk and then to the military chief of staff. **********""Welcome to South Africa,"" Mr. de Klerk said. **********""I hope you are successful,"" Mr. Castro replied. **********It was a day for conciliatory gestures. **********Joe Modise, a former guerrilla leader and now Mr. Mandela's Defense Minister-designate, noticed a delegation led by Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi, of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party, and the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelethini, languishing in the B-list seats and moved them to the front row. **********Someone likewise rescued Winnie Mandela, the estranged wife of the new President, and led her from her chair behind a low sandstone wall to the covered stage where family and invited guests were seated. A Victory in Soccer **********Tonight the new President dropped in at the packed soccer stadium where the South African national team defeated Zambia in an inaugural special. He frowned when the 60,000 spectators failed to raise their voices in the two anthems of the new South Africa -- the old Afrikaans poem, The Call of South Africa, and the liberation anthem, God Bless Africa. **********""You have to learn the words to both anthems,"" he scolded the crowd. ""If you don't know Afrikaans, you must learn it. If you don't know Zulu or Xhosa, you must learn those."" **********""It's nice that he came, but I think this is the last time we'll come together like this,"" said one fan, a resident of the Phola Park squatter camp who declined to give her name. Wrapped in a huge A.N.C. flag but already feeling the seep of disillusionment, she wondered, ""What are we going to do now? There's nothing to protest against."""

McEvoy, a vice president at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ""This probably makes the stock, which has been a miserable performer, a bit more interesting."" **********Rite Aid said it would sell its ADAP auto parts supply chain, its Encore book shops, Concord Custom Cleaners stores and Sera Tec Biologicals plasma-collecting centers.  Reserve Planned **********The company said it would establish a $25.6 million reserve to cover losses from selling the businesses. **********Martin Grass, Rite Aid's president and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview that the company expected to realize about $125 million in net proceeds from the sales. **********""These are businesses that were not that meaningful to our overall operation,"" Mr. Grass said. ""As they were starting to grow, they were going to require more and more capital. We want to keep our powder dry for other opportunities."" **********Rite Aid has owned some of the businesses as long as 20 years, and analysts said the step was overdue. **********""The divestiture of the non-drugstore assets removes a distraction,"" said Joseph Ronning, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. **********""It surprised me a bit they are getting out of Sera Tec, because the returns there were quite good. But over all, these businesses only accounted for 6 percent of sales last year, and 7 percent of earnings."" **********Based in Camp Hill, Pa., Rite Aid is the nation's largest drugstore chain in terms of number of stores -- it operates roughly 2,700 in 23 states east of the Mississippi -- and fourth largest in terms of sales. **********However, in recent years its fortunes have been flagging, as competition from aggressive retailers like Walgreen's has intensified. **********For the nine months ended Nov. 27, Rite Aid reported revenues of $3.18 billion, a 6.8 percent increase from a year earlier. However, net income slumped nearly 7 percent, to $80.7 million from $86.61 million, and Rite Aid's share price has fallen more than 25 percent in the last 12 months. **********In October, Rite Aid was one of 50 large companies listed as a laggard in terms of financial performance by the Council of Institutional Investors.  Dutch Auction Planned **********""The stock has been trading at a very low price for a very long time,"" Mr. Grass said, explaining the decision to buy back up to 22 million of its 88 million outstanding shares. ""We think the Dutch auction is the best vehicle to buy back the shares.""

Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, delivered a speech by satellite to the company's Asian offices recently, not once did he mention Japan, which accounts for half of the chemical giant's Asian sales. Mr. Woolard instead gushed on about new opportunities in China and elsewhere in the Far East, to the annoyance of company employees in Japan. **********More and more, American companies seem to be less mindful of Japan, lured instead by faster-growing, less-developed markets in China and elsewhere in Asia. Japan is perceived as an already mature market in which it is expensive to operate, with strong domestic competitors and numerous regulations and other barriers. **********""Certainly a lot of American businessmen come through here and tell me that in terms of opportunity costs, they are increasingly of the view that they better spend more time elsewhere in the Asian market,"" Walter F. Mondale, the United States Ambassador to Japan, said recently. **********The Austin Company, a construction concern based in Cleveland, recently closed its office here after more than 20 years, saying it perceived fewer opportunities in Japan. Only half a year earlier, the United States and Japan signed a trade agreement aimed at opening Japanese public works projects to foreign construction companies. **********Such loss of interest in Japanese markets is already forcing the Clinton Administration to shift its trade focus to other areas of Asia and to Latin America, and some experts say that the lack of interest is threatening to undermine Washington's will to press for new trade agreements with Japan. **********Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said the Administration's trade agenda for Japan ""remains very broad and very formidable."" But Japan, he added, is no longer the sole focus of attention. **********""It's clear also that the stakes elsewhere in Asia are growing,"" Mr. Garten said in an interview. ""We have to find a way to focus not only on Japan but particularly on big emerging markets in Asia."" **********The Commerce Department recently began trying to promote American exports to 10 such emerging markets, including China and Indonesia, but not Japan. **********Yet all this has happened as the rise of the yen and the deregulation starting to occur in Japan could give American and other foreign companies a better chance than ever to sell their products in the world's second-largest market. **********To be sure, many American companies are not forsaking Japan. Some prominent companies are making a greater effort than ever. **********Ford and Chrysler are experiencing rapid growth in Japanese sales after cutting prices and starting to make cars for Japan with the steering wheel on the right side. General Motors is also stepping up its effort to sell cars and parts. **********Compaq and Dell, two American personal computer makers, have surged into the Japanese market by offering lower prices than local competitors like NEC or Fujitsu. Semiconductor companies have seen their market share grow. And companies like Toys ""R"" Us, Lands' End and L.L. Bean are making Japanese consumers more receptive to new forms of retailing, like mail-order and giant discount stores. **********Many American automotive and electronics executives say that being able to compete in Japan, the world's most demanding market, is essential to global competitiveness. They say they must compete in Japan to deny Japanese companies a monopoly in their home market, which can produce profits to finance expansion abroad. **********Some industry executives say it is only natural to pay attention to the fast-growing markets in China and Southeast Asia, but that it does not diminish their interest in Japan. **********""If you have another child, is the first child less important?"" said R.K. Morris, senior policy director for international trade at the National Association of Manufacturers, the Washington trade group. **********But financial and political resources are limited, so efforts in other markets can mean diminished efforts in Japan. **********The Nynex Corporation, the New York-based telecommunications company, has put on hold its plans to provide advanced cable television services in Japan. The Nynex executive stationed in Tokyo has moved to Hong Kong with broader responsibilities. **********Some financial services companies like CS First Boston, Merrill Lynch and the Bank of America have also moved their Asian headquarters from Tokyo to Hong Kong, which is next door to China. **********A. T. Kearney International, a consulting firm, recently conducted a survey, as yet unreleased, on the investment intentions of 130 big American and European companies that operate in Japan. **********""Their management's focus has radically shifted away from Japan and toward China,"" said Joseph L. Raudabaugh, head of the Japan office of Kearney. **********These are among the other indicators of a declining interest in Japan, prompted in part by the yen's rise against the dollar: ***********American direct investment in Japan, in which an American company buys a Japanese company or builds a factory or sales operation here, is down. In the last fiscal year ended in March, there were 317 cases of American direct investment totaling $930 million, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. That was down from 363 cases worth $1.3 billion a year earlier and only about half the 727 cases in the year ended March 1990, when American direct investment totaled $1.6 billion. ***********The number of American electronics companies setting up in Japan declined from a peak of 48 in 1991 to 25 in 1993, according to the American Electronics Association. ***********Some American business publications are cutting back in Japan. Fortune magazine cut back its Tokyo bureau this year. Forbes, which had two reporters here in 1992, has moved one slot to Hong Kong. ***********The number of American companies listing their stock on the Tokyo Stock exchange has declined to 49 from a peak of 72 in 1990. Many companies that delisted, however, continue to do business in Japan. **********The number of Americans in Japan also appears to be declining. Fewer Americans here does not necessarily mean that American companies are losing interest. In some cases, the high yen has made it expensive to station Americans here, so companies are replacing them with Japanese executives. And some companies like the International Business Machines Corporation, Eastman Kodak and Digital Equipment have reduced their Japanese work forces because of overall business problems. **********The construction industry is one in which companies have abandoned Japan. Morrison Knudsen and Guy F. Atkinson are two American construction companies that have not renewed their licenses here. **********""A lot of companies found it to be a harder slog than they anticipated,"" said John Dickison, general manager of Japan operations for Schal Bovis Inc., a Chicago-based construction management company that is staying in Japan. **********Not all American companies are rushing to China and Southeast Asia. Those markets, while seemingly offering greener pastures, have their own regulations and other problems. Du Pont, for example, has found that more than 30 Chinese companies have copied agricultural chemicals it is trying to sell there."

He suggested that this amount would be too small to stop Cubans from setting out in rafts for Florida. **********The negotiator, Ricardo Alarcon, said in an interview that his Government would like the United States to admit for a specific time, perhaps a year, all Cubans who have expressed interest in moving to the United States. **********One way to measure this, he said, was the number of Cubans -- 134,000 -- who applied for travel visas to the United States last year. **********According to Mr. Alarcon, letting in so many people would defuse the pent-up pressures for illegal immigration by boat people. Conflict Over Numbers **********During talks in New York on Thursday and Friday, the Administration presented an offer that would vastly expand the number of Cubans granted entry rights each year -- to at least 20,000 -- if Fidel Castro promised to halt the flood of boat people. Over the last 12 months, the United States granted visas to 2,700 Cubans, making Havana complain that this was far below the ceiling of 27,845 visas allowed under American law. **********United States and Cuban officials said the Cuban delegation has not made a formal response to the 20,000 figure, suggesting that the talks could continue for several days. **********In the interview yesterday at the Cuban Mission to the United Nations, Mr. Alarcon acknowledged that he had not put forward a specific number of how many Cubans Havana wants the United States to allow in each year. **********The talks are schedule to resume today at the United States Mission to the United Nations. **********Mr. Alarcon declined to predict when the talks would end, reiterating that they should address Washington's three-decade-old embargo against Cuba. 'I cannot be optimistic' **********""I cannot be optimistic,"" he said. ""To find a real solution you have to deal with the causes of the emigration and that remains the economic embargo. The other side has refused to talk about the embargo."" **********Nonetheless, Mr. Alarcon, a 55-year-old former Foreign Minister who is president of Cuba's National Assembly, did not rule out an agreement that did not address the embargo. **********""I'd be prepared to accept something on immigration matters even if the economic embargo stays in place -- if the other side shows flexibility on immigration matters,"" he said. **********Mr. Alarcon said Cuba was eager to see legal immigration increased because Havana was convinced this would reduce the pressures behind the exodus, which he said was a destabilizing force for Cuba. As of 9 P.M. yesterday, the Coast Guard had picked up 850 more refugees in the waters between Cuba and Florida. A Veiled Warning **********Mr. Alarcon is widely considered to be one of Cuba's shrewdest politicians and diplomats, and it is hard to tell whether the position he staked out today was a steadfast bargaining position or posturing aimed at exacting more concessions from Washington. **********In what appeared to be a veiled warning, Mr. Alarcon said Washington should not expect any slackening soon in the flow of refugees. He said that after three decades of granting entry to all Cubans, President Clinton's decision to keep boat people at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station would not in a matter of one or two weeks dissuade Cubans from heading to Florida by raft. **********It was to be expected, he said, that many Cuban refugees remain convinced that their relatives in Florida would pull strings to get them into the United States. **********Mr. Alarcon said Mr. Castro's decision to let Cubans emigrate freely was a response to a series of boat hijackings. Those hijackings, he said, were fueled by Washington's longtime policy of not prosecuting Cubans who head to Florida after using violence to steal boats. **********'It's not a matter of 'Castro' putting a halt to the exodus,"" he said, using his hands to make quotation marks.  ""It's a matter for both sides to accept their responsibilities."" Strangling Cuba's Economy **********Repeatedly during the hourlong interview, Mr. Alarcon returned to the embargo and his assertions that it was strangling Cuba's economy and pressuring people to flee. **********He argued that it was unwise for Mr. Clinton to maintain the embargo because Cuba is opening its economy to investors worldwide and United States businesses are missing out. **********""Cuba is not as big as China in terms of market or territory, but it is a potential market of a few billion dollars that is right across the street,"" he said. **********Mr. Alarcon insisted that Cuba is embracing economic reforms, but he said that the embargo, combined with the collapse of trade relations with the former Soviet bloc, has created such hard times that it is undermining the Government's ability to experiment. **********""The main obstacle to the reform process is the United States embargo,"" he said. ""Those who want us to change are doing their utmost to make it impossible."" **********Mr. Alarcon seemed to enjoy tweaking the United States as he puffed on his thick, six-inch cigar. He chided the Administration for its temerity in pressing his Government to halt the exodus. That meant, he said, Washington was urging Havana to violate his people's right to travel -- although he failed to mention that Mr. Castro has for years stopped Cubans from setting to sea. **********Mr. Alarcon scoffed at the belief, espoused by many Administration officials and Cuban-American leaders, that Mr. Castro's Government is on its last legs. Such an attitude, he said, was pushing President Clinton to foolishly embrace tougher sanctions that increase the pain for the average Cuban, even as Mr. Castro remains firmly in power. **********""If I were an adviser to the North American Government, I'd remind them that there are people in Florida who have forecast for 35 years the end of the Castro regime,"" he said. Then, in an allusion to the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, he added, ""United States policy against Cuba has had some well-known failures because of such inaccurate perceptions."" **********""We have severe difficulties, serious problems, but it would be dead wrong to assume that the country is blowing apart,"" he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/07/world/arab-car-bomber-kills-8-in-israel-44-are-wounded.html,Clyde Haberman,1994-04-07,,1497,,The New York Times,World,News,article,44 ARE WOUNDED,ARAB CAR BOMBER KILLS 8 IN ISRAEL; 44 ARE WOUNDED," **********In the most serious terrorist attack inside Israel since 1989, 8 people were killed and 44 others wounded today when a Palestinian suicide bomber blew up his car beside a bus in this northern Israeli town. **********The explosion turned the bus into a storm of flying metal and flames, slashing some victims to pieces and horribly burning others. **********Many, including several who died, were Israeli teen-agers preparing to board the bus, which had stopped near two schools where classes were letting out. ""Two boys were burning like torches,"" said Albert Amos, a driving instructor, who told of how he had ripped flaming clothes from one of the youngsters. Both boys survived. **********The attack was the work of a young West Bank man loyal to the militant Islamic Hamas group, and Hamas took responsibility for the attack over mosque loudspeakers in the Gaza Strip. **********Underscoring the indiscriminate nature of the attack was the fact that some of the victims were Israeli Arabs, including a 30-year-old woman who was killed. **********[ A Palestinian shot and wounded at least two Israelis at a bus stop in the southern Israel port of Ashod early Thursday before he was shot dead bya bystander, said The Associated Press in Jerusalem, attributing its report to Israel Radio. ] **********The car bombing enraged Israelis but did not completely surprise them. Since the massacre on Feb. 25 in Hebron, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in which a Jewish settler killed at least 29 Muslim worshipers, most people in this country had suspected that it was a question of time before a Palestinian group staged a reprisal. **********And today was a day laden with symbolism: for Palestinians, the end of 40 days of Muslim mourning for the Hebron victims; for Israelis, the start tonight of an annual 24 hours commemorating the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. **********At a ceremony tonight at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin did not mention the Afula bombing. But President Ezer Weizman did, saying that as the day of remembrance approached, ""we paid a heavy price because we are Jews, for our desire to live peaceful and independent lives in the Land of Israel."" **********Government officials said they would not let the attack deter them from peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, even though opposition leaders and many Afula residents demanded that the talks be halted, just as the P.L.O. had suspended them for five weeks after the Hebron massacre. **********""Why do they not stop the talks?"" said Ahuva David, who works in a real-estate office 30 yards from where the bombing occurred. **********Scores of people in Afula, a working-class town of about 33,000 that lies in Israel six miles from the northern border of the West Bank, took to the streets tonight to denounce the Government. Some chanted ""Death to Arabs!"" -- a cry echoed in other protests in the country. But while the Israeli police protectively stepped up patrols in Arab villages near Afula, no revenge attacks by Jews were reported tonight. Israeli Shift Unlikely **********Right after the mass killings in Hebron, Mr. Rabin had urged the P.L.O. to continue negotiations despite widespread Palestinian fury. He argued that his Government had not let anti-Israel terrorism deflect it from its course. So it seemed unlikely that he would now shift gears. **********""If the peace process is stopped, we are placing our fate in the hands of these suicide bombers, and that is their wish,"" said Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, who has been active in the negotiations. **********Those talks, which were supposed to have moved ahead full steam after their resumption in Cairo a few days ago, have still not produced a breakthrough on security and other arrangements that would lead an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho and the start of Palestinian self-rule there. **********If anything, Palestinian negotiators expressed considerable irritation that their Israeli counterparts had returned home today for the Holocaust commemoration, saying they would be back in Cairo on Sunday, after the Jewish Sabbath. **********Although the negotiations seemed likely to stay on track, some Israeli officials demanded that Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, condemn the Afula attack, as Mr. Rabin had uncompromisingly denounced the Hebron massacre and declared the killer, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, to be alien to Israel and to Judaism. The United States, through the State Department spokesman, similarly urged Mr. Arafat to condemn the car bombing. **********But when asked about the events today during a news conference in Cairo, the P.L.O. leader walked away without a comment. Some other Palestinians spoke out, though. **********Diab al-Loh, a senior official of Mr. Arafat's Fatah faction in Gaza said: ""We condemn any attack against innocent people. As a Palestinian, I am personally in pain for what happened in Afula, as I am about what happened in Jabaliya and Hebron."" The Jabaliya reference was to the killing of six Fatah members by Israeli soldiers last week in that Gaza refugee camp. **********The death toll in Afula -- which may climb because some of the wounded were severely burned -- was the highest for a single terrorist act inside Israel since 15 people were killed in 1989 when a Palestinian grabbed the wheel of a bus and plunged it into a ravine near Jerusalem. **********The car bombing was not the only attack on Israelis today. Palestinians wounded six soldiers -- none seriously, according to reports -- by throwing grenades at a foot patrol outside the Shati refugee camp in Gaza. A Boycott by P.L.O. **********Today the P.L.O. in Gaza was supposed to take possession of a police barracks that the Israelis had vacated. But its local officials left Israeli commanders standing at a small ceremony scheduled to mark the transfer, boycotting it as a protest against the lack of a firm date for Israel's full withdrawal. **********Senior police officials said the bombing seemed to have been carried out by one man, identified as Raed Mohammed Zakarieh, 19, who lived in the West Bank village of Qabatiya, 14 miles south of Afula. Palestinians in that area said Mr. Zakarieh had been jailed for two months in 1992 and was wanted by the authorities again for being a Hamas member. **********Hamas, which opposes peace talks with Israel, had repeatedly threatened reprisals for the Hebron massacre and warned in a call today to a news organization in Jerusalem that more attacks would follow. **********Accounts by witnesses varied, but most said the killer had pulled up to the bus as it picked up passengers at a crowded stop. Moments after he parked 9 or 10 feet in front of the bus, the explosion occurred, they said. Horrors on a Video **********What followed was sheer terror. A man with a video camera who had arrived quickly at the scene recorded survivors with skin blackened and clothes blown off. One man was decapitated by flying debris. Other victims had legs severed. The video also showed a smoldering, mangled body that may have been that of the bomber, who was among the eight killed. **********""People were screaming and holding their heads, they were so scared,"" said Ronen Noga, a businessman who ran out of his nearby store as soon as he heard the blast. ""They jumped out of the bus, many with their clothes burning. Those who could even jumped out of the windows."" **********Shai Buzali, 23, a kibbutz worker who finished his army service last month, was reading a newspaper at the bus stop when suddenly he ""heard a boom and saw rolling fire."" Mr. Buzali was taken to Haemek Hospital in Afula with cuts and burns on both hands, which he had raised instinctively to cover his face. 'These Are Crazies' **********Two beds away from him in the hospital lay Hassan Nijin, 60, an Arab citizen of Israel from Nazareth who traveled six miles a day to work in Afula. He could not talk. His face was blackened and his burned hands were wrapped in bandages. His son, Amin, sat beside the bed. **********""These people don't want peace,"" Amin Nijin said of Hamas. ""These are crazies, that's all I can say."" **********By late tonight, hospital officials said they had identified only four of the eight who were killed. Two were teen-age passengers, one was the bus driver, and the fourth was an Arab woman who lived north of town. The others were said to be three woman and a man presumed to be the killer. **********On the streets of Afula, some residents said they were convinced that the horror today would not be the last. ""One will follow like the other,"" said Shmulik Aloush, a supermarket owner. ""This won't stop. Tomorrow there will be something else."""

M. Keehner, former head of its brokerage unit, had left to start his own business venture. **********The departure of Mr. Keehner, 50, was not a complete surprise. As part of a reshuffling less than a month ago by John F.

Some Clinton advisers feared the President could be embarrassed politically for visiting a nation that is on the Administration's list of countries that sponsor terrorism. **********The centerpiece of the trip, which is shaping up as the most extensive presidential trip to the region since President Nixon visited 20 years ago, is the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan on their southern border on Wednesday. **********Mr. Clinton, who will depart on the four-day trip next Tuesday, will also address the Israeli and Jordanian parliaments and visit American troops in Kuwait. **********He will also travel to Saudi Arabia to see King Fahd and visit Cairo, where he will meet with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt as well as Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The President's aides say that visiting Damascus is a political gamble worth taking because they are confident that in a face-to-face meeting, Mr. Clinton can persuade President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to take some new steps toward compromise that would hasten a peace treaty with Israel. **********The President also said he would talk with the Syrian leader about the importance of combating terrorism. **********""I will visit Syria,"" Mr. Clinton said today, ""because it is my judgment that the visit will further the goal of an ultimate peace agreement between Israel and Syria. And until that is done, we will never have comprehensive peace in the Middle East."" **********But the President's advisers admit the decision holds risks. Some Jewish groups have opposed such a visit unless Mr. Assad in return makes some highly visible, major steps toward peace with Israel, like announcing that he will meet with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. **********Since January, peace efforts between Israel and Syria have inched forward, with Secretary of State Warren Christopher visiting the region five times since May to mediate between the two countries. **********Administration officials say they hope for a major breakthrough in the peace talks in the next three or four months. The rough outline of an agreement is well-known: Israel would withdraw from the Golan Heights and in return Syria would normalize relations with its longtime enemy. **********The points of disagreement are how quickly and extensively any Israeli withdrawal would be, and how quickly and completely Syria would recognize Israel and accept steps to meet its security concerns. **********With Washington and Jerusalem urging Mr. Assad to engage in more public diplomacy to show he is serious about peace, senior Administration officials say they hope the Syrian leader will use the President's visit to make some tough public statements against terrorism. **********They also voiced confidence that Mr. Assad would go further than before in his public remarks favoring peace. In addition, several officials said they expected Mr. Assad to show increased flexibility behind the scenes to help narrow his negotiating differences with Israel. **********""This meeting was agreed to on one basis: substantive moves forward in the peace process,"" said one Administration official. ""You won't see developments on the private negotiating track for a while, but we expect him to be more forthcoming on the public side."" **********The official continued, ""Assad knows what we need out of this and what he needs out of this. He's not going to embarrass the President. "" **********President Clinton decided to visit Damascus after a long debate in which his advisers painstakingly listed the many pros and cons, Administration officials said. Some advisers said they feared that Mr. Assad would feel slighted if Mr. Clinton bypassed Syria. Such a slight could be a step backward in the Syria-Israeli peace talks, they said. **********On the other hand, the President's aides expressed concern about safety in Damascus, especially after the recent wave of terrorism. They also worried that unless the Syria visit produces some tangible steps toward peace, the President could lose face among Israelis. **********Some Administration officials noted that President Bush had a meeting with Mr. Assad and that Mr. Clinton met with the Syrian leader last January in Geneva. In an important step forward in the peace process, Mr. Assad announced in Geneva that he had made a strategic choice for peace with Israel. **********In 1974, Mr. Nixon met with President Assad in Damascus and the United States and Syria re-established diplomatic relations, which were broken off in 1967. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter visited Israel and Egypt in a diplomatic effort that helped seal a peace treaty between the two countries. **********""Going there at this time will give the negotiations a push, at a time the negotiations have slowed because of the complexity of the issues,"" said a senior Administration official. ""It's an investment by President Clinton to produce a result a little down the road, rather than a dramatic breakthrough now."" **********President Clinton indicated that he would discuss terrorism with Mr. Assad. ""It is a serious issue,"" Mr. Clinton said today. ""It has been constantly discussed between us, and it will continue to be."" **********American officials have told Mr. Assad that if he wants Syria to be taken off the Administration's list of nations that sponsor terrorism, he needs to do more to crack down on Party of God guerrillas in southern Lebanon. In the Administration's view, Iran is the chief sponsor of the militant Shiite Muslims, but Syria can do more to stifle their operations. **********The Party of God has fired three waves of rockets from Southern Lebanon over the past two days, and Administration officials said today that they expect Mr. Assad to stop such attacks. **********White House officials said that in his meeting with Mr. Arafat, President Clinton will discuss a wide range of topics, including financial assistance, the fight against terrorism and the P.L.O.'s peace talks with Israel. **********At his news conference, President Clinton said he had ordered Federal agencies to redouble their efforts to stop any Americans from sending money overseas that could be used for terrorism by Hamas, the militant Muslim organization that claimed responsibility for the Tel Aviv bombing. **********An Administration official said today that officials at the National Security Council in recent days discussed whether there were any American links to Hamas and informally asked law enforcement agencies to keep alert for such possibilities. The word has now filtered down to officials at Justice, the F.B.I. and other agencies. **********On other subjects, Mr. Clinton said he would keep his promise to Congress and ask the United Nations Security Council to adopt a resolution to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia. He said, if that fails, he would consult with Congress about lifting the embargo unilaterally. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton said that for more than two years he has believed that a unilateral lifting would be a mistake because it would lead to the withdrawal of United Nations troops from Bosnia and would hurt Washington's ability to work with its allies to end the war there. **********Mr. Clinton also defended the accord signed today with North Korea in which it vowed to freeze its nuclear program in return for having the United States and other nations build it modern nuclear reactors. **********He acknowledged that some people are upset by the decision to delay inspections of waste sites believed to hold evidence showing that North Korea has diverted fissile material to make nuclear weapons. **********But Mr. Clinton said the important thing was ""the waste sites are not going anywhere"" and ""we have a commitment for a freeze and then a dismantling"" of North Korea's nuclear installations."

Noticeably absent in the article  was mention of the excellent credit insurance program of credit unions. **********The Consumer Federation of America, while negative about credit insurance generally, praises credit insurance marketed through credit unions. It urges consumers to ""consider purchasing credit life insurance only from credit unions, which have high payout ratios."" **********We're proud that credit unions, which belong to their members, are strongly consumer oriented. Not only do credit unions have very high credit insurance payout ratios but, in some cases, a credit union will pay the premium for coverage on the borrower since credit insurance provides protection for both the lender and the borrower. Clearly, there can be no better deal for the consumer. **********Credit insurance purchased as part of a credit union loan can be a good consumer value, particularly if the borrower has little or no life insurance. Credit insurance is easily available as part of the lending process to those who are not eligible for or can't gain access to the more traditional coverages.

Although slight differences remain over the basis for formal peace talks, it appears that they might begin early next year under the auspices of the five nations known as the contact group. **********But the durability of the cease-fire, the latest of more than 30 announced since the war began in 1992, and the eventual success of peace talks, remained open to question because, despite the agreement, none of the deep differences between Muslims and Serbs that caused the war have been resolved. **********These differences center on whether Bosnia should remain a single state or be dismembered, and what territory each side should get. **********After three days of hectic shuttle diplomacy between Sarajevo and the nearby Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale (pronounced PAH-leh), Mr. Carter read a statement today that said there was an accord on the ""implementation of a nationwide cease-fire within 72 hours, including monitoring by United Nations forces along all lines of confrontation."" **********He added that negotiations would begin on the same day, Friday, to build the cease-fire into a ""total cessation of hostilities"" that would last for four months ""or for a longer period if mutually agreed by both parties."" The preliminary negotiations are due to end by Jan. 1. **********""We have an agreement from both parties on a four-month cease-fire,"" he said. **********Asked in an interview with CNN whether the agreement constituted a breakthrough, Ejup Ganic, the Vice President of the Muslim-Croat federation, said: ""Unfortunately not.  We might have a cease-fire in 72 hours. But I still worry, because President Carter signed some papers with Karadzic, and we don't know what is in those papers. So, we have to wait and see. We hope for a cease-fire, but from our experience we have to be careful."" **********Mr. Ganic was referring to Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. **********The essential difference between a cease-fire and a cessation of hostilities is that troops would pull back some distance from the current front lines and allow the interposing of United Nations troops where necessary. How this is to be done will be discussed by generals from the rival armies between Friday and Jan. 1. **********The United Nations has long been convinced that only such a cessation of hostilities would provide a chance of stopping the fighting for longer than the many past cease-fires that have quickly frayed and collapsed. **********Mr. Carter said the cease-fire included the western Muslim enclave of Bihac, which has been under attack by the Serbs for more than a month. He added that the Serbs had promised to exercise restraint until Friday. **********The former American President was able to break a long deadlock in Bosnia by going directly to the Bosnian Serbs, expressing some sympathy for their position and offering considerable flexibility in future negotiations on the peace plan they rejected last July. **********This plan offers 51 percent of Bosnia to a Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs, who would have to give up about a third of the territory they now hold. **********Because Mr. Carter was not formally representing the American Government, he had more freedom to hand out blandishments and pose for the cameras with Dr. Karadzic. His visit was clearly closely coordinated with the Clinton Administration, whose overriding aim at this point is to get the warring parties into serious peace negotiations. **********Mr. Carter almost succeeded in securing a guarantee that these talks would begin. However, a slight but telling difference persisted over the phrasing describing the role of the contact group plan in negotiations. The group consists of representatives of the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. **********The Bosnian Serbs said they would negotiate a comprehensive peace agreement ""with the proposal of the contact group as the basis for negotiation of all points."" The Bosnian Government insisted on a negotiation ""with acceptance of the proposal of the contact group as a starting point."" **********Mr. Carter said he could not detect any difference between the wordings and dismissed the disagreement as ""semantics."" **********Behind the dispute lurked the fact that the Bosnian Government wants to stay as close as possible to the current contact group map, while the Bosnian Serbs want to move a long way away from it. Thus the Bosnian Government wants formal acceptance of the map as a starting point, while the Bosnian Serbs do not want any reference to ""acceptance."" **********Mr. Ganic said, ""Mr. Karadzic wants to start with the peace plan and then destroy it, while we want to build on it."" **********In an interview, Dr. Karadzic made clear that he wants to hold onto several towns, including Brcko, Jajce, Sanski Most and Doboj, that he was to hand over under the contact group plan. He also wants the Posavina area and the eastern Muslim enclaves of Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica. **********Such changes would transform the current map. Dr. Karadzic argued in the interview that this was only fair in that the Serbs were currently being offered just 30 percent of Bosnia's resources and should receive 50 percent. **********""We are prepared to make big sacrifices over Sarajevo for these towns,"" Dr. Karadzic said, suggesting that the Bosnian Government be given most of the city and the Serbs be allowed to build a separate Sarajevo using the southern and western suburbs as a base. **********Thus, in effect, if a negotiation does begin, it is likely to quickly become enmeshed in the deep territorial disputes that have dogged and ultimately defeated all former talks. **********Behind the differences over territory there has always stood and still stands the fact that the Bosnian Serbs ultimately want to secede from Bosnia and so want a body of territory that would enable them to do so. **********Their argument is that they never wanted to leave Yugoslavia and become a minority under a Muslim-led government. They have pursued it with an often devastating brutality against hundreds of thousands of Muslim civilians. **********Mr. Carter said that during the envisaged period of the cessation of hostilities, the security of Sarajevo airport would not be threatened and there would be free movement for all United Nations aid convoys. The airport has often been closed by Serbian threats in the last year, and convoys have often been blocked by the Serbs. **********The former President added that human rights would be respected and all people would be free to live where they like. Until the war ends, however, and probably for some time after that, it is extremely unlikely that any Muslim would want to venture back to Serbian-held territory or any Serbs would return to homes they abandoned or were chased from in Government-controlled central Bosnia. **********An ""early exchange"" of prisoners is also envisaged in the agreement announced today. Their number is not known because many prisons have remained inaccessible. **********Under the agreement, Bosnian forces are to withdraw from Mount Igman, a supposedly demilitarized zone southwest of the city that they have used to mount attacks on the Serbs. The United Nations has undertaken to insure that the crucial road running over the mountain and connecting Sarajevo with the Croatian coast will be kept open and secure."

Ethernet is the dominant technology for moving data on computer networks but is limited by its ""party line"" approach to sharing a network; adding a switch to the system, however, lets more users send data transmissions without conflict, much the way telephone systems work. **********Cisco's shares gained 37.5 cents today, closing at $27.625, in Nasdaq trading. **********But a big beneficiary of the deal was the Chipcom Corporation, a competitor of Kalpana. Its shares jumped $4.125, closing at $55.875 in Nasdaq trading. Analysts said the proposed acquisition of Kalpana by I.B.M. had posed a threat to Chipcom because I.B.M. distributes Chipcom's products, accounting for about 40 percent of its sales. **********Today, I.B.M. and Chipcom said they had entered into a service support agreement under which I.B.M. would service Chipcom products. **********Although Cisco makes some Ethernet switches, they are expensive and have not captured a large share of the market. Kalpana's switches, which sell for $500 to $1,000, had more than 50 percent of the market in 1993 and have been estimated to retain about a 40 percent market share this year. **********""Ethernet switching is the sexiest segment of the networking market today,"" said Glenn Gabriel Ben-Yosef, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston. Though its technology is not the most advanced, ""from the standpoint of perception, distribution channel and market share, Kalpana is the leader,"" he said. The Yankee Group estimates that the market for Ethernet switches will grow from $100 million this year to about $1 billion in 1997. **********Ethernet switching appeals to major corporations because it is an inexpensive, easy way to improve network performance without changing hardware or software. **********The acquisition ""reflects our recognition of the very rapid growth in this sector,"" Ed Kozel, Cisco's vice president for business development, said in a telephone interview. ""The key thing here is that Kalpana has products and channels that are highly complementary to ours."" **********Mr. Kozel declined to comment on I.B.M.'s interest in acquiring Kalpana but said that he hoped an existing product development agreement between the two companies would go forward. **********Cisco said it currently planned to retain Kalpana's 150 employees and its base in Sunnyvale, Calif. Kalpana told analysts today it would have 1994 revenues of $35 million to $40 million. Cisco, which had fiscal 1994 revenues of $1.2 billion, is based in San Jose, Calif. **********Paul Johnson, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Company, said the deal appeared to be primarily defensive, and would have only a minor impact on Cisco's revenues. ""I sense Cisco is buying it to preempt I.B.M.,"" he said. ""It's not that key a technology"" for Cisco."

Tries Again","Chastened, T.W.A. Tries Again"," **********When Trans World Airlines emerged from bankruptcy last fall, it gave travelers free tickets and held ""spirit day"" rallies for employees around the country. The celebrations, it seems, were premature. **********The airline emerged with a business plan built largely on hope. It called for revenues to rise 70 percent, to $5.7 billion, in 1997. Now, just one year out of bankruptcy, the airline says that revenues will be closer to $4 billion, which is almost $1 billion more than it made in 1993. **********Now that T.W.A. is again talking about a possible bankruptcy, many creditors point to that overly optimistic plan and to several management missteps. The airline says that if it cannot renegotiate $800 million of debt with its creditors soon, it will run out of cash by January. **********T.W.A.'s fate is now in the hands of creditors, including its former chairman, Carl C. Icahn, to whom the airline must pay $190 million in January. Many debt holders said this week that negotiations with the company were going well or predictably, but would not elaborate. Mr. Icahn declined to comment. **********But an overarching question remains: Why was T.W.A. not fixed during its 19-month bankruptcy? **********The broad answer, many current and former employees agree, is that T.W.A. continues to suffer from a number of bad decisions -- or indecision -- by its owners. Management shuffles have resulted in fitful changes in strategy. And the airline is slow to replace aging aircraft, a reluctance that dates to T.W.A.'s former owner, Howard Hughes. **********""The company's business plan was overly aggressive, and management, for whatever reasons, was not functioning properly,"" said Robert A. Peiser, T.W.A.'s chief financial officer. He is among several top executives who joined the company this year, and who have worked to forge a new plan. **********T.W.A.'s managers have lowered the airline's costs somewhat with the help of unions representing the airline's pilots, flight attendants and machinists. They quickly put together new contracts this fall that threw out many outdated work rules. **********Among other things, this week T.W.A. acquired computer software to help set ticket prices to better match demand. Other airlines have been using such software for years. **********William F. Compton, chairman of the pilots' union, who has spent years finding silver linings in T.W.A.'s clouds, said that the airline's past troubles had laid the groundwork for a rapid turnaround. **********""One of the bright spots is that you had so much wrong,"" he said. **********And much remains wrong. The airline is weighed down by debt of $1.8 billion, prompting it to ask creditors to exchange $294 million in debt for new stock, as well as to swap $557 million in secured and unsecured notes for new debt and stock. **********The average age of T.W.A.'s fleet, 19.2 years, is the highest of the major carriers; consequently, its planes require more maintenance and burn more fuel than others'. Its cash cushion was a paltry $114.1 million at the end of the third quarter. **********Its stock, which closed unchanged yesterday at $1.875, has lost more than two-thirds of its value since it began trading last year on the American Stock Exchange. **********The airline itself has suffered a similarly steep decline since the days when it and Pan American World Airways ruled the North Atlantic routes. But when Mr. Icahn took the company private in 1988, he decided, like Mr. Hughes, against buying new airplanes. And to help pay off the airline's debt, the airline sold some routes, including its valuable J.F.K.-Heathrow routes. **********Once in bankruptcy court, T.W.A.'s best interests were also placed below those of its creditors, several former and current employees said. Mr. Icahn simply wanted out of his airline. So the creditors were left to fashion a restructuring plan. Without the usual checks and balances, they sought to protect themselves against potential future losses with secured debt as they gave the airline another chance, albeit a slim one, to make money. **********Some creditors said they knew the plan was unlikely to work, but there was no time or energy left for another round of talks with the various constituents, including the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. **********""Nobody really had the stomach to go out and do the things they had to do,"" such as wring more concessions from each party, said a creditor who declined to be identified. **********T.W.A.'s plan called for revenues to rise 70 percent, to $5.7 billion in 1997 from $3.37 billion in 1993. Now, they are expected to rise 28 percent, to $4.04 billion in 1997 from actual 1993 revenues of $3.158 billion. **********T.W.A. was making strides in 1993 when it introduced Comfort Class, its name for economy class after it removed 8 percent of the seats to provide more legroom. It helped T.W.A. win a J. D. Power award for the best long-haul service. **********The airline's management believed that the extra leg room would help attract business travelers, and there were early signs that the plan was working. **********Then, in July 1993, the airline hired William R. Howard, who had retired as chief executive of Piedmont Airlines in 1987, to be chairman of the reorganized T.W.A. **********But Mr. Howard, who was then 71, never seemed fully engaged in his new job, former and current employees said, recalling that he would sometimes doze off in meetings and would occasionally call company officers by the wrong name. At a news conference about T.W.A.'s emergence from bankruptcy, Mr. Howard once called the carrier ""Piedmont."" **********Of greatest concern to employees, however, was his apparent skepticism about Comfort Class. He also decided that T.W.A. should expand its historically unprofitable flights to Europe, rather than cut back, reversing an earlier decision by other T.W.A. managers. He asked managers to defend their positions and brought in his own consultant to evaluate their presentations. That diverted energy from other issues and led to periods of indecision. **********""There was no room for error, and a lot of errors were made,"" a former manager said. **********In January, Mr. Howard resigned and received a $992,875 severance check, according to the company's most recent registration statement. Mr. Howard, reached this week at his home in Wilmington, N.C., declined to comment. **********The new management, led by Jeffrey H. Erickson, the chief executive, who is a former chief executive of Reno Air, decided to modify Comfort Class by adding back seats, yet leaving enough legroom to distinguish T.W.A. from its competitors. **********The airline said it needed the revenue it otherwise lost on heavy travel days like Friday when it could sell more seats. And while many travelers said they liked Comfort Class, it did not attract many new customers, the airline said. **********T.W.A. is trying to cut its cost to fly one seat one mile by 9 percent next year to 7.5 cents from 8.2 cents now. At Southwest Airlines, the only consistently profitable major carrier, a seat-mile costs about 7.5 cents. **********Many industry experts, of course, are skeptical about T.W.A.'s prospects. But Paul Karos, an airline analyst for First Boston who has predicted in recent winters that the airline might not make it, said he was no longer surprised by T.W.A.'s resilience. **********""When they are down, they somehow pull it out,"" he said. **********""I've been amazed."""

The reasons for this are the high average age of cars and trucks on the road, as well as increases in employment, personal income and consumer confidence. **********The gains have led some analysts to predict that there may soon be shortages of certain models. The strong demand has also resulted in smaller discounts and lower rebates, enhancing dealers' profits. 'Can't Get Enough' **********""The biggest problem is not the economy or the environment,"" said Roger Williams, president of Jack Williams Automall in Fort Worth. ""It's that we can't get enough Chevrolet trucks and Jeep Cherokees to sell."" **********Mr. Williams said the demand had pushed up the price of used cars, and he expected his inventory of new vehicles to remain slim until at least March. **********Al Rivera, a manager of Eger Subaru in Bridgeport, Pa., said he expected sales to remain strong through February because ""many people had their cars damaged or totaled"" in winter storms and would need replacements. **********One factor in the sales surge is the high average age of cars and trucks on the road. The average has risen to nearly eight and a half years, the highest since the Korean War, according to estimates by Dean Witter. In addition, the median family income was $37,232 in the third quarter of 1993, compared with $36,088 a year earlier. Beyond Expectations **********In recent weeks, investors have been reacting to a growing consensus among investment professionals and economists that the United States is firmly in the midst of a cyclical automotive recovery that could last through 1996. **********""No one thought the numbers would be this strong,"" said Joseph S. Phillippi, automotive analyst for Lehman Brothers in New York. ""If this is for real, you have to scratch your head and wonder whether the suppliers will have enough parts for all the cars that are going to get built."" **********Reacting to the sales report, the stocks of the biggest American auto makers rose sharply in heavy trading today, with shares of the General Motors Corporation hitting an all-time high of $63, up $1.50. Shares of the Ford Motor Company jumped $1.625, to $69.375, and Chrysler stock rose $1.25, to $62.50. **********Total light-vehicle sales for the month were 1,024,678, compared with 900,357 in January 1993. Car sales rose 8.1 percent, to 611,714, while sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans, utility vehicles and pickups, rose 23.6 percent, to 412,964. **********The Big Three auto makers grabbed a bigger share of the automotive market -- 74.1 percent, compared with 72.5 percent last January -- while the share of the Japanese auto makers dropped to 21.9 percent, from 22.4 percent a year earlier. **********The reason is twofold. Domestic models are regarded by consumers as better values because the strong yen has driven up the price of Japanese models. And the market for light trucks, a segment in which domestic manufacturers are stronger than their Japanese competitors, has been the nation's fastest growing. Dealers Are Pleased **********Many retail dealers were ecstatic about the increases in volume and higher selling prices. **********""Considering we lost one week of sales, we still did pretty good, equal to our projections,"" said Chris Wright, the owner of Wright Motors Cadillac-GMC in Evansville, Ind., referring to bad winter weather. **********Car sales at G.M. rose 13.6 percent for the month, to 211,701. Light-truck sales rose 21.7 percent, to 135,065. Sales of G.M. cars built in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which are considered domestic production, rose 14.8 percent, to 208,476. **********Car sales at Ford rose 1.2 percent, to 133,650, from a year earlier; light-truck sales rose 34 percent, to 127,286. Sales of Ford cars built in North America were up 3.6 percent, to 132,353. **********Car sales at Chrysler rose 1.3 percent, to 60,667; light-truck sales rose 18.2 percent, to 97,612. Sales of Chrysler's domestic cars were up 6 percent, to 58,356. **********Toyota's imported and domestic car sales fell 4.1 percent, to 45,760; light-truck sales rose 17.2 percent, to 21,539. Honda's imported and domestic car sales rose 14.2 percent, to 47,873. Nissan's car sales fell 4.2 percent, to 31,529; the company's light-truck sales rose 33.5 percent, to 16,041."

""As individuals we can help our Government run more efficiently."" **********And the former officer, Lieut. Col. Daniel Delgado, added, ""We expect, in a short time, to be called on again."" **********In Panama where, as in Haiti, the United States intervened to remove a brutal military Government and install a democratically elected one,there are still serious doubts about how much the former military officers and their civilian associates have truly changed. **********Former lower-ranking military officers now command a police force whose loyalty to democracy is questioned. And as people who openly collaborated with the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Noriega return to positions of power, there is fear that the democratic system established after the invasion is in jeopardy. **********The Democratic Revolutionary Party, which was created by Panama's military, is back in control of the presidency and the legislature. On Sept. 23, President Ernesto Perez Balladares pardoned some 200 people, the majority associated with General Noriega, for crimes from corruption to homicide. He said the pardons would help the country move ahead by healing the wounds of the past. **********A prominent politician, who said he was afraid to be identified, asserted that the pardons showed that the past was returning. **********The party regained the presidency in May, defeating the coalition of parties elected just before the invasion but kept from office by General Noriega.

Mr. Perez won with only one-third of the vote. **********Even the losers cite the election as evidence that one of the goals of the United States invasion, respect for the electoral process, has been achieved. ""They were the cleanest elections I've ever seen,"" said Ricardo Arias Calderon, who was a Vice President in the Endara Government. **********The critical question now, foreign diplomats and the Democratic Revolutionary Party's opponents say, is whether having won in a democratic election the party will govern without resorting to repression. **********The other principal aim of the invasion was to arrest General Noriega on narcotics charges, bring him to justice in the United States and reduce the use of Panama by drug traffickers. The general is now serving a 40-year sentence in a Federal prison, but that may not have reduced either drug shipments or money laundering. **********A Drug Enforcement Administration official who spoke on condition that he not be identified said: ""We were never sure how much of that was going on under Noriega. And we can only estimate now, but I doubt it has gone down."" **********Reflecting a challenge likely to confront the United States in Haiti, American officials and the Panamanians they put in office said they would try to transform a corrupt and brutal military force into professional police officers rather than discharge them and risk their becoming an armed resistance or criminal bands. **********An American official involved said the effort was generally satisfactory. But another high-level American official, who insisted on anonymity, characterized the estimated 80 percent of the policemen who came from the military as ""a bunch of thugs."" **********That official said, ""They all want to go back to the old days"" and would be likely to conspire to do that were it not for the United States military forces based in Panama to guard the Panama Canal."

The rate had fallen markedly early this year. **********The data, which provide the first broad view of economic performance for the month, seemed to reduce further the chance that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates again at its policy meeting in September. **********At the same time, the growth in factory and other jobs was sufficient to blunt concern that the economy might sink to an unsatisfactorily low pace of expansion, because of tighter Government spending, higher taxes and higher interest rates. **********Merrill Lynch called the employment figures ""constructive"" on the whole. The report showed a smaller-than-expected rise of 179,000 payroll jobs last month, the lowest increase since January. That rise was far below the average of 293,000 so far this year and below the 259,000 jobs created in July. **********The Clinton Administration, meanwhile, took the occasion to boast that 3.1 million jobs had been created since Labor Day of 1993. **********""The U.S. economy continues to enjoy healthy growth in incomes and employment,"" Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said. Moreover, she added, ""there is no sign of an intensification of inflationary pressures in today's report."" **********The report initially cheered the bond market, but traders looking for any hints of inflation soon found other reasons to sell.  [ Page 35. ] **********Private analysts noted that average hourly earnings rose a skimpy 2 cents last month, cutting the annual rate of increase in the latest three months to just 1.5 percent. This suggested lackluster consumer spending as the holiday shopping season approaches. **********""With wages falling below inflation, consumers are not going to have the discretionary buying power to give the economy much support,"" said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at HSBC Holdings Inc. in New York. The Consumer Price Index rose at a 3.3 percent compounded annual rate for the three months that ended in July. **********What seems to be happening, economists and business people say, is that companies facing sharp increases in the cost of various commodities -- but unable to raise their own prices -- are stoutly holding the line on wages, their biggest expense. **********As has become common this year, partly because of new methods involving the Government's survey of households, commentators and securities traders found elements of the labor-market report hard to interpret, or, in the case of inflation, at odds with other readings. Columbia Inflation Index Up **********For example, a Columbia University index intended to predict inflation jumped today to 111.4 in August from 109.5 in July, with all four available components contributing to the rise. **********""It is evident,"" the university's Center for International Business Cycle Research concluded, ""that the leading indicators of inflation are still locked in cyclical upswings and continue to point to a cyclical upturn in U.S. inflation this year."" **********When this result was published, the bond market gave up its early gains. **********The 179,000 new payroll jobs included a 32,000 increase in factory jobs. The factory sector showed more vigor than many expected, even allowing for the reopening of automobile plants that were closed for retooling in July. The factory workweek and factory overtime, both already at near-record levels, edged up by 6 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively, also reflecting activity in the auto industry. **********On the other hand, construction jobs eased 6,000 in August after 13 straight months of growth that swelled payrolls by more than 300,000, the department noted. Analysts pointed to this as a reflection of the toll that rising interest rates have taken on housing in recent months, although some jobs were also lost to exceptional rain in the South. The World Cup Effect **********Employment in the retail trade was essentially unchanged after two months of robust growth. Some of the 29,000-job decline at bars and restaurants was attributed to the end of the World Cup soccer tournament. **********The temporary-help sector added an unusually small 15,000 jobs, less than half the average of the preceding 12 months. But health services added 38,000 as employment rebounded at hospitals. **********The so-called bias adjustment, a figure representing the estimated number of jobs at fledgling companies that the statistical mechanism does not yet capture, is 158,000 this quarter, or 88 percent of the August gain. **********The department's index of aggregate hours for production workers edged down two-tenths of a point, to 129.1, while 57 percent of industries reported adding workers, compared with 58.8 percent in July, the survey of payrolls also showed. Also, the average workweek in the private sector fell by 12 minutes. **********Although unchanged nationally, at 6.1 percent, the unemployment rate edged down in the Northeast, to 6.4 percent; in the South, to 5.8 percent, and in the Midwest, to 5.1 percent. The rate in the West edged up, however, to 7.5 percent. None of these moves was more than two-tenths of a point. Skepticism Over Big Gain **********Among the 11 largest states, the jobless rate eased marginally in eight and rose marginally in North Carolina and Michigan. The Massachusetts rate remained at 5.9 percent. **********The jobless rate in California, whose economy has been sluggish, fell to 8.9 percent in August from 9 percent in July. New York now shows a jobless rate of 6.9 percent, down from 7.1 percent, and New Jersey slipped to 6 percent from 6.4 percent. **********According to the department's survey of households, the basis for calculating the unemployment rate, the labor force soared by 732,000. And 714,000 of those people -- a stunning number -- found jobs. But economists, who have long favored the payroll survey and have been particularly skeptical about the reliability of the household survey since it was overhauled early this year, tended to dismiss these increases as probably little more than partial catching-up from earlier lags. **********One fact that suggests that seasonal adjustment distortions are involved is that the labor force fell by 422,000 and employment fell by 10,000 last month when no adjustment for recurring seasonal patterns is made. **********The household tally also showed 489,000 workers too discouraged to look for jobs, 7,079,000 workers with two or more jobs (including 260,000 with primary and secondary jobs both full-time), and 4,284,000 people working part time who would have preferred full-time work. There was a 253,000 decline in the number of people idle for less than five weeks."

Commissions are being dropped entirely on some customer transactions. **********The offer comes in two forms, Smart Trade and Smart Trading.

Each share must cost at least $5. **********Smart Trading, by comparison, is available for accounts of all sizes. To escape commissions, trades must still be 1,000 shares or more, and the minimum share price remains $5. **********But -- and here's the big qualifier -- these trades must be in stocks recommended by Olde analysts. The constantly changing list now numbers about 200 companies plucked from all three exchanges. **********Critics say the list contains stocks in Olde's inventory that the firm is trying to unload and stocks in which it is a market maker, meaning it profits from the spread between the bid and asked prices even if it does not charge a commission.  When asked about its list, Randal Mudge, an Olde director, said there was no conflict of interest. Many brokerage houses hold an inventory of securities and still charge the full commission on their sale, he said.  Furthermore, Olde is one of multiple market makers in all stocks on its list and therefore does not control trading and prices of those shares, Mr. Mudge said.  When a broker in Olde's office in Fairfield, Conn., made a cold call to this reporter in September, the offer of no-fee trading seemed too good to be true. How could the company possibly make money without charging commissions? **********Steven Ayer, the broker, responded that the company recouped lost commissions by encouraging customers to use Olde for margin loans, for which it does receive fees, and by fostering sales of bonds and mutual funds that do carry brokers' commissions. **********A fast-growing brokerage firm based in Detroit that positions itself as a deep discounter with the personal attention of a full-service broker, Olde is known within the industry for its aggressive salespeople. **********Another common practice among deep discount brokers is to charge for statements and services that full-service brokerages supply at no extra cost. **********Will other brokers ever match Olde's offer? It's unlikely. **********Tom Taggart, a spokesman for Charles Schwab & Company, said Schwab would have to put pressure on its clients to make other investments if it made such a deal. ""And that's not the way we like to generate business,"" he said. **********A. G. Edwards and Merrill Lynch took similar positions. ""We prefer to build relationships with our clients by taking plenty of time for counseling,"" said Bobbie Collins, a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch.

A flurry of certificates of deposit and various derivative products have appeared. **********At the same time, increasing numbers of supranational organizations such as the Asian Development Bank and the Nordic Investment Bank seeking funds in the region have also raised money in the local currency, whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. **********Yet, with the exception of a few bond- issuing pioneers, private companies have largely shunned a market that can offer cheaper medium-term financing than bank loans, and one that analysts expect someday will be huge. **********""The Hong Kong dollar debt market is starved for issues; it has no depth,"" said Peter Ferry, director of fixed-income sales and trading for CS First Boston. ""But there's too much liquidity out there for it not to develop."" **********But how long will it take? **********""Most of the major banks and finance companies are equipped to deal in Hong Kong bonds and notes,"" Robert McBain, executive director of NatWest Capital Markets, said. ""There are many more players than necessary, given the size of the market now, but everybody wants to be ready when things take off."" **********Although it continually runs a budget surplus, the Hong Kong government sells short- term bills, with maturities of 30 days or less, and notes with a maximum maturity of three years to help steer monetary policy and prod a commercial debt market into life in a financial center where equities have long been king. **********The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank, has established a central depository and clearing system for its notes that can also be used in the trade of private-sector paper and serve as a bridge to international clearing systems. **********""The authorities have done quite a lot to make the environment friendly,"" said Andrew Sheng, deputy chief executive (monetary) at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the colony's central bank. ""There is lot of demand for high-quality, long-term paper out there. Now it's up to the private sector."" **********The market expects the HKMA to issue a note with a five-year maturity at some point this year, a move that will help provide a benchmark for debt that extends beyond July 1997, the date of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule. **********But the government, which is trying to stimulate market development and has recently eased listing requirements for new bond issues, will not heed calls to grant corporate issuers the tax-exempt status it extends to supranationals. **********For this reason, and the fact that few Hong Kong companies have debt ratings, Hong Kong dollar corporate debt can yield significantly more than comparable U.S. or European corporate paper - on average, about 150 basis points, or one and a half percentage points, more. **********""From the risk/return point of view, it's a jungle out there now,"" said Philippe Delhaise, president of Thomson Bankwatch Asia, one of Asia's few corporate rating agencies. **********""More companies are now prepared to look at this financing option and to undergo rating because they can see that, otherwise, the pricing they get is very much uncorrelated with the quality of their paper,"" said Mr. Delhaise, who predicted the market would ""explode"" when secondary trading expanded. **********But that boom could take awhile, maybe a year or two, according to some traders. Demand for quality paper far outweighs supply. **********""Investors are not quite ready for corporate issues,"" said Andrew Fung, manager of swaps and trading for Wardley Ltd., a leading arranger and trader in the Hong Kong dollar debt market. **********""The Swire Pacific issue was the first and most successful, but its trading spread continues to widen,"" Mr. Fung said, referring to the seven-year, 750 million Hong Kong dollar (US$97 million) bond paying a 7.125 percent semiannual coupon.

There was great optimism here over the benefits of active policy coordination. **********It takes only a few minutes with Yasushi Mieno, the plain-spoken governor of the Bank of Japan, to get a sense of how much things have changed. Mr. Mieno, (pronounced mee-AY-no), a gregarious 70-year-old whose passion outside of monetary statistics is sumo wrestling, may well become known as the governor of diminished expectations.  Discussion Replaces Action **********With Japan getting little help in halting the punishing rise of the yen these days, the Government being criticized for not doing enough to end the recession and the flood of Japanese capital abroad having become a trickle, coordinated action by the industrialized nations has been largely transformed, in Mr. Mieno's words, into a passive exchange of information about basic policy goals. **********""That is the notion of policy coordination that I have,"" Mr. Mieno said in an interview. **********His admission reflects the sober mood at the top of Japan's financial system as Mr. Mieno nears the end of his controversial five-year term. His tenure, which ends in December, covered one of the most tumultuous and humbling periods in the country's financial history. **********Under his stewardship, the Bank of Japan for the first time increased interest rates, not as a remedy for a burst of consumer price inflation -- which was almost nonexistent when he took office in 1989 -- but to check soaring stock and land prices. **********The policy punctured what is now called the ""bubble economy"" of the 1980's, a speculative period that sent asset prices to astronomical levels. At the peak, the land beneath the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo was said to be worth more than all the real estate in California. **********The central bank's action produced the longest recession in the postwar period. Mr. Mieno then reversed course and engineered the lowest official interest rates ever, from a peak of 6 percent to the current 1.75 percent. Yet the cheap credit has failed to ignite an economic recovery because, some argue, Mr. Mieno's experiment in controlling asset prices went on too long.  A Burden of Bad Debts **********More than $6 trillion in asset values have been wiped out, the property market is all but moribund and commercial banks are saddled with a huge burden of bad debts. It is no wonder that Mr. Mieno is regarded with a combination of fear, respect and anger -- but never indifference. **********Some Japanese consider him a hero for having stopped the orgy of speculation during the 1980's, putting the economy on a more solid footing for the future, even if the medicine has been painful. **********""My view is that nobody could have behaved better during such an unlucky period,"" said Yoshio Suzuki, chairman of the advisory board at the Nomura Research Institute and a former top executive at the Bank of Japan. Others, however, share the view of Shin Kanemaru, formerly the country's most powerful politician, who suggested several years ago that someone ought to behead the central bank governor. Several Difficult Problems **********The years under Mr. Mieno have left the Bank of Japan with several perplexing problems that could influence policy well into the future. For one, the bank has to decide if Mr. Mieno's campaign against soaring stock and land prices was a one-time foray or a long-term policy. And if it is a long-term policy, it raises the question: When does a bull market cross the line into becoming the dangerous ""asset inflation"" that Mr. Mieno attacked? **********The central bank must also decide where to draw the line between ridding Japan's financial markets of their heavy burden of regulation -- Mr. Mieno's long-stated policy -- and using regulation to maintain the kind of order with which the bank is obsessed. **********""It is uncertain to what extent financial liberalization affected behavior during the period of the financial bubble,"" Mr. Mieno said. What is certain, he said, is that ""under the process of deregulation there was some excessive aggressiveness on the part of the banks."" **********He said deregulation had to continue, since competition was the only way to teach banks to manage their risks better. **********But he also insisted that the Government's heavy-handed manner of handling the bad-debt crisis at the commercial banks would continue because of the central bank's need to protect the financial system against panic. The commercial banks have been pressured by the Government to keep many ailing borrowers afloat with new loans below market rates. **********""Our greatest concern is systemic risk in the financial system,"" he said. **********Mr. Mieno spent most of his 47-year career at the Bank of Japan being groomed for his current post. He spent part of his youth in northern China, which Japan was transforming into an engine for its military expansion of the 30's. When Japan lost the war, Mr. Mieno's father, a commercial banker, lost everything. Mr. Mieno was able to attend Tokyo University, the country's most elite institution, but had to live and work in a sumo stable, where he cultivated his interest in the sport. He is now a member of the council that selects the wrestlers to be elevated to the sport's highest status. **********He also spent two years in New York in the early 1960's, studying for a short time at Columbia University. But for the most part his career was spent in the bank's domestic departments, where he developed a reputation for being smart and decisive. **********Mr. Mieno was engulfed in criticism almost from his first day as governor in December 1989. The press reported that the Finance Minister was resisting a proposed increase in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, which influences what banks charge customers for loans. **********The discount rate was raised and, within days, the stock market hit what remains its record high. When the rate went up three more times in the next 10 months, the market plunged and Mr. Mieno became known as the disciplinarian who ended one of the most powerful bull runs ever. Many experts say that he was right to raise interest rates but that he moved too fast. **********""It was a question of degree,"" said Makoto Utsumi, the vice minister of finance at that time and now a professor at Keio University. ""The point all along was to avoid a hard landing. I think if we had tightened more slowly we could have had a soft landing."" **********There was virtually no price or wage inflation, but Mr. Mieno acted because of a belief that soaring asset prices would eventually provoke consumer price inflation. Some still question that view. **********""We still don't know the connection between monetary policy and asset prices,"" said Mikio Wakatsuki, a former deputy governor at the Bank of Japan and now chairman of the board of councilors at the Japan Research Institute. ""What benchmark do you use? Which prices do you follow? We don't know, and didn't know then."" On One Hand -- and the Other **********Even Mr. Mieno seems ambivalent. He explained that steep rises in asset prices could not be given the same emphasis in policy making as could broader measures of consumer prices. On the other hand, he said, they cannot be ignored. **********""The lesson that we learned from that,"" he said, "" is that when we see the symptom of such asset price inflation we have to act immediately."" **********With the interest rate increases so unpopular at that time, Mr. Mieno put the issue in moral terms: He said that rocketing land prices put a home out of reach of the average Japanese and threatened social harmony. **********""The bubble hurt the soundness and stability of Japanese society,"" Mr. Mieno said in another interview several years ago. ""The efforts of labor, which is to work with sweat on your forehead, have been weakened. Morale was reduced and there was unfairness in the distribution of wealth."" **********In the latest interview, however, Mr. Mieno backed away from that kind of preaching. **********""I am a central banker and not a sociologist,"" he said. ""Neither I nor the Bank of Japan is in the position of being able to provide a guideline as to how the public should earn its income. Also, we are not playing the part of Robin Hood -- I like him, but I'm not Robin Hood."""

Their meeting was followed by a meeting with President Clinton. **********One Western official said that if an environmental conference cannot be organized by April, then Mr. Gore, or perhaps Mrs. Clinton, could lead the American delegation to attend a United Nations conference on women in September. **********The Administration also plans for Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary to travel to China early next year to lead a large delegation of corporate executives of energy and high-technology companies. **********China is currently negotiating with a number of American companies competing with European and Japanese companies to win contracts to build electrical power plants, subway systems, dams and other infrastructure projects."

They were notified late Tuesday that their publication licenses had been revoked by the Government. **********The United States Embassy in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, issued a statement expressing ""regret over the Indonesian Government's decision to cancel the publishing licenses."" President Clinton is expected to travel to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the leaders of Asian and Pacific countries. **********Fikri Jufri, editor in chief of Tempo, said in a telephone interview from Jakarta that there was no hope of resurrecting the publication -- ""at least not in this regime."" **********""Tempo becomes history, and I'm surprised and I'm saddened,"" he said, adding that the move would chill the reporting of other Indonesian publications, a view shared by diplomats and human rights groups. **********In their willingness to challenge the Government of President Suharto, who has held power in Indonesia for a quarter of a century, the three publications had no rival among Indonesia's daily newspapers, which are far more timid in their coverage of the Government. News broadcasts on Indonesian television and radio have traditionally been subjected to tight Government control. **********The Information Ministry said Tuesday in Jakarta that it closed Tempo after the magazine, which had a circulation of about 190,000, failed to heed several warnings about its news coverage. The director of the ministry's press department was quoted in news reports from Jakarta as saying that recent articles in Tempo ""haven't reflected the life of a sound press, a free and responsible press."" **********The ministry said the other two publications were being shut down for ""administrative"" reasons involving their supposed failure to operate according to terms of their licenses. **********The shutdown of the three magazines appeared to offer new evidence of the growing influence of the Indonesian Technology Minister, B. J. Habibie, a close friend of Mr. Suharto and a possible successor, who was the subject of unflattering scrutiny in Tempo and elsewhere after he arranged the purchase of 39 ships from the former East Germany Navy. The purchase had been opposed by senior officers of the Indonesian Navy. **********DeTik, which means a second of time, began publishing in February 1993 and aroused the anger of the Government because of a series of recent articles implicating senior officials and friends of President Suharto in the country's worst banking scandal, a $436 million swindle of Government funds."

Posts A Solid Profit For Quarter,COMPANY REPORTS; I.B.M. Posts A Solid Profit For Quarter," **********I.B.M. reported surprisingly strong first-quarter profits yesterday, prompting a wave of buying on Wall Street that increased the company's stock price nearly 12 percent. **********The better-than-expected results are partly a sign that the cost-cutting program devised by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who became chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation 12 months ago, is on schedule. But what most surprised analysts was that the erosion of I.B.M.'s large-computer business greatly slowed and that the company's international operations had strong sales, even in areas of economic weakness like Western Europe. 'A Blowout Quarter' **********The company reported net income for the first quarter of $392 million, or 64 cents a share. By contrast, it lost $399 million, or 70 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. **********""It was a blowout quarter, really on track or ahead of the game in every respect,"" said Daniel Mandresh, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, who had raised his profit forecast for I.B.M. two weeks ago but still underestimated the magnitude of the improvement. **********For their part, I.B.M. executives welcomed the results, but cautioned against reading too much into a rebound during a single three-month period. In a statement, Mr. Gerstner termed the results ""encouraging,"" but he added that they ""do not guarantee sustained, long-term success."" **********In a conference call with securities analysts yesterday morning, Jerome B. York, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said that the quarter's profit level, given that sales were $13.4 billion, was ""nothing to write home about."" He said he was satisfied with the level of profitability in only a few of I.B.M.'s major businesses -- minicomputer hardware and software, and the maintenance business. **********""There are still plenty of challenges ahead for this company,"" Mr. York said later in an interview. ""I wouldn't take one quarter's results as proof positive that you should load up on I.B.M. stock."" Stock Soars on News **********Yet many investors chose to load up anyway. On Wall Street, where traders look for shifts in momentum, the first-quarter figures were read yesterday as a sign that I.B.M.'s recovery is under way. The company's share price jumped $6.125, to $58.375. **********The first-quarter results included a one-time gain of $248 million from the sale of I.B.M.'s Federal Systems Company, a data-processing subsidiary whose client is the Government, which was bought by the Loral Corporation. The quarter also included an extraordinary charge of $192 million to reflect a more conservative accounting treatment of the value of I.B.M.'s software, recognizing the accelerating pace at which software technology changes and falls in value. **********Still, without the extraordinary gain and bookkeeping change, I.B.M. would have reported net income of $336 million, or 54 cents a share. This figure -- the net profit from continuing operations -- is the yardstick most closely watched by analysts. And the 54 cents was far ahead of the consensus forecast among analysts, which had been 8 cents a share. **********Revenues, at $13.4 billion, increased 2 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Overall sales of hardware -- computers and equipment -- rose 9 percent, to $6.3 billion, also higher than analysts expected. **********The surprise in the hardware sector, though, was the sales of I.B.M.'s mainframe machines. These computers have been under pressure as smaller desktop machines have become more powerful and better able to handle some computing chores once reserved for mainframes. Mainframe Slide Slows **********To try to retain clients, mainframe makers led by I.B.M. have been forced to cut prices sharply and reduce revenues. That trend continues, but the pace eased in the first part of this year, as price cuts have made the big machines more competitive with alternative technologies and the economy has strengthened. **********After falling 32 percent last year, I.B.M.'s mainframe sales slipped 12 percent in the first quarter, Mr. York said. The slower erosion, he said, lifted I.B.M.'s profits by 10 cents to 15 cents a share in the first quarter. **********So analysts are revising their estimates. John B. Jones Jr. of Salomon Brothers Inc., who had expected I.B.M.'s mainframe business to fall by 30 percent or more this year, is now projecting that the mainframe sales will slide by only 15 percent. **********Analysts noted that I.B.M.'s healthy sales abroad, especially in the weak European economy, where revenues rose 3 percent, was another positive sign for the company."

He lost that one to the Social Democrats, but this year he is accusing them of plotting to collaborate with the environmentalist Greens and the marginal former Communists to unseat him after nearly 12 years as Chancellor. **********""We need every vote,"" he told a cheering rally of several thousand supporters the other night in an indoor tennis stadium in Halle, a few hours north of here in Westphalia. ""Don't let yourself be influenced by public opinion polls -- we haven't got a single vote to spare and none to lose."" Nine months ago, he said, polling had written him off, and six months ago he was far behind the opposition. **********All the major polls now show that Mr. Kohl has a good chance of leading his Christian Democratic alliance to well over 40 percent of the vote, enough to continue his 12-year coalition with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's Free Democrats. But to remain part of the coalition, the Free Democrats must win at least the 5 percent of the national vote that it takes to get into Parliament. **********This is something Mr. Kohl says he does not doubt for a minute, though the Free Democrats fell short of the 5 percent hurdle in a string of state elections earlier this year. In the vote for the Bavarian state legislature on Sunday, they won only about 3 percent, down from about 5.2 percent four years ago. But the Christian Social Union, Mr. Kohl's principal Bavarian allies, won nearly 53 percent. **********As Mr. Kohl sees it, the main threat to his ambition to break Konrad Adenauer's record of 14 years as Chancellor comes from voter apathy. The campaign has been devoid of clashes over issues, with the Government and opposition in agreement on the need to cut spending to bring down the deficits that Mr. Kohl's Government ran up to pay the costs of unification. **********On the campaign trail, the 64-year-old Mr. Kohl flies from rally to rally in a helicopter, enjoying audiences even when they include a few hecklers. Some of these booed and whistled from up in the balconies in the Halle stadium, hanging out a banner that punned on his name by suggesting that the country had eaten ""coal"" dust too long. **********The high cost of unification was worth every penny, he told his supporters from the well-off and sometimes resentful western part of the country, and they cheered. Oct. 16, he said, is the main challenge now. **********""There's a tendency to encourage people to think it's all over so that Christian Democratic voters will stay at home on election day,"" he told reporters before the rally."

The militants were members of the underground Islamic Group, they said. The raid was part of a crackdown in which hundreds of militants have been arrested this month. **********Security officials said two gunmen opened fire with pistols on the bus at dawn as it was taking the Romanian engineers to work at the Asyut Cement Company. While bullets pierced the bus and smashed windows, no one inside was hurt, the officials said. Two Egyptian engineers were also on the bus. **********Last week militants issued a statement warning foreigners living and working in Egypt to leave.

The State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said tonight that he was ""confident there will be a bank"" eventually. **********He said that a group of economic experts were studying the proposal to structure the bank in a way that would be acceptable to various parties. American officials said that they agreed with many objections raised by the Saudis but were confident they could be resolved. **********The United States has recently presented Saudi Arabia with several requests for financial commitments, including requests to purchase American aircraft and arms, while the Saudis have been having difficulty meeting current payments on commitments already extended. The Saudis have been running budget deficits averaging $10 billion a year in recent years; the budget called for $42.6 billion in spending in 1994. **********In a tour of the region last week, President Clinton met with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to reassure him of United States commitments to defend the Kingdom. But Arab officials here said that no discussion of the bank project took place. **********The economic conference concluded today with an initial agreement to establish regional chambers of commerce and offices of tourism staffed by Israelis and Arabs as part of a broad five-page ""Casablanca Declaration"" outlining plans to cement peace talks between Arabs and Israelis with foreign participation in capital and expertise. **********But the disagreement over the development bank highlighted the obstacles facing the conference's stated objective, which is to construct a network of private-sector projects and investments binding Israel's economy to that of the Arab world surrounding it. **********Lack of money emerged as a separate hindrance to hopes for speeding the negotiations between Syria and Israel. **********""We have an abundance of lending and financial aid institutions operating under capacity in the region,"" said Soleiman Soleim, Saudi Arabia's Commerce Minister, who argued that creating one more financial aid institution is a waste of time and effort that would be better used to activate dormant money that is under Arab control. **********Other Arab delegates, speaking privately, said their countries support peace talks with Israel but argued that oil prices have been dropping or hovering at record low numbers for more than a decade. They said that the huge bank deposits they accumulated in the 1970's have been depleted by the cost of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's and the Persian Gulf war in the 1990's. **********Another strong United States plea to abolish totally the Arab boycott of Israeli businesses also met with considerable Arab resistance. The central Arab argument was that the political problems among Israel, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians needed to be resolved before the boycott could be further lifted. **********Arab businessmen said that the initial contacts made here were a success and are bound to be pursued. But Arab politicians attending the conference and influencing its outcome also said political considerations take precedence at the moment. **********""We cannot succeed by putting the cart before the horse,"" said Arab League Secretary General, Esmat Abdelmeguid. ""A durable peace must be based on a just solution of land for peace and on the successful end of all Arab-Israeli talks."" Mr. Abdelmeguid's comments, delivered to an audience of business investors and Israeli officials, reflected a general mood among Arab delegates. **********Still the enthusiasm demonstrated by the hundreds of businessmen who flocked to the conference -- sponsored by the New York-based Council of Foreign Relations and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum -- suggested that the experience was widely seen an initial success. **********""We are witnessing the birth of a new Middle East,"" said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who sat next to Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, at the closing session of the conference this afternoon. **********Of the Arabs, Morocco, Egypt and Jordan were the most eager to expand commercial ties with Israel. **********""We have long spoken on the Middle East in conflict,"" said Amr Moussa, the Foreign Minister of Egypt. ""Now, here, we are speaking about peace. I'm not saying we are dreaming but the view is clear ahead of hope in the future."" **********Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan called the conference ""a civilized economic achievement,"" while King Hassan of Morocco said the peace negotiations with Israel were now irreversible. **********Israel's business delegation arrived here with 140 ideas for joint projects, while a delegation of 100 Egyptian businessmen proposed some 50 business ventures in areas of agriculture, construction, tourism and manufacturing. There were many business card exchanges and long discussions over lunches and dinners. **********""I think it is time for real cooperation to concentrate on the private sector in this region, on small projects to get people employed and get the economies rolling,"" said Omar Mohanna, an Egyptian investment banker. **********Mr. Arafat succeeded in lobbying for an acceleration of financial aid meant to support the self rule of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho. He won support from the conference to oppose further closures of the borders of these areas by the Israeli Army, which barred Palestinians from entering Israel after recent attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. **********""It is important that the borders of the Palestinian territories be kept open for labor, tourism and trade to allow the Palestinian Authority, in partnership with its neighbors, the opportunity to build a viable economy in peace,"" one clause of the Casablanca Declaration read."

It makes money -- just enough of it to make the operation's Russian partners eager to expand, but not enough to make executives at the ice cream maker's home office in Waterbury, Vt., feel easy about branching out beyond this vast northern region of lakes and rivers called Karelia. **********Since 1991, when the collapse of Communism made serious foreign investment in Russia possible, American businesses have moved beyond the point of simply establishing a presence and testing a market to the knottier issues of whether to expand in an uncertain economy, how to pay for growth with little security under local law for their investment and how much leeway to give Russian partners once they have learned the finer points of capitalism. **********A 'Real Business' **********""It's not possible for Ben & Jerry's to control the situation overseas -- now it's a real business on Russian ground,"" said Sergei Lukin, 36, the co-chairman of the venture, along with Ben Cohen, the chief executive of the ice cream maker, who is stepping down as chief executive but continuing as chairman, concentrating on product development. **********Nevertheless, the home office is insisting that future growth be financed with profits from the joint venture and not with an infusion of cash from Vermont. ""They see these vast opportunities in the marketplace and it's hard to  tell them we're not comfortable reaching for those goals,"" said Dave Morse, head of Ben & Jerry's Russian operation, in a telephone interview from Vermont. **********Many Russian-American joint ventures -- about 500 American companies, from small grocery stores to Citicorp, have a presence here, according to the Moscow-based American Chamber of Commerce in Russia -- never face these questions. **********With money for expansion and development scarce, many of these companies have undertaken their projects only after securing loans from international financial institutions like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or loan guarantees from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, or OPIC, a  for-profit agency of the United States Government. **********But Ben & Jerry's, using a combination of local products and imported flavoring and packaging, has found a way to manufacture its premium-quality ice  cream profitably at a price Russians can afford. A scoop costs about 800 rubles, or around 40 cents, compared with the 500 rubles charged by Russian ice cream makers. A pint retails for about $1.25. Last year, the venture, called Iceverks  (which stands for Ice Cream of Vermont and Karelia) earned about $100,000, Mr. Morse said. **********On any given day, especially one of the endless days of Arctic summer, more  than 2,000 Russians line up at the company's three ice cream parlors the way they used to line up at state stores for butter or milk in the Soviet era. There are now three scoop shops, two in Petrozavodsk (the name, Peter's Factory, comes from the founding of the city by Peter the Great in the 18th century), and one in Kondopoga, 30 miles from here. **********The Russian partners, who have been running the operation on their own for six months, have been creative in coming up with some uniquely Russian flavors,  about a dozen of which are available at any given time. **********Karelian Fairytale, for example, is made from a locally produced caramel nougat, and Black Currant, Cranberry and Black Cherry use locally bought berries. A flavor called Dynya is made from Georgian melons bought at market in  Karelia. Production of Karelian Krunch had to be discontinued, however, because  supplies of locally grown pine nuts were inadequate. **********Nagging Supply Problems **********Popular American flavors are also available, but some are also plagued by supply problems. Take White Russian, a name redolent with history, past and present: in 1917, the Whites opposed the Reds in the Russian Revolution, and in  the Russian language White Russian translates to Belarus, the former Soviet republic. Lacking Kahlua, the coffee-flavored liqueur that is a central ingredient of White Russian, Iceverks had to make its own, using domestic vodka  as a base. **********For all the customer satisfaction, the Iceverks products are still unavailable in St. Petersburg, 400 miles southwest of Petrozavodsk, or in Moscow, and the small factory here churns out 6 tons of ice cream a week, far below its capacity. **********""We know we have an existing healthy business,"" Mr. Morse said. ""If we try to push too hard, we could blow that. I'd rather be a success in Karelia than a  failure in Moscow."" **********Mr. Morse said Iceverks would be broadening its market by establishing a distribution network and franchising scoop shops in Moscow and St. Petersburg. But not for a year or so. Then, he said, when demand grows to the point where production is about 75 percent of capacity, ""we intend to inject some capital into the joint venture."" **********The Russian partners say, however, that is not soon enough. ""We've done what we could in Petrozavodsk,"" said Vasily M. Mikheyev, 33, the company's co-director. ""Now we have to expand further."" **********'Ice Cream Diplomacy' **********Such conflicts would have been difficult to foresee back in 1988, when the idea of a Ben & Jerry's in Russia was conceived. Mr. Cohen traveled to Petrozavodsk with a delegation from Vermont, which has a sister-state relationship with Karelia, and met Mr. Lukin, who at the time was a television reporter. The idea of ""ice cream diplomacy"" was born, and after a search for other suitable sites, a start-up date of 1991 was set. **********A year of delays ensued. ""We didn't know how to make ice cream and Ben & Jerry didn't know how to behave in Russia,"" Mr. Lukin said. **********In June 1992, the first scoop shop and the factory opened in what had been a cloak room and a passageway of a building next door to the Pioneer Youth Center. The total investment of $1 million was split between the two partners. The Russians raised part of their stake by selling a 20 percent interest to a local  bank. **********Mr. Lukin and Mr. Mikheyev have continued the Vermont company's counterculture corporate style. The venture donates from 10 to 15 percent of profits to charity, mostly to a local fund for disabled children. Last year, it  gave away 5,000 ice cream cones to the entire first-year class of Petrozavodsk's elementary schools. **********The partners have also used company money in more uniquely Russian ways, building apartments for their employees. **********Both sides say the disagreement over expansion is a natural result of the unexpected success of Iceverks. **********Mr. Lukin says that he has received several requests to build other factories throughout Russia and that loans are available from Russian banks. Mr. Morse counters that he does not see how the business can hope to repay debt at an interest rate of up to 300 percent annually -- if a loan is granted. **********Rivals Moving In **********Increasing revenue has become more urgent after a two-year tax holiday given to Ben & Jerry's as a start-up venture expired last month. Other imported ice cream products from Finland and even the Czech Republic are beginning to push into the Karelian market, and some workers are worried that Ben & Jerry's has not kept up with the competition. **********Mr. Lukin remains hopeful. Asked what other American business executives could learn from the Ben & Jerry's operation here, Mr. Lukin said: ""First of all, they should trust Russians. If they find good partners, they should trust them because they know Russia."""

And why did the S.E.C. allow the firms anonymity in the May 19 report after having found that several were flying a disproportionate number of red flags? **********In August 1992, the S.E.C. began a vast study of nine brokerage firms, hoping to learn more about brokers who were repeat offenders in using bad sales practices and about the managers who apparently were off on coffee breaks whenever those brokers were up to no good. **********The study was motivated by an embarrassing newspaper series that detailed the rovings of ""rogue brokers"" who got in trouble at one firm and would move on -- frequently lured by a nice bonus -- to the next. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission badgered the nation's nine biggest firms for a mass of information after the series ran, and the firms huffed and puffed over some of the demands. For one thing, they didn't like the demand that they hand over documents about their brokers that attached a compensation figure to a social security number, protesting that a leak of that data to the competition would be devastating. While the S.E.C. backed off on that one, the boxes of frequently incriminating documents began to land in Washington. **********When all was said and done, the S.E.C. decided to zero in on 268 brokers who had irked customers to the point of complaining, demanding an arbitration, or suing. Also among the 268 were players who had been officially reprimanded by a stock exchange or a state or Federal securities entity. **********Inspections of 161 branch offices followed, prompting 40 referrals of entire offices or of individuals to the enforcement division. Of those, 88 percent were attached to either Paine Webber, Prudential Securities or Shearson, which merged with Smith Barney before the study was done. **********The names, confirmed last week by a government official who insisted on anonymity, are an open secret in the brokerage industry at this point. But at the S.E.C., the list of bad and relatively good firms is officially under wraps. ""You're right that the information would certainly be relevant"" to the investor making a decision about opening a new account, said William McLucas, chief of the enforcement division. ""But we don't make public the result of examinations,"" he added, making the point that the S.E.C. names names only after charges have been made. **********For the record, Merrill Lynch and Kidder, Peabody, while by no means looking lily white at the end of the study, had nothing egregious enough to pass on to the securities cops, the government official said. Mr. McLucas had no comment, either, on which firms had the least problems. **********A Smith Barney Shearson spokesman noted that ""to my knowledge, all of those brokers are gone from this firm,"" but declined to comment on its inclusion in the group of most troublesome firms in the study. A Prudential spokeswoman said that ""we have no knowledge"" of having been in the red-flag group, but that Prudential had already bolstered education and training of brokers and improved its compliance procedures. At Paine Webber, a spokesman similarly declined to comment on the status of the firm in the report, but said that it had made new compliance and legal efforts and had a new ""state of the art"" system to monitor brokers. **********Indeed, in the week since the S.E.C. released its report, brokerage firms have seized the opportunity to crow about their nifty new crook-catching systems as if they'd thought it up all by themselves. In fact, though, Prudential set up new systems after having gone through a long tango with the S.E.C. to settle charges of sales practice abuses related to limited partnerships that it sold. And Paine Webber was similarly told by the commission to ""run some classes and beef up things,"" a spokesman admitted. **********Long before the study was getting wrapped up, brokerage firms had begun to make big changes, Mr. McLucas said. ""The industry has really reacted out of a level of fear and responsibility,"" he said. ""People have tried to get with it."" **********Not so with it, though, has been the hilarious glass-is-half-full reaction of industry executives who have been keeping a straight face in recent days while talking about the S.E.C. study as a Great Vindication. The rap goes like this: with more than 50,000 brokers working at the nine firms in the study, and only 40 cases being referred to enforcement, investors need to fear fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation's brokers. **********But not quite. For starters, each of the 40 cases could include a number of brokers, because an entire branch could be under investigation. In addition, the S.E.C. picked its shots, only shipping to enforcement the most egregious cases from the 161 branches it inspected. More important is that the S.E.C.'s mere selection of a branch meant that it had already suffered reports of repeated problems. **********Even giving the industry the benefit of the doubt, though -- let's say there really are only a fraction of a fraction of a percent of brokers who are crooked -- something doesn't quite make sense. Among recommendations of the study was that brokerage firms share with new customers a special 800 number -- run by the National Association of Securities Dealers -- that gives limited but useful information about brokers' past problems. **********But several brokerage industry executives said privately last week that they object vigorously to that recommendation, calling it ""inappropriate"" that they suggest to investors that they check on a broker before opening an account. If it's safe for investors to walk the streets, though, why not? Surely only a fraction of a fraction -- fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent, to be precise -- would take their business elsewhere."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, President of Haiti, to the United Nations General Assembly, as translated from the French and Creole by The New York Times. **********. . . Finally, in 11 days, I will be in Haiti. **********Thanks to the heroic courage of the Haitian people and to your solidarity, soon we will be back. Your eyes and ours will witness the blossoming of the democratic flowers. In 11 days I invite you to celebrate the festival of reconciliation, of democracy and of peace at home, in Haiti. **********Already, at the peaceful start of Operation Uphold Democracy on Sept. 19, a tropical smile brightened peace-loving faces. Together we and President Clinton have been able to bore a tunnel of hope through so much suffering. **********Hats off for the Haitian people! **********Honor and respect for our 5,000 victims! **********Father Jean-Marie Vincent died so that Haiti would live! **********The resistance by the Haitian people has its roots in a historical past where the light of liberty glows day and night. With reason, Toussaint L'Ouverture declared as he was leaving for France: ""By toppling me, you have only cut the trunk of the tree of liberty. Its roots will grow back because they are deep. **********At the eve of our 200th independence day, these roots feed us with democracy. **********Never will the Haitian people stop fighting to guarantee their inalienable rights to life, to liberty, to happiness. Never will we stop fighting for a socially just, economically free and politically independent Haitian nation. 'We Reach Democracy' **********The first black republic in the world, which has been ripped apart by the Sept. 30, 1991, coup, is marching toward the restoration of democracy -- resolutely and definitively. Through diplomacy we reach democracy, better late than never. . . . Hope makes one live. **********Beyond the sad display that the past three years symbolize, we are marching toward 2004 with optimism. The road that leads there necessarily leads through historical crossroads: the elections of Dec. 16, 1990, and our return to Haiti. **********In 11 days I will be there, thanks to the determination of the Haitian people and to our solidarity. This is a history that deserves attention, because only a free people's history deserves attention; the history of a people subservient to despotism is but a collection of short stories, jokes. **********In 11 days we will be there. A bright light will dazzle all eyes, the light of reconciliation. Reconciliation will impose itself between violence and vengeance. Justice will impose itself between impunity and inequity. **********In other terms, we, President of the Republic of Haiti, say clearly and firmly: **********Yes to reconciliation! **********No to violence! **********No to vengeance! **********No to impunity! **********Yes to justice! **********We will prepare the coffee of reconciliation with the filter of justice so there will be no trace of violence or vengeance. Through reconciliation, enthusiasm has to set fire to all hearts, rich and poor, civilian and military.  'Tears Will Come' **********Through reconciliation, streams of tears will come to our eyes. You, the parents and friends of our 5,000 victims, you who bear this crushing yoke, you all, rich and poor, civilian and military, soon the flow of light will fill your hearts. This is indeed the light of reconciliation. **********How else is the darkness of subhuman misery to be dissipated? How does one get from misery to poverty in dignity? An exploration of third world countries shows us that one-fifth of the people in developing countries are hungry, one-fourth lack basic means of survival, one-third live in extreme misery. . . . **********In Haiti in 1994, the number of children going to school is 750,000. More than 1,250,000 children stay home or work in agriculture. However, our constitution stipulates that education is a right for all. It is a duty the state cannot sidestep. **********In 10 years, we will have to accommodate 3 million children in schools. This means an increase in the number of teachers from 35,000 to 100,000, and in the number of schools from 8,000 to 20,000. . . .  'A New Era' **********The dissolution of the Soviet bloc allows for the opening of a new era after decades of polarization. But it is our responsibility to protect peace in the heart of our states. Between 1989 and 1992, we have seen 82 armed conflicts; only 3 were between nations. **********Domestically, institutionalized violence has sparked not civil war but really genocide. Today still, despite the presence of a multinational force, acts of violence toward the people are continuing. The disarming of paramilitary groups, namely Fraph and their attaches, is indispensible for peace to prevail throughout the country. **********Lavalas brings a message of peace. Weapons have to be silenced for us to have peace. . . ."

Mr. Pole grabbed the radio and called for the police. **********Fifteen minutes later two overloaded buses groaned up the hill, with Mr. Pole's car between them and a police escort. It was not enough. As the convoy passed beneath the bluff, there were gunshots and a shower of heavy rocks. The bus windows exploded in on the terrified passengers. **********The injuries were minor, but the message was clear: elections can be dangerous. **********In the last two weeks, since the Zulu nationalists of the Inkatha Freedom Party called on their followers to defy the April election, the country's first nonracial vote, the monitors who serve as the early warning system in this polarized region say they have felt a seismic shift. **********Among the magnificent rolling hills of tropical green and red clay, where the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu is scattered in fragments across the province of Natal, one settlement after another has erupted in fresh outbreaks of killing and house-burning. **********But worse than that, the monitors say, they see an ominous pattern: attacks by Inkatha partisans are more audacious, more concerted, more coordinated. Observers Grow Fearful **********In the nonpartisan network of violence monitors, mediating committees, and pre-election observers, the men and women who promote peace on the front lines say they are increasingly powerless to defuse local conflicts, and fear they may be targets themselves. **********This week, for the first time, a peace monitor was killed on the job, ending three years of tacit immunity. **********Monitors from several groups said they had pleaded with Pretoria to send troops to the volatile areas around Durban. While the KwaZulu homeland police and some units of the South African Police are widely regarded as partial to Inkatha, the army is trusted. **********""All the monitoring groups are feeling desperate about the situation,"" said Jenni Irish, national coordinator of the Scandinavian-financed Network of Independent Monitors, the most seasoned of the anti-violence organizations. ""How bad does it have to get before it's considered an extreme crisis?"" **********One army unit arrived this week with six armored vehicles to patrol the hills north of Durban, but the soldiers do not intervene unless the police request help. **********Many monitors speculate that the authorities are letting the province degenerate until there is wide public support for taking over KwaZulu from its chief minister, the Inkatha leader, Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi. **********""Maybe it's for the best, but they're playing with people's lives,"" said one frustrated monitor. **********The latest wave of killing began two weeks ago, when the Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelethini, announced he ""cannot advise my people"" to take part in the elections, and called upon Zulus to defend their sovereignty. **********Since then, armed Inkatha loyalists have twice occupied stadiums booked for African National Congress rallies, setting off raging gunfights. **********In townships from northern KwaZulu to the Indian Ocean coast, monitors said, groups of armed men have attacked communities where congress supporters live. In some cases, informants have told the monitors, the assailants arrived by bus wearing khaki outfits -- the uniforms of a new, 5,000-man Inkatha ""self-defense"" force. **********The monitors' suspicions of Inkatha gained weight last week when a judicial commission disclosed evidence that the South African and KwaZulu police had collaborated with Zulu nationalists in organizing assassination squads and terrorism. Reputation for Impartiality **********Many of the monitors come from anti-apartheid organizations that tend to be sympathetic to the African National Congress, but in the last few years they have developed a strong reputation as impartial. **********They make up what may be the most elaborate network of intermediaries in any country not formally at war, working in embattled neighborhoods as witnesses, mediators or investigators, usually wearing distinctive colored vests and caps. **********The Network of Independent Monitors includes South Africans and Swedes and Norwegians, who not only patrol restive areas but also investigate violence and sometimes try to defuse tense situations. The multi-party Peace Committees, which include members of rival parties as well as the police, church groups and other organizations, have operatives who try to mediate local conflicts of all types. **********There are newcomers trained by the Independent Electoral Commission, whose focus is entirely on the election campaign and voting. And there are the ""internationals,"" from the United Nations, European Community and other agencies, who only observe. **********Isaac Shandu was a 55-year-old Inkatha supporter who worked for the Peace Committee near Durban. In a line of work that sometimes attracts naive do-gooders, Mr. Shandu was a well-connected operator who had made a fortune, been shot, found God and knew everyone, from Zulu chiefs to police constables to gangsters. **********Tuesday night someone stopped his car and shot him dead in an Inkatha-controlled area south of Durban. **********The killers and motive were unknown, but the killing caused the Peace Committees to restrict their travel in black townships and alarmed monitors for other groups, especially the Independent Electoral Commission. **********Stephanie Miller, who hired Mr. Shandu and who identified his body, said Inkatha has stopped showing up for Peace Committee meetings, stopped letting monitors in some areas, even stopped returning phone calls. A Charge of Bias **********True, said John Aulesbrook, Inkatha's chairman for Durban and nearby townships, because the Peace Committees are ""biased"" and their meetings ""are used by the A.N.C. to identify our people for assassination."" **********The solution to the escalating conflict in Natal, he added, is to postpone the elections and yield to Inkatha's demands for an autonomous province. **********""The violence is getting worse because the A.N.C., after its success in Bophuthatswana, has picked this time to destabilize Natal,"" he said. ""In response, the Zulu people are preparing themselves for a civil war."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/28/business/bell-atlantic-set-to-offer-wireless-data-service.html,Edmund Andrews,1994-04-28,,551,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bell Atlantic Set to Offer Wireless Data Service,Bell Atlantic Set to Offer Wireless Data Service," **********In the first big commercial introduction of wireless data services over cellular telephone systems, the Bell Atlantic Corporation is set to offer a new technology that can be used for tasks like verifying credit cards or sending electronic messages over the air. **********The technology -- known as cellular digital packet data or C.D.P.D. -- has been under development throughout the industry. Using a new approach to send packets of data alongside the voice signals of regular telephone conversations, the technology could sharply reduce the cost of wireless data links and open up a host of new applications. **********Despite considerable publicity last year, however, some cellular companies have run into snags in making the technology commercially available, causing some industry skeptics to question its readiness.  McCaw Hit Snags **********McCaw Cellular Communications, the nation's biggest cellular operator, had hoped to have the same kind of service available in many markets by this time. But it has slipped behind schedule and has attributed much of the delay to late equipment deliveries by manufacturers. **********Bell Atlantic executives put some of those doubts to rest today, disclosing both the prices they intend to charge and a list of computer software companies that are developing particular services for customers. A formal announcement of the technology is scheduled for Thursday. **********The Lotus Development Corporation has developed a new version of its popular electronic mail program, cc: Mail, that operates over the cellular packet system. Wireless Systems Inc. of Baltimore is developing vehicle-tracking systems that allow companies to monitor the location of trucks or cars. **********Bell Atlantic, which is based in Philadelphia, has also forged alliances with a number of smaller companies that already develop wireless communication systems for specialized purposes, such as linking a sales force or processing insurance claims. **********""We're pretty excited,"" said Benjamin L. Scott, chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic Mobile, the company's cellular subsidiary. ""There are a lot of people who believe C.D.P.D. offers a breakthrough because we are able to overlay it on the original cellular network at an added cost of only 5 to 10 percent of our original investment."" Data 'Packets' to Be Sent **********The new wireless data links will initially be available in Washington, Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Instead of dialing up a number and securing a full cellular channel to send a message, the new system sends each message as a series of electronic envelopes or ""packets,"" each of which contains an address for its destination. These packets are slipped in between the voice signals of ordinary cellular telephone users. **********Customers will typically pay a few cents for each message, which is far cheaper than paying for the use of an ordinary cellular telephone channel with a minute or more of airtime. Because cellular companies already have more than 13 million customers nationwide, industry analysts believe the widespread deployment of C.D.P.D. should accelerate the growth of wireless data. **********The Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that wireless data services will grow tenfold over the next five years, to $3.8 billion in 1998 from about $370 million in 1993. **********""This has the potential to take wireless data into the mainstream,"" said Roberta Wiggins, director of wireless mobile communications at the Yankee Group."

Partly as a result of his efforts, NCR and AT&T have paid millions of dollars in customer claims in the last decade, and new cases are still piling up. **********As in other businesses, customer lawsuits are not all that unusual against computer companies. But in this booming field of litigation, which has already spawned a cottage industry of well-paid expert witnesses and technology-savvy lawyers, Mr. Cohen has emerged as the rare specialist. **********Not only does he derive almost his entire livelihood from finding fault with one company and its products, in contrast to most other expert witnesses he is an active instigator of litigation. **********""I know of no one else in this industry who focuses like that on one company,"" said Frank Dzubeck, a computer industry consultant in Washington who has himself occasionally served as an expert witness in corporate computer litigation. **********Mr. Cohen runs ads in publications like The Wall Street Journal and The National Law Journal soliciting ""unhappy NCR customers,"" and boasting that ""our clients have received judgments against NCR ranging from $500,000 to $30 million."" **********He also writes directly to many corporate customers, outlining problems that others have had and urging them to hire him as a consultant or expert witness. And he places numerous calls to reporters and editors in the trade press and at daily newspapers -- including The New York Times -- proposing negative articles about NCR computers. **********AT&T, meanwhile, has begun firing back by spreading unflattering -- if sometimes irrelevant -- personal information about Mr. Cohen's past. AT&T officials also attack Mr. Cohen -- who resigned as an NCR computer salesman in 1980 after being demoted as a sales manager -- as an opportunist. **********""We think his self-interest is self-evident,"" said Mark Siegel, a spokesman for AT&T Global Information Solutions, as NCR is now formally known. ""The more people he gets to sue AT&T Global Information Solutions, the more money he makes."" **********Although Mr. Cohen prefers to keep his tips to reporters off the record, if pressed he will speak for attribution to rattle a few NCR skeletons. ""Had they known then what they know now, many customers would have seriously re-evaluated their decision to purchase an NCR system,"" Mr. Cohen said last week in a telephone interview. **********But when asked to comment about his personal role in battling AT&T, Mr. Cohen insists that the story is not about him. **********Mr. Cohen's fans consider him a hero who rescued them from problem-plagued computer systems and what they say was a wall of indifference at NCR. **********""It was manna from heaven,"" said Stuart L. Goldfaden, chief financial officer of Trans America Auto Parts in Gardena, Calif. Trans America sued NCR several years ago over a computerized inventory system, Warehouse Manager, which NCR pulled from the market after complaints from many of the several dozen customers who spent $180,000 for the product. **********""He gave us the confidence to understand that the problems we were having weren't our fault,"" Mr. Goldfaden said. ""He gave us the courage of our convictions."" He also helped Mr. Goldfaden's company win an out-of-court settlement whose dollar amount, by agreement of the parties, has not been disclosed. **********Mr. Cohen is paid by the hour, and sometimes also on a contingency basis, receiving a percentage of a settlement paid by AT&T. He declines to discuss how lucrative his business has been. **********Having done work for nearly two dozen companies that sued over Warehouse Manager, Mr. Cohen is on a new campaign. Now he is soliciting more than 30 small banks and savings institutions that bought an NCR product called the Universal Financial System in the late 1980's and early 90's. **********Because of many problems that turned up in the financial transaction system, which sold for $300,000 to $1 million, only 21 are still in use. In June 1993, AT&T agreed to pay $818,000 to the Warwick Savings Bank in Warwick, N.Y., after a private arbitration proceeding in which the bank had accused NCR of fraudulently inducing it to buy a system that was missing important features. **********Mr. Cohen did not represent Warwick Savings. But based on that case he has recruited several clients, including Central National Bank and Trust in Enid, Okla. Central National has filed suit against AT&T, asserting that NCR engaged in fraud and misrepresentation in selling the system. **********Executives of AT&T, which acquired NCR in 1991, acknowledge that some of the computer systems at issue have had serious problems. But they say most of the trouble stemmed from software written for an older generation of NCR computers and whose use required intimate knowledge of NCR's own technology. **********""We acknowledge very freely that in its original releases the software had a number of bugs,"" conceded Jerre L. Stead, president of AT&T Global Information Solutions. ""The implementation of complex software like this requires on-site programming support, and I take full responsibility for any misunderstanding about that."" **********In casting Mr. Cohen as a man intent on dredging up old problems, AT&T executives have bent over backward to discredit Mr. Cohen's past. They note, for example, that in 1969, while he was in his early 20's, Mr. Cohen was convicted in Pennsylvania and spent several months in prison for ""pandering"" and collecting ""bawd money"" -- legalese for the act of soliciting customers for prostitutes. **********He was pardoned by Gov. Milton J. Shapp of Pennsylvania in 1978, though the details are unclear. Mr. Cohen, who acknowledged the basic facts of the case, declined to discuss it. But he did follow up by faxing a written comment, ""The issues occurred in the distant past, and NCR is only raising them to attack my credibility."" **********Mr. Siegel, the AT&T spokesman, said the company was justified in digging up dirt. ""You have to know who you're dealing with,"" he said. **********After he left NCR in 1980, having worked at the company 11 years, Mr. Cohen spent a few years installing computer systems of different makes. Then, in 1982, a different sort of opportunity presented itself. **********Mr. Cohen was recruited as an expert witness for lawyers representing a California chain of dry cleaners, Glovatorium Inc., which was suing NCR over an accounting system called Spirit. Mr. Cohen testified that while he was still at NCR he had told his own superiors about bugs in Spirit. His testimony helped to build the case that the company had knowingly withheld important information from the customer. A jury awarded Glovatorium $2.3 million in damages. **********Over the next few years, Mr. Cohen became involved as an expert witness in other NCR cases. And by the early 1990's, he had begun advertising as a boutique that specialized in complaints against NCR. **********Some of the banks Mr. Cohen has contacted about the Universal Financial System say they are grateful for his help. ""We bought the system based on the fact they they had a mortgage-processing module,"" said Fred Doud, executive vice president of Central National, the Oklahoma bank that has filed suit. ""It wasn't there when we bought it. When we finally got it in October of 1990 and tested it, it didn't work."" **********But other bankers solicited by Mr. Cohen say that in attacking NCR's Universal Financial System, he is dredging up old disputes. **********""The problem we have with joining such a suit is that we are operating the system successfully today,"" said Thomas G. Leek, senior vice president of the Citizens Saving Bank in Salineville, Ohio. **********""That's not to say there weren't snags -- big ones,"" he added. ""But it's the responsibility of a bank to make sure that what they are using works."""

Efforts to Win Major Contracts **********The contract also bolsters the prospects for tiny Broadband Technologies, which will supply the fiber optic backbone for the AT&T system. The company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has staked its future on winning major contracts from regional telephone companies, although its sole contract before today's announcement was for a $100 million test project for Bell Atlantic. **********""The significance for us is it's yet another telephone company recognizing the value of switched digital video technology,"" said Salim Bhatia, president and chief executive. **********Broadband shares rose 15 percent yesterday to $18.125, up $2.375, on volume of 1.3 million shares. A Southwestern Bell Telephone spokesman, Paul Dusseault, said the company had not selected a vendor for converter boxes and other equipment to be installed in customers' homes. **********Southwestern Bell declined to say how much it plans to spend on the Richardson network, which will link 47,000 households by early 1997. In its 1993 prospectus, Broadband said its system would cost about $1,150 a household, meaning the project could cost more than $40 million. **********Mr. Bhatia said the technology has evolved since then, however, and with AT&T supplying certain unspecified components, system cost will be significantly lower. **********""We have found that by working with AT&T we can dramatically improve price performance,"" Mr. Bhatia said. **********Broadband was an early proponent of so-called fiber-to-the-curb technology, which utilizes high-capacity fiber optic cables to distribute information to ""nodes"" at the neighborhood level. AT&T's Network Systems unit has been winning major contracts from telephone companies lately by proposing a less expensive ""hybrid fiber-coax"" architecture that uses fiber optic trunk lines to distribute voice and data to groups of as many as 500 homes, then distributing the signals through coaxial lines identical to those used by cable television companies. **********Southwestern Bell said it plans to begin construction by the end of this year. The network first will be used to provide telephone service, although Southwestern Bell hopes to use it for a market test by its Southwestern Bell Video Services unit by mid-1995. The company plans to have all 47,000 homes wired by early 1997. **********The entire project hinges upon approval by the Federal Communications Commission. And to provide video programming -- one of the most profitable uses for the network -- Southwestern Bell must be freed from Federal laws prohibiting regional phone companies from providing such services."

W orld's Leading Opium Source **********Myanmar, formerly Burma, is the source of most of the world's opium, the raw material of heroin. And most of the opium grown in Myanmar is cultivated in rugged mountain areas controlled by Khun Sa, who was indicted on narcotics charges in the United States in 1989. **********The junta reported last month that fighting since May with Khun Sa's army, which doubles as a rebel force of the Shan ethnic group, had taken the lives of 250 rebels and 196 Government soldiers. **********""We've begun to hurt him,"" said Lieut. Col. Kyaw Thein, a spokesman for the Burmese junta's anti-narcotics program. ""If we can, we would like to destroy Khun Sa's army and wipe it off the map."" U.S. Help Sought **********But he said Myanmar would need help from the United States, which has cut off all aid to the junta, including military assistance, to protest human rights violations. The nation's leading dissident, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is about to enter her sixth year under house arrest in Yangon, formerly Rangoon. Her political party, the National League for Democracy, won national elections in 1990, but the junta refused to turn over power to the elected legislature. **********""We alone cannot do this job,"" Colonel Kyaw Thein said of drug war. ""If the U.S. really wants Khun Sa to be wiped out of this area, the first thing they will need to do is help us with arms and ammunition. We cannot buy any of that sort of thing."" **********Since 1990, the Burmese Army has received a trove of weapons, worth an estimated $1 billion, from China, the country's closest ally. But Burmese officials say the Chinese-made arsenal of jet fighters, ships and tanks is of no use in battle in the mountainous terrain controlled by Khun Sa. ""What we need from America are helicopters and smaller arms, which we can use in the mountains,"" a military officer said. Rebel Truces Reached **********In the last two years, the army has reached cease-fire agreements with several ethnic rebel groups, allowing it to concentrate on Khun Sa after several years of waging only a nominal campaign against him. **********In its most recent annual report on drug trafficking in Myanmar, the State Department accused the junta of ""only minimal narcotics law enforcement."" The report was critical of peace settlements between the junta and two ethnic groups, the Wa and the Kokang, that will permit the groups to continue harvesting opium for at least several years. **********Western diplomats and human rights groups have questioned whether settlements with some of the opium-cultivating ethnic groups were intended in part to allow military officers to share in the huge proceeds from the drug trade. **********The State Department report cited reliable accounts of ""police, customs and army personnel who are paid to acquiesce or participate in drug trafficking,"" although it said there were only ""occasional, unsubstantiated allegations of corruption among senior Burmese officials."""

It's not ""The Twilight Zone,"" it's ""The Neighborhood Spot."" **********Time Warner City Cable Advertising -- which sells commercial time on three cable systems in New York City, reaching nearly a million households -- has introduced an innovative series of 60-second commercials, produced in a feature format, called ""The Neighborhood Spot."" The initial commercials began appearing in mid-May and are scheduled to run through this week. **********Each ""Neighborhood Spot"" presents two genial hosts, Glen Hoffman and Danielle Ganek, who offer a 10-second tribute to a neighborhood, then tour three shops there. Their fast-paced banter invites those watching to come by and, of course, bring money. The first three commercials are sponsored by nine retailers in the SoHo section of Manhattan, whose names and addresses are superimposed over the scenes shot in their stores. **********The commercials, which cost each participating retailer $15,000, are intended to offer small businesses that advertise predominantly in print an opportunity to buy commercial time on television, which might otherwise be prohibitively expensive for them. Indeed, most of the nine SoHo retailers, selling merchandise like home furnishings, apparel and footwear, are first-time television advertisers. **********""By allowing them to share the cost, it's a way to test the medium,"" Denise Silverberg, senior director of strategic planning for Time Warner City Cable, said in a recent interview. **********""It's something the print medium has done, traditionally,"" she noted, referring to localized and zoned ad vehicles in newspapers, magazines and telephone directories. ""Why not bring it to television, adding sight and sound?"" **********The commercials are being created in-house by Elaine Gold, vice president and executive producer for television production at Time Warner City Cable, and Mr. Hoffman, who, when not playing host on screen, is the manager of commercial production. **********The slick, infomercial qualities of the spots -- Ms. Gold refers to them as ""advertainment"" -- may confuse some viewers into thinking they are segments of an unusually brief news magazine program rather than paid sales pitches. **********Still, the soft-sell, low-key nature of the spots is a welcome relief from the incessant yammering endemic to commercials for local retailers like auto dealers and consumer electronics stores. **********""It's not easy for locally based businesses to see a broader view and get beyond the hard sell they think belongs in local advertising,"" Mr. Hoffman said. **********Participants in ""The Neighborhood Spot"" say they are pleased. **********""The way it was packaged up made it very simple for us to do,"" said David Kosh, an agent for Molinari, a furniture manufacturer in Tione, Italy, that supplies merchandise for a store that appears in one spot, Sofa So Good, at 106 Wooster Street. He added that he and Cristina Revilla, the president of Sofa So Good, had ""noted a big increase in business."" **********Art Errickson, an executive vice president of Avirex Ltd. in Long Island City, Queens, praised the way the commercials ""zeroed in on the neighborhood."" He heads the mail-order catalogue and retail store division, which includes the Cockpit, at 595 Broadway, which appears in a second spot. **********That spot includes a quick glimpse of Al Nassour, the manager of the Cockpit store. ""He's like Mujibur and Sirajul,"" Mr. Errickson said, laughing, referring to Mujibur Rahman and Sirajul Islam, the shop managers who regularly turn up on CBS's ""Late Show With David Letterman."" **********Larry Fischer, president of Time Warner City Cable, said the positive responses to ""The Neighborhood Spot"" had him considering ""some sort of long-form programming idea,"" like segments, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes long, that would focus on advertisers in entertainment, food, fashion and restaurants. **********Meantime, the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side will be next in the ""Neighborhood Spot"" spotlight. Because neither area is a magnet for visitors, tourists and shoppers the way SoHo is, Mr. Fischer said, ""it will be interesting to see if"" the commercials help persuade ""people to travel crosstown to buy shoes for their kids for school."" **********The next batch of advertisers will include Harry's Shoes and the Charivari and Cosmetics Plus chains, he said."

Touched off by fears of renewed inflation in the United States and continuing weakness in the dollar, stocks on the benchmark DAX index fell 2.51 percent and bonds had one of their worst days in weeks. **********""Everyone is bearish on the dollar,"" said Jeff Hochman, a strategic analyst at Deutsche Bank. ""And unfortunately, as goes the dollar these days, so go German stocks and bonds."" This is in part because a weaker dollar creates a stronger mark, which makes the exports upon which German industries depend more expensive abroad. **********The dollar hit another two-year low here during the day at 1.4853 marks, moving up at the end of trading here and in New York, ending the day there at 1.4970 marks. But German analysts saw little reason for the dollar not to drop again. **********At a semiannual ceremony in which six research institutes issue a joint economic forecast for the Government, five of the six said the economy would grow 2.5 percent this year -- up from a projection six months ago of 1.5 percent growth in the economy. **********They projected that overall growth in 1995 would be 3 percent, that western Germany would grow 2.5 percent, and that eastern Germany -- which is being rebuilt through infusions of aid from western Germans -- would grow 8.5 percent. **********The sole dissent came from the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin, which predicted much slower growth. **********The institutes also said that unemployment in both parts of the country would come down, but very slowly. German joblessness reached a high of four million workers in January and is expected to fall to 3.72 million by year's end, and only to 3.6 million by the end of 1995. That still represents a persistently high jobless rate for Germany of 9.3 percent. **********""In the west and east, the fall of employment and the growth of unemployment has come to a standstill,"" the report said. **********Though the economic analysis is made by nongovernmental institutes, it is done for the Government in Bonn. Officials of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's administration were quick to say that the findings reinforced their economic policies, and opposition politicians, quick to parry such contentions. **********But the report emphasized that the German recovery could be brought to a quick halt by either tax increases or high wage increases from next year's labor negotiations. **********The institutes also called on the Government to cut taxes and spur investment and consumer demand. **********But the markets here today were not excessively influenced by the report. Their concern has been that the United States economy is growing so fast that the Federal Reserve will raise American interest rates again in an effort to dampen inflation. **********For now, a stock analyst at a big German bank said, no one wants to buy dollars. **********""There is a lot to be worried about right now,"" the analyst said. ""The main concern is the trend of United States interest rates. As long as that is the main concern, there is nothing to cheer about in the equities market."""

The drug company employs about 1,250 worldwide. Jersey City Move **********The Lewco Securities Corporation is among the latest financial services companies to leave Manhattan for the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City. Lewco, a joint venture of Wertheim Schroeder Inc. and Hambrecht & Quist Inc., does stock clearing paperwork for the two securities companies. **********In a move that will provide 50 percent more space, Lewco is taking 75,234 square feet at the Harborside Financial Center, a 1.9-million-square-foot complex next to the Exchange Place PATH station. **********The lease is valued at about $24 million for its 15-year term, said Martin Turchin, vice chairman of Edward S. Gordon, which represented the tenant in the transaction. **********The company is moving to Harborside, a 10-story complex completed in 1989, largely because it is in a state-designated urban enterprise zone, Mr. Turchin said. Computers and other equipment and supplies bought and used in such zones are exempt from sales tax. Also, Lewco's real estate taxes will be fixed at $2 a square foot annually for 15 years because of its zone status, he said. That is less than half the cost of Manhattan real estate taxes, he said. Lewco's offices are at 2 Broadway, where the lease is expiring. The move, scheduled for October, will involve 375 employees. **********Harborside, owned by a U S West pension fund, is 95 percent leased, said Charles Simberg, chief executive of the complex, said. New tenants are paying $22 to $24 a square foot in annual rent, he said. Calvin Klein Expansion **********In a big expansion, the Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company, which makes and distributes the Obsession and Eternity fragrance lines, is taking an additional 310,000 square feet at the International Trade Center in Mount Olive, N.J. **********The fragrance company now has a 142,550-square-foot warehousing and distribution center in a New Jersey foreign trade zone taking up about half the International Trade Center, a 670-acre business park. The company needs room for a manufacturing operation that it plans to move from Wayne, N.J., a company spokeswoman said. ""We want all these operations under one roof for increased efficiency,"" she said. **********The addition will cost about $25 million to build, according to Danielle DeCrette, a spokeswoman for the Rockefeller Group, developer of the business park. Calvin Klein Cosmetics leased the addition for an undisclosed term. The average lease at the business park is 15 years. **********When the addition is completed in February, the company's Mount Olive work force will increase from 100 to 500, including about 340 employees from Wayne, the company spokeswoman said. **********Companies in trade zones can avoid paying duty by importing goods to be assembled in the United States and then exported. If the goods are sold domestically, the companies still have the advantage of postponing payment of duty. With its expansion, Calvin Klein Cosmetics, which is owned by Unilever P.L.C. and uses many imported ingredients in its fragrance blends, will have the largest operation in the trade zone. Other zone tenants are BMW of North America and the Seiko Corporation. The business park is situated off Exit 25 of Interstate 80. Insurer Is Moving **********The Greater New York Mutual Insurance Company, a commercial property and casualty insurer with $400 million in assets, is taking 66,895 square feet of office space at 200 Madison Avenue, between 35th and 36th Streets. The lease term is 11 years and two months. **********The insurer is moving partly because it wants its corporate headquarters to be on fewer floors, said Kathleen Wit, an associate director at Julien J. Studley, which represented the tenant. The company now occupies 60,000 square feet on seven levels at 215 Lexington Avenue. At 200 Madison Avenue, the insurer will occupy part of the second and the entire third floor of the 25-story building. **********The move, scheduled for October, will involve 225 employees, Peter Lencsis, a vice president of the insurance company, said.

But his resignation marked a turning point in the country's move toward political renewal and the possible installation of a new political class to replace the Christian Democratic-dominated Governments that ran the land for four decades. **********With Mr. Ciampi's resignation, President Scalfaro can now dissolve Parliament. Constitutionally, new elections may then be held after 70 days, offering Italians their first chance to vote on a national level since the corruption scandal began in Italy almost two years ago. 3,000 Investigated in Scandal **********Since then, more than 3,000 politicians and businessmen have been formally investigated in a huge kickback scandal involving bribes for government contracts. **********The big question after Mr. Ciampi's resignation was when and how Mr. Scalfaro, himself a Christian Democrat, would react to it. Many Italian analysts predicted that the President, whose largely ceremonial role now assumes much greater importance, would quickly dissolve Parliament, announce an election date and possibly name Mr. Ciampi as acting prime minister to run the country until the vote. **********But with Mr. Scalfaro himself facing accusations of wrongdoing during an earlier spell as Interior Minister, and with his Christian Democratic colleagues desperate for time to regroup, it remained uncertain when he would decide on his course of action. **********Apart from dissolving Parliament and calling new elections, Mr. Scalfaro has the option of rejecting Mr. Ciampi's resignation, or of accepting it and naming a new prime minister to try to put together a new coalition. President to Consult **********Mr. Scalfaro, who has denied the accusations against him, said tonight that he would hold a round of consultations with parliamentary leaders beginning Friday before deciding. **********The corruption scandal has been blamed for driving hundreds of thousands of Italian voters away from the Christian Democrats and other parties in the coalition since the last national vote in April 1992. **********Since then, perennial opposition parties like the Democratic Party of the Left, as the former Communists are now known, the separatist Northern League and even the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement have surged to the fore in local votes. **********In new national elections, analysts predict that as many as two-thirds of the 900-plus members of Parliament could lose their seats, and thus their immunity from prosecution. About one-fifth of the current Parliament is under investigation on accusations ranging from corruption to dealings with the Mafia. **********The earliest an election could be held is March 20, but for technical reasons, a delay of just a few days by President Scalfaro in announcing the ballot could put the vote back to April 10. Some Christian Democrats want it put off until June while the party tries to remold its image, change its name and fight for a comeback. Opposition Favors Early Vote **********Reform-minded groups like the former Communists and the Northern League say they favor an early vote. **********""I cannot but take note of the profound division in Parliament,"" Mr. Ciampi told legislators today, arguing that differences among them raised ""a question over the conditions indispensable for further productive work by Parliament."" **********Today's final parliamentary debate had initially been scheduled as prelude to a confidence vote on Mr. Ciampi's Government. When it became obvious that Mr. Ciampi would survive the confidence vote, the legislators who supported it withdrew the motion and no vote was taken. **********If he had lost the confidence motion, the political crisis would have been extended while a replacement government was sought. By surviving the challenge, Mr. Ciampi was able to pursue his oft-repeated intention to resign and force new elections. Passed Electoral Reform **********Mr. Ciampi was appointed Prime Minister last April after a national referendum in which Italians voted overwhelmingly to overhaul their political system. One of his principal qualifications was that he had no visible ties to the Christian Democrats or the Socialists, the two largest parties in the coalitions that have run the land for decades, carving up power and patronage between them. **********During his tenure, he forced Parliament to pass a crucial electoral reform, scrapping the proportional representation from which political parties traditionally drew immense power and replacing it with a majority voting system similar to those of other European countries. **********At the same time, his Government took the first steps toward selling off to private buyers parts of the huge state industrial and business sector, which ranges from supermarkets to airlines and which provided the old guard with a gigantic pork barrel. **********When, last month, Parliament approved an austerity budget for 1994, Mr. Ciampi said he had completed the tasks set for him, so his work was done."

The training program lasts a week, and this group of Xerox students certainly seems to be getting the message. Mr. Nelson, a district business manager in Hartford, and his colleagues speak fluently of ""digital solutions"" in business and the need for the copier company to ""capture the benefits of digital technology."" **********The corporate reeducation is a critical step in Xerox's strategy to bring its copier business into the computer revolution. Clearly, the old days of simply selling copiers and then enjoying the annuity income from continuing sales of paper, toner and service are rapidly receding. Today, when an office worker wants a few copies of a memo or letter, the person is as likely to push the ""print"" button on a personal computer a couple of times as walk over to a machine and make duplicates. **********The ease of PC printing is just one example of the inroads digital technology has made in the office. Xerox has not only recognized the necessity of overhauling its electromechanical machines. It is pursuing an ambitious plan to digitize the corporate world's paperwork, trying to capture much of the business market for copying and printing. To signal the shift, Xerox is now calling itself ""The Document Company"" -- no mere copy machine maker -- and has adopted a new logo (a single X partly printed in digital-style squares). **********The strategy began in 1990, when Xerox introduced mammoth machines called Docutechs, which cost up to $300,000 each. They scan paper documents and convert them into the 1's and 0's of digital code. Once in digital form, the coded text or pictures can be easily stored, modified, printed or sent over computer networks. **********The Docutechs have proved a success, with sales expected to reach $1.5 billion this year. Yet Xerox still depends on traditional stand-alone copiers for 80 percent of its core nonfinancial-service business revenues of more than $14 billion. By 2005, the company predicts, digital products will account for the majority of its business. **********To help get there, Xerox has introduced a flurry of new digital printers, copiers and scanners in recent months. The company has also introduced software, which it calls the Document Services Platform, to link its machines over computer networks, allowing them to communicate with each other and with the machines made by other companies. **********To broaden the potential market for its document-imaging technology, Xerox has formed alliances with a bevy of computer software and service companies including Microsoft, Novell, Sun Microsystems, E.D.S., Lotus, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. These projects are intended to insure that Xerox offerings work with those of other vendors. As is so common in today's computer business, some of the alliance partners, like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, are also competitors. **********The Xerox digital strategy will make it more like a computer company. And indeed, Xerox has a rich legacy in the computer industry -- a curious blend of innovation and failure. **********Once, Xerox had visions of becoming a computer company. Roughly 25 years ago, its executives searched almost frantically for a computer company to buy. It even took made a bid for the Digital Equipment Company. Eventually, Xerox did buy a computer maker, Scientific Data Systems, but that quickly became a financial millstone. **********Later in the 1970's, Xerox developed the first personal computer with a mouse and icon-based software at its Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC. Steven Jobs toured the centered, recognized the prototype as the future of personal computing, and built that future as well as a personal fortune at Apple Computer Inc. **********This time, Xerox executives hope they have found a formula for success by working hand-in-hand with the computer industry instead of competing toe-to-toe in it. **********""The most important thing to understand is that our strategy now is fundamentally different than our digital strategies of the past,"" said Peter van Cuylenberg, a computer industry veteran Xerox hired last year to manage its leap into information networks. **********Today, analysts say Xerox should be in a strong position to push its high-tech plans because it has put its own house in order. For years, the fear at Xerox headquarters in Stamford, Conn., had been that something would replace dry copying as thoroughly as xerography obliterated the messy, wet systems that proceeded it. **********IN fact, the real threat came in 1970's from companies like Canon and Ricoh, beating Xerox in its own bailiwick. In the 1980's, after losing business to Japanese rivals, Xerox made big strides in improving its quality and lowering its production costs. **********So the company has managed to confine the Japanese competition to smaller copiers and Xerox remains the dominant supplier of large machines, which are more profitable. Today, the company is acknowledged to have the broadest product line in the business, ranging from simple copiers and fax machines costing $300 to high speed printers capable of printing, collating and binding books at close to $300,000. **********Yet when its copier business appeared to be faltering in the 1980's, Xerox made a foray into insurance and other financial services. ""It was an unprofitable distraction,"" noted Jack L. Kelly, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Now, Xerox is gradually trying to sell off its insurance business, and concentrating on moving into the computer age with its basic business -- which, properly managed, is a lucrative business indeed. Last year Xerox's core non-financial services business earned $620 million, or $5.46 a share before special charges reflecting the costs of its restructuring program, aimed at reducing its work force by 10,000 people. This year, analysts estimate the company will earn $6.70 a share and the consensus is that will rise to $8.30 a share next year. **********The company's stock price, which was under $40 a share as recently as 1990, has risen steadily since, peaking at $112.75 in October. It has since slid to the mid-90's in a generally down market. **********WITH its digital strategy, Xerox is looking to enlarge its hold on the office copying and printing market. At one end, the company wants to regain the copying chores of a few documents at a time that it is now losing to the personal computer printer. But at the other end, Xerox is going after the offset printing business. **********Already, the very nature of printing is changing, with xerographic printers eating into the market that is now dominated by offset, particularly for runs of 5,000 copies or fewer. **********To cut costs, companies today seek to take a just-in-time approach to document management, just as they have in manufacturing. They want to avoid filling warehouses with expensive and easily outdated sales literature and training manuals when the relevant files can be stored electronically, transmitted where needed and printed only as needed. **********In industry parlance, the shift is from ""print, then distribute"" to ""distribute, then print."" Xerox estimates the market for electronic printing amounted to $20 billion in North America and Europe last year and said it appears to be growing at 15 percent a year. And the increasing use of color documents in offices should boost that business even further. Without digital controls, Xerox officials say it is hard to hold color values during production runs. **********Xerox executives, understandably, insist that the company's analog copying business is alive and well, and will be for some time. But its strategy means that Xerox must manage two different businesses, and that promises to be a tricky challenge. **********""The pitfall is that management will often take the wrong advice,"" said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston. ""New markets are never as completely certain as old ones, and you are not sure of your relationships."" **********THE other big challenge is to craft a strategy that can maintain Xerox's high profit margins. For as the personal computer industry has shown, digital technology tends to drive products toward commodity pricing, except for the companies that own essential technology standards, like Intel and Microsoft. **********In an interview, Paul A. Allaire, the chairman and chief executive of Xerox, conceded that was inevitable that lower end products will be like commodities and sell on price alone. But in digital networks, he said the company believes it can sustain a competitive advantage -- and higher magins. **********""We believe that we can sustain an advantage by taking a systemic approach to hardware, software and systems support that will be hard for our competitors to match,"" Mr. Allaire said. ""You can not make a commodity out of a system."" **********Retraining the company's 15,000-person corporate sales force is vital if Xerox is to refashion itself as a supplier of digital copying and printing systems. At the recent session in the Virginia training center, district managers like Mr. Nelson were being schooled in meeting with corporate chief information officers to identify productivity bottlenecks and suggest solutions. **********In the past, explained Steve Alves, one of the instructors, Xerox sold machines and not much more. ""Now we want our managers to meet with higher-level executives that sales representatives can't reach,"" he added. ""We want to understand what a company's critical success factors are, so we don't try to automate a bad process."" **********Armed with a looseleaf notebook about 4 inches thick, Mr. Nelson and his peers are encouraged to study the business of prospective customers to see where they might make suggestions about improving productivity -- and sell a few boxes to companies' chief information officers. Among the course titles are Solutions Selling and Selling in a Consultive Manner. **********""CIO's have a tough job,"" Mr. Van Cuylenberg said. ""They have to buy from different vendors and then try to put everything together in a system. We will tell them that Xerox can cover the whole enterprise in printing and copying."" Mr. Allaire said training will be key in the transition to digital technology. ""Clearly as we become more systems oriented, we will have to change the competency of the direct sales force plus service and administration,"" he said. A LONG BUT FRUSTRATING TRADITION OF INNOVATION **********PERCHED on a hill overlooking Stanford University, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center has long been held up as a prime example of how hard it is to translate cutting edge research into product improvements. **********In addition to the Alto, the first computer designed to be used by a single person, scientists at PARC developed the ""mouse"" hand-held input device, the first graphics-oriented monitor, the first nonexpert word processing program, and the first laser printer. **********All were then developed as products by other companies. **********John Seely Brown, the current head of PARC, who also holds the title of chief scientist of Xerox, argues that today the lab is more tightly coupled with the company's products. **********He said the Xerox digital printers that can spew out 135 pages a minute owe a lot to technology developed a PARC. **********""To print at that speed, you have to process information at high definition television speeds,"" he said. ""This is not a task for boys."" **********One of the overriding goals of the company's research is to keep products simple to operate, no matter how complex they are, Mr. Brown said. ""Our philosophy is to use technology inside the box to keep it simple on the outside."" **********He said the lab employs several research anthropologists and psychologists to study interactions between people and machines in offices. ""Our long-term goal is to bring calmness to the office in contrast to today's information overload."" **********The gap between pony-tailed West Coast computer specialists and the suit-and-tie mechanical engineers who design copiers in Rochester, N.Y., has lessened, Mr. Brown said. This is because of the increasing use of computerized devices to control mechanical operations. ""The boundaries between computational and mechanical have blurred,"" he said."

Raoul Cedras, to move faster to disarm the shadowy paramilitary groups that have long been closely allied with Haiti's military. **********""We think there's just an absolutely needless amount of weapons floating out there,"" General Shalikashvili said. **********He said that the United States would begin a program on Monday to buy back weapons from Haitians and would insist that General Cedras tighten enforcement of Haiti's gun control laws. **********Clinton Administration officials said they had expected incidents like the Cap-Haitien clash, in which United States marines killed Haitian policemen and their paramilitary auxiliaries, known as attaches, in front of the city's police headquarters. **********Responding to the firefight, President Clinton said in a statement: ""We regret any loss of life in connection with our mission in Haiti, but it must be clear that U.S. forces are prepared to respond to hostile action against them and will do so. We will continue to work with Haitian military authorities for a peaceful transition."" **********Many officials in Washington were struggling to learn more about today's incidents in Cap-Haitien, in which the Haitian police deserted their headquarters, barracks and substations and hundreds of Haitians ransacked the police buildings. **********One senior official said that if civil order broke down completely in Cap-Haitien, the country's second-largest city after Port-au-Prince, the Pentagon would probably deploy American troops there to restore order. **********""One might have to do it on a temporary basis until you organize or reorganize some Haitian authorities,"" the official said. **********According to Administration officials, if American troops are used to restore order in Cap-Haitien, Haitian soldiers or policemen, perhaps from other areas, would soon be assigned to take over the day-to-day policing of the city. **********""The Administration is concerned, but has no big problems with the crowd situation in Cap-Haitien,"" said Dennis Boxx, a Pentagon spokesman. ""We'll be there to provide some stability and security, and where it gets out of hand, we'll step in. But we're not to that point in Cap-Haitien."" **********American commanders have said repeatedly over the past week that they do not intend for American forces to be in charge of maintaining basic law and order in Haiti. **********But they have said that under certain circumstances the military might intervene with force to protect themselves, to prevent Haitian security forces from abusing the population, or to control unrest. **********American forces are authorized to shoot at any armed Haitian -- soldier, policeman or someone in plain clothes -- who uses or threatens to use weapons against the Americans. **********American forces may intervene against the Haitian police and military if they observe ""grave abuses that threaten the life of the victim."" But even in such cases the first concern of the Americans should be their own safety, they have been told. **********Finally, the Americans might step in to protect what the Pentagon calls ""essential civic order."" General Shalikashvili has explained that this means the Americans might quell a demonstration, but would not do so ""unless these demonstrations or this level of violence becomes so great that it threatens the overall stability and the security of our multinational forces."" **********Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, pointed to the disorder in Cap-Haitien to defend the Administration's decision to let General Cedras remain in charge for several more weeks with the aim of promoting an orderly transition of power. **********For much of the last week, American officials said they would treat General Cedras as a partner in administering Haiti until he cedes power. But today General Shalikashvili adopted a tough new line toward the head of Haiti's junta. His tone seemed intended to step up pressure on General Cedras to leave Haiti. Former President Jimmy Carter did not win such a commitment in his negotiations with General Cedras last weekend that averted an invasion. Under the agreement, the junta is to yield power by Oct. 15. **********General Shalikashvili said he was convinced that atrocities had occurred under General Cedras's leadership and that ""there's an awful lot of hatred against General Cedras that you can feel when you walk through the streets of Port-au-Prince."" **********He said that this hatred ""won't evaporate"" once General Cedras cedes power and added that he ""cannot imagine"" that the mission of American troops would ever be to protect the Haitian general if he decided to remain in Haiti. **********Several members of Congress, among them Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip, seized on the Cap-Haitien firefight to press President Clinton to withdraw American troops as soon as possible. **********Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview: ""With or without that incident, you would have had calls for bringing the troops out quickly. I suspect that will increase the calls but not markedly. There is substantial Congressional sentiment today to bring them out quickly."" **********Mr. Hamilton said the Democratic leadership in Congress would probably support a deadline of around March 1. When American troops leave, their security role would be turned over to a 6,000-member United Nations mission that would include 2,000 to 3,000 Americans. **********Appearing today on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" Defense Secretary William J. Perry said American forces would remain in Haiti at least until early next year, partly to insure safety during parliamentary elections scheduled for late this year. He reiterated his opposition to any effort by Congress to impose a specific deadline for withdrawal."

Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, commander of the United Nations forces, has chosen negotiation, but NATO pressure to adopt a tougher stance is growing. **********The airport's closing has already depleted food stocks in the city, at a time when their replenishment ahead of the winter was planned. **********Overland aid convoys did start to move again today after being held up for 10 days at Bosnian Serb checkpoints. But of 96,000 tons of food aid that have come into Sarajevo since the beginning of 1993, 81,000 tons came through the airport. **********""The Serbs want their ownership of the airport established, now and in the future, as well as the right to fees for aircraft landing here and the right to control people and goods moving through the airfield,"" one United Nations official said. ""They have combined this demand with a threat to any incoming aircraft."" **********The agreement governing the airport, signed in June 1992, says, ""The parties undertake not to attempt to interfere in any way with the free movement of United Nations Protection Force-supervised air traffic."" **********But General Rose is convinced that the Serbs have the anti-aircraft weapons to make good on their threat, and has decided not to test their will, the officials said. His decision has angered those trying to rebuild Sarajevo, who argue that talks should be held only once planes are flying. **********The airport, to the west of the city, is strategically crucial. It lies between the city center and the one Bosnian-controlled land route out of town -- a road that leads to Mount Igman, which is outside the Serbian siege lines. **********One tunnel under the airport already connects Sarajevo with this road, and another is being built by the Muslim-led Government. With control of the airport, the Serbs could stop the movement of people and goods through these tunnels. The Igman road is already being squeezed because it is under fire from Serbian guns in Ilidza. **********In the longer term, a senior Bosnian Serb official said the Serbs plan to level the airport and build a new downtown area for the Serbian section of Sarajevo there. In this vision of a divided Sarajevo, the Serbs will live on the south bank of the Miljacka River. People loyal to the Bosnian Government will live on the other bank of the Miljacka, he explained, and will be able to use an airport in the nearby town of Visoko.  ""We are building a new airport in Sokolac, and that will be the airport for the Serbs,"" he said.                     --------------------       Belgrade Said to Close Border **********UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3 (Reuters) -- The Secretary General has received formal confirmation that Yugoslavia's closing of its borders with Bosnia is effective, clearing the way for the easing of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, a Security Council source said today. **********Under a Security Council resolution on Sept. 23, some sanctions against Belgrade would be suspended for an initial 100-day period the day after the Security Council receives the report from Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. This would permit the reopening of Belgrade airport and a ferry service between Bar, in Montenegro, and Bari, Italy. **********Comprehensive sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia for assisting the Bosnian Serbs. But the Security Council decided last month to suspend some of the curbs to reward Belgrade for closing its borders to further aid."

Until five months ago, Raymond Roy owned two large factories that produced pots, pans and cans and employed 600 people. **********But now, as a result of the sweeping economic sanctions imposed on Haiti by the United Nations, both are idle and struggling, like virtually all of their compatriots, to adjust to an economy that is gradually grinding to a halt. The effects of the international embargo clearly differ from one sector of Haitian society to another, but no class has been spared. **********For people at the bottom of the ladder, like Ms. Pierre and her neighbors in the sprawling slum of Cite Soleil, the battle has become one of day-to-day survival. Ms. Pierre, 25, said she had not eaten in 36 hours and was reduced to ""asking people for whatever they can afford to give"" for herself and her two small sons. **********Garbage collection in her neighborhood, sporadic even in the best of times, has stopped, she said, because the city argues that gasoline, obtainable only on the black market at more than $8 a gallon, is too expensive to waste on picking up trash. No one can quite remember the last time there was any electricity.  'Life Never Easy' **********""You know, life in Haiti has never been easy,"" said Guiteau Griffin, a 24-year-old street vendor in Cite Soleil who has seen his sales of soap and canned milk drop to one-tenth of their level before the embargo, because his customers no longer have their jobs. ""But it is more difficult right now than it has ever been."" **********Because of the embargo, which is intended to force the resignation of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and the Government he controls in favor of the country's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian economy is largely cut off from the rest of the world. Except for a crucial clandestine trade across the land border with the Dominican Republic and shipments of food and medicine, the country is no longer exporting or importing anything of value, and has been forced to rely on its own very limited resources. **********Nearly three years after Father Aristide was ousted by the military, no one here ventures to predict how much longer Haiti can withstand that economic isolation before a breaking point is reached. It is clear, though, that even smuggled goods are becoming very expensive and that an agreement signed by the Dominican Republic last week to step up patrols along the border will increase the pressure on General Cedras.  Many Sellers, Few Buyers **********At first glance, this country of about seven million people still appears to be pulsing with activity. The markets and sidewalks of the capital, as well as smaller cities like Gonaives or Les Cayes, are crowded with people selling items ranging from vegetables to imported cosmetics. And since food is exempt from the sanctions, supermarket shelves continue to be filled. **********But because unemployment is estimated at more than 50 percent and wages remain low, sellers are many and buyers are few. The economy, Mr. Roy said, has been reduced to ""a thousand women each trying to sell one gallon of gasoline by the side of the road."" **********And despite efforts to accumulate stockpiles of goods before the harshest sanctions went into effect this spring, shortages have begun appearing. **********""Bakeries will soon be shutting down because they can't get yeast,"" said Raymond Lafontant, executive director of the Haitian Industrial Association. Though yeast is not on the list of embargoed products, Mr. Lafontant said, most shipping companies simply do not want to be bothered with long, cumbersome inspections on the high seas.  His Companies Shut Down **********Mr. Roy, president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said he had been forced to shut down his two companies, Haiti Metal and the Haitian Can Corporation, because his supplies of imported steel, aluminum, enamel and tin halted. The only companies still managing to hang on, he said, are those that rely on raw materials that are abundant in Haiti, like clay and sisal. **********A sack of cement now costs more than $13, compared with $2.50 before the embargo, ""and you cannot produce at that price,"" Mr. Roy said. Even basic foods, like sugar and rice, have doubled in price in little more than a month. **********The poor and the unemployed are obviously the most seriously affected by such increases in food prices, which forces them to eliminate every other expenditure, even clothing. **********People in the middle class lucky enough to still have jobs are also finding it hard to get by. **********""There are times now when I have serious problems in getting enough food to put on the table for my children,"" said a 31-year-old economist who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ""I can't live on my salary anymore because it remains the same while the cost of everything else has gone up."" Poor Called Better Prepared **********Robert Malval, Father Aristide's Prime Minister, argues that the embargo has created ""a paradox"" in which the poor are better prepared to withstand the embargo than are more affluent Haitians. **********""The masses can withstand this much longer than the middle class and the bourgeoisie,"" Mr. Malval said in a recent interview, both because they are more accustomed to privation and have access to food supplied by international agencies. **********But many of the poor do not agree. They see themselves as bearing the brunt and believe that the upper class, the primary target of the sanctions, is cushioned from its worst effects. **********""They had five cars, and maybe now they have only two,"" said Hercule Guerville, a 30-year-old former brewery worker who has been unemployed for nearly two years. ""That's not suffering. They always have their supply of food, but we are the ones who are dying of hunger."""

The larger deficit also weakened the dollar, which put further pressure on bonds. Treasury securities also suffered from higher commodity prices. **********The Commerce Department's report of the July trade balance was a little worse than expected. The report showed the nation's trade deficit in goods and services widening to nearly $11 billion, compared with $9 billion in June. Exports were a little weaker than expected and imports were stronger. **********The price of the 30-year bond fell 8/32 yesterday, to 9626/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.77 percent, from 7.75 percent on Monday. Inflation jitters and concern about further rate increases by the Federal Reserve helped to keep buyers at bay, as sellers used each uptick in prices as an opportunity to sell. **********The yield is at its highest level since Aug. 24, 1992, when it was 7.82 percent. **********Before the trade data were released, bond prices were already declining from overnight selling in Europe and Japan amid concern about inflation and its negative impact on the value of investments.  ""Japanese accounts have been selling all their foreign holdings, including U.S. Treasuries as well as European bonds,"" said James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Francisco. ""It's not that they hold large amounts of these securities, but when they sell they influence other investors."" **********And while both the dollar and Treasury prices recovered some losses, traders called it a difficult day. **********Late yesterday, Johnson Redbook Services released its latest weekly survey on retail sales. The survey showed sales up 3 percent, weaker than the 4.2 percent increase for the previous weeks of September. **********Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that aside from the trade data, the market was also pressured from the supply side by a $1.5 billion global bond issue from the World Bank. **********The global bonds, which mature in five years and are not callable for the life of the issue, were priced at 99.471 to yield 7.253 percent through underwriters led by UBS Securities. **********Mr. Roden also noted that the market might have been concerned about yesterday's announcement regarding the size of next week's Treasury auctions of two- and five-year notes. ""With all the negatives, there were a few plus sides today,"" Mr. Roden said. ""The dollar rebounded and that helped the market psychologically. **********""My guys tell me that some economists on the Street are telling institutional investors that they are now expecting not just one rate increase from the Fed, but multiple short-term rate increases,"" he added. ""If you believe that, then many money managers will have to rethink their strategies."" **********Gains in commodity prices, especially precious metals, also helped to undermine bonds. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.56 points, to 230.97. Gold prices jumped $3.60 an ounce yesterday, to $397.20.  In the municipal market, the Puerto Rico Municipal Finance Agency sold $273.5 million of tax-exempt bonds through CS First Boston. The issue, most of which is insured by Financial Security Assurance and rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, was initially priced to yield a maximum of 6.35 percent for an issue due in 2019. **********Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 4.60 percent in 1996 to 6.10 percent in 2009, with another long bond due in 2014 priced to yield 6.30 percent. **********Among corporate issues sold yesterday was a $500 million debt offering by Wal-Mart Stores through Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch. **********The discount retailer sold $250 million of 8 percent notes due in 2005 at a price of 99.767 to yield 8.03 percent and $250 million of 8.5 percent debentures due in 2024 at a price of 99.031 to yield 8.59 percent. **********Underwriters said the issues were rated Aa1 by Moody's and AA by S.& P."

It is still owed $236 million, or 65 percent of the total. **********Of the $126 million collected, about $84 million was given back to consumers who were victims of the frauds, a normal trade agency practice. **********Mr. Conyers, Democrat of Michigan and head of the House committee that oversees Federal Trade Commission operations, called the finding ""highly disturbing."" He said the commission's new chairman would ""have a chance"" to find out what had happened and ""clean this up."" **********A trade commission spokesman said that it was the agency's policy not to comment on such matters but that it was looking into the matter to find out why the fines had not been collected. **********Representative Conyers has written to the commission's chairwoman, Janet D. Steiger, saying his committee is ""concerned that various Federal agencies fail to collect money owed to the Government"" and asking her to explain the failure to collect. **********The Clinton Administration has named Robert Pitofsky, a professor of antitrust law at Georgetown University Law Center, to replace Ms. Steiger, whose term expires this year. The appointment of Mr. Pitofsky, who was an F.T.C. commissioner until he resigned in 1981, has been announced but not yet confirmed by Congress. **********The commission's judgments came in cases ranging from fraudulent claims for the value of artwork sold by one company to a telemarketing scheme selling oil and gas leases that defrauded 8,000 customers of more than $47 million. **********The largest item on the list is a $49.9 million unpaid judgment against Figgie International, a conglomerate based in Willoughby, Ohio, whose businesses include security, fire prevention and sporting goods. About $7.6 million is listed as on deposit in a bank, but the rest apparently is tied up in a court case involving the judgment. **********Ira Gamm, a spokesman for Figgie, said that the commission had obtained a judgment against one of its companies, Interstate Engineering, of Anaheim, Calif., for fraudulently portraying the benefits of a ""heat detector"" that homeowners could use alongside a smoke detector for more reliable fire alarms. **********He said the judgment amount was probably an estimate of how much money would be needed to buy back the detectors from all the customers. The company agreed in a court settlement to put $7.6 million in escrow and customers are being paid back out of that fund, Mr. Gamm said."

In what could be the most lucrative deal in its 45 years of existence, it licensed Ford Motor Co. to produce a revolutionary gearless transmission it calls Torotrak - a transmission BTG has been refining, patenting and promoting for more than three decades. **********If the Torotrak system is a success, it will only be one of a long series of them for BTG, which calls itself the world's largest technology-transfer organization. **********Set up by a Labor Party government in the 1940s to patent and promote British inventions, BTG was sold into private hands three years ago and its ownership was transferred to managers and financial institutions. It will soon be floated on the London Stock Exchange. **********After a British discovery, penicillin, went on to become a worldwide financial success, the government decided to set up BCG. The bulk of its patents remain on British products. **********Its flotation is expected to raise as much as £20 million. It would value the company, which had pretax profit of £3.7 million on revenue of £29 million in the year ending March 1994, at around £50 million. **********The flotation would follow the successful sale of 3i Group PLC, which was opened to public ownership last month. That company, formerly called Investors in Industry Group PLC, was also formed by the British government just after World War II to finance small businesses. Shares in 3i Group closed Tuesday at 295.5 pence ($4.50), up 2. **********As perhaps befitting the market leader in the patenting and promotion of technology, BTG's boast is that its technologies typically revolutionize their marketplaces. But far from being lionized, at least initially, BTG's more common experience is one of rejection. **********Thirty years ago it happened with pyrethrin, a then-revolutionary type of insecticide based on natural substances. **********""At the time, none of the existing insecticide manufacturers would touch it,"" said Ian Harvey, BTG's chief executive. The first license went to Sumitomo Corp. of Japan, which liked the technology enough to start a new unit to produce it. Today, pyrethrin accounts for one-fifth of the world insecticide market. **********Magnetic imaging, the successor technology to many types of X-rays, is another case in point. BTG took out its first patents in the mid-1970s and today holds a clutch of patents underpinning a $1.5 billion-a-year business. **********With its patents on pyrethrin now nearly all expired and its magnetic-imaging patents well past the middle of their lifespan, BTG's big bet on Torotrak could fill a large gap. To date it has invested £6 million in Torotrak, which alone accounts for 300 of BTG's 10,000 patents and patent applications. **********Early tests on Torotrak have indicated potential fuel savings of 15 percent and emission reductions of nearly a third. **********Those gains come from a system that instead of taking an engine's power to its wheels via a fixed series of four or five gearing ratios does it with an infinitely variable ratio. It is like the difference between an ordinary off-on light switch and a dimmer switch. In Torotrak's case, instead of gears, the system uses a box filled with a series of disks, bearings and traction fluid. **********The basic idea for such a device dates to the 19th century. Getting it to work cheaply and smoothly is what is new. **********""If it delivers on the promise we have seen, it could be a very important development,"" said Adam Mirren, manager of power-train research at Ford in Britain, who expects to have an answer by the end of 1995. **********Torotrak is lighter, simpler and cheaper to make than conventional transmissions, and what is more, it can be used on any size engine from the largest truck motors to autos. **********""The Ford license is very important,"" said Geoff Soares, a Torotrak project manager. ""In the auto industry, companies like to be No. 2, not No. 1, with new technologies."" **********Mr. Soares said that others ranging from truck manufacturers to bearing makers and oil companies are charging in ""since they now see it as having potential."" **********With years of tests still to come, even if it pans out the first commercial version of Torotrak will not be available until the turn of the century. **********An even more striking example of a BTG technology that has proven painfully far ahead of its time is a relatively simple device called a grain stripper. By in essence combing the grain off its stalks instead cutting the stalks off at the base and then threshing them, the device can harvest a field at twice the speed and with half as large an engine as a conventional combine. **********Mr. Harvey says the device could cut costs in the harvester market by as much as 75 percent. **********BTG signed its first licensing agreement with a small British manufacturer in 1987 and only recently was able to sign up Massey-Ferguson Ltd. in Canada. **********BTG promises its inventors that it will more than double their expected revenues. In return BTG gets a 50 percent cut of all fees."

They vowed to advance on Mexico City unless the Government met their demands for sweeping social reforms. **********""The war we declare is a final but justified measure,"" the rebels said in a proclamation they posted in the occupied towns and read over a captured radio station in one of them. ""We have nothing, absolutely nothing. Not a dignified roof, nor work, nor land, nor health care, nor education."" **********In a brief communique that was the only government comment on the attacks, Chiapas state officials played down the incidents, calling the attackers Indian peasants who do not speak Spanish and had not issued clear demands. The state Government estimated the entire force at no more than 200 people, but people in two of the occupied towns said there were several hundred insurgents in each of them. **********Senior Mexican officials have repeatedly denied the existence of any guerrilla activity in Mexico. When a smattering of news reports appeared this spring that small rebel groups were training near the country's border with Guatemala, aides to Mr. Salinas dismissed them as part of a malicious attempt to discredit the Government as it sought approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect as the new year began. **********The Mexican Government fought several small leftist rebel armies in the early to mid-1970's, but virtually wiped them out with an aggressive, often brutal counterinsurgency campaign. Hundreds of Guatemalan rebels also operate near that country's border with Mexico, and several of them have been captured during the past year carrying or stockpiling arms inside Mexico. **********Chiapas, one of Mexico's poorest states, has also been the site of longstanding conflicts between landless peasants and relatively wealthy ranchers and farmers. **********Several people reached by telephone in San Cristobal de las Casas, a colonial town and popular tourist site about a two-and-a-half-hour drive east from thisstate capital, said the insurgents stormed into the town between 3 A.M. and 4 A.M., as New Year's celebrations were winding down. **********The witnesses said the attackers took over the town hall, burned files in the state prosecutor's office and shot to death one man who defied their orders at a roadblock. In similar attacks carried out almost simultaneously, the insurgents were also reported to have killed the police chief and two other police officers in the town of Ocosingo, as well as at least two people in the farming town of Las Margaritas. Government officials did not immediately confirm any of the deaths. Officials to 'Dissuade' Attackers **********The insurgents also took the town of Altamirano, and a small force was reported tonight to have been seen near Palenque, the site of some of Mexico's most famous Mayan ruins. **********The state Government said it had ordered the security forces ""to try to dissuade the Indian groups, to ask them to reconsider their attitude, to return to legal channels and join in building solutions to their demands."" **********In a proclamation quoted by the television network Eco, the insurgents said they wanted the Mexican Congress to remove Mr. Salinas's Government and decree laws redistributing farm lands. **********People in San Cristobal and news reports from the other towns said the attackers were mostly uniformed and appeared well-organized. Some were said to carry AK-47 and other types of assault rifles. In San Cristobal, two people said they believed that some of the men spoke with Guatemalan accents."

Major companies like Intel and Microsoft have chosen to keep Nasdaq listings after they became major forces in their industries. **********But some of the taint remains because Nasdaq lists some companies whose principal reason for existence is to provide shares for a promoter to sell to suckers. State securities regulators say that many penny stock abuses involve companies listed on Nasdaq's secondary, or small-cap, market. **********Last week, Nasdaq proposed a rule that would clear the way for it to clean up its act by getting rid of such stocks. The rule needs the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and could face a court challenge. But if it is approved it will be clear that Nasdaq has the power to refuse to list stocks that are connected to known promoters. If such stocks keep trading, Nasdaq will be to blame. **********As Nasdaq officials tell it, they have been frustrated by the fact that after a crooked broker is thrown out of the securities industry, he often resurfaces as a promoter, corporate official or consultant, doing the same things that got him in trouble in the first place. They want to be able to refuse to list any company linked to a person they deem to be a crook. **********The proposed new rule is breathtaking in its scope. It allows Nasdaq to refuse to list any company, or to take away its listing, if ""any event, condition or circumstance"" makes it ""inadvisable or unwarranted"" to list the security. In other words, Nasdaq wants to be able to blackball a stock for any reason. **********It is not now clear if Nasdaq has that power. When it refused to list stocks that were largely owned by Jordan Belfort, a founder of the Stratton, Oakmont penny stock firm, Mr. Belfort sued. The case was dismissed on the technicality that Mr. Belfort had not exhausted his appeals within Nasdaq, but his lawyer, Marvin Pickholtz, says that decision will be appealed. He complains that Nasdaq is trying to weigh the merits of stocks, something the S.E.C. is not allowed to do, rather than simply require full disclosure. **********Because Nasdaq does not publicize its listing decisions, it is impossible to know how often it has blocked a listing because of a similar connection. But officials say there have been cases, including at least one involving Bob Brennan, the former head of First Jersey Securities who is facing S.E.C. civil charges. **********The market news last week was dominated by the fact that stock and bond prices stabilized after falling sharply. But for those who invest in Nasdaq stocks, the success or failure of efforts to clean up the market is of much greater importance."

Kazakhstan ships its oil through Russia, is home to many ethnic Russians and prizes its harmonious relations with Moscow. **********Still, a further reason for dealing with the Russians was that Moscow might make a claim on the 600 kilograms of the highly enriched uranium, which was produced in Russia and sent to Kazakhstan to be turned into fuel for nuclear vessels. **********""The Russians could have scuttled the deal by going public or putting pressure on Kazakhstan,"" an Administration official said. **********Initially, some Administration officials thought that the best thing would be for the Russians to take the nuclear material and put it under international safeguards. Given Moscow's record in accounting for its nuclear materials, however, that would have been less secure than flying it to the United States. **********On the other hand, Russia was nearby, and moving the material there would relieve the Energy Department of the problem of anti-nuclear groups that might object to storage in the United States. **********But Russia was already swamped with its own nuclear material and had no interest in paying the Kazakhs for the supply, American officials said. The Russians made it clear that it was fine with them if the United States took the material. **********The understanding was sealed in June when Vice President Al Gore met with the Russian Prime Minister, Victor S. Chernomyrdin. **********But that still left some questions unresolved: where to store the material in the United States and who would cover the costs. **********Initially, some Energy Department officials were not enthusiastic about storing the material in the United States. **********But Pentagon and White House officials insisted it be kept at an Energy Department site, under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. **********As the agencies sought to work out a plan, they were racing against time. Washington wanted to get the supply out of Kazakhstan before the winter snows interfered and forced a wait until spring. **********Finally, it was agreed that the supply would be sent to the Oak Ridge installation in Tennessee. Within nine months after that, it would be sent to a commercial site where it would be turned into low-enriched uranium for use in commercial reactors. **********In return, the United States pledged to give Kazakhstan additional aid that one Administration officials said would be in the ""low tens of millions."" **********Kazakhstan has asked that the specific amount not be made public. Washington was not eager to publicize the figure either, for fear that it may send a strong signal that it is willing to pay for nuclear material that nations are trying to unload. **********Throughout that time, the effort was handled with secrecy and code-named Project Sapphire. American officials were worried that word of the deal might tempt arms dealers to try to steal the supply. Some officials were also concerned that disclosure of the operation could hurt Democratic prospects in the Tennessee elections. **********To prepare the nuclear materials for shipment, a factory about the size of a three-car garage was built near the sites in Kazakhstan. Thirty-one American officials spent a month in Kazakhstan transferring the uranium from more than 7,000 containers into 1,400 stainless steel cans, each the size of about a quart can of motor oil. **********The nuclear shipment was flown nonstop to Dover, Del., and then sent by truck to Tennessee. The last shipment arrived at Oak Ridge this morning, Administration officials said. **********Today, Defense Secretary William J. Perry described the operation as ""one of a kind."" **********""We are seeking to repeat this, but if a similar, identical situation came up, the factors that led us to make this decision I think would similarly be true,"" he said."

They are betting that the Vienna, Va., company will be a big winner in the business of computer services sent to homes -- the first huge consumer market, analysts say, in the evolution of computer and communications technology known as the information highway. **********""You don't buy America Online for earnings,"" said Steven Eskenazi, a principal of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. **********The concept was selling briskly yesterday. America Online shares closed up $5.75, to $70.50. For much of the last year, it has been a Wall Street favorite, rising from $17.75 in less than 10 months. It is selling at more than 120 times last year's earnings, compared with 23 times for the Standard & Poor's 500. **********But even some America Online fans are starting to question the stock's continuing ascent. Last week, Kenneth T. Berents, director of research for Wheat First Butcher & Singer, a brokerage in Richmond, lowered his rating on the company from buy to neutral. ""It's a great company, but the hyper-growth that it has experienced will slow down for awhile,"" Mr. Berents said. **********America Online supplies news, electronic mail, chat lines and software to subscribers, who receive the service on personal computers equipped with modems. Founded in 1985, the company grew slowly at first, taking eight years to sign up its first 300,000 subscribers, who typically pay $15 a month for its service. In the last seven months, its subscriber base has doubled to 600,000. **********Clearly America Online's business, and hopes for the future, have been lifted by price wars that put computers into more homes and by widespread, relentless proselytizing for the ""information revolution,"" notably by Vice President Al Gore. And unlike its leading rivals, Prodigy, jointly owned by I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck and Compuserve, a unit of H& R Block, America Online is in only one business. To enthusiasts, America Online looks like a ""pure play"" on the future. **********Still, the company is already experiencing some growing pains. It announced last week that it would have to ration access to users during peak times because of the overload on its system. The problem, to be sure, is a byproduct of the surge in its business. Still, it is irritating to customers, who either cannot tap into America Online or find the system works slowly, if at all. The company is hiring more staff, adding computer gear and offering rebates to disgruntled customers. **********""We were taken by surprise,"" said Lennert Leader, America Online's chief financial officer. ""But we view this as a temporary problem, which should be fixed entirely in a couple of months."" **********Most analysts agree. The longer-term challenge, they say, is whether America Online can maintain its momentum and rapid growth in the face of increasing competition. **********The company has been a software innovator, offering a system with easy-to-use icons and requiring fewer computer commands than its rivals. It also gets much of its traffic from communications features like chat lines, which allow users to read and type messages to each other instantly. But Prodigy plans to add new features, like chat lines soon. All the on-line services are upgrading their software to make their systems easier to use. **********""The advantage America Online has had is diminishing,"" said Joshua Harris, president of Jupiter Communications Company, a New York consulting firm. **********New rivals are another threat. The companies that have recently entered the on-line business, or are expected to do so soon, include Ziff-Davis, A.T.&. T, and Microsoft. And older competitors are working hard to counter America Online's recent gains, including Prodigy and Delphi, which was purchased late last year by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. **********""America Online is going to have to continue to spend heavily to upgrade their systems, attract customers and scramble to stay ahead of some large, well-financed companies,"" said Mark Stahlman, president of New Media Associates, a research firm in New York **********America Online executives are undaunted. Only four million American households tapped into on-line services last year, Mr. Leader noted. But by 1998, he expects the figure to rise to 20 million, citing independent market research. ""We'll see more competition,"" he said. ""But we're not in a zero-sum game. There's enormous growth in this market."" **********Given America Online's current growth pace, it should reach two million subscribers by the first half of 1996, predicts Rick Martin, director of research for the Chicago Corporation, an investment bank. With that customer base, Mr. Martin projects net income of roughly $25 million, or $3 a share. With its growth, he figures that would make America Online a $150-a-share price. That, he calculates, implies a current stock price of between $76 and $89 a share. **********""That's why we feel comfortable with America Online, despite the outrageous price-earnings ratio it has today,"" Mr. Martin said."

And while the bond market rallied on the soft inflation number, it was the dollar that caused the stock market's early undoing. The dollar cut its earlier losses to end little changed from Monday. Volume Relatively Light **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was again lighter than usual with 252.3 million shares traded, up from 223 million on Monday. The number of stocks showing gains outpaced losers by a slim margin, 1,074 to 1,012. **********Scott Bleier, vice president of technical research of Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the market was seeing a breakdown in leadership. ""It's not the end of the bull market, and the bear market has not begun,"" Mr. Bleier said. Instead, the market is in a floundering phase, when seen over the long term, and is taking a restatement of gains made in the last three years. **********The technology sector, which he said had been a strong market leader over the last three to five years after the explosion in personal computers and semiconductors, may be on the wane. ""They have seen the peak and are not growing as fast and furious as growth investors would like,"" he said.  ""So now we have to wait for the next new technology cycle to see who the new leaders will be."" **********Technology stocks opened lower yesterday after a report showed the semiconductor book-to-bill ratio fell to 1.08 in June from 1.13 in May. The report issued by the Semiconductor Industry Association is an indicator of future demand for semiconductors. **********While the number was negative, it was not considered all that bad for the summer, when demand slackens, said Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond. **********Stronger-than-expect earnings released by Motorola after the market's close on Monday were initially overshadowed by the book-to-bill report because most investors happen to be looking forward and not backward. **********But Motorola, the most actively traded issue on the Big Board, surged, lifting technology issues near the close. Motorola rose 5 1/4, to 50, on nearly nine million shares. **********On the Nasdaq, where many of the technology issues are traded, the composite index was up 2.76 points, to 709.59. **********Cisco Systems fell 1, to 22 3/4, after Salomon Brothers lowered its rating on the company to ""hold"" from ""buy."" The company said it had agreed to acquire privately held Newport Systems Solutions in exchange for 4.2 million shares of Cisco stock. **********General Public Utilities fell 1 3/4, to 25 1/4, after a Pennsylvania court ruled that a subsidiary, the Metropolitan Edison Company, could not pass the costs of decommissioning a Three Mile Island nuclear power unit on to customers. Goldman, Sachs & Company said it had downgraded the stock on concerns of a possible write-off. **********Abbott Laboratories fell 2 1/8, to 26 7/8. Traders said Bear, Stearns & Company had cut its estimates of 1994 and 1995 Abbott earnings.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/business/multiple-motives-for-kidder-s-self-examination.html,Sylvia Nasar,1994-08-08,,1145,,The New York Times,Business Day,An Analysis; News Analysis,article,Multiple Motives for Kidder's Self-Examination,Multiple Motives for Kidder's Self-Examination," **********Joseph Jett's defense lawyers complained last week that the Lynch report was not so much an independent fact finding as a prosecutor's brief. They have a point, but they're missing the main one. **********True, the internal investigation by Gary G. Lynch, a partner at Kidder, Peabody & Company's outside law firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell, did paint Mr. Jett as a criminal, particularly by dating the $350 million false profit scheme back near the beginning of Mr. Jett's employment at Kidder and by pointing to various signs that the bond trader had tried to conceal his activities. **********But Mr. Lynch was not mainly trying to lend a hand to the United States Attorney, who would not take the firm's word as gospel in any case. Rather, his report is Kidder's biggest bargaining chip with regulators and the Government. Working to Avoid a Collapse **********All along, Kidder and its parent, the General Electric Company, which has sunk $1.4 billion into the investment bank, have been trying to assure that the Wall Street firm would avoid the fate of Drexel Burnham Lambert and E. F. Hutton. Both of those firms collapsed under the weight of Government charges and fines. **********""In the longer-term negotiating game, this is a first cut,"" said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University. **********To lawyers at Kidder and G.E., it was clear days before Mr. Jett was dismissed that the firm itself was in potentially serious trouble. Since the Michael Milken scandal, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken an increasingly hard line on who is ultimately responsible when wrongdoing occurs in a securities firm. **********More often than not, the regulators aim at the higher-ups who knew or should have known -- as well as at the firms themselves. The idea, S.E.C. officials have said on several occasions, is to give firms compelling incentives to watch their big money-makers like hawks and to take swift action when something does go awry. **********""They have expressly said, 'You can't insulate yourself with layers of management,' "" said Ira Lee Sorkin, a partner at Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent, Sheinfeld & Sorkin who represented several Drexel executives. **********And, increasingly, the only way to avoid devastating penalties has been readily to admit responsibility at the top, to show that the firm's way of doing business is being overhauled and to take lots of bitter medicine, long before the regulators insist.  Lynch Lends Kidder Credibility **********Hence, securities lawyers say, Mr. Lynch was hired more for his credibility as a negotiator than for his well-known hatred of bad guys and his reputation for objectivity and thoroughness. After all, as chief of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division until 1989, Mr. Lynch sat on the other side of the bargaining table. He also helped pick his successor, William McLucas, the S.E.C.'s current top cop. **********""If anyone is taken seriously by McLucas, it's Lynch,"" said Mr. Coffee. **********As a first step toward re-establishing Kidder's credibility with regulators, Mr. Lynch rejected the firm's initial defense -- repeated frequently by its chief executive, Michael A. Carpenter -- that the Jett fiasco could have happened anywhere. A clever crook could beat the best of systems or hoodwink the most alert managers, Mr. Carpenter used to say before he was forced out in June. **********That defense never resonated much with regulators. From the day that Kidder first disclosed the size and duration of the scheme that Mr. Jett is accused of -- involving more than a trillion dollars of phony trades and hundreds of millions of dollars in false profits -- regulators, just like Kidder's competitors, believed high-ranking Kidder executives were either in league with Mr. Jett or not watching him the way they were supposed to. No. 2 Executive Blamed **********Mr. Lynch reserved most of the blame for Edward A. Cerullo, the firm's powerful head of fixed-income trading -- effectively, the firm's No. 2 executive -- and one of the mostly highly compensated managers on Wall Street. **********Mr. Lynch's report said Mr. Cerullo not only had no idea what his star bond trader was up to but also, when an assistant discovered a huge volume of odd-looking transactions, kept his suspicions to himself for several weeks before informing colleagues. His scathing review of Mr. Cerullo's performance -- in which Mr. Lynch essentially says that Mr. Cerullo failed by a wide margin to meet the S.E.C.'s requirements for ""reasonable supervision"" -- clearly played a role in Mr. Cerullo's resignation last month. **********When Mr. Lynch's report was delivered to regulators, two days before it was made public but several weeks after he showed it to senior G.E. and Kidder officials, Kidder's top three executives had already been swept out and a new G.E. team was on board. **********""Internal investigations focus not so much on who did it as on how to prevent it from happening again,"" said Mr. Sorkin, the Drexel attorney. ""You want to get one step ahead of the S.E.C."" **********Will Mr. Lynch's negotiating strategy work? Executives at G.E. and Kidder are expressing cautious optimism that the Government will not be punitive. But that may prove a shade optimistic.  Report May Be Too Narrow **********For all of its baring of Kidder's breast, there is some question whether the Lynch report has taken a broad enough view. **********Take the matter, for example, of Richard W. O'Donnell, who continues as Kidder's top financial officer. He gets off relatively lightly in part because ""the accounting people got involved so late in the game,"" Mr. Lynch said in an interview. **********That could be a problem, Mr. Coffee said. ""Like any S.E.C. lawyer, Lynch would instinctively focus on who had the legal responsibility for overseeing Jett,"" he said. ""The C.F.O. may have been negligent but he doesn't fall into the reasonable-supervision pigeonhole."" **********Mr. Coffee added, ""Even if the traders didn't know what Jett was doing, how could the accountants not have insisted that whole time on being able to identify the assets?"" He was referring to the fact that at the end of a year, any profits that are not parceled out to shareholders automatically become part of the firm's balance sheet. **********Kidder has not allowed individual employees to comment on the Jett affair. **********Reading between the lines of Mr. Lynch's report, by the end of 1992, $32.5 million in false profits that had been reported were missing. By the end of 1993, several months before Mr. Jett was dismissed, the missing assets had mushroomed to nearly $200 million. **********That may be just one reason, despite the firm's optimistic tone, more departures may be in the works -- and why no one at Kidder or G.E. seems to feel certain that regulators will not ask for more than Mr. Lynch has offered. As he knows better than anyone else, they usually do."

Several years of explosive growth should only be a prelude to more of the same. **********In computer keyboards and mouses, mother boards and monitors, Taiwanese manufacturers have grabbed major shares of world markets in their respective fields, cumulatively expanding from about $2.3 billion in sales in 1986 to $10.8 billion last year. **********And that's what Mr. Chang, a Shanghai-born, American-educated engineer who rose to the top ranks of the U.S. computer industry before moving to Taiwan, envisions for the nation's integrated circuit makers, the business where the real money - and real risk - is these days. **********Mr. Chang, who headed Texas Instruments Inc.'s semiconductor business before becoming General Instrument Corp.'s chief executive officer, now finds himself a leader of Taiwan's assault on the world's computer chip markets. **********As chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Wyse Technology Inc., a maker of personal computers, and Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., Mr. Chang, 63, embodies the brain gain and restlessness that has put Taiwan in contention in so many markets so quickly. **********Disenchanted with the mergers and acquisitions frenzy in the U.S. industry in the 1980s and eager to work in Chinese society after 36 years in the United States, Mr. Chang agreed in 1985 to head Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute, a government-funded laboratory. **********The Taiwanese government has extended substantial assistance in the form of tax holidays, R&D grants and cheap loans to the information industry in a bid to create the high-tech exports needed to replace the low-skill manufacturing work being lost to other Asian countries. **********""Taiwan has to choose what kind of industries it wants to specialize in. Right now it is a big personal computer maker and a big monitor maker, both of which are under pressure because their value-added is lower,"" said Mr. Chang. **********""The industry should probably go upstream, building the key components. It's making good progress in integrated circuits and there are opportunities in display components, flat panels and CRTs. They'll be around for a long time,"" Mr. Chang said. CRTs are cathode ray tubes. **********Originally his job was to help steer a government-backed research and development effort toward commercial success. But seeing an enormous opportunity, Mr. Chang convinced the Taiwan government and Dutch electronics giant Philips Electronics NV to set up the world's first independent chip foundry. **********""I knew what it took to do a fab well,"" said Mr. Chang, in the industry parlance for a chip-making factory. ""And I thought Taiwan possessed many of those requirements."" **********In seven years, that business, TSMC, has grown and is forecast to make a 8.2 billion Taiwan dollar ($311 million) profit this year and 13.3 billion Taiwan dollars in 1995, according to HG Asia Securities Taiwan Ltd. TSMC restricts its business to making mostly logic chips under contract to other companies. **********World-class engineering, low salaries for highly trained technicians and economies of scale have combined to make TSMC the largest ""pure foundry"" business in the world with an estimated 12.6 percent global market share. **********""Taiwan Semiconductor represents an unparalleled corporate success story,"" said Jonathan Ross, head of HG Asia Taiwan, of a business started with a $46 million initial investment that has allowed Taiwanese chip design houses to lessen their dependence on foreign manufacturers. **********To remain ahead of the pack, TSMC will spend between $300 and $500 million a year over the next three years in a bid to double capacity. **********With still more expansion in mind, TSMC has taken a 25 percent stake in another ITRI spin- off, Taiwan Sub-Micron Laboratories, the country's most advanced semiconductor facility."

Why? Because unlike some stocks or certain types of property, one can rarely expect to make a fortune overnight by putting money into a rare art deco brooch. **********""I never advise people to buy just for investment,"" said Daniela Mascetti, a jewelry specialist at Sotheby's International in London. ""I tell them to buy it because they like it."" **********For the novice collector, analysts say, it is often a good idea to go straight to a reputable auction house, as more can often be shaved off the price of a piece of antique jewelry if bought at auction rather than through an individual dealer. **********And like a painting, the name on the piece counts among its most valuable assets. A high-quality gold necklace will command a far greater price if it is signed by a famous designer such as Cartier or Kutchinsky, for example, than one that might be just as well- made but whose maker is unknown. **********However, ""It is rare to find collectors who specialize in one particular make or type of jewelry,"" said James Nicholson, a jewelry analyst at Bonhams auction house in London. ""Most collections are made up of a mix of things that people will enjoy wearing."" **********Because of the highly-specialized nature of the antique jewelry field and the finite number of people who can afford exceptional period pieces, experts advise potential investors to think carefully before they buy. **********""Unless an investor is really clever and knows exactly what he is doing, it is difficult to invest in jewelry and make any money,"" said Mr. Nicholson. ""Although a number of people try and sell a piece of jewelry for a quick turnaround, it is difficult unless you have a first-class knowledge of values."" **********While experts agree that buying and selling period jewelry will almost never make an investor rich in a short time, they nonetheless recommend jewelry as a safe store of value. **********""A good jewel will always maintain its value, which in turn will increase in time,"" said Miss Mascetti. ""But like anything else, the price of jewelry is subject to changes that factor into which way it swings."" **********Fortunately for investors in gems, economic slumps that have hit parallel markets, such as paintings, rather hard in recent years have been less harmful to jewelry values. **********""It has always been a stable investment,"" said Miss Mascetti. ""Other fields have felt recessions, but not fine jewelry. What you have is lasting value because you have paid for the precious metal and the gemstones."" **********In any case, there are apparently legions of well-informed buyers prepared to pay hefty prices to obtain an exquisite piece, whether or not there might be an eventual return on the investment. Bonhams alone holds many jewelry auctions every year in London that are typically well-attended and that often achieve considerable results. **********At a recent auction, for example, Bonhams sold a Mugal emerald set by Cartier for £230,000 ($372,000). And premiumauction houses have seen several million dollars come in for one extremely rare, large and perfect stone. **********""Either you look at the workmanship, the design and the signature, or the quality of the gemstone,"" said Miss Mascetti. ""Of course, you pay a premium for the name."" **********Modern manufactured jewelry is rarely considered by serious collectors, said Mr. Nicholson. He said that most contemporary jewelry produced in factories was ""like a car or a washing machine. It loses its value as soon as you've bought it."" **********Mr. Nicholson advised seeking out pieces from established names such as Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Boucheron, particularly those from the early 20th century. Jewelry from the 1940s, he said, is also particularly valuable, as are quality art deco pieces. Early pieces by the British designer Elizabeth Gage ""are also becoming desirable,"" he added. **********Overall, analysts say, jewelry prices are steadily on the increase as demand remains high and fewer quality pieces are appearing on the market. **********""Quality is the only thing that doesn't follow fashion,"" said Miss Mascetti."

She did say the problem did not affect other Fidelity funds. **********Normally, mutual funds distribute their profits only when required for tax reasons. Under the tax law, mutual funds that sell their investments at a profit must pass along realized capital gains, net of any losses, to shareholders every year. Shareholders then pay the taxes on those gains, as well as on dividend income. **********This is the second major accounting problem at Fidelity this year. On June 18, the company gave out incorrect prices for its funds when its computer systems broke down. **********The company would not confirm the size of its mistake in calculating the distribution, but the $36 billion fund has more than 500 million shares outstanding, which means the glitch was more than $2 billion. **********Industry experts expressed bewilderment at the size of the error, but suggested that aside from a simple miscalculation, its problem could have resulted from mistakes in recording the historical cost of certain investments or the nature of some income the fund received from its investments. **********Most investors avoid buying shares at the end of the year because they do not want to face taxes on gains earned before they bought into the fund. For that reason, as well as to help investors get a handle on their tax liabilities, fund companies like Fidelity often estimate the size and timing of a distribution. **********Such estimates are often off by a few cents, but rarely by such a large amount, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, which has tracked mutual funds for decades. **********While some investors may even be relieved not to receive the distribution, thus lowering their tax bills, ""this year some might have liked to have it,"" Mr. Lipper said. ""If you had a bond fund and took a loss there, you might like to have an equity fund with a capital gain to offset it."" **********Coming on the heels of the earlier problem, ""there's a 'Gee, are they out of control?' issue,"" said Michael Stolper, who manages about $50 million of his clients' investments in mutual funds and publishes a newsletter on the topic. **********But the glitch should not cause financial hardship for Magellan shareholders, most of whom reinvest their distributions in the fund. Because they do not live off the income, he said, ""I doubt you'll see widows in Omaha scrambling for food stamps."""

""I am leaving the judiciary with death in my heart."" **********While the resignation does not mean that corruption inquiries into Mr. Berlusconi's Fininvest business empire will come to a halt, it could mean that the investigation will proceed with far less momentum. **********Among some Italians, it is bound to be seen as a victory for Mr. Berlusconi, possibly signaling the beginning of the end for the bribery and kickback investigations that were begun in February 1992 by the team of investigating Milan magistrates known as the ""Mani Pulite,"" or ""clean hands."" **********Mr. Di Pietro's resignation letter, leaked to Italian reporters, electrified Italy. Television channels broke into their programs for live coverage of Mr. Di Pietro prosecuting at his final trial in Milan. **********It was not clear tonight from Mr. Di Pietro's letter whether his resignation was aimed at winning public sympathy or was, perhaps, a prelude to a political career. In his letter, the 44-year-old magistrate said he had ""no prospects for my future."" **********La Repubblica newspaper said this week that 71 per cent of those questioned in a recent survey would vote for Mr. Di Pietro over Mr. Berlusconi. **********While he rarely gave interviews, Mr. Di Pietro, a former police officer born in a poor area of southern Italy, was often seen as the public face of the ""mani pulite"" team. **********Televised courtroom appearances of Mr. Di Pietro, with his black robes and aggressive style of cross-examination, became compulsive viewing, with his ratings sometimes exceeded those of soccer games. **********Politicians rushed to associate themselves with his crusade, and distance themselves from blame for his resignation. Demonstrators gathered outside Milan's courthouse to urge Mr. Di Pietro to stay on. Stocks and the lira fell on financial markets. **********Newspapers reported they were deluged by faxes sent in urging Mr. Di Pietro to reconsider. Even some people who had been investigated by him spoke out. **********""If Di Pietro really leaves, we will have lost one of the stars of the 'Italian Revolution,' "" said Carlo De Benedetti, the head of the Olivetti computer company, who was investigated by Mr. Di Pietro in May 1993, and acknowledged that his company had paid bribes to political parties. **********Prime Minister Berlusconi said the magistrate's departure ""leaves a bitter taste even in the mouths of those who have considered parts of his inquiries questionable."" **********But Mr. Berlusconi made clear that he saw the move as a boost for his campaign to restore what he called today ""normality and balance in the administration of justice"" after the frenetic, headline-grabbing years of inquiries that hounded Italy's business and political elite. **********The chief Milan prosecutor, Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Mr. Di Pietro's superior and head of the city's investigating magistrates, told a news conference: ""Our work will go ahead regardless, without pause, without fear and without weakness. I can guarantee that."" **********In what seemed a parting shot in court today, Mr. Di Pietro asked for a 10-month jail term for Umberto Bossi, Mr. Berlusconi's coalition partner and head of the federalist Northern League, which rose to prominence campaigning against the corruption of Italy's old guard. **********Mr. Bossi was one of 24 defendants, including former Prime Minister and Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi, in a huge trial. Mr. Bossi was accused of accepting an undeclared campaign contribution of $125,000 from the Ferruzzi company. Mr. Bossi denies knowledge of the payment, and the sentence has yet to be confirmed. **********Since the investigations began, thousands of politicians and businessmen have been questioned and at least 700, including five former Prime Ministers, have been sent for trial in connection bribery for public works contracts. **********In recent months, though, as the inquiries have expanded into corruption among the treasury police, they have increasingly implicated Mr. Berlusconi's huge and indebted Fininvest business empire. **********On Nov. 22, Mr. Di Pietro and the other Milan magistrates formally told Mr. Berlusconi that he was being investigated in connection with bribes purportedly paid by companies he owns to tax agents in exchange for favorable audits. The Prime Minister has not so far been questioned and has sworn his innocence ""on the heads of my children."" **********Investigators have said, however, that those are only part of the inquiries involving Fininvest. **********Europeo magazine compiled a tally of inquiries by magistrates from Milan to Sicily into allegations, including bribes to secure television spots for Mr. Berlusconi's three commercial television channels, kickbacks in exchange for broadcasting frequencies, and illicit payments for construction contracts. **********The company is also accused of circumventing antitrust laws and of seeking to pressure the state broadcasting corporation into a deal to share out advertising revenues. Investigators in Sicily are trying to find out whether Mr. Berlusconi's Standa supermarket chain paid extortion money to the Mafia. **********As those inquiries have unfolded, so has the confrontation with the Milan magistrates. **********Last July, Mr. Berlusconi issued a decree preventing magistrates from ordering the pretrial arrest of corruption suspects. After Mr. Di Pietro and his colleagues threatened to quit over the issue, Mr. Berlusconi's Government nearly fell under the weight of public support for the magistrates and the decree was rescinded. **********In September, Mr. Di Pietro offered a deal to end the investigation if corrupt politicians confessed, paid back the bribes they accepted and left office. The Government in turn accused the investigators of interference in politics. **********Last week, Italy's highest appeals court ruled that Mr. Di Pietro and his colleagues had no further jurisdiction in a major case in the Fininvest inquiries. And, last weekend, Mr. Berlusconi's Forza Italia party organized protests against the Milan magistrates. **********The conflict between the two men has been highly personalized and Mr. Di Pietro said in his letter today: ""I have always worked in the most objective way possible, with no ulterior motive. I have never pursued aims other than justice. **********""And yet, especially in recent times, my duties as a magistrate are interpreted ever more as a personal campaign,"" he said. ""I feel the duty, as a citizen and a man, to do something to restore calm and faith in our institutions."" **********He said his resignation was intended to ""depersonalize"" the conflict. **********Mr. Borrelli said Mr. Di Pietro's work had been conducted ""in an atmosphere of increasingly insulting hostility,"" a clear jibe at Mr. Berlusconi's Government. **********Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, as the former Communist Party is now named, said, ""It is impossible to deny the link between this resignation, which upsets and embitters millions of Italians, and the growing climate of siege and intimidation which the magistrates have experienced in recent months."" **********But the Government spokesman, Giuliano Ferrara, said the opposition had brought about Mr. Di Pietro's resignation. ""The magistrate is fed up with being waved like a flag and used as a symbol."" **********But the investigation had a dark side often cited by Mr. Berlusconi's allies as evidence that the Milan magistrates had become an inquisitorial power unto themselves: since the inquiries started, more than 20 suspects have taken their own lives, either to avoid interrogation or because they could not cope with long periods of pretrial detention."

Mr. Rabin announced the measures a day after the President urged Israel to take action to keep negotiations with the P.L.O. alive. **********In an important gesture intended to induce Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, to keep his pledge to resume talks in Washington, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Rabin in a telephone call on Saturday evening that it was crucial to curb militant settlers, a senior Administration official said. **********After Israel ordered some of the toughest measures ever taken against the settlers, the Administration praised the move on Sunday and again today and expressed hope that Israel would put the measures into force soon. Urging Quick Implementation **********Today, Michael McCurry, State Department spokesman, called the Israeli Cabinet decision on settlers ""unprecedented."" **********""We certainly commended that action and indicated our own belief that the Israeli Government should continue to move quickly and effectively to implement those decisions that they outlined yesterday,"" he said. **********The Administration also said today that the rules governing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks should not be changed as a result of last Friday's massacre, rejecting P.L.O. conditions for resuming peace talks with Israel. **********Mr. McCurry said that Israel and the P.L.O. should focus on completing the interim agreement they signed in Washington last September. ""The agenda is the Declaration of Principles and how it can be implemented and the full range of issues associated with the declaration,"" Mr. McCurry said. ""That has been the agenda and will likely remain the agenda and must remain the agenda for them to move ahead in the process."" Support for Tough Resolution **********When asked whether Mr. Clinton offered ideas of his own as to how Israel might deal with the settlers, the official said: ""It's not for us to micromanage Rabin's response. The President said how important to us it was for him to take measures, and he responded that he would do it."" **********Mr. Clinton's message was part of an American initiative after the massacre in Hebron to keep alive the agreement Israelis and Palestinians reached last September. In addition to announcing just hours after the attack that the United States would hold talks until Israel and the P.L.O. resolve the differences preventing their accord from going into force, the United States is also supporting the idea of a tough Security Council resolution condemning the attack. **********The new Middle East strategy comes as the United States on Saturday began another round of high-profile, high-risk, open-ended negotiations between the Muslim-dominated Government of Bosnia and the Croatian faction in an effort to reach a comprehensive peace agreement to end the 22-month war. 'Moment of New Danger' **********""In Bosnia, we have a moment of new opportunity, and in the Middle East a moment of new danger,"" the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, said in an interview. ""And each calls for a more assertive American role."" **********Since Friday's attack, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has sought assurances that Mr. Arafat's delay in accepting an invitation to the peace talks in Washington and a walkout by three other Arab delegations did not mean the quest for a negotiated settlement was over. But he has no intention, barring new developments, of delaying or changing an 11-day trip to Hawaii, Australia, China and Japan that begins Friday. **********But it is unclear whether the Palestinians will want to resume talks while he is out of the country. **********In addition to speaking by telephone with Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat since Friday's massacre, Mr. Christopher has sent letters to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan of Morocco and King Hussein of Jordan urging them to help revive the peace talks. **********Mr. Christopher intends to call Mr. Arafat again on Tuesday to implore him to come back to the talks. **********Mr. Christopher was heartened by his phone conversation today with Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, who said that Syria's decision to break off its participation in the current round of talks in Washington ""was a pause and not a retreat,"" said Mr. McCurry, the State Department spokesman. Jordan and Lebanon, in a show of solidarity with the P.L.O., also ceased participation in the talks. **********But there is deep concern in the Administration that a two-week delay in the talks could increase pressure on Mr. Arafat to abandon the agreement and could encourage violence on both sides. **********""What we are worried about is that while we wait for the situation to calm down, some new act of violence of possibly a horrific nature will intervene,"" said one Administration official. **********As a sign that the P.L.O. is still poised to reconvene the talks, the Palestinians have informed the United States that they will send an envoy to Washington, possibly later this week, to explain their point of view.                    --------------------       U.N. Debate on Hebron **********UNITED NATIONS, Feb 28. (Special to The New York Times) -- The Security Council failed again today to agree on how to condemn the Hebron massacre after three days of debate, but members hope to resolve their differences and settle on a text on Tuesday. **********If that occurs, some diplomats say that will encourage Mr. Arafat to rejoin talks in Washington this week. **********The principal sticking points include a Palestinian demand for an international presence in the occupied territories to help protect Palestinians. Israel and the United States oppose the demand in the form the Palestinians are proposing. **********In addition, the United States does not want the resolution to state that the Israeli-occupied territories include Jerusalem, as the Council has said in the past, because the status of the city is one of the most sensitive final issues in the peace talks."

The deal also was financially within reach: Mitsubishi Bank has 48.83 trillion yen in assets, compared with Nippon Trust's 1.38 trillion yen. **********Mitsubishi Bank said its money would buy 443.4 million new shares of Nippon Trust at 450 yen each. The transaction will be completed Nov. 10 and give Mitsubishi 68.8 percent of Nippon Trust, the smallest of Japan's seven trust banks. **********""This decision was taken after careful review at the request of and in consultation with financial authorities who were concerned about the possible negative impact of Nippon Trust's difficulties in Japan's financial system,"" Mitsubishi Bank said. **********Analysts said the price may have been too high, considering that Nippon Trust had been disclosing 130 billion yen in nonperforming assets, a figure it raised abruptly to 230 billion yen on Wednesday and which some analysts say may be as high as 500 billion yen. **********""The price is excessive in that it will yield nothing for two to three years,"" said Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. **********""But from the long-term perspective it may pay off,"" she added, noting that the Japanese pension fund management market was huge and growing. **********Access to the pension fund management business was the incentive Mitsubishi extracted from the Finance Ministry in return for bailing out Nippon Trust. **********Japan's 11 city banks, including Mitsubishi Bank, will be permitted to set up trust bank subsidiaries next year, but they will be restricted from major trust bank activities such as pension fund management. To get the ministry's blessings to operate the trust bank with full powers, Mitsubishi played tough in negotiations that began last spring. **********""The Ministry of Finance simply wanted us to bail them out without much in return,"" a Mitsubishi Bank executive said. **********Daiwa Bank won a similar concession last year when, in return for rescuing its ailing affiliate Cosmo Securities, the Finance Ministry gave it permission to engage in the securities business. Other banks will be permitted to enter the securities business next month but with severe restrictions. **********The Finance Ministry's concessions speak to its desire to hasten cleaning up the financial system. Ms. Daniels said that Japan's 21 city, trust and long- term credit banks were saddled with 40 trillion yen in bad debt. Of this, about 20 trillion will eventually have to be written off; so far only about one-third has been. Disposing of the remaining debt could take two to three years."

For instance, what had been proposed as a permanent reduction in income taxes will now be a one-year, $55 billion reduction because of a continuing dispute over how the Government will make up for the loss in revenues. **********But the plan, which also includes large increases in public works spending and low-cost loans for businesses, will still be the largest economic stimulus plan Japan has ever initiated. It is intended to jolt the country out of its worst recession since World War II and, by quickening economic growth, pull in more imports and reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus. **********The awkward agreement comes just two days before Prime Minister Hosokawa is scheduled to depart for Washington, where he will hold a critical summit meeting with President Clinton. The principal purpose of the trip is to review progress in a series of trade talks Japan and the United States agreed upon last summer. **********In addition to demanding that Japan open a number of markets to more foreign-made goods, the Clinton Administration has also insisted that Japan take measures to reinvigorate the economy. With the talks in several of the sectors failing to make much headway, it had been hoped that the economic stimulus package would be the one clear area of concord between the two leaders. **********The problem has been the question of how to pay for the tax cuts. Mr. Hosokawa had sided earlier with the conservatives in his Government, and in the Finance Ministry, by arguing that the Government would have to increase the national sales tax after a delay of three years. Their aim was to avoid long-running budget deficits. **********Mr. Hosokawa had proposed increasing the sales tax, which has been highly unpopular since it was introduced five years ago, to 7 percent from 3 percent. That would have actually raised more revenues than the income tax reduction would have cost the Government. **********The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, had threatened to withdraw from the Cabinet and possibly bring down the Government if Mr. Hosokawa stuck by this proposal. The Socialists argued that the tax increase would fall most heavily on lower income workers. **********Mr. Hosokawa was forced into the humiliating position of withdrawing his initial proposal a day after he presented it last week, but he still insisted the sales tax increase was needed. **********That led to a political crisis that lasted throughout the weekend that jeopardized his meeting with President Clinton. If the trip goes badly, political analysts have said, it would take an enormous toll on Mr. Hosokawa's already shaky governing coalition."

Dealers Post Losses **********Many of the major dealers in emerging market securities lost $30 million to $100 million in recent weeks, traders estimated yesterday. The largest dealers include J. P. Morgan & Company, Chemical Bank, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and ING Securities. But the effect of the market drop will not be seen until these companies release their first-quarter reports in April. **********Morgan, among the largest dealers in the market, with a reputation for taking large trading positions, was said by traders at other firms to be especially hard hit. A Morgan spokesman declined to comment. **********""It was a pretty tough week,"" said Peter R. Geraghty, president of ING Securities, a unit of a large Dutch bank and a major dealer in emerging markets debt securities. ""I'm sure that everybody lost money. People went into the downturn fairly long."" **********Most dealers keep large inventories of emerging market securities. And those positions -- unlike those in more established markets -- are difficult to hedge, for example, by selling some securities short. Moreover, most dealers continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the markets. **********The selloff was initiated by the aftershocks from the Federal Reserve's move to raise American short-term interest rates in early February, an action that has roiled other, more established bond and currency markets around the world. **********But the emerging markets fell faster and further than many traders had expected when the rate cut was announced. Brady bonds, the securities created out of restructured bank loans to developing countries, fell 6 percent last week, but rebounded about 1.5 percent yesterday, according to a J. P. Morgan index. Brady bonds rose by 44 percent in 1993. **********Emerging market stocks fell by 6 percent last week, according to a Baring Securities index, with stock markets in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil down about 10 percent. **********Traders said that the largest dealers handled more than $2 billion of securities on Thursday, the busiest day of the week. **********Stephen W. Dizard, the head of emerging markets trading at Salomon Brothers, said his firm was able to keep losses to a minimum. **********""We were one of the few houses to take a cautious view,"" he said. ""We were maintaining the positions we needed to serve our customers. Otherwise we were basically out of it."" **********Salomon was cautious, Mr. Dizard said, because technical indicators showed that many emerging markets investors had become overextended. Many of the banks that hold portfolios of Latin debt securities took the fall in the market as a sign to sell their holdings and take profits, he said. **********While the recent losses may hurt the first-quarter results of the leading firms, it is unlikely to lessen their commitment to what has been an extraordinarily profitable business. **********J. P. Morgan, for example, had estimated trading revenue from emerging markets activities of $200 million in the fourth quarter of 1993. **********Indeed, dealers have grown used to volatile markets, having weathered big declines in 1991 and 1992. **********""Most of the big houses have been there, done that, and experienced the good times as well as the bad,"" Mr. Geraghty said. **********Traders said that many hedge funds -- aggressive investment companies that typically manage money raised outside of the United States -- had heavily leveraged positions in emerging markets debt and faced margin calls last week, causing some to sell. Some hedge funds had borrowed as much as 90 percent of their positions, traders said. **********The emerging markets problems come at a time when hedge funds also face substantial losses from the volatility in European interest rates and the fall of the dollar against the yen after the United States and Japan recently broke off negotiations over trade. Questions for Mutual Funds **********Among the biggest questions for the future of the emerging markets is how the recent decline will affect investors who have been pouring money into emerging markets as opportunities in the developed world have looked meager. In particular, traders worry that mutual fund investors in particular may get scared off by the sharp decline and redeem their shares. **********Fidelity's New Market Income Fund, which invests in emerging market debt securities, fell by 9.5 percent last week. As a result, by last Friday, investors sold a net of about $32 million in the fund, or about 10 percent of its assets, according to figures provided by Jane Jaimieson, a spokeswoman for Fidelity. And they sold more over the weekend, she said. **********""A lot of people have been attracted to the fund based on its strong performance are now reacting to the volatility in the market,"" she said. **********Some mutual fund managers suggest, however, that the market drop is actually an opportunity for them to improve their performance. **********""We've been buying all last, taking advantages of values we haven't seen for months,"" said Isabel Saltzman, a portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. Mexican Bond Trading **********Mexican par bonds, one of the most widely traded forms of Mexican Government debt, now trade at a yield of 2.4 percentage points above the equivalent United States Treasury bond, that's an increase from 1.7 percentage points a week ago, Ms. Saltzman said. ""To me that's incredible,"" she added, noting the bonds had fallen to the levels they were at before the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was seen to improve Mexico's credit rating. **********Most emerging market specialists said they expected the markets to rebound slowly over the coming weeks and months because the long-term economies of most developing nations are improving. **********""We still believe in the fundamental values in Mexico and Argentina,"" Ms. Saltzman said. Brazil and Venezuela, she added, will recover more slowly. **********Dealers in the emerging markets, however, said they are likely to be more cautious for much of the rest of the year, largely because they have been surprised about how volatile the market remains. Moreover, there has been a recognition that some of the positive events that investors had been expecting -- such as an upgrade of Mexican debt and a completion of the Brazilian debt restructuring -- would be delayed until the end of this year, Mr. Dizard said. ""When the time horizon strategy stretches out it makes speculators like broker dealers and hedge funds better sellers than buyers,"" he said."

It would require the Bosnian Serbs to surrender about a third of the territory they have seized since the Bosnian war began in April 1992. The Serbs now hold 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********More objectionable to the Serbs now, however, are elements of the plan that would legally preserve the existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign state. **********In their 90-minute meeting at the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in Pale, Mr. Hurd reportedly told Mr. Karadzic that rejection of the plan would be a ""choice for war and disaster."" **********""We were faced with a terrifying image of an extended and intensified war that might spread beyond the borders,"" Mr. Karadzic said. ""We listened to all this, but we also said that this war grew out of the Serbs' fear of Muslim and Croatian domination and because of our refusal to accept an independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We did not accept that state and we will not accept it in the future. **********""If we are in any kind of relationship with them,"" Mr. Karadzic said, referring to the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, ""it will only be as an internationally recognized state, and with this it will be possible to make a compromise. The international community has to fear war more than us, because we are already at war."" **********Earlier this month, Mr. Karadzic called the proposal a ""humiliation"" for the Bosnian Serbs. **********In a meeting with the two Foreign Ministers in Sarajevo earlier in the day, Bosnian Government officials said they would recommend that their parliament accept the plan when it meets on Monday, but only if provisions for recognizing Bosnia's sovereignty and territorial integrity remain. **********""About this there can be no discussion,"" Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic, said. ""The plan is bad, but all the other options are worse. If the Serbs accept the plan, they recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina. If they don't, the war will continue under significantly better conditions for us."" **********The so-called contact Group countries have warned that if the Serbs reject the plan the international arms embargo against Bosnia might be lifted. But Western diplomats admit that there is no consensus over what action should be taken if any of the warring sides turn it down. **********Mr. Karadzic has reportedly been under pressure from Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept the peace plan. International economic sanctions have hurt the economy of the Yugoslav federation, in which Serbia is dominant. **********Mr. Milosevic is clearly eager to have the sanctions lifted. But Mr. Hurd said the Serbian President also refrained from giving the peace plan a clear endorsement in a meeting this evening in Belgrade. **********In the event the Bosnian Serbs reject the peace plan, Mr. Izetbegovic called on Mr. Milosevic and the federal Yugoslav Army to allow the United Nations to place troops along Serbia's border with Bosnia, across which Bosnian Serbs receive most of their supplies. **********The United Nations force in Bosnia has had a mandate to police the border between Bosnia and Serbia since 1992, but Belgrade has not permitted it to deploy troops."

And, like any swamp, it is clinging messily, even as the new Socialist Government seeks prestige and respect from its current presidency of the European Union. **********Ever since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Greece has been fighting and gradually losing the battle to prevent the world from recognizing the former Communist wedge of land on its northern border by the name it has chosen for itself -- Macedonia. **********It is an issue that boils with nationalist passion. It played a major part in bringing down the previous Greek Government last September. Yet, as some Greeks slowly seem to be acknowledging, it is an issue that cannot be won and may as well be left to fizzle quietly, even as the Government's adversaries insist that it will not be allowed to simply go away. 'Fight It All the Way' **********""We will fight it all the way,"" said former Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras, the conservative rebel whose defection from the New Democracy Party last year brought down the Government of Constantine Mitsotakis and forced early elections that recalled the Socialist Andreas Papandreou to power three months ago. **********Put simply, the dispute centers on Greek fears that, implicit in both the name of the fledgling state and in its constitution is an expansionist claim on the northern Greek area that is also called Macedonia. **********Greece's campaign has been energetic, and irritating to its European Union partners. And it has backfired: six countries -- Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark -- decided last month to recognize Macedonia as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. **********On the surface it is an uneven fight. Greece has 10 million people, an army, navy and air force, membership in the European Union and NATO. Landlocked Macedonia has 2 million people, no significant armed forces and trade patterns that make it hugely dependent on Greek goodwill. A Circumlocutory Republic **********""I am not scared as far as Skopje today is concerned,"" Mr. Samaras said, referring to the country by the name of its capital. No one here says ""Macedonia"" outright unless they mean Greek Macedonia; even diplomats use ""Fyrom"" -- the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. **********""I don't believe Skopje could ever invade Greece."" Rather, Mr. Samaras said, ""what I'm worried about is the potential combination of forces in the region that could create a major threat to Greece"" should the Balkan contortions produce new lineups of power that could use the Macedonia issue against Greece. **********Macedonia, said Miltiades Evert, the new leader of the New Democracy opposition, ""could bring us into a very bad situation with Bulgarians, Turks, Albanians."" **********Paradoxically, it is the readiness of Greek opposition parties to seek political capital from the debate that makes it yet more difficult for them to heal this Balkan fault line when they get into power. **********After Mr. Papandreou took office last October, he promptly redeemed campaign promises by canceling negotiations under United Nations auspices that had been nudging Athens toward direct talks with Skopje. **********At the same time, his administration revived other issues in what is emerging as a political minuet to end the controversy without losing face. **********""The main issue is at a dead end,"" said Theodoros Pangalos, the Minister for European Union Affairs who, some Greeks say, is Mr. Papandreou's point man for eventual concessions. ""They want their name and we can't possibly accept it under any kind of formula, but we can live without an agreement on the name."" **********What Greece does want, though, is the removal of the 16-pointed star of Vergina, an old Greek emblem, from the Macedonian flag, the excision of constitutional references to the protection of Macedonians outside their country and recognition of existing borders."

Indeed, many people familiar with the airline, as well as the airline itself, have said that the stock will most likely be worthless someday soon. **********In its most recent quarterly statement, America West says it ""anticipates that the reorganization process will result in the elimination of the interests of its common and preferred stockholders."" **********Although a boilerplate warning appears in all the company's financial documents, it has included such a cautionary note in only a couple of news releases over the last two years. **********Some company analysts said that the stock had also jumped because of a so-called short squeeze, in which investors who have bet wrongly that the price of the stock will fall start scrambling to cover their losses by buying shares. This typically accelerates the rise of a stock's price. **********To be sure, America West is a bit different from many previous cases like Trans World Airlines and Continental Airlines' second bankruptcy, where unsuspecting investors awoke one day to newspaper reports that their stock was certain to be worthless because the companies' reorganization plans said so. **********At America West, however, no reorganization plan exists for the carrier, so the question of how equity holders will ultimately be treated remains unanswered. **********But by any measure, stocks in bankrupt companies are awfully risky, and many people think investing in America West is an unmitigated waste of money. ""The stock has no intrinsic value and is worthless,"" wrote Dick Newberg, a partner at Emanuel & Company of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in a recent research report. **********That may be true, but current shareholders still have some reason, however small, to hold out hope that they will not be left penniless from their investment in the Phoenix-based airline. **********The pending reorganization plan could leave something on the table for equity holders, particularly since employees own a sizable minority stake. In a service business like the airline industry, raising the ire of employees is not a good idea, so an incentive exists to treat those stockholders -- and therefore all others -- somewhat fairly. **********One possibility is that an investor like the Steinhardt Group would finance the reorganization. And after buying majority control, it would leave everyone else with a claim to fight among themselves.  Because the equity committee at America West could possibly delay confirmation of a reorganization plan, common stockholders are likely to command at least some respect at the table. **********A second alternative is a stand-alone plan, in which the company recovers sufficiently to be able to raise what it needs in the form of debt. Again, equity holders could persuade creditors that they have a legitimate claim to the company. A third possibility is a hybrid, with an outside investor buying a minority stake and the company going to the marketplace to raise additional funds. **********Counting on these possibilities will require some tightly crossed fingers, particularly because of the historically unpredictable nature of the industry. But then again, investing in the carrier required a certain amount of faith in the first place."

Economists said the new data constituted a clear sign that Europe's largest economy had begun to recover from its worst recession of the postwar era. **********The gross domestic product in western Germany, the site of the bulk of the nation's economic activity, grew by five-tenths of 1 percent in the first three months of 1994 from the previous quarter and was up 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to figures released by the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden. The growth was powered by the construction and export sectors. **********The western German economy contracted by nine-tenths of 1 percent in the final quarter of 1993 compared with a year earlier, and by five-tenths of 1 percent from the third quarter. Data for formerly Communist eastern Germany were not released today, but the region's industries continue to trail those inthe rest of the country, **********Today's figures were good news for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has made the economy the focal point of his campaign for re-election on Oct. 16. Officials from Mr. Kohl's center-right coalition Government seized on the statistics as proof that recovery has set in. **********""Against the background of the better-than-expected start to the year and the continued upward trend of indicators pointing to the future, a more favorable development is certainly possible,"" Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt said in a statement. **********Separately, the Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg reported that unemployment in western Germany rose only mildly in May, climbing to a seasonally adjusted 2.599 million from 2.590 million in April. The unemployment rate, based on unadjusted figures, dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.4 percent. In May 1993, the unemployment rate was 6.9 percent. **********In eastern Germany, unadjusted unemployment fell to 1.159 million in May from 1.216 million in April. The unemployment rate fell to 15.4 percent from 16.2 percent. **********Mr. Rexrodt said the growth figures released today confirmed that the Government's forecast of 1.5 percent growth this year for all of Germany was realistic. Stimulating Growth Elsewhere **********A rebound in Germany, coming amid signs that Japan's economy is beginning to pull out of recession, would provide a significant boost to the global economy by stimulating growth elsewhere in Europe. **********But private economists warned that the 2.1 percent growth in western Germany's gross domestic product was due in large part to the economy's earlier dismal performance in the first quarter of 1993, as well as some extraordinary factors, including unusually mild winter weather that contributed to a 6 percent expansion in construction activity in the first three months of this year. **********""The economy shows clear signs of recovery and that is going to continue,"" Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt, said. ""But the year-on-year comparison is misleading. If we have five-tenths of 1 percent growth in the second quarter of this year from the first, the economy will be doing quite well. And for the full year, we are still predicting 1 percent growth."""

On Friday, the price of gold in London jumped $2, to $395.70 an ounce, a 1994 high, after a steady run-up since Aug. 16. Gold did not make $400 an ounce in early January, when it hit $395.25. And it sagged after touching the $390 level in March and June. **********But Doug Fabian, the editor of Fabian's Investment Resource, a newsletter that identifies long-term trends in mutual funds, thinks $400 will be easily breached on this try. At the end of last week Mr. Fabian put out a new ""buy"" signal on gold mutual funds. ""I put a ton of money in today,"" he added on Friday.  He had sent out another buy in February 1993 ahead of the last time gold broke $400. The rally was brief, but the signal came when the price was around $330 an ounce in London. But Mr. Fabian can change his mind quickly because he is not a long-term investor. His last recommendation was a sell this April, between the gold price peaks in March and June.

Kazarian, a suitor for Borden Inc., publicly denounced the company yesterday for the first time, asserting that it had treated him unfairly in his quest to buy the struggling consumer products giant. **********He said Borden should allow its shareholders to vote on a buyout proposal that he would offer in competition with a bid from Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. That buyout firm surprised Wall Street last week by offering $2 billion of RJR Nabisco stock for Borden. **********A spokesman for Borden declined to comment on Mr. Kazarian's complaints. But Mr. Kazarian, 38, was scathing in his characterization of the deal with Kohlberg, Kravis. In a telephone interview, he said Borden's board was ""running this process much in the way they've been running a company where the stock went from 35 to 12."" **********Indeed, Mr. Kazarian appeared to be laying the groundwork for future litigation in a letter sent yesterday to Borden's eight directors, who met yesterday afternoon to put the finishing touches on a definitive agreement with Kohlberg, Kravis. **********But he said that litigation was not his aim. ""Our ultimate goal is to use economic competition to determine a corporate contest,"" he said. **********In the letter, Mr. Kazarian asserted that Borden had engaged in a ""continuing pattern of attempting to delay, deflect and discourage Japonica's efforts,"" referring to his Rhode Island investment firm, Japonica Partners. **********""Their obligation is to give me guidance so they can maximize shareholder value,"" Mr. Kazarian said. **********The letter also criticized a section of the agreement with Kohlberg, Kravis that Borden filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to announce the proposed acquisition. **********Japonica contends that the section, a so-called nonshop agreement, prohibits the Borden board from working with Mr. Kazarian's firm to develop a friendly competing offer. ""That section certainly does not seem to be consistent with the goal of maximizing shareholder value,"" Mr. Kazarian said. **********The letter to the Borden board asserts that Mr. Kazarian's firm presented ""a menu of options"" for acquiring part of the company, valuing Borden stock at $16 to $18 a share and suggesting a Japonica investment of $200 million to $500 million. **********Kohlberg, Kravis is offering $14.25 a share in stock for Borden. **********Mr. Kazarian's letter contends that Borden's board declined to provide Japonica with a descriptive list of company documents so that his firm could take its first step toward signing a confidentiality agreement in exchange for further information. **********Mr. Kazarian said in the interview that Borden's delaying tactics had denied him information that would enable him to present a detailed proposal that would include sources of financing. **********He asserted that Borden ""gave us 48 hours' notice"" for a meeting with Borden management on Wednesday, ""and never until Wednesday did they ask us for any financial commitments."" **********Mr. Kazarian asked the Borden board to permit Japonica to put in a competing proposal that would give shareholders an alternative to the Kohlberg, Kravis deal. **********The Borden board met yesterday afternoon to review the provisions of a definitive agreement that would send the Kohlberg, Kravis deal to shareholders for a vote. No announcement was made about the progress of the negotiations, which continued late into the evening. **********On Sept. 12, Kohlberg, Kravis proposed to swap nearly half of its stock in the RJR Nabisco Holdings Company to pay for all of Borden's shares at $14.25. **********Unless the parties mutually agree to a postponement, the board has until today to come to an agreement with Kohlberg, Kravis, or it must pay the firm $2 million more than the $20 million it has already paid for agreeing to the deal. Failure to agree will also give Kohlberg, Kravis 19.9 percent of Borden's stock, in shares that would be newly issued by the company. **********Borden has never considered Mr. Kazarian a serious rival to Kohlberg, Kravis because he has never disclosed any financing commitments. He offered no specifics on financing to the Borden management on Wednesday, nor in his letter yesterday. **********Although Borden would not comment publicly, an industry executive familiar with the company's thinking denied that Borden had misled Mr. Kazarian in any way. Company executives do not believe they are under obligation to provide guidance to Japonica, this executive said. **********As for the nonshop section of the disclosure document, Borden is said to believe that there are no preconditions to prevent it from providing information to Japonica, other than Japonica's signing a confidentiality agreement. Japonica has not done so. **********Borden executives, this person said, are not receptive to the idea of offering Mr. Kazarian's offer alongside the one from Kohlberg, Kravis, because they do not believe Japonica has made a legitimate proposal. **********Mr. Kazarian was said to be spending much of the day yesterday with his associates in conference rooms at the Manhattan law offices of Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman & Goodman. When asked whether and when he would begin a hostile bid, Mr. Kazarian replied, ""We hope to remain friendly."""

But the litigation this time would focus not on securities trades, but rather on a more unusual contention: that some Prudential brokers were practicing law without a license. **********A ruling quietly issued recently by a Federal judge has caused a number of former clients and their lawyers to explore bringing new litigation against the firm and its brokers for actions they say were taken in the class settlement of claims arising from Prudential's sale of the VMS Mortgage Investment Fund in the late 1980's. **********In her ruling, Judge Susan Conlon, who oversaw the VMS case in Federal District Court in Chicago, held that four Michigan investors could bring a new lawsuit against their brokers for dispensing legal advice without a license. Investors who participated in the settlement in 1991 saw a return of pennies for each dollar they invested, while some investors who sued the firm individually received far more. A Different Tack **********Lawyers for some former Prudential clients said the ruling would give investors their first opportunity to bring to trial their accusations that they were misled into joining the settlement. **********Other efforts at bringing suit on the issue have usually focused on claims of fraud or negligent misrepresentation, and Judge Conlon has essentially ruled that those matters were covered by the class action settlement. **********""Before this order, these clients had no redress,"" said Cary Lapidus, a lawyer who represents investors who say they were misled. ""If Judge Conlon is now allowing some investors to pursue their claims outside of the class action, then she has provided an avenue of relief for them."" **********Prudential has repeatedly denied that clients were misled into joining the settlement. William Ahearn, a Prudential spokesman, said a number of memos distributed through Prudential's internal computer system had instructed brokers to offer no advice about the settlement. ""We are confident that those advisories have been heeded,"" he said. **********Judge Conlon ruled on the matter because she retained control of the class action after the settlement was reached, and so still hears cases involving disputes between Prudential and investors who were part of the class action. **********Her decision, which was first reported in Securities Week, a trade publication, came after Prudential filed a motion with Judge Conlon asking her to enforce the settlement and dismiss the cases. Prudential has filed a motion for Judge Conlon to reconsider her decision. **********In interviews and in complaints filed with regulators, former clients and former brokers have said that Prudential and some brokers misled investors by persuading them to join the class action settlement. Some former brokers have said they were instructed by their managers to mislead clients about their legal rights, telling them that the class action was their only legal remedy. **********In fact, the clients could have brought individual lawsuits against the firm. Former clients said that once they were told they had no other legal option, they agreed to participate in the class action settlement. **********These assertions are being investigated by regulators and Government officials."

Similar measures were taken on Monday and Tuesday. **********The delays began after the papers published reports on a large Hamas rally in Gaza on Saturday, citing a crowd estimate by the organizers of 70,000 participants. The Palestinian police had put the number at 5,000. Some Western news organizations used a figure of 20,000. **********""It's a form of censorship, basically,"" said Marwan Abu Zalaf, editor in chief of Al Quds. ""They are making a kind of clampdown because they want us to abide by their statements. Where is the democracy that the Palestinian Authority advocates? The police are supposed to enhance democracy, not abuse it."" **********Although it normally supports the Palestinian Authority, Al Quds has attacked the restrictions in editorial columns and cartoons. On Tuesday it published a caricature of the Gaza police chief, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, showing him in an office equipped with a censor's stamp and scissors, sitting next to a sign that said: ""The distribution of papers in Gaza is forbidden because their news doesn't suit my mood."" **********General Jabali has attributed the delays to heavy rains in Gaza, difficulties at an Israeli checkpoint and ""routine procedures."" He denied there were orders to hold up the newspapers. ""There is no official decision to ban or confiscate the newspapers,"" he said. **********But Yasir Abed Rabbo, who holds the Information and Culture portfolio in the authority, told Palestinian journalists that the delays were ""a decision by the authority at the highest level,"" an apparent reference to Yasir Arafat. **********Mr. Abed Rabbo criticized the actions, however. ""We are against any measures that violate the freedom of the press, and they must be lifted quickly,"" he said. ""We will not allow, with all the means at our disposal, any such possibility. Palestinian mouths should not and will not be shut by Palestinian hands."" He said the issue would be discussed at the weekly meeting of the Palestinian Authority on Saturday. **********The authority drew criticism from Palestinians when it banned the distribution of An Nahar last July, asserting that its pro-Jordanian stance ran counter to Palestinian interests. The paper was allowed to reappear five weeks later after it abandoned its pro-Jordanian line and declared its loyalty to the P.L.O."

Both new companies said they were trying to simplify the task of retrieving information with a personal computer. **********The services, which are part of a growing wave of cottage businesses using the Internet to reach millions of computer users, are made possible by the falling cost of delivering information electronically. Until recently, this has tended to be more costly than using conventional paper-based delivery. **********Infoseek Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif., company founded by the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steven Kirsch, is using the Internet to permit computer users to simply search large commercial publication data bases at low cost. **********Farcast Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., software developer, has begun delivering what it describes as an ""agent based"" news and information service for personal computer and mobile electronic mail users. Personalized Setup **********Farcast permits subscribers to establish lists of topics or companies they wish to follow by mailing them to the company's centralized retrieval system. Articles are then sent to the user as electronic mail messages after they are delivered to the central server computers by four news services: The Associated Press, United Press International, Business Wire and PR Newswire. Farcast also offers automatic stock quotes on individual companies and industries. **********The agents, which are programs that monitor the text sent by the news services as it streams into Farcast's computers, are referred to as ""Droids."" They can be as simple as a company name or a topic. When a match is found in an article it is immediately electronically mailed to the subscriber. **********""We're not trying to replace newspapers,"" said Scott Love, one of Farcast's co-founders. ""We think we're a great addition to reading a newspaper."" **********He said that the company planned to add new information services monthly and was pricing Farcast at less than a dollar a day regardless of the amount of use. He said that many on-line services currently had low monthly fees, but additional use could make the services prohibitive. Infoseek Taps Ziff Davis **********Last week Infoseek began a trial service with Ziff Davis Communications as a data base. Computer users who have a direct connection to the Internet can connect to Infoseek's data base server and retrieve articles by typing queries in plain English. The Ziff Davis data base contains abstract and full text from 140 publications. When the service is offered commercially later this year Infoseek expects to charge about 10 cents a query, far less than current on-line services such as Mead Data Corporation and Dialog. **********""The era of expensive information is drawing to a close,"" said Mr. Kirsch, the founder of Infoseek.

The soundtrack blares into the eerily empty streets outlined in silver moonlight, the noise competing with the nearby mosque's call to prayer. In a city whose survival depends on the politics of faction leaders and armed gunmen, the theater's owner, Ali Hassan Mohammed, 48, is known and liked by just about everyone. **********The Cinema Equatore, which seats about 800, was closed for almost two years, but Mr. Mohammed reopened it last March, three months after the American troops arrived. Despite bombings by United Nations troops in its neighborhood, major battles right outside its doors and many empty seats, it has almost uninterruptedly offered two shows a night and once-a-week concerts of Somali music. **********This week's hits were ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""The Dirty Dozen,"" two films about fighting in a bombed-out city. But the theater is a testament to the Somalis' instinct for survival. The customers have to walk to the movies because of pervasive car theft at night, and the 50-cent entrance fee is steep in a city with little official employment. Yet many are willing to take the risk for a change of pace. **********'Nothing Else to Do' **********Before the civil war, Mogadishu had 18 movie theatres, all of them open-air because of the climate. Now three others have opened, but they are much smaller. Built in 1970, the theater was a favorite playground for the capital's Italian expatriates, showing Rossellini and Fellini movies. For Muslim Somalis, it was one of the few places where men and women could freely socialize. Now few women brave the streets to come, and the movies, pirated and scratchy, are mostly American action thrillers or Italian Mafia stories. The first movie shown after the American troop arrival was ""Delta Force."" **********""There is nothing else to do at night in Mogadishu,"" said Mohammed Dahir Dirir, 26, a cigarette seller who goes to the movies several times a week. ""I like American action movies, especially war movies. We compare it with the war here in Somalia."" **********In the past year, many small family-run businesses such as Mr. Mohammed's theater have reappeared in Mogadishu, shutting temporarily or moving to quieter areas when the fighting flared. This type of entrepreneurship has become the basis of the economy in a country without a government, central electricity, phones or working sanitation and with the only steady salaried employment the relatively few jobs created by the United Nations, the United States military and relief agencies. As the American troops pull out this month, many of the businessmen are worried. Mr. Mohammed's clientele has been decreasingfrom about 500 people a night earlier this year. He says he barely breaks even. **********Desperately Poor **********""My theater will stay open provided there is no war,"" he said. ""Life was better with the Americans around. But now I am worried. Fewer people are coming to the movies because they just don't have any more money. There is no work and if they have money they use it for food. I need to buy new chairs and repair the theater, but if I fix them now and there is a war, people will take them. So I'm waiting to make sure we will have peace."" **********Now, increasing looting and banditry are shutting many of the new businesses that had opened in the past months. And unemployment remains a serious problem. Mogadishu is still a desperately poor city, where tens of thousands of displaced Somalis are barely managing to survive, many scavenging through the city's garbage piles or begging at street corners. Only a few food distribution centers are open, serving only women and children, and malnutrition rates are rising again. **********Patrons Come to Dream **********Yet the city is alive, jammed with cars, overloaded red and yellow taxis, teetering buses and rusted antique trucks. There are hawkers and shops, camels and donkey carts, and ubiquitous electricity generators. Guns are visible everywhere, the gleaming metal barrels of AK-47's and M-16's poking out of most car windows to protect against carjackers. And hired gunmen are reputed to earn the best salaries in town. **********Some shops are nothing more than ragged tin and wooden shacks propped up on street corners selling old clothes, car parts and food. Near them, new shiny painted signs advertise hotels and fax and photocopying services. An electronics store takes up a whole city block and is festooned with Christmas lights powered by its own generator. **********Mr. Mohammed's cinema occupies a site on a traffic circle in the center of the city. The circle, which also has two buildings that serve as United Nations strongpoints, has been the focus of some of the most vicious fighting this past year. **********Most recently, two Somalis armed with rocket-propelled grenades opened fire on a Saudi Arabian food distribution center behind the theater. The show went on that evening after all moviegoers, in accordance with Mr. Mohammed's rules, were thoroughly searched for weapons. **********Mr. Mohammed, who studied English at Brandeis University, is a fan of his own movies, and he personally nurses the cranky video projector every night. The movie theater, he says, is the only place truly at peace in Mogadishu. **********""People come here to escape their worries and to dream,"" said Mr. Mohammed. ""The first time I showed Rambo, there were so many who came I had to make three showings."""

Until last year, Soviet officials maintained the outbreak was a natural one originating in contaminated meat. **********One of the first admissions that the outbreak came from a biological warfare plant came from President Boris N. Yeltsin, who in a 1992 speech was quoted as saying, ""The K.G.B. admitted that our military developments were the cause."" At the time of the 1979 outbreak, Mr. Yeltsin was the chief Communist Party official in Sverdlovsk, now called Yekaterinburg. **********Now with Mr. Yeltsin's aid, Russian and American scientists, including Russian doctors present during the original outbreak, have spent more than a year studying it. They have concluded that it ""resulted from the windborne spread of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen, that the source of the pathogen was at the military microbiology facility"" in Sverdlovsk, from which it escaped on Monday, April 2, 1979. **********""This should end the argument about where the outbreak came from,"" said Dr. Matthew Meselson, a Harvard molecular biologist and expert on chemical and biological warfare who led the scientific team. ""Right up until now, people have still been debating the matter."" **********Anthrax is a bacillus that has a dormant, or spore phase, and then an active phase in which it multiplies rapidly in the body. It gives off fatal toxins that kill immune system cells. In the spore phase, anthrax may enter the body through the skin, may be breathed or may be ingested with food. **********An official of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said today that the report could be important in the multilateral talks now going on to revise the Biological Weapons Convention. ""This demonstrates the value of being able to go in and check out these events routinely and immediately after they happen,"" he said. ""It makes a good argument for cooperation on verification measures."" **********The scientists -- including Dr. Meselson, Dr. Jeanne Guillemin of Boston College, Dr. Ilona Popova of Urals State University in Yekaterinburg, and Olga Yampolskaya of Botkin Hospital in Moscow -- interviewed many survivors and their relatives, reviewed medical and veterinary files and autopsy data, and finally were able to trace the locations of most of the victims on that Monday. **********They have created a detailed map which shows the anthrax cases did not occur in a scattered pattern, as would be expected for a natural outbreak, but in a narrow oval shape stretching downwind from the Sverdlovsk biological warfare plant to villages lying southeast of the city. **********All six of the villages in the region which reported outbreaks of anthrax among animals were inside the projected plume, and of the 66 people for whom home and workplace addresses were obtained, 60 could be placed by researchers in the plume on the day that the aerosol was released. **********The report, in the Nov. 18 issue of Science magazine, is the first substantial data outside a laboratory on the effect that a tiny amount of a biological warfare agent can have in a population. **********The report estimates that the amount of released anthrax spores was probably less than one gram, and possibly as little as a few milligrams, most likely in the form of a very fine, inhalable aerosol. **********Dr. Guillemin said some of the evidence important to getting detailed information on the symptoms of the victims was carefully preserved and kept away from the Soviet police and intelligence. **********She said Dr. Faina A. Abramova and Dr. Lev M. Grinberg could not think of a place to hide the slides from pathology exams of the victims, so they left them in open view among other slides on Dr. Abramova's desk. The notes from the exams remained in a waste bin, and the organs and other evidence were put on display in the little museum in Dr. Grinberg's clinic to keep them from looking hidden. **********When the scientists arrived beginning in 1992, the evidence was still there, in plain view. **********Anthrax has been an agent in the biological warfare stocks of the United States and the Soviet Union. During World War II, the United States like other countries had stocks of anthrax but never used them, Dr. Meselson said. The Japanese military also made anthrax bombs and experimented with the deadly bacillus on at least 30 human beings during the war."

Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, sent letters to U.S. Central and to the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal agency that regulates credit unions, asking whether the credit union was ""risking taxpayer monies by investing"" in Banesto, as the Spanish bank is known. **********Staff members of the banking committee said yesterday that the concerns of Mr. Gonzalez went well beyond U.S. Central, the linchpin of the Corporate Credit Union Network, which functions like a central bank for credit unions. The committee, they said, would ask the Federal Reserve to determine whether American banks other than J. P. Morgan & Company had been involved with the Spanish bank. J. P. Morgan had created an investment partnership that held an 8 percent stake in Banesto. **********Responding to Mr. Gonzalez's query, credit union officials said yesterday that the Banesto investment, whatever hindsight might show, was made in the name of diversity and safety. ""We pursue a diversification strategy that takes us into the highest-rated banks in the world,"" said Glenn Carter, the chief financial officer of U.S. Credit. ""Of the top 25 in the world, one is in the United States, of the top 250, 30 are in the United States."" **********Last summer, he said, U.S. Central made deposits of $10 million to $50 million, at maturities of three to 12 months, the last of which will mature on June 9. Mr. Carter declined to specify the interest rates on those deposits other than that they were at ""fair market value, reflective of market levels at the time."" **********When those deposits were made, Banesto enjoyed top ratings for its short-term debt from ratings agencies like the Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service. Those were among the data that Mr. Carter consulted. S.& P. lowered its rating on the Banesto debt on Dec. 13, two weeks before the Spanish Government appointed a new board and four months after U.S. Central made its last deposit in Banesto. **********As recently as last Friday, Mr. Carter said, a $10 million deposit matured and its principal and interest were paid by Banesto. And he said Spanish Government officials had said publicly, and the board of Banesto had stated in writing, that the American deposits were secure and would be fully repaid. **********Mr. Carter of U.S. Central said his credit union, which is based in Overland Park, Kan., had assets of about $27 billion, of which 15 to 30 percent was invested with foreign banks, ""the bulk of that in the United States in branches of foreign institutions."" Deposits Restricted **********The 13,000 credit unions that accept money from individuals are permitted by law to deposit their money only in United States Treasury securitiesor other Government-backed instruments. Their excess funds are deposited in what are known as ""corporate credit unions,"" of which there are 43, and which are permitted to deposit money overseas. These 43 regional or state credit unions, in turn, deposit their excess funds in U.S. Central. **********Robert Loftus, a spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration, said only four corporate credit unions had deposits overseas, none of them in Banesto. **********Aides to the House Banking Committee said yesterday that in addition to the specifics of the U.S. Central deposits, committee members were concerned about why the corporate credit unions were permitted to operate under less restrictive requirements than those imposed on banks and savings and loan deposits. **********The Senate voted in 1991 to impose higher capital standards on corporate credit unions, but the House did not."

Miles, of Pittsburgh, is the American subsidiary of Bayer A.G., the world's ninth-largest drug company. **********In October, the Hoechst Celanese Corporation, the American subsidiary of Hoechst A.G., the German pharmaceutical maker, paid $546 million for 51 percent of Copley Pharmaceutical Inc., a deal valued at about 12 times sales. The price proposed for Schein, which makes 350 products and had sales of $400 million last year, is only about three times sales. Miles makes prescription drugs and over-the-counter remedies like Bactine and Alka-Seltzer. 'U.S. Companies in a Mirage' **********Rita M. Freedman, a drug analyst at the PNC Bank Corporation, said prices for generic drug companies had declined somewhat as brand-name drug makers moved to capture a share of the generic market. **********Even so, Jerry I. Treppel, a senior vice president at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the deal ""clearly does put a very high premium on generic manufacturers."" He added, ""U.S. companies are still in a mirage, thinking they can compete with major generic manufacturers."" **********German drug companies, he said, already faced harsher price competition and harbored no illusions about maintaining fat margins. ""The Germans have seen the abyss,"" he added. A Family-Owned Business **********By offering a broader product mix, Miles will be better able to compete for large customers, such as managed-care organizations, which prefer to buy from as few suppliers as possible, said Horst Wallrabe, president of Miles's pharmaceutical division. ""If you accept that scenario,"" he added, ""we must have a stake in that field."" **********Schein, which began 40 years ago as a family-owned pharmacy in Queens, has an estimated 10 percent share of the $4.5 billion generic drug market. The market is expected to grow to $10 billion by 2000 as generic drug makers stamp out low-cost copies of brand-name products whose patents are due to expire. **********Schein's biggest selling products are generics of an antidepressant drug by Sandoz and a muscle relaxant drug by Merck, as well as its own brand of injectable iron, Martin Sperber, Schein's chairman and chief executive, said. **********Schein, which had considered a public offering in the near future, gains a competitive advantage through its alliance, Mr. Sperber said. By tapping Bayer's worldwide distribution network and access to raw materials, Schein could realize sales growth and cost savings it could not attain on its own, he said."

Hollings insisted he was not just ""shilling"" for South Carolina's apparel industry when he vowed this week to block Congressional approval of the global trade pact. **********That may be true. But before Mr. Hollings acted, he and other apparel-state lawmakers had already managed to add pretty much everything the industry wanted to the legislation, which underwent a last-minute flurry of political deal-making worth hundreds of millions of dollars to influential American companies. **********Nor is the apparel industry a singular case. As it shopped for Congressional support for the pact, the Clinton Administration agreed to do favors for a host of industries: steel, cars, wheat, lumber, cement, ball bearings, cellular telephones, civil aircraft and apparel. **********Buried in President Clinton's four-inch-thick proposal to Congress for putting the pact into effect are deals that include a $65 million reduction in Government fees on a new cellular telephone technology; higher effective tariffs on wheat imports; new labeling rules aimed at reducing Chinese apparel shipments to the United States, and changes in Government regulations that will make it easier for steel, cement, ball bearing and civil aircraft producers to win steep Commerce Department tariffs on foreign competitors. **********Although Congress cannot amend the actual 123-nation trade agreement, which was negotiated in December in Geneva, it can help the Administration to write the legislation that puts the pact's provisions into law. The only legal restriction in drafting that so-called enabling legislation is that nothing may contradict the Geneva pact; trade law changes that do not appear in the pact are allowed in the bill and have been included. **********Even some industry leaders professed to be appalled at the dickering. ""I think that all of these trade deals are getting bogged down with far too many industry-specific provisions that are not an appropriate part of trade policy,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Mr. Jasinowski's organization wound up not seeking any special deals, but that is because its members could not agree on what they wanted. **********""We all know that getting trade agreements through Congress requires some horse trading, but I think we've gone too far down the road of horse trading,"" he added. **********The Clinton Administration won Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement with a grocery list of agricultural deals, including extra protection from foreign competition for American producers of tomatoes, orange juice, wheat and sugar beets. **********The basic outlines of the enabling legislation have been set for weeks. But as Congress came closer to bringing it to a vote, the Administration cut final deals in marathon drafting sessions in the last two weeks to woo lawmakers like Mr. Hollings and others. President Clinton submitted the bill on Tuesday evening, and no further changes can be made. **********Under the so-called fast-track rules, the House and Senate will each vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on the measure. **********If approved by Congress and other countries, the Geneva pact would lower tariffs around the world and expand the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to cover farming and service industries like accounting. **********Only a handful of countries have approved the trade pact so far, and many, particularly in Europe, are waiting to see what the United States will do and follow suit. No minimum number of the 123 nations is required for approval, and the pact takes effect among all that sign it.  Administration officials contend that provisions aimed at specific industries reflect good public policy rather than political manipulation. **********""They are all calculated to keep American business competitive and keep American jobs in this country,"" said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. ""They had nothing to do with votes."" **********The Administration chose, for instance, to impose fees on the new high-capacity, short-range cellular phone technology, but to make them $65 million less than the Federal Communications Commission had proposed because the Administration has long wanted to encourage pioneers of the technology, said Lawrence J. Haas, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. The fees are being imposed to raise money that will offset tariff revenues that the pact will eliminate. **********""It's not the case that we changed our position because of lobbying,"" Mr. Haas said. **********Several members of Congress complained in interviews today that they were still trying to figure out what was in the voluminous legislation and who obtained what deals. ""There is no way that it is broadly understood by the membership, and I find it incredible that they want to bring up a bill of this magnitude, equal to the health bill, and put it through before we leave,"" said Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who is critical of free-trade pacts. **********One of the most contentious special provisions in the trade bill would help American textile and apparel producers by changing the rules for apparel import quotas in a way that would severely restrict shipments from China. **********The deal did not satisfy Senator Hollings, who declared on Wednesday, ""Yes, we'll lose a million textile jobs, but I'm not shilling for one industry, I'm shilling for the United States of America."" **********Retailers contend that the provision might help American clothing producers but would hurt consumers enormously. The measure would block imports that account for $6 billion to $12 billion of the nation's $56 billion a year in retail clothing sales, said John C. Dill, a senior vice president at the Washington-based National Retail Federation, which represents many stores whose inventories depend on cheap imports. **********The American Textile Manufacturers Institute contends that the effect would be much smaller and that retailers have been taking advantage of peculiarities in the current rules that the provision would eliminate. ""It's a scam -- they're exploiting a loophole"" involving a garment's country of origin for quota and tariff purposes, said Carlos F. J. Moore, executive vice president of the textile group. **********Under current United States Customs Service regulations, the country of origin depends on where the fabric was cut into the appropriately sized pieces to make the garment. Under the new provision, the country of origin would depend on where these pieces are sewn together. **********The provision might severely limit American apparel imports, because the United States has large quotas for imports from countries where a lot of clothing is cut but smaller quotas for countries where a lot of clothing is sewn. The quotas would stay the same, so the rule change would create an artificial bottleneck, at least until manufacturers could move factories to other countries. **********For instance, some places with rising wages and large cutting operations, like Hong Kong, retain large quotas for selling apparel in the United States even though they no longer have large numbers of low-wage seamstresses. **********So manufacturers in Hong Kong cut fabric for clothing which they then send to China for sewing, which accounts for most of the cost of clothing production. Under current rules, they can still sell the garments in the United States under Hong Kong's quotas. **********If the new provision becomes law, Hong Kong apparel shipments to the United States would presumably fall in volume and become more expensive -- two developments that would help their American competitors. China already cuts, sews and ships the maximum quantity allowed under American quotas for many categories of clothing and would not be allowed to ship more, so as to make up any shortfall from Hong Kong."

Those clients included the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the New York City Employees' Retirement Systems, and the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension Fund. Some clients said they had moved their accounts because of poor investment results, but people familiar with the firm's operations said most defections came after clients became aware of the pending S.E.C. investigation. **********The telephone number listed for Galleon has been disconnected and, according to the S.E.C., the firm is winding down its operations. Galleon's owner, Louis Acevedo, who was also named in the S.E.C. suit, could not be reached for comment yesterday. His lawyer, Michael Lipman of San Diego, confirmed the settlement last night, but declined further comment on the case or on the status of his client's firm. **********Both Galleon and Mr. Acevedo agreed to settle the civil case without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, the S.E.C. said. In addition, the S.E.C. said, the firm and Mr. Acevedo have agreed to give back $243,000 of the $286,000 that the agency said was obtained through the scheme. The commission noted that the settlement was reduced because of the firm's ""demonstrated inability to pay"" the entire sum. **********The S.E.C. case brings to a dark end a bright story of success for Mr. Acevedo, who was raised in the Bronx and became a successful money manager for the Wells Fargo Bank in Los Angeles before starting his own firm in 1990. **********By last summer, his firm handled nearly $160 million in pension fund accounts and Mr. Acevedo, who is in his late 30's, had drawn attention as one of the more visible figures in the small community of minority-owned equity investment firms. In August, he was interviewed by Fortune magazine, which cited his ""deft selection of large growth stocks."" **********Colleen P. Mahoney, the deputy director of the S.E.C. enforcement division, said last night that the Galleon case was part of a continuing investigation by the agency. ""Chairman Arthur Levitt has made it clear that the commission will place emphasis on policing the conduct of investment advisers,"" Ms. Mahoney said. ""This is part of the commission's efforts to examine investment advisory practices."" **********The Galleon case spotlights an arcane Wall Street currency known as ""soft dollars,"" which are actually indirect rebates of brokerage commissions to the clients whose trades generated those commissions. **********In a typical soft-dollar arrangement, a money manager agrees to trade enough through a particular broker to generate a certain level of commissions for that broker. In return, that broker agrees to forward part of the commissions to other firms that supply research or other services to the money manager. **********Such arrangements have been standard practice in the securities industry for decades, and are legal if the soft dollars made available to a money manager are used to obtain services that benefit the clients whose money generated the brokerage commissions in the first place. **********But in the Galleon case, the S.E.C. charged that Mr. Acevedo and his firm used doctored invoices and fictitious bills to improperly obtain soft-dollar rebates to cover the firm's promotional and computer services, as well as Mr. Acevedo's personal legal expenses. **********In one instance, the S.E.C. asserted, Mr. Acevedo even converted these soft-dollar rebates into hard cash by directing an employee to submit a bill from an outside company the employee controlled; when the bill was paid by one of the firm's brokers, the S.E.C. said, the employee gave the cash to Mr. Acevedo. **********The commission also accused Galleon and Mr. Acevedo of excessive trading, or ""churning,"" in certain client accounts to increase the soft dollars available for the firm's use."

The actress Janet Leigh, looking purposefully into the camera, intoned three times: ""Vote . . . and the choice is yours. Don't vote . . . and the choice is theirs."" For those unable to take their medicine orally, Ms. Leigh stood by an oversized sign that bore the same message. **********Today's pitch is typified by commercials from the 1994 campaign for Rock the Vote, the nonpartisan organization working to motivate young people to participate in the political process. The spots carry a far bolder theme: ""Take the law into your own hands. Vote."" **********One likens the cataclysmic power of voting to effect change to that of a ""rogue asteroid"" colliding with Earth, ""destroying life as we know it."" Another, showing a man being repeatedly slapped in the face, ends with an announcer asking sardonically, ""Had enough?"" **********David Graham, a copywriter at N. W. Ayer & Partners in New York, who helped create the Rock the Vote commercials, explained the shift. **********""It's a much more media-literate country you're advertising to,"" he said. ""You have to do a much bigger job in a much shorter time to make the message stick."" **********Nicholas Butterworth, former executive director of Rock the Vote in New York, who serves as its spokesman, agreed. **********""We're playing catch-up because there's so little civic education these days,"" he said. ""No one's out there with the message that your vote matters."" **********One fact that hasn't changed is that celebrities still play a significant role in voting ads. **********A series of commercials from the Hollywood Policy Center Foundation, a nonprofit organization that coordinates issue advertising for the entertainment industry, presents stars of popular television series on their sets: Tim Allen of the ABC sitcom ""Home Improvement""; Shelley Fabares of the ABC sitcom ""Coach""; Julia Louis-Dreyfus of the NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld""; Luke Perry and Tori Spelling of the Fox series ""Beverly Hills, 90210,"" and the actors who portray the dysfunctional Bundy family on the Fox sitcom ""Married . . . With Children."" **********The spots were created for the Media Voting Project, a voter education effort sponsored by 26 foundations including the Carnegie, Ford, Revson and Rockefeller. They were written by Dan Mountain, a longtime agency creative executive, and produced by Moffitt-Lee Productions in Hollywood. **********Some spots are humorous, like the Bundys' decision to vote because it's something ""we could do as a family that doesn't cost money."" Others are thought-provoking, like Mr. Allen's, in which he declares: ""Sometimes I look at my family, and I say, 'What kind of world am I leaving them?' And I'm not always sure I like the answer."" All are engaging. **********""In the 80's, the Media Voting Project did a number of get-out-the-vote spots that looked like your normal get-out-the-vote spots,"" said Kathy Garmezy, executive director at the center in Los Angeles. ""They got play but not that much."" **********""Our spots are different,"" she added. ""They're a little 'off' in a positive sense and a little more hip, so they seem more real."" **********That helped the commercials ""be more appealing to the stations"" that decide which public service announcements to run, Ms. Garmezy said. In 1992, the first time the center and the Media Voting Project joined forces, their commercials, which also involved celebrities, ran 1,700 to 2,300 times on 204 stations in 152 cities. Figures for 1994 will not be available until after Election Day."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/19/business/company-reports-record-profit-for-chrysler-in-4th-quarter.html,James Bennet,1994-01-19,,688,,The New York Times,Business Day,Statistics,article,Record Profit For Chrysler In 4th Quarter,COMPANY REPORTS; Record Profit For Chrysler In 4th Quarter," **********The Chrysler Corporation reported today that its earnings almost doubled to a record $777 million in the fourth quarter of 1993, beating even the rosiest predictions by Wall Street analysts. **********A recovering North American automobile market and Chrysler's revived line of cars and trucks contributed to a year of record earnings over all for the company, before taxes and charges for accounting changes. **********But in part because of a previously announced charge of $4.68 billion to account for the health care of its future retirees, Chrysler lost $2.55 billion, or $7.62 a share, for the year.  Total revenue for the year was $43.6 billion, compared with a record of $36.9 billion set in 1992. Previous Record in 1984 **********For the quarter ended Dec. 31, earnings were $2.11 a share, compared with $1.12 a share, on net earnings of $356 million, in the fourth quarter of 1992. The most optimistic forecast, by Zacks Investment Research, had been $1.90 a share. Chrysler's previous record for a fourth quarter, in 1984, was $607 million. **********In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chrysler shares hit a record of $63.50 early in the day, before closing today at $62.50 a share, up 75 cents. It was the Big Board's second most actively traded issue. In a little more than a year, the stock has nearly doubled, reflecting the growing affirmation on Wall Street of the No. 3 auto maker's turnaround. **********""What this quarter says in no uncertain terms is that this is a superbly managed company,"" said Philip K. Fricke of Prudential Securities. ""The company has been dead-on in product development."" Further, he said, Chrysler's introductions of new vehicles, like the Neon subcompact, have occurred without the production glitches that restrained sales of new models in the past. **********Mr. Fricke added that at this point in a cyclical auto recovery heartening earnings surprises tend to be the norm. ""Several positive forces start to come together at this point in auto cycles,"" he said. Increased sales volume spreads fixed costs more thinly, while buyers begin picking more expensive models and options, and, faced with robust demand, companies reduce rebates. **********Indeed, Chrysler reported that in the fourth quarter it further reduced rebates because of the popularity of vehicles like its mid-sized Dodge Intrepid sedan, Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility wagon, and restyled Dodge Ram pickup. For the quarter, such incentives averaged $650 a vehicle, down 16 percent from $775 in the third quarter, and down 36 percent from $1,020 a year ago, said Gary C. Valade, Chrysler's executive vice president and chief financial officer. **********As a result, pretax profit per vehicle averaged $1,727 in the fourth quarter, and $1,335 for the year, far higher than that at the Ford Motor Company or the General Motors Corporation, analysts said. **********Along with growing profits and sales, Chrysler has gained market share. For the year, the company said it had picked up 1.4 percentage points to hold 14.8 percent of the North American car and truck market, its largest share since 1970, when it had 15.3 percent. G.M. controls about a third of the North American market, and Ford about a quarter. **********While Chrysler's overseas sales are growing -- the company reported today that they had jumped 45 percent for the year, to 105,849 vehicles -- it trails its domestic competitors in exploiting foreign markets. But with the Japanese and European markets slumping, Chrysler's insulation from those markets has proved a boon to the company's bottom line. **********The company reported today that it had further reduced its unfinanced pension liability -- essentially, the amount of money it had not set aside to cover the pensions of future retirees. That liability shrank to $2.2 billion at the end of last year, from $3.9 billion at the end of 1992, Mr. Valade said. The company put $3.5 billion into the fund during the year, but changes in the discount rate and new labor contracts that increased pensions ate up some of that, he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/business/the-executive-computer-how-lotus-is-raising-the-level-of-group-dynamics.html,Laurie Flynn,1994-04-10,,1394,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,The Executive Computer; How Lotus Is Raising the Level of Group Dynamics,The Executive Computer; How Lotus Is Raising the Level of Group Dynamics," **********FOR most of its four years on the market, Lotus Notes was something of a misfit in the software industry, a quirky individualist in an era of me-too products. **********But Notes is now one of the hottest selling programs in the business-software market. Last year revenue from Notes sales more than doubled, to about one-tenth of the Lotus Development Corporation's total revenues of $981 million. And industry analysts expect Notes to do even better in 1994. By the end of the year, they predict, more than a million people will be using it. **********Notes belongs to that ever-expanding category of software known as groupware, a rather vague catch-all for programs that work on networks of personal computers and enable people to collaborate in one way or another. But most software that calls itself groupware focuses on a single discrete task, like group scheduling or document editing. **********Notes, by contrast, is the Swiss Army Knife of groupware -- a software package that allows corporate programmers to create applications to handle any of hundreds of work-group tasks. Examples include holding electronic meetings with co-workers, sharing project reports and creating sales-tracking systems. **********Its most distinguishing feature is that it lets customers take a rather free-form approach to creating network data bases -- libraries of client accounts, sales statistics, customer-service reference materials and other types of data that need to be widely shared within a company. **********It is a marked departure from traditional relational data bases, in which information is structured in a fixed format and relationships between various pieces of information are set and inflexible. **********A client-account system written in a traditional data base, for example, might have on-screen fields of a fixed length for a client contact name, a telephone number, the account manager's name and so on. The user could search the data base for any of these fields. But each screen might also have a field for additional comments, also of fixed length, and this information may not be accessible through a data base search. **********Notes is seen as innovative because it provides a flexible repository for corporate data that can be searched and retrieved by various people according to their specific needs. A client-account data base written in Notes, for instance, might include room for lengthy comments about the client as well as documents from prior sales. The user can conduct data base searches that would comb through this information as well as the more conventional elements like names and phone numbers. **********And unlike most other data base software, Notes can be used with a mix of software operating systems -- whether PC's running Windows, Apple Macintoshes or Unix machines. **********The result, say Notes advocates, is better sharing of information across broad organizations, a strategy they say fits with today's business ""re-engineering"" trend toward flatter management structures and less hierarchy. A study being released this week by the market researcher International Data Corporation, based on visits to 68 Notes customers in 11 countries, concludes that Notes can improve white-collar productivity in companies by as much as 25 percent. **********""Customers were changing their model at the same time the tool was available to fill the need,"" said Ray Ozzie, the software programmer who designed Notes for Lotus. **********But potential buyers shouldn't expect Notes to replace their existing corporate data base systems. As Lotus itself acknowledges, there are plenty of things Notes isn't good at. It wouldn't be feasible, for example, to use Notes for heavy-duty transaction-processing chores like real-time entry of sales orders or sending out customers' bills. **********And Notes isn't cheap. At roughly $400 a user, Notes adds a hefty sum to the price of any network installation. **********What is more, getting corporate management to buy into Notes can still be tough -- information-systems managers can be very set in their computing ways. **********""Corporate I.S. is used to seeing structured data,"" said Stephen Verderber, an information systems analyst at Varian Systems, a large Notes customer in Palo Alto, Calif. ""They see Notes, and they don't get it. Noncomputer professionals have an easier time with it."" **********At Kubota Pacific Computer Inc., the executive staff was ""information starved"" until bringing in Notes, said Bernard Miller, chief information officer of the Santa Clara, Calif., work-station maker, which had revenues last year of about $45 million. The biggest contribution of Notes was providing the laptop-toting sales force with a standard way of reporting results to management, Mr. Miller said. **********""All of a sudden, the company had a vision of what it was doing,"" Mr. Miller said. **********And in the 28 offices of the Environmental Protection Agency, Notes provides an inexpensive way to track and coordinate public requests for information. The agency estimates that it would have cost about $2 million and taken two years to implement such a system using mainframe computer technology. With the Notes setup, the document data base was designed and implemented in six months and for about one-tenth the cost, according to Dave Henderson, chief of information in the E.P.A.'s regional office in San Francisco. **********Lotus's recent announcement that it is working with A.T.& T. to provide Notes-based computer services over a public network should help the product reach a broader market and become more useful to existing Notes customers because the public-network arrangement will allow them to compute collaboratively with people outside their own organizations. **********When it becomes publicly available early next year, A.T.& T. Network Notes -- as it is called -- will enable companies that use Notes to better communicate and share data with their customers, suppliers and remote offices around the globe by connecting them over telephone lines to ""server"" computers running the software. The documents can include graphics, audio and video, assuming the sender and recipients have computers equipped to handle them. **********The deal with A.T.& T. solves what Jim Manzi, chairman of Lotus, calls the ""last hundred yards problem"" for businesses that want to connect to the information superhighway. Today, corporations wanting such wide-area network capabilities usually must create private networks, generally using leased lines; managing and supporting such private networks can be expensive and complicated. But with the public Notes network, A.T.& T. is promising to absorb the hassle, and a lot of the costs. **********Notes, however, won't much longer be the only game in town. The Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc. are both preparing groupware products aimed directly at Notes' cozy market niche. **********Microsoft plans a line of competing software code-named Touchdown, which is supposed to reach the market in the second half of the year. One piece, called E.M.S. for enterprise messaging services, will offer enhanced mail services that Microsoft contends will go far beyond those offered in Notes. **********And Microsoft is reportedly working on its own public network deal with A.T.& T. (Both Microsoft and A.T.& T will confirm they have had discussions, but neither will provide details.) **********Meanwhile, the Wordperfect Corporation has been pursuing a similar arrangement with the MCI Communications Corporation to provide public-network links for customers of its coming groupware software, Wordperfect Office. Novell Inc. will be absorbing that technology as part of its acquisition of Wordperfect, a deal announced last month. Wordperfect Office already has some of the functions of Notes, like document management, and a version more closely paired with Novell's Netware networking software is in the lab. **********From all indications, the battle for the groupware customer will be a fierce one. Both Microsoft and Novell will attempt to use their dominance in desktop and network operating systems to their fullest advantages. Lotus, for its part, contends that it will have an advantage because most large corporations use a mix of operating systems -- all of which work with Notes. **********As for the competitive clamor, Lotus appears to be enjoying the opportunity to say ""I told you so."" John Landry, the company's chief technologist, recalls that when he was hired by Mr. Manzi in 1991, the software industry was skeptical that Notes could amount to anything -- and even wondered whether Lotus itself was long for this world. **********Now, Mr. Landry said, ""It's 'What a genius Jim Manzi was for seeing its potential.'

Now Power to Rocket Forces Is Cut Off,Russia's Poor Army! Now Power to Rocket Forces Is Cut Off," **********In an episode that has driven millions of Russians to tears of laughter -- and many others to just plain tears -- the Moscow regional electricity authority severed all power to the nation's Strategic Nuclear Missile Command Center on Wednesday because nobody had bothered to pay the bills. **********The Odintsovo Central Command Post, 15 miles west of Moscow, which controls one of the largest clusters of nuclear missiles on earth, immediately switched to an emergency fail-safe system for four hours until power was restored. **********But the incident, and the naked reminder that human error can quickly dismantle even the most elaborate defenses, drove Russia's political leaders into a frenzy of accusation and reprisal today. And it provided a painful new indication of just how significant the military's financial problems really are. **********""There are no words in the Russian language, even unprintable ones, to describe what happened,"" Gen. Igor Sergeyev, commander of the strategic rocket forces said today. ""You cannot even imagine how much switching off the electricity threatened the security of the country."" **********Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, usually among the most circumspect and reserved of politicians, called the action ""scandalous."" Before meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin this afternoon he said: ""The person guilty of this outrage will be punished today. If the bureaucrat who did this was guided by financial considerations, he was trying to be more holy than the Pope."" **********Many other parliamentary leaders joined Mr. Chernomyrdin in denouncing the action. They pointed out that such an action violated basic laws governing national security.  The incident would have been embarrassing whenever it occurred. But coming two days before Mr. Yeltsin plans to leave for the United States, where he will discuss nuclear safety and security among other issues, the timing could not have been less fortunate. **********It is not clear exactly why the electricity department decided to cut power to the missile center when it did. The Itar-Tass news agency reported today that Pavel Siyukov, the chief of the Moscow power supply region, made the decision. **********Agency officials said they were unaware that they were cutting off such a vital military installation, and said they never would have done it if they had known. But officials at the missile center countered that the agency had already warned them to pay up or else and that it was impossible that such a large and important consumer of electricity as the rocket forces could be confused with another client. **********Whatever the reasons, the military officials used the embarrassing event as yet another opportunity to lobby for more funds for the shrinking defense forces. The bill is almost the only issue not in doubt: the Defense Ministry owed Mosenergo, the power authority, 2.5 billion rubles (almost $1 million). **********According to the Energy Supervision Directorate of the Moscow region, the Russian Defense Ministry owes more than 50 billion rubles ($20 million) in electricity bills for all its institutions in the Moscow region. The Defense Ministry has paid no energy bills since January, according to Yevgeny Dubinsky the power authority's chief engineer, and it has ignored all warnings to do so. **********Gen. Vasily Vorovyov, head of the ministry's budget department, told Itar-Tass that like many governmental and private employers in Russia today, the military simply did not have enough money to pay its electricity bills. **********""If the problem of meeting the debts of the army and navy are not decided at a state level,"" he said, ""then the possibility of a crisis cannot be ruled out."" **********Like many governmental agencies, the Russian military has undergone sharp budget reductions over the last several years, particularly since it has withdrawn forces from the Baltic nations and Germany. Nonetheless, there are still billions of dollars a year devoted to the military in this country, and many commentators speaking on television and radio said today that it was ludicrous to suggest that the military simply could not afford to provide power to its most sensitive rocket installations."

Start-ups that wagered everything on one drug suffered most. **********""The large pharmaceutical companies have the ability to bury their dead at night,"" said William H.

And the rebel group's leader, Umar Avturkhanov, who formally broke with the Chechen government and pledged his allegiance to Russia while visiting Moscow this weekend, provided the Russian Government with an opportunity to act. **********Moscow has said it will not send troops to the republic of Chechnya, but it is now engaged in its most menacing war of words yet. **********President Boris N. Yeltsin's patience snapped last week after a mass kidnapping by a Chechen gang in the Russian resort town of Mineralnye Vody, on the Chechen border. A police rescue attempt failed, and at least five hostages were killed. **********Moscow blamed the Chechen government, accusing it of doing nothing to stop Chechen criminals from operating across the border. It was the third such mass kidnapping in 12 weeks, but the first in which hostages died. **********But the leaders of Chechnya, who still control the capital, are threatening to fight both the opposition forces, which control the Nadterechnaya district, and -- should it come to that -- Russia troops. ""We will wage a war if the Russian leadership forces it upon us,"" said Vice President Zelimkhan Yanderbiyev. **********In Grozny, the capital, the authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Avturkhanov on charges of treason and asked the acting Russian prosecutor to extradite him. Mr. Avturkhanov is the only major opposition leader in Chechnya who advocates returning to the Russian federation. **********Chechnya, an oil-producing republic of 1.3 million people situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian, is formally a part of Russia. **********Dzhokhar Dudayev, a retired Soviet Air Force general, called for elections in the republic in October 1991, and won them. He declared independence as the Soviet Union was collapsing. Mr. Yeltsin sent troops in but rescinded the order two days later after protests in Parliament. **********Since then, Russia has never done much to enforce its sovereignty, but fears new independence movements throughout the north Caucasus. That fear, Russian officials say, is the prime reason Moscow intervened in the Georgian civil war, when Abkhazia tried to secede from Georgia. Russian troops are now patrolling the Abkhazia-Georgia war zone to enforce a cease-fire, an operation recently approved by the United Nations. **********""Despite a generally difficult situation in the Caucasus, Russia's main pain is Chechnya,"" Prime Minister Viktor S.

Some like the fact that insiders own so much of the stock. Others adore how cranberry prices keep rising along with demand. And still others, the easy-to-please types, just like knowing that a box of cranberries will land at every shareholder's doorsteps each year -- just in time for Thanksgiving. **********But whatever their reasons, they've nearly all made money playing the bogs. The grower, based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., has been one of the quieter successes among over-the-counter stocks in recent years. **********The stock, which closed at $18.25 on Friday, has risen threefold since 1990, with more than $2 of the gain posted in the fourteen months since the company broke away from the powerful Ocean Spray Cooperative. What makes that rise all the more remarkable is that the company is not offering a futuristic technology or bioengineered berry, but simply excels at the dull, familiar task of planting vines each spring and harvesting the fruit each fall. **********The rest of the year, the company makes no money. But shareholders have been a patient lot, and their endurance has paid off. **********Earnings and revenues have grown in each of the last three years, as have profit margins. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994, the company made $2.9 million on sales of $18.1 million. That translates into a 16 percent net margin, twice what the company logged in 1991. **********""It's done better than we expected,"" said John F. Nelson, director of growth equities for the Wisconsin Investment Board, which bought 299,000 shares at an average of $13 each. ""They have a game plan, and they are very successful at executing it."" **********In hindsight, one of the company's smartest moves was breaking away from Ocean Spray, the cooperative that controls 75 percent of the domestic crop. No sooner had the deed been done than Northland won multi-year contracts to supply two of the nation's largest independent bottlers, the Cliffstar Corporation and Clement Pappas & Co. Both pay Northland 15 percent more than what it would have gotten from the cooperative. **********At the same time, Northland continues to benefit from Ocean Spray's $40 million advertising budget, without kicking in a dime to support it. That campaign has helped talk the tart-tasting fruit into everything from muffins to flavored waters and teas. And since cranberries are not easy to brand, the campaign fuels demand for all cranberries, even those grown by the competition. **********Analysts and investors think the stock still has room to grow, especially if earnings expand 63 percent to $1.09 a share in fiscal 1995, as Wall Street anticipates. **********The company thinks it can sell more overseas, exploiting the fact that only a fraction of the 4 billion barrels harvested domestically is exported. Plus, analysts note that $70 million spent in the last six years on land and equipment is paying off. **********That investment should help Northland produce more fruit that is of high enough quality to be bagged and sold in the produce section of the supermarket. Those berries fetch up to $130 a barrel, compared with the $70 a barrel that wholesalers pay for fruit that is only good enough for sauces or juices. **********Last year, Northland's overtaxed bagging system popped too many berries and left only 10 percent fit for bagging. By installing new $700,000 dryers that operate at lower temperatures which are less likely to cook the berries, the company has been able to insure that as much as 20 percent of its harvest is blemish-free and in the bag. **********The company has also wisely devoted some of its capital budget to expansion.  Federal regulations aimed at protecting vanishing wetlands took effect in January. They make it virtually impossible to develop new bogs. **********But by buying existing bogs in Wisconsin and in Massachusetts that were cheaper because they were a few years away from producing fruit, the company increased its potential yield without paying top dollar. **********This year's crop, which just started being harvested last month, is expected to approach 300,000 barrels, six times the 1986 crop, and that does not begin to include 600 acres that are being replanted with higher-yielding vines that take up to six years to mature. ""With 25 to 30 percent of their acreage not fully producing, as they reach maturity, it should translate into higher earnings,"" said B. Laureen Knecht, an analyst for David L. Babson & Company, a Cambridge money management firm that owns 339,000 Northland shares. **********Richard G. Elam, a Kemper Securities Inc. analyst, agrees that the current stock price ""seems reasonable given its growth prospects."" He predicts Northland's stock will reach $25 by next September. **********Though he may be a bit biased, given that his firm is an underwriter of the company, a run-up of that size is not out of the question. The company would have to increase sales by 17 percent, in line with past growth, and achieve net margins of 20 percent to earn enough to warrant a $25 stock price at its current price-earnings multiple. **********The biggest risk facing the company is weather. Nature has many ways of bespoiling the fragile fruit, ranging from hurricanes to marsh molds. **********""There's not a lot you can do about creating more sun,"" concedes John Swendrowski, Northland's president. A former high school football coach turned banker, he formed the company by stitching together several limited partnerships in local marshes that he then took public in 1987. He has kept a quarter of the shares for himself, despite a second public offering in 1992. **********Employees all pitch in at harvest time. Even the company's chief scientist doffs his lab coat for a work shirt. In exchange, Mr. Swendrowski has made sure that many employees, down to the marsh managers who wade thigh-deep into the flooded bogs to collect the loosened berries, get stock options, too. Come to think of it, that's yet another reason to like the stock."

""Our thinking is that we have to build socialism."" **********That the cold war had ended seemed to mean nothing to the hundreds of insurgents who stunned their countrymen Saturday by announcing themselves as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and declaring war on the Government. The struggle they describe is the timeless one of poor Indians against ""the rich,"" the new world they envision being one where things would simply be better. Confusion Replaces Muscle **********Government forces appeared mostly to avoid any offensive against the rebels today after at least 84 people were reported killed in the seizures of the four towns and the fighting that ensued as the rebels retreated from three of them -- Las Margaritas, Ocosingo and San Cristobal de las Casas -- on Sunday. **********The guerrillas' military weakness was obvious today along a 30-mile stretch of rural highway that remained more or less under their control. From quiet conversations with townspeople and villagers, the rebels' sway seemed a product less of any considered support than of confusion and fear. **********Yet the mere sight of scores of Indian men and women, staked out along the road with assault rifles, was a remarkable measure of the despair that has taken root in this land since Spaniards began to conquer the Maya almost five centuries ago. **********""There is no longer any way to survive the situation in Mexico,"" said Jesus, who described himself as the child of poor peasants from another part of Chiapas state, near the border with Guatemala. 'This Is Where We Live' **********""There is no work, no land, no education,"" Jesus said. ""There is no way to change that in elections,"" he added, echoing the proclamations of his superiors without seeming to mimic them. ""This is not going to be a war of two or three years. This could be a war of 25 or 30 years."" **********When a reporter asked the dozen men clustered around Jesus whether they were prepared for such a sacrifice, no one spoke up. Asked whether they wanted to go home, one said, ""This is where we live."" **********Physically beautiful and dismally poor, Chiapas is known for the lush jungle ruins left by the Maya, the Baroque colonial churches left by the Spaniards and the deep inequities that have prevailed since the cultures met. Near Servitude **********Even after the 1910 revolution, the Indians often continued to live in almost feudal servitude to the landowners. The state's riches, from pine forests and tropical farmlands to vast cattle ranches, were controlled by a small clique of European and mixed blood. **********The Indians were controlled politically by village bosses, called caciques, who were fully integrated into the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico for 65 years. **********It has since become a standard photo opportunity for candidates and Presidents of the governing party to appear in the brilliantly colored ponchos that Indians in many villages still wear over their jeans or skirts. **********But even as President after President have declared their deep commitments to the Indians, the social and economic problems have eased only somewhat, and fights over scarce arable land have kept poor peasants and farmers in perpetual conflict, often with the Catholic Church and the Government as their respective proxies. **********Chiapas ranks last among Mexican states in households with electricity (66.9 percent), last in the number of children under 14 who attend school (71.3 percent) and last in the number of people over 14 who can read (69.6 percent). It is fourth from the bottom in the percentage of households with access to sewers (41.2 percent) or running water (58.4 percent). **********The state has also consistently earned one of the country's worst records of human rights abuse, and advocates for the Indians, most notably the outspoken Bishop of San Cristobal, Samuel Ruiz, have accused the Government frequently of torture. Such assertions emerged again last April after hundreds of soldiers swept through Indian villages seeking the killers of two officers, touching off initial rumors of guerrilla activity. **********In an interview in San Cristobal, Bishop Ruiz's spokesman, the Rev. Gonzalo Ituarte, said the poverty and political domination of Indians had eased in recent years. But he argued that the situation had also grown more volatile as a new concentration of the region's wealth grew more apparent. In Rebellion Since 1712 **********""Any Indian who has a tiny little hovel and one change of clothes comes to the city now and sees new cars and beautiful hotels and all of these fine things, and they are not insensitive to that,"" Father Ituarte said. ""The control of the caciques has been reduced. The big landholdings have been reduced. The problem is, these things continue to exist at the door of the 21st century."" **********Periodic rebellions date to 1712, when Tzeltal Indians rose up after being forced to pay taxes to build a church and hospital in San Cristobal. But despite some rumors earlier this year of guerrilla activity in the sparsely populated pine forests around Ocosingo, another of the towns seized by the Zapatista army, the new war seemed unfathomable even for many of the people who found themselves surrounded by the rebels today. **********""Look at this,"" said Francisco Gomez Sanchez, 53, a teacher in the farming town of Oxchuc, sweeping his hand toward a spontaneous gathering of hundreds of townspeople who seemed to have been stranded by the fighting. ""There are no big landholders here, no rich people. How do you explain that they burned down the town hall?"" **********In their proclamation of war, the Zapatista army, named for the peasant hero of the 1910 Revolution, Emiliano Zapata, offered any number of reasons. **********Their struggle, they wrote, was ""for work, land, housing, food, health care, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace."" They also decried environmental degradation and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which they called a ""death sentence"" for Indians handed down by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 'The People Must Rule' **********A 20-year-old rebel leader who gave his nom de guerre as Eliseo said the goals could only be achieved by the fall of Mr. Salinas and his party. ""The people must rule Mexico,"" he said. **********Another guerrilla, in a ski mask, with a semi-automatic rifle and a walkie-talkie, who would identify himself only as a 28-year-old captain, insisted vehemently that the rebels had received no outside support, as some Government officials have suggested, but were fighting ""for socialism like the Cubans have, but better."" **********Some peasants, like Romeo Jimenez, said the act of rebellion was enough to bring their sympathy. **********""We Indians are the conquered ones,"" said Mr. Jimenez, 32, a farmer in San Cristobal. ""The Government always says they will help us, and they never pay attention. We don't know those men,"" he said of the rebels. ""But we understand them.""                    --------------------       U.S. Says Americans Safe **********WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Reuters) -- The United States Ambassador to Mexico has sent five aides to southern Mexico to assess the situation, the State Department said today. **********""We understand that all Americans who have wanted to leave that area have been able to do so recently, and we have had some direct contact with American citizens who indicate that they are safe,"" said the State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry."

The chants echoed attempts by many people here to find meaning in the latest burst of bloodletting in their strife-torn city. **********As they visited bereaved families and paid tribute to the dead, many Palestinians acknowledged that their sense of loss was deepened by the realization that deep wounds had been self-inflicted. For many, the funerals provided a look into the abyss of civil war. **********With a pall of grief hanging over Gaza, many shops were closed and traffic was light. Scattered groups of demonstrators burned tires and barricaded roads as Koran verses commemorating the dead were read over mosque loudspeakers. **********Muslim militants set fire to the Nasser Cinema, burning movie reels and scattering them on sidewalks. But the Palestinian policemen, the object of Friday's rage, were scarcely seen, having been called back to their barracks to prevent further clashes. **********A few hundred supporters of the Islamic movement Hamas marched behind a black banner to the homes of the dead, vowing revenge. **********""Arafat, you are not one of us -- take your dogs and get out!"" they shouted, waving Korans in the air. ""Arafat is a collaborator! Hamas, you are the gun, and we are the bullets!"" **********But no firearms were waved at this protest, apparently a gesture of restraint to avoid further violence. Instead, a Hamas member spray-painted angry slogans on walls. **********""The blood of the martyrs is a mark of shame on Arafat's forehead,"" one slogan said. **********A doctor who had treated victims of the police shootings at Shifa Hospital walked with the marchers. **********""Arafat is a dictator,"" he said bitterly. ""The people don't interest him."" **********On one street corner, men gathered around a policeman, chastising him for the actions of his comrades. **********""Why did you use guns?"" one man asked the officer. ""We are all cousins. Arabs shouldn't shoot Arabs."" **********The policeman said little. **********""We had to do it,"" he blurted. ""God will find a way."" **********Walking down another street, two policemen expressed regret for the violence on Friday. **********""This was inhuman and unpatriotic,"" said one, who refused to be identified. ""Anyone who fires on his brothers is a traitor. If I receive such orders I will not shoot."" **********Like the policeman, relatives of the victims chose to attribute the killings to Palestinian ""collaborators"" and ""spies"" for Israel who they charged had infiltrated the police and the Palestinian Authority. **********""This was not simply a clash between Palestinians,"" said Ali Alayan, whose cousin was killed. ""These were collaborators who attacked the people."" **********Suheil Imawi, whose brother died, blamed ""slaves of the Jews"" for the shootings. **********""When the Palestinian police came to Gaza, I was among the first to greet them,"" he said. ""I applied for a business license from the Palestinian Authority so I could pay taxes, because I felt that this government was ours. Now I won't have anything do to with it, unless it wipes out the traitors."" **********But there were also efforts toward reconciliation as Hamas leaders met through the day with Israeli Arab mediators in an attempt to reach an understanding with the Palestinian Authority. **********Dr. Saud Shawa, a Hamas supporter, said Friday's clashes were so dangerous that a way had be found for coexistence between Gaza's political factions. **********""It's absurd to kill one another while the enemy is watching,"" Dr. Shawa said. ""We have no other option but dialogue between brothers. Otherwise, we Palestinians will be the losers."""

Possibly. In this case, if people had thoroughly checked the investment sponsor and the man who controlled it, they would have turned up some red flags, an examination of public records shows. Prosecutors and financial experts said the case pointed out the importance of investigating a sponsor's background.  Gary W. Lefkowitz, 41, president of Citi-Equity Group of Culver City, Calif., who was indicted on 45 counts relating to fraud, has not entered a plea, but his company said in a statement that he ""is preparing to vigorously defend all charges."" **********After the indictment, investors got a bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee for Citi-Equity to preserve and recover assets. But Mr. Lefkowitz's lawyer said the move could jeopardize a refinancing of 50 properties and cost investors $52 million. **********This investors' nightmare is not related to a flaw in the low-income housing programs for the Federal tax credits, which Citi-Equity's investors thought they were getting. ""The program was simply another vehicle for legitimate investment that someone intent on defrauding others can use,"" said Andrew Luger, the assistant U.S. attorney in Minneapolis -- where the Citi-Equity inquiry began -- who brought the indictment. **********All investments are vulnerable to fraud, Mr. Luger said. But, he added, those offered by individuals or small companies require special caution from investors. ""Many of these products are marketed by smaller companies with less of a track record,"" he said, ""so brokers and investors need to be extra diligent."" **********A similar warning came from Buzz Mroszak, the Internal Revenue Service agent who is examining the more than 80 partnerships that Citi-Equity sponsored. ""When you go into any investment where you rely on whoever you're investing with,"" he said, ""there's nothing I can tell you but look into it a little closer."" **********Mr. Luger recommended getting credit histories for the company sponsoring the investment and its principals, looking for lawsuits and checking with professional associations for disciplinary problems. **********That means reading daunting legal documents like prospectuses and memorandums for private offerings. But the papers provided by the investment company probably are not enough, Mr. Luger said, because ""a lot of them are boilerplate; you have to go beyond that."" **********For example, a memorandum for a partnership that Citi-Equity registered for sale last year included a list of risks, but did not include current audited financial information on Citi-Equity or disclose that Mr. Lefkowitz, a lawyer, had been suspended from practicing law for a year in 1989. ""Certainly any discipline problems by any professional association can be a signal of a more widespread problem,"" Mr. Luger said. **********How could an investor have found out about that suspension? It was disclosed in a filing Citi-Equity was required to make with the New York State Attorney General's office. Because the company's limited partnerships were supposed to be sold only to a limited number of wealthy or sophisticated investors, state officials did not review the offerings, but mandated some special disclosure. **********It pays to check such information thoroughly. While Mr. Lefkowitz's filing said the suspension did not involve ""dishonest conduct or financial wrongdoing,"" the California State Bar Court found in a 1988 decision that Mr. Lefkowitz had breached his fiduciary duties to clients in a case involving real estate and forged documents. The court found that deeds in his custody had been altered, but did not determine who had altered them. **********Mr. Lefkowitz also had a file in the central data base maintained by the National Association of Securities Dealers and the National Association of State Securities Administrators. ""As a general proposition, unless you have reason to know a great deal about someone you are investing with, you are crazy if you don't use this resource,"" said Scott Stapf, a spokesman for the state regulators' association. ""In better than four out of five cases, you can spot someone with a problem background."" **********The so-called CRD report, for central registration depository, shows that in 1985, regulators issued a cease and desist order against Mr. Lefkowitz and Citi-Equity for selling unregulated securities, but the order was vacated in 1987. **********The report also shows that from August 1985 through March 1987, Mr. Lefkowitz was a director of the Investment Brokers of America, a now-defunct brokerage firm. A search of Mead Data Central's Nexis data base showed that by 1988, the firm had a history of regulatory problems, including some related to the sale of limited partnerships, and lost its securities license in several states. **********Searches of data bases, credit reports or visits to California courthouses might also have turned up more information about Mr. Lefkowitz and Citi-Equity. For example, builders and suppliers had sued Citi-Equity, which in some cases lost the titles to the properties it supposedly owned. And some Citi-Equity partnerships have filed for voluntary protection from bankruptcy. **********""Anybody who is selling investments who has spent a lot of time defending lawsuits may not be a good risk,"" Mr. Luger said. ""With a small company and an unusual investment, even if it sounds good, you want to know as much as possible."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/business/market-place-the-two-big-stock-picking-styles-aren-t-very-stylish-this-year.html,Leslie Eaton,1994-07-21,,662,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Market Place; The two big stock-picking styles aren't very stylish this year.,Market Place; The two big stock-picking styles aren't very stylish this year.," **********IN the stock market, style is usually as important as substance -- but not in 1994. **********Style, the way investment professionals use the word, does not refer to hemlines or lapel widths or the chiffon-and-combat-boot look. On Wall Street, style means the way portfolio managers pick stocks and the kind of stocks they stay with. Consultants to pension funds get paid big money to come up with style categories and to put managers into them, a practice that is filtering into the world of mutual funds, as well. **********Theoretically, money managers adopt a single style, which will succeed in some years and fail in others, depending on economic trends and market fads. Similarly, a woman who wears nothing but ankle-length skirts will alternate between high fashion and frumpishness. **********The appeal of investment styles is that when one is out, another is usually in. The nimble investor may be able to move from one style to another as they ebb and flow; the more conservative could cushion losses by owning funds with different approaches. **********But not this year. The two major style categories -- growth and value -- are down, and by almost identical rates. Wilshire Asset Management, which manages money using style-based index funds, reports that among its large-stock indexes, the value style fell 5.06 percent in the first half, while growth fell 5.02 percent. **********Value investing is sometimes summed up as ""buying cheap stocks""; its adherents look for stocks that are trading for relatively little money compared with their assets or earnings. Looking at the 750 largest stocks in the country, Wilshire categorizes as value stocks the 20 percent with the lowest price-to-earnings ratios, lowest price-to-book ratios and highest yields, among other factors. **********If value investors are the bird-in-the-hand boys, growth investors go for two in the bush, looking for companies that will do well in the future. Wilshire's growth index includes companies with rapidly growing sales and earnings, and high returns on equity. **********Over the long haul, these two Wilshire indexes have turned in quite similar results. For the period from 1978 through today, the value index's average annual return has been 15.6 percent, while the growth index's return has been 14.3 percent. **********But in the short run, the two indexes tend to turn in very different results. For example, in 1991, value rose 25.6 percent, but growth zoomed 46.6 percent. An extreme example occurred in 1981, when value gained 10.3 percent while growth lost 10.7 percent. **********These two styles will sometimes move together for a couple of months, often when the overall market is bad. For example, both plunged during the quarter that included the crash of 1987, though growth was hit harder than value. Both, by the way, ended that year in the black. **********But the last time these two indexes were both down for two straight quarters, as they are today, was more than a decade ago. In the first half of 1982, growth did far worse than value, but almost made it up in the fourth quarter, and ended 1982 up 14.5 percent, versus a 15.8 percent gain for value. **********Statistical junkies may take hope from that rebound, and from the fact that since 1978 there has never been a year when both the big value and big growth indexes have ended December in the red. **********Not so with the value and growth indexes that track smaller stocks. Both fell in 1987, and in 1990, a terrible year for small stocks, both indexes plunged more than 19 percent. **********This year, the small-cap value index is actually holding up relatively well, falling just 3.2 percent. But the small-cap growth index has fallen about 11 percent. So there are still reaches of the stock market where having a strong sense of style can do more for investors than just keeping their outfits up to date."

Sponsored by Time magazine and Life magazine, the exhibit contains 69 color and black-and-white photographs taken by photographers from the two magazines and other news outlets. While the exhibit depicts all sides in the war in the former Yugoslavia as victims, the bulk of the pictures show results of atrocities committed by Bosnian Serbs against Muslims and Croats in Bosnia. **********Serbian-American groups, angered by the symbolic linking of the Bosnian Serb activities with those of the Nazis, have protested. Joined by some Jewish groups, they have also objected to the use of the Holocaust Museum for an exhibit depicting Croats as victims, noting the persecution of Jews by the fascist puppet government set up under Nazi control in Croatia. **********""I think that it's a shame that the Holocaust is being used as a forum by partisans in a civil war who do not have clean hands,"" said George Bogdanich, director of SerbNet, a coalition of Serbian-American organizations. ""There are a lot of bad guys on this war on all three sides. But that doesn't mean they should be permitted to use the Holocaust as a political forum to advance their cause."" **********Mr. Bogdanich wrote a letter to museum officials protesting the exhibition and saying that the ""lessons of the Holocaust must not be trivialized or distorted."" **********Roughly two-thirds of the museum's $33 million annual budget is provided by the Federal Government. Of the 65 members of its governing council, 10 are members of Congress. **********Serbian-Americans are already upset with the museum, which opened in 1993, because its permanent exhibition contains almost no depiction of the atrocities visited on the Serbs by the Nazis, their Croatian fascist allies and, in a more limited role, Muslim troops during World War II. While estimates vary, most historians believe 300,000 to 400,000 Serbs were killed in Yugoslavia during the war, along with 60,000 Jews and 27,000 Gypsies. **********Museum officials say the exhibit does not duck the victimization of the Serbs during World War II or the atrocities committed by Croats and others. The first panel a visitor to the exhibition confronts is one explaining the confusing and brutal history of Yugoslavia during the war. **********The panel describes the policy of one group of nationalist Serbs known as Chetniks who wanted to create a ""Greater Serbia"" that would be ""cleansed of all ethnic minorities."" The panel also speaks of the desire of the Croatian fascist leaders for ""cleansing society of foreign elements, the Serbs and the Jews."" Visitors will be given brochures that examine the brutal history of Yugoslavia during the war, including Jasenovac, a death camp operated by the Croatian fascists where at least 70,000 Serbs were put to death. **********""In this exhibition you can see how these longstanding ethnic feuds play themselves out differently during great moments in history,"" said Sara Bloomfield, the museum's associate director for public programs. ""One way today, another 50 years ago."" **********Miles Lerman, chairman of the museum's council, said today that the purpose of the exhibition was not to take sides in the current war in Bosnia, but for the museum to bring the world's attention to the suffering there. **********""Memory tells me that the Croats and the Bosnians were the most willing collaborators of the killing squads of Nazi Germany,"" Mr. Lerman said. ""So it would be logical for me to say, a plague on both your houses. But morality dictates to me that we are 50 years away from the Holocaust and it does not give the Serbs of today the license to kill and maim women and children."

Approving measures to protect their fragile Alpine hills and valleys from pollution in a referendum on Feb. 20, the Swiss not only rebuffed their Government, but also threw the European Union's entire transportation policy into disarray. **********That the Swiss distrust outsiders -- even their European neighbors -- was no secret. Fearing that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels would soon be nibbling away at their sovereignty, they used an earlier referendum in December 1992 to reject a Government plan to link Switzerland to the European Union, then known as the European Community. Ban on Trucks Going Through **********But while European governments thought it quaintly Swiss to opt for isolation in 1992, they were unprepared for the latest decision: to order an outright ban -- to come into effect in 10 years -- on all heavy trucks passing through this country by road on their way between other European countries. **********There were roars of protest this week from neighboring governments, which charged discrimination against non-Swiss vehicles and threatened reprisals against Swiss products. The embarrassed Swiss Government was left mumbling apologies about this country's peculiar form of direct democracy. **********In this postcard-pretty town in the canton of Uri, where the so-called Alp Initiative was born four years ago, the mood was predictably more upbeat, not least because local campaigners were unsure until the votes were counted whether Switzerland as a whole would back the ban on heavy trucks. The Spirit of William Tell **********For a referendum item to be approved, it must win a majority of total votes as well as a majority of votes in at least 14 of the country's 26 cantons. And in this case, with the more populous French-speaking cantons saying no, the initiative was adopted by just 51.9 to 48.1 percent nationally. **********But all of the Alpine cantons -- those divided by the north-south highways and railroads that carry the main load of trade between Germany and Italy -- voted strongly in favor. In Uri, where the rebellious spirit of William Tell is still revered, locals voted 87.5 percent in favor, 12.5 percent against. **********Their response is unsurprising. Since 1980, traffic along the six-lane highway leading to the Gotthard tunnel toward Italy has steadily increased, disrupting the once-idyllic Reuss River valley with noise and harming its forests with pollution. Some 2,500 trucks use the route daily, but according to some estimates the number could rise to 6,000 by the end of the decade. **********In the tiny village of Wassen, which stands over the highway near the entrance to the tunnel, the impact of this traffic is even more dramatic. ""Here it's the noise, the constant roar of the trucks, that most affects us,"" Urs Kunzi-Fuchs, who owns the local Hotel des Alpes, explained. **********Pressure from the valleys in fact prompted the Swiss Government to impose restrictions on heavy trucks -- none heavier than 28 tons and no traffic on Sundays or between 10 P.M. and 5 A.M. -- in an agreement that it reached with the European Community in 1992. Rail Cars to Carry Trucks **********While the Government was eager to transfer road traffic to the railroads, the Alp Initiative has made this law. No new major highways can be built and, starting in 2004, all heavy trucks passing through Switzerland must be put on railroad flatbeds. **********With this tiny country standing at a crossroads of much European trade, Swiss voters have single-handedly forced their neighbors to pay heed to environmental protection. In the process, they have assisted other Europeans who have long argued that railroads are less harmful to the environment than highways. **********The issue is already dominating Austria's negotiations to enter the European Union. And, responding to the Swiss decision, Austria warned that if forced to abandon its own controls on Alpine truck traffic, its voters might eventually decide against joining the union. **********Dominik Furgler, who works in the Swiss Government's Integration Bureau in charge of relations with the European Union, said he was surprised by the ferocity of some of the attacks on the Swiss vote. ""This form of democracy is deeply rooted in our history,"" he said. **********But he conceded that it would complicate Switzerland's future relations with its neighbors. ""We want to negotiate new bilateral agreements on transit, free movement of people, agriculture and so on,"" he said, ""but Brussels says it needs time to analyze the new situation."" **********Mr. Stadler, though, felt no need to apologize. ""Optimistically speaking, all goods will be moved by train within 10 years,"" he said. ""And by then, people may say that the Swiss were the pioneers. We acted because we couldn't stand the truck traffic any more. Others may follow our example."""

The chrome-plated .38-caliber Smith & Wesson is always at his side. **********Does he need protection from international terrorists? No, Mr. Khoja explained, cradling the pistol in one hand. He needs protection from the national police of Thailand, a remarkable assertion that few people in Thailand would dispute. **********""The police here are bigger than the Government itself,"" the 60-year-old diplomat whispered. ""I am a Muslim, and I stay because I feel I am fighting the devils."" **********After four years of digging and prodding, Mr. Khoja is the man largely responsible for unearthing the biggest scandal in the history of the Thai national police, a saga that begins with the theft of more than $20 million worth of jewels from a Saudi prince and ends with a trail of blood in the streets of Bangkok. **********At least 18 police officers have been implicated in the gems case, including two police generals who were dismissed this month. Several killings have been linked to the theft. **********The newest victims are the wife and 14-year-old son of the Government's principal witness, who were found dead last month, bloodied and beaten, in their Mercedes outside Bangkok. The witness, a Bangkok jeweler, is in hiding. **********Mr. Khoja, whose tenacity appears to have finally forced the Thai Government to act, said he was convinced that Thai police commanders were also behind the killing of three Saudi diplomats here in 1990. They were shot, he said, after learning the names of the gem thieves. **********To protest Bangkok's long inaction in the gems case, Saudi Arabia has cut off work permits to more than 250,000 Thai guest workers, depriving the economy here of billions of dollars a year. About 20,000 Thai workers remain in Saudi Arabia. **********Yet whatever the damage to the economy and to Thailand's reputation, Mr. Khoja has become a hero to many Thais who admire his willingness to risk his own safety to expose what is widely understood to be the largest criminal organization in Thailand: the Royal Thai Police. **********The saga of the Saudi gems began in 1989 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in the palace of Prince Faisal, son of King Fahd. The palace employed a Thai house servant, Kriangkrai Taechamong, whose job included cleaning the room where the Prince and his family stored their jewels. **********When the Prince took a vacation abroad, the servant disabled the electronic alarm and stole nearly 200 pounds of gems and jewelry. Mr. Kraingkrai returned to Thailand and was quickly seized by the Thai police, who had been alerted by the Saudis. He was sentenced to five years in prison. **********A box filled with jewels was initially returned to the Saudis. But the Prince and his family soon determined that nearly 80 percent of the jewels had disappeared. Some had been replaced by crude fakes. **********Mr. Khoja -- whose title is charge d'affaires, not ambassador, because Saudi Arabia downgraded relations with Thailand -- was sent here in 1990. A 35-year veteran of the Saudi diplomatic corps, he volunteered for the job. **********""Here is the reason,"" he said, dropping onto his desk a photo of bloodied corpse of Fahd al-Bahli, one of the three diplomats killed in 1990. ""He was one of my students in the diplomatic institute. He had three young sons. They are now orphans."" **********Mr. Khoja said he would remain here until the perpetrators are put behind bars ""or at least until their names and their lives are ruined."""

That gave the party 42 of 183 seats in Parliament. **********Next January, Mr. Haider says, he plans to leapfrog parties entirely and create a Ross Perot-style popular movement called Citizens' Alliance '98, which he hopes will bring him to power by 1998. He promised that when he became chancellor, illegal immigrants would be thrown out, jobless foreigners would be sent home, and the two Austrian parties that have monopolized power for nearly 50 years would be relegated to the opposition. **********""A movement needs a fuhrer,"" said Simon Wiesenthal, the veteran Nazi-hunter and survivor of Hitler's concentration camps, echoing the many Haider critics who see him as a crypto-neo-fascist. **********Mr. Haider, wearing blue jeans and a blazer with a dark blue polka-dot tie during an interview in the parliamentary offices of his Freedom Party, dismissed the accusation. **********""People say that just because I am openly an anti-socialist,"" he laughed. ""The downfall of Communism of course mobilized all the forces that fear their socialist ideals are in danger of disappearing and brand their opponents as fascists, extremists and whatever."" **********The Haider phenomenon is just one of the aftershocks from the collapse of the Berlin wall five years ago, which marked the end of the cold war and undermined Western European political assumptions of the post-World War II era. **********One such assumption was that there was no room for neo-fascism in the political system. That idea was swept away by the collapse of Italy's Christian Democrats amid corruption scandals last winter, when the populist movement led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi came to power with the support of the neo-Fascist National Alliance. **********The National Alliance leader, Gianfranco Fini, 42, wears stylish double-breasted suits instead of jeans, but otherwise bears comparison to Mr. Haider, even if the latter resents it. Mr. Fini is also surging in popularity lately, putting Mr. Berlusconi in the shade in public opinion polls. **********And now he has moved to distance himself from the most avowedly Fascist component of his group, the Italian Social Movement, established by the heirs of Mussolini after the war. Mr. Fini recently announced plans to dissolve the movement and make the National Alliance a broad citizens' group like the one Mr. Haider wants to create in Austria. **********Mr. Fini and Mr. Haider seem to draw on some of the same wellsprings of support. ""Our values today are not those of Fascism,"" the Italian said in an interview last summer. ""People voted for us first of all because all the established parties were corrupt, because they knew we were not an anti-democratic party, and because we stood for values that were not simply materialistic."" **********Mr. Haider put it this way: ""In Italy the political system is collapsing because it is corrupt. In Austria it will be also be the same over the next few years, and a completely new political system will be the result."" **********In other countries as well, the far right has had the most success where frustration with established parties is greatest. In Belgium, the far-right Flemish Bloc surged in popularity in local elections this fall, getting 28 percent of the vote in Antwerp, where Socialist and Catholic parties have dominated city politics since 1921. **********""We say openly what most people think,"" said Filip Dewinter, a Flemish Bloc candidate who ran on a platform of separate schools for Flemish and Islamic children and of shipping jobless immigrants back to their home countries. Among Mr. Haider's campaign slogans in Austria were ""He says what we think"" and ""Vote the way he thinks."" **********Support for the biggest far-right party in Germany, the Republicans, collapsed in the Oct. 16 elections there. The main reason was that the mainstream parties reached consensus a year earlier on constitutional change to stem an influx of foreign asylum-seekers and immigrants that peaked at nearly 500,000 in 1992. Right-wing violence against foreigners and shelters for asylum-seekers has also diminished since then, though it has not stopped. **********Here in Austria, uneasiness about foreigners was only one reason for Mr. Haider's stunning success. **********""The main cause of his success is popular frustration with the political system,"" said Heide Schmidt, a former ally of Mr. Haider who broke with him nearly two years ago over his insistence on a popular referendum on immigration. **********""A few years ago, when I still belonged to the Freedom Party, we wanted to visit a city retirement home here in Vienna, which has been ruled by the Social Democrats since the war,"" she said. **********""The administrators wouldn't let us in -- they said it was a Social Democratic retirement home, and that is symptomatic of the confusion between parties and the Government here,"" Mrs. Schmidt added. ""Haider knows how to expose these things, how to evoke positive feelings about himself while exploiting negative feelings about issues, and if the Social Democrats don't come to their senses pretty soon, it's quite possible he will become Chancellor in 1998."" **********Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democratic Party and Foreign Minister Alois Mock's People's Party, which follows Christian Democratic politics, have shared power in a coalition since 1986. Both lost voters by the hundreds of thousands to Mr. Haider in October. **********Among the supposed abuses of power he promised to end then was the cozy system of highly paid Social Democratic and Christian Democratic functionaries running not only nursing homes but also labor unions, social security agencies, banks, television stations and newspapers, and making party membership the main criterion for jobs. **********""We have been in power for eight years, and we have to work hard to make our accomplishments more highly visible,"" Mr. Vranitzky said in an interview. **********""Haider offers oversimplified solutions to complicated problems,"" the Chancellor said. ""We clearly need better ways of teaching children in schools where there is a high concentration of non-German-speaking students, but there is no sense in doing what he says and sending 20,000 foreigners home to make room for 20,000 Austrians to hold jobs because they don't take jobs away from Austrians."" **********Multiculturalism, Mr. Haider says, is a pernicious leftist doctrine, but he is not against immigrants who seek full integration here. He is just for an immigration law that makes it possible to keep them out. **********Official figures count 600,000 foreigners now in Austria, fewer than 8 percent of the 7.6 million population. More than 10 percent of them are unemployed, compared with 5.5 percent in the whole work force. **********Mr. Haider asserted that many foreign workers legally in Austria see him as a protector, because they, too, feared illegal immigration. **********His opponents unfairly tried to smear him, he said, by suggesting that he sympathized with policies of the Nazis because he once suggested in the heat of debate that they had been successful in fighting unemployment in the 1930's. In the ensuing uproar, he had to resign the governorship of Carinthia. **********Today he says his words were taken out of context, but he does not disavow them. **********""It was just a single sentence,"" he said, ""but without it I probably wouldn't be where I am today."""

Kelly arrived at the station house the other day. The scores of keys, along with ripped-up wallets and pieces of shoes and belts that had littered the dirt in front of the tiny concrete holding cells were piled out of sight behind the roots of a tree. **********Chickens and goats wandered about the carcasses of police cars resting on rusted wheel rims. When a storeroom door was opened it revealed a huge heap of filthy rifles piled haphazardly and such unusual law-enforcement equipment as mortars and a heavy machine-gun mount. **********""You couldn't clean this place,"" the former New York City Police Commissioner muttered as he left the building. **********But in a sense that is exactly what Mr. Kelly is trying to do as he attempts to reform the police force that has itself been a major part of the problem here. How does he expect to do it? **********""With great difficulty, frankly,"" Mr. Kelly said. **********""Haiti does not have a police force in the traditional sense of police,"" Mr. Kelly said. ""The police were part of the army. There is a history of violence and the police have been used as an instrument of repression. The goal is to start from a clean sheet."" **********But, like the American generals here, Mr. Kelly says his job has been made more difficult by former President Jimmy Carter's last-minute deal with the military regime of Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras that staved off an actual invasion but left the army and police structure intact. **********Rather than starting completely fresh, Mr. Kelly must deal with the remnants of a force that had terrorized the population as he heads a group called the International Police Monitors, which is to guide and train the Haitian police. **********Despite the difficulties, Mr. Kelly, a longtime street cop in New York, has at times seemed at home here. His yellow-hatted police monitors have been cheered by crowds as they take away people accused of being gunmen or armed civilian auxiliaries known as attaches (and therefore save them from being beaten). On Friday, Mr. Kelly rushed to a slum where a detail of his men had cornered a man who had fired two shots into a crowd. Today, when word reached his office that a crowd of about 300 slum dwellers in Cite Soleil had surrounded the house of a suspected attache and were threatening to beat the man to death, Mr. Kelly again rushed to the scene. The crowd cheered as he told them, through an interpreter, ""We are here and things are changing."" **********The Haitian police are demoralized by the American presence and fearful of retribution from the people they once bullied. They were further shaken last Monday when a group of policemen were yanked to the ground as they ran into American soldiers raiding an office used by paramilitary gunmen. In front of a cheering crowd, the Haitian policemen were handcuffed and thrown into trucks, some with their mouths taped shut. Their police pickup truck was later smashed up by the crowd; its wreckage stands forlornly in the parking lot of the police headquarters across from the National Palace. **********One of Mr. Kelly's first tasks was to meet for hours with the police commanders -- their chief, Lieut. Col. Michel Francois had just fled over the border to the Dominican Republic -- and try to calm them down and persuade them to continue the task of patrolling. **********But much of the force here and in Cap-Haitien seems to be melting away, Pentagon officials say. Indeed, the policemen are disappearing so fast that the Americans may not be able to rig together the interim police force for the scheduled return of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President in the coming week. American soldiers may have to take up policing duties. **********""The alternatives are that the Americans do it all, or nobody does it,"" Mr. Kelly said. ""Neither is any good. There must be a police force, but you can't police someone else's country. The Haitians have to do it themselves."" **********Plans for the future including repainting the police stations from the hated distinctive mustard-yellow of all military installations in the country to light blue, the issuance of new uniforms and the creation of a police academy. A training program has been started for Haitian refugees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A critical part of the plan is to sort out the policemen who remain, eliminating those who have committed human rights abuses. It is not yet clear how this vetting process will be carried. **********Mr. Kelly heads a group that is expected to have about 800 monitors, wearing distinctive yellow baseball hats, who are to patrol with the Haitian police to provide good examples and dissuade them from beating, torturing and stealing, as has been their common practice. Some of the monitors are reservists with the United States Marines or are former policemen, while others are police officers detailed from Caribbean countries, Argentina and Jordan. They will carry sidearms but are not supposed to perform actual police functions. **********A group from a Justice Department agency called the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, which has given training to Latin American police forces, is also here to revamp the Haitian police. Some time early next year, when a United Nations peacekeeping force takes over from the American troops, United Nations police monitors, including Canadian Mounties, are supposed to have the task of watching the police. **********""A real concern is that it's pay-back time,"" Mr. Kelly said, speaking of the possibility that vengeance would be taken on the police. ""Then the job will be made more difficult. I hope it doesn't happen, but this country has a history of that, too."" **********Mr. Kelly, along with American military officers, is trying to persuade members of the Haitian police that they will have a future in staying on the job. One enticement would be new equipment, including vehicles to replace those that have broken down on Haiti's rutted roads. The police here complain that they have no cars with which to go out on patrol. **********""It's tenuous,"" Mr. Kelly said. ""We hope they become resigned to the fact that any hope for them staying in the police is that they must change. We have to convince them they have a stake in staying on the good side."""

Until recently, they gave workers few investment choices and virtually no guidance.",976,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"Decisions, Decisions on Retirement Plans","Decisions, Decisions on Retirement Plans"," **********Although employees have been roundly criticized for investing too conservatively in their 401(k) retirement plans, employers must shoulder at least half the blame. Until recently, they gave workers few investment choices and virtually no guidance. **********When you look back on it, these plans were slapped together,"" said Brian Ternoey, a principal in the Princeton, N.J., office of Foster Higgins, benefits consultants. ""There wasn't much investment planning involved."" **********But the picture is changing drastically, with choices multiplying and education increasing. A few big companies and some benefits consultants, in fact, are creating some extensive plans that suggest just how diverse the options may be in years to come. **********Pepsico and Chrysler, for example, give their employees complete freedom of choice in their 401(k) plans. Bold investors can put their money in a discount brokerage account and serve as their own money managers. ""Employees can design their own portfolios with common and preferred stocks, bonds and Fidelity mutual funds,"" said Elaine Franklin, a Pepsico spokeswoman, while conceding brokerage use has been limited. **********Other unconventional approaches include mutual fund alliances and private investment funds that are not found in any newspaper listing. For people who already agonize when choosing among a handful of mutual funds in  their retirement plans, such options might be intimidating. But in the growing 401(k) industry, still in its infancy, investment choices are expected to balloon for several years. **********Assets in the plans now amount to $475 billion and will climb to about $1 trillion by 1998, said Robert L. Reynolds, president of the Fidelity Institutional Retirement Services Company. The plans are referred to as self-directed plans, because workers choose what percentage of their salary to put into them tax deferred and then how to invest those funds. **********Although conservative low-yielding investments often appeal to novice investors, they do not provide the long-term returns sought by professional pension managers. Investing in stocks and bonds as well as cash can make the difference between a comfortable retirement and a hand-to-mouth existence in retirement, financial advisers repeatedly warn. **********Riskier and potentially more profitable investment choices began appearing in employer-sponsored plans when corporate finance departments took over some responsibilities from human resources departments. Financial types were more concerned with the spectrum of risk and reward in the plans, and designed new and more complex investments. ""I have one client that has added two international funds, one with a top-down investment approach and the other with a bottom-up value approach to investment,"" said Michael Seidenburg, a principal in the Philadelphia office of  William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm. ""That's a neat choice if you understand it."" **********Also propelling change are government guidelines that took effect at the beginning of the year. The guidelines, while not mandatory, give employers some  protection against liability if they provide financial education and offer at least three core investments and a range of investment options. **********To provide companies with greater choice, benefits consultants have created mutual fund alliances, which combine the funds of six or eight different fund companies. If employers sign up for these programs, employees can choose from any of the funds. **********Hewitt Associates has enlisted 66 companies for its alliance, which offers funds from 10 families along with guaranteed investment contracts (an insurance  industry investment with fixed returns) and low-cost stock index funds, which replicate the performance of various stock market indexes. **********Other employers are moving away from mutual funds toward privately managed funds in search of the lower fees offered to institutional customers. ""Mutual funds have brand recognition,"" but their fees range from 1 to 2 percent of assets, said Mr. Seidenburg of Mercer. By comparison, he has put together private funds for companies at an annual cost of as little as 6 basis points, or 0.06 of 1 percent, of assets. **********For one client, Mr. Seidenburg set up a plan with six options and three ""premixed"" portfolios. Employees who choose a portfolio get their plans automatically rebalanced once a year, or returned to their original asset allocation. In other words, if the portfolio is set up with 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds and stocks grow to 60 percent of the portfolio, some money  is moved from stocks to bonds. **********Financial advisers suggest that employees view their 401(k) plans as part of  their entire investment portfolios. ""You should be looking at a 401(k) within a  broader context and taking into account your other assets as well,"" said Jim Gately, senior vice president at the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa. That means you should consider your overall asset allocation and decide what assets are best placed within your 401(k) plan and which -- if any -- outside. **********Perhaps you want a simple allocation: half stocks, half bonds. If you have $50,000 in a 401(k) and $50,000 in an outside portfolio that is in bonds and cash, you might want to put all of your 401(k) money in stocks. **********Unfortunately, not all 401(k) investment choices are good ones. ""I've seen plans where every single fund was below average,"" said Jonathan Pond, president  of Financial Planning Information Inc., a Boston financial planning and publishing concern. **********Armed with information from your employer about the investments, you may want to shift how you have allocated assets in your private accounts and your 401(k)  accounts. If your 401(k) plan provides an international fund with a top-notch record, but no small-company fund, then the solution may be to put a significant portion in the international fund and buy a small-stock fund outside."

""Our entire system is on trial here. How much was paid, how people got their power."" Intrigue, Fast Cars, Suicide **********The trial of a 45-year-old money manager named Sergio Cusani has wandered into its fourth month, the proceedings revealing a maze of scheming, graft and corruption that has enveloped many of the country's best and the brightest over the last decade. **********The case chronicles the fall of the golden generation that rode a wave of prosperity to designer suits, fast cars and corporate jets in the 1980's. **********Mr. Cusani, the sole defendant in the scandal's first trial, faces charges in the financial collapse of the Ferruzzi industrial group, Italy's second-largest private company. Former Premiers Testified **********The roll call of star witnesses has included former prime ministers like the Socialist Bettino Craxi and Arnaldo Forlani, a Christian Democrat. But the trial will not include two of Italy's most dynamic corporate leaders over the last decade: the former Ferruzzi chief executive Raul Gardini and Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of the Government-owned ENI energy group.  They committed suicide within days of each other last summer as details of the widespread corruption became more widely known. **********A verdict might come this month, after the trial's last scheduled session on Feb. 25, less than two months before national elections that are viewed as the most crucial since voting in 1948 prevented the Communists from leading a government. **********As it turns out, a front-runner in the March 27-28 general election is the Democratic Party of the Left, the Communists' successor organization. Its leaders have come under attack by several witnesses. The Look of a Classroom **********On a recent Wednesday, Chief Judge Giuseppe Tarantola joined two other judges under a 25-foot-square Art Deco mural of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Paradise and called to order the defendant and lawyers who sat cramped on long benches that gave the chamber the look of a classroom. **********The lawyers put aside their newspapers -- the headlines were about an Italian crooner's daughter missing in New Orleans -- and slumped into their chairs. Mr. Cusani wore a dark blue suit and orange-rimmed glasses that made him indistinguishable from his lawyers. He is charged with falsifying corporate balance sheets and violating the laws on the financing of political parties. **********The judge called to the stand Giuseppe Garofano, who was chief executive of Ferruzzi's Montedison chemical subsidiary until corruption charges ended his career. At issue was a receipt for a $10 million payment to Rome politicians for favors. Mr. Garofano, a tall, nattily dressed man, denied any guilt. **********""I did not give operative instructions,"" he said. **********That prompted Antonio Di Pietro, the anti-racket investigator who is also the trial prosecutor, to say: ""Oh, I get it. You just told your people, 'If someone asks you for the money, then you pay it.' "" Angry Wife Started It All **********Italy's wave of scandals involving top names in business, politicians and the mob began unfolding in 1992 after a Milan City official named Mario Chiesa, who pocketed bribes from businessmen in exchange for favors, was denounced by his disaffected wife. **********But it was the collapse of Ferruzzi last year that led to the arrest of Mr. Cusani, a close associate of Mr. Gardini, and uncovered what may prove to be the greatest of Italy's scandals, the Government buyout in 1990 of the Enimont chemical corporation. **********The charges involve a November 1990 battle between Ferruzzi's Montedison chemicals subsidiary and the ENI, the state-run energy company, for control of Enimont, their joint venture. **********Mr. Di Pietro and his team of investigators have focused on how ENI and its chairman, Mr. Cagliari, together with ENI's owners at the Italian treasury, staved off a hostile takeover bid for Enimont by Mr. Gardini. To this end, they evidently prevailed on state-run banks to refuse to underwrite Mr. Gardini's bid, then worked out a deal whereby ENI paid an inflated sum to get Mr. Gardini and Montedison out of the Enimont venture. In turn. Mr. Gardini and his associates, including Mr. Cusani, channeled the equivalent of about $94 million in kickbacks to the major political parties. **********'High Technology' Corruption **********Scrutiny of Ferruzzi's books disclosed immense unaccounted-for sums that led to the charges against Mr. Cusani. Fresh arrests and further disclosures revealed a tangled network of confidential bank accounts in Switzerland, at the Vatican and at offshore banking havens like the Caymans. Leaks to the Italian press and the jailing of prominent figures like Mr. Garofano, the former chief executive at Ferruzzi, helped bring out details about just how hundreds of millions of dollars flowed clandestinely from Italian businessmen to the politicians. **********Trying to explain the wide net of corruption in the 1980's, a senior diplomat from an allied country said: ""Two things happened. First, the art of corruption moved from the stage of simple craftsmanship to that of high technology. Next, it became personalized, no longer enriching just the parties, but individuals."" 4,000 Under Investigation **********Now more than 4,000 people, including 130 members of the old Parliament, are under investigation. Within the next two months, the corruption cases of two former Prime Ministers, Mr. Craxi and Giovanni Goria, a former Christian Democratic government leader, will go to trial. In the wake of bad publicity, Mr. Craxi's Socialists have been virtually wiped from the political landscape in pre-election voter surveys, while the Christian Democrats recently renamed themselves the Italian Popular Party. **********The arguments used by Mr. Cusani's defense lawyer, Giuliano Spazzali, are essentially that the numbers are inflated, that no such large sums were ever paid and that a closer look at Ferruzzi's books will show that they all add up. Moreover, he says, since everybody appears to have been doing it, why make a scapegoat of Mr. Cusani. Follow the Money **********Much of the efforts of Mr. Di Pietro's team of investigators have focused on tracking down the money through foreign bank accounts and front companies used to launder it. The investigators' frustrations are often illustrated by the cross-examination. **********After hearing Mr. Garofano, the judge called Carlo Sama, a former Ferruzzi executive and the husband of Alessandra Ferruzzi, the daughter of the company's founding patriarch, Serafino Ferruzzi. Mr. Sama was questioned about an account he established in 1990 called the San Serafino Foundation, for his late father-in-law, with a deposit of $1.1 million at the Vatican bank, as he now said, ""for the purpose of absolute confidentiality."" **********In earlier testimony, another Ferruzzi employee named Luigi Bisignani who helped set up the account said that with Mr. Sama's complicity, the account was used to launder about $55 million in Italian treasury notes. Apologizing for contradicting an old friend, Mr. Sama denied all this, and when Mr. Bisignani was led in for a face-to-face meeting, he backtracked, exonerating Mr. Sama. Prosecutor Explodes **********""Somebody here is lying,"" Mr. Di Pietro shouted, punching the air with a fist. **********Many Italians follow the trial because they identify with Mr. Di Pietro, said Laura Gaiani, a 20-year-old law student who watched the session. **********""The phrases, the comments, the questions,"" she said, ""are those most ordinary people would use."" **********Approving of the proceeding's atmosphere, she added: ""In this way, all Italians can see how lavishly they went at it. When ordinary people hear these numbers, these millions and billions, then people who have had to work all their lives to support themselves, they can only roll their eyes."" **********Still, Mr. Di Pietro has been accused of turning a blind eye toward the Communists, who have been little implicated in the scandals until now, and the annual human rights report of the United States State Department recently criticized his use of the preventive imprisonment to coax confessions from from suspects. **********While the 43-year-old magistrate has been approached by several political parties to run on their ticket, without success, perhaps the best measure of his popularity came recently from Naples, where carvers of traditional Christmas figurines produced a Good Shepherd in the likeness of Mr. Di Pietro. The figurines became the sales hit of the season."

Currie negotiates the eroded hills, halts at a clearing of weathered sandstone and picks up what appear to be several stones. In fact, they are the fossilized bone fragments of a dinosaur. **********Dr. Currie thinks the shards -- brittle, lightly striated, too small to be of any scientific value -- probably came from the vertebrae of a duck-billed, plant-eating hadrosaurus. **********He would know, if anyone. **********Dr. Currie is head of paleontology at the Royal Tyrrell Museum here, the only dinosaur museum in the world not in a city or university, but in the heart of dinosaur country. **********Drumheller is a town of 6,500 in the Alberta badlands, where glacial ice and meltwater carved deep trenches into the prairie around 10,000 years ago. **********The town lies about 100 miles northeast of Calgary. Five miles away at Kneehill Creek, a tributary of the Red Deer River, Joseph B. Tyrrell in 1884 came upon the skull of a fearsome, flesh-eating dinosaur later dubbed Albertosaurus. **********That was one of the big discoveries of its day and touched off the region's first dinosaur rush as American and Canadian museums competed for fossils, which were carted off in boxcar loads to museums in New York, Chicago, Toronto and Ottawa. **********Decades later, the government of Alberta began displaying its own dinosaurs, which culminated in 1985 with the opening of this museum showing 35 complete dinosaur skeletons against the conjectured background of their habitat more than 65 million years ago. **********Now a new dinosaur rush has been generated by the popularity of the film ""Jurassic Park."" Dr. Currie has seen it four times. Some see the youthful, outdoors-loving Canadian paleontologist as the model for Dr. Alan Grant, the hero of the book and movie who was interested not just in collecting and cataloguing bones but extrapolating dinosaur development and social behavior. **********""I can empathize with that character very easily,"" said Dr. Currie, whose researches have shown that dinosaurs, far from being pea-brained plodders, functioned in social groups, nurtured their offspring and shared some of the characteristics of modern birds. Some may even have been warm-blooded. **********Dr. Currie is also grateful to the movie for what it's done for his museum. A half million visitors have stepped inside the last two years, 40 percent more than the pre-""Jurassic Park"" days of 1992. **********People are constantly phoning and writing him letters with questions about dinosaurs. During an interview in his office, one woman called to inquire about dome-headed dinosaurs. She had read that their skulls contained sulfur and that when those animals hit their heads they would produce sparks and have smoke coming out of their nostrils. **********He told her he had no such knowledge. **********The 45-year-old Ontario-born scientist still talks about dinosaurs with the same excitement he felt as a kid opening a cereal box to find a plastic dinosaur inside. A short time later he read Roy Chapman Andrews's book, ""All About Dinosaurs."" **********""They are all the superlatives -- the biggest, the longest, the fiercest, the wildest things out of your imagination,"" Dr. Currie said. ""The difference is they were real. They were something you could go to a museum and see the bones of. And they made you think of the age of the earth, how could animals get that big, how would they interact with each other. I never got past the big, spectacular end of it. I just never grew up, I guess."" **********The mystery of dinosaurs also attracted him, not just what caused them to die out, but the vast number of species that must be still awaiting discovery somewhere in the Alberta Badlands, South America or the Gobi, the stony desert region of north central Asia. **********Dr. Currie said there are 8,000 known species of birds, 6,000 lizards and 4,000 mammals. Yet despite their 150 million years on earth, only 500 species of dinosaurs have been unearthed. **********What happened at the end, he said, may have been a meteorite. But dinosaurs had gotten bigger, reproduced less often and were less adaptable. ""So if there was a major catastrophe like a meterorite, it probably just killed them off,"" he said. **********Dr. Currie is the co-leader of the Canada-China Dinosaur Project, the largest dinosaur exploration ever undertaken. Chief interest is in the Gobi, where dinosaurs already have been found that are first cousins to those in Alberta. **********""Basically, the Gobi is 90 percent desert, and of that 90 percent, 50 percent is rock, and maybe 10 percent of that 50 percent is dinosaur-bearing rock. The Gobi is wide open."" **********So close is he to dinosaurs that sometimes he jumps into a time warp with them. At a site in British Columbia, footprints ran across the ripple-marked mudstone and disappeared into the water. **********""Once,"" he said, ""I was walking along there and was looking at these footprints, and the sun was just right, just a perfect level. You couldn't tell it was rock any more. It looked like mud. It looked like a beach, and my hairs just kind of stood on the back of my neck."""

He is one of two known survivors from the Salavador Allende, a cargo ship with a crew of 31 that sank Friday 750 miles from shore in a raging gale. **********The other surviving sailor was picked up by a nearby tanker. The bodies of seven dead seamen have been recovered; the other 22 are missing. The violent weather and the distance from shore made rescue efforts extremely difficult. **********Mr. Taranov was spotted bobbing in a vast sea of 25-foot waves and pulled from the ocean by a New York Air National Guard helicopter. A strong current had carried him nearly 75 miles from the site where the Salvador Allende went down. **********The helicopter flew down near the surface of the water and hovered while Tech. Sgt.

The water was reported to be nearly 65 degrees because the ship went down in the Gulf Stream. **********""His chief complaint was that his eyes were burning from the salt water,"" said Sergeant Dougherty. But Mr. Taranov worried about his lost shipmates, the sergeant recalled: ""He said, in kind of broken English, 'I had two or three friends with me; I don't know where they are.' "" **********Mr. Taranov, a 36-year-old father of two, called his wife, Larysa, in Herson, Ukraine, this morning to tell her that he is all right. **********Wet snow and rain prevented the helicopters from flying out of here this morning, and the planes have not seen any more survivors. **********The Salvador Allende was listing at a 45-degree angle when the first of many planes involved in the rescue effort, a Canadian C-130 Hercules, reached it at 3 A.M. Friday. The first distress calles were received at 9:30 P.M. Thursday. Guided by faint, static-filled radio calls of ""Mayday,"" the plane's crew, adided by night goggles, spotted two life rafts. **********The plane dropped survival kits to the clusters of sailors hanging on to broken crates and other debris. **********At dawn, the plane's crew saw a long wooden life boat and dropped another survival kit.

At an Independence Day military parade on Friday in Mexico City, the head of the federal forces, Gen. Antonio Riviello Bazan, said nothing about increasing tension in the Chiapas war zone. **********""After the elections of Aug. 21 you saw that the response of the citizenry was totally normal, tranquil and that is what we expect will continue in the coming months,"" General Riviello said. **********But in a written statement dated Sept. 15 from the mountain retreat of the Zapatistas, the rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos said that the federal army had doubled in size and that it had renewed night flights over the area in an attempt at intimidation. **********Marcos also accused the army troops stationed in several cities in rebel territory of patrolling far beyond the positions agreed to in a January cease-fire, ""and advancing toward Zapatista territory with the purpose of provoking our troops, intimidating the population and forcing a rupture of the cease-fire."" **********""If the war is started again this time it won't stop,"" Marcos warned.

So far he has received no response from the Zapatistas. But today he denied there was any Government plan to seek a military solution to the conflict. **********A hint of what the Zapatistas would ask for as a condition for returning to the negotiating table came this week when Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, who was president of a Zapatista convention in August, addressed about 15,000 people gathered at the National Autonomous University of Mexico for Indepedence Day ceremonies. **********Mrs. Ibarra de Piedra repeated the estimate of 50,000 federal troops stationed in Chiapas and, saying she was conveying a message from Marcos, demanded that they be removed before the talks could resume. She also said the Zapatistas wanted the leftist candidate for governor of Chiapas, Amado Avendano, to be recognized as the winner and to be allowed to take office on Dec. 8. **********This is not the first time rebel leaders have accused the Mexican Army of preparing for an assault to end the armed movement that began on Jan. 1.

""I regretfully have concluded there is no prospect of a cease-fire being agreed upon in the coming days,"" he said. **********Diplomats said there was no willingness to send another big peacekeeping force, like the one that had been sent to Somalia, to try to impose peace on Rwanda's warring tribes -- a task that the Secretary General said would require several thousand additional troops. **********Most of the existing force is being withdrawn for its own safety because the United Nations troops had originally been sent to oversee a peace agreement and not to become involved in a new civil war, these diplomats said. **********But the 270 peacekeepers being left behind in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, will try to insure the safety of the roughly 20,000 Rwandans who have taken refuge with the United Nations.  Human rights organizations and aid workers fear the refugees may be killed after the troops pull out. **********On Wednesday, the commander of the United Nations force in Rwanda sent several hundred nonessential soldiers, mainly troops from Ghana and Bangladesh, out of the country for their safety. The move followed a decision by Belgium to evacuate the battalion it had contributed to the peacekeeping force after 10 of its soldiers were tortured and killed. **********African and other third world members of the Security Council had favored greatly strengthening the Rwandan force instead and giving it a new mandate to put down violence and help with relief work. But it remained unclear whether any country would have risked sending more soldiers to Rwanda now. **********As the Council was deciding to reduce the peacekeeping force, tribal killings continued in Rwanda, with the Red Cross reporting tens or even hundreds of thousands of people killed in fighting that has now spread all over the country. Peace Talks Are Planned **********The President of Tanzania, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, said leaders of the Hutu-dominated Government and the Tutsi-controlled opposition would hold peace talks Saturday in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. **********But it was unclear whether these talks have any realistic chance of producing a settlement. **********The present United Nations peacekeeping force is charged with patrolling a demilitarized zone in the north of the country, separating the Government forces from those of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front and helping to protect the coalition government that the two sidesare trying to form in Kigali. **********But the United Nations has no mandate to go to war against the fighting bands who have reduced Kigali and much of the country to chaos. Moreover, after Belgium withdrew its battalion -- the only one trained and equipped to NATO standards -- the remaining forces from Ghana and Bangladesh were not considered up to the dangerous and sensitive mission of enforcing a return to law and order. **********Human rights organizations fear that if the United Nations pulls out, tens of thousands of Rwandans living under its protection in the capital and at bases around the countryside will be slaughtered, adding to the already horrendous death toll. U.N. Protection Sought **********An estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Rwandans, many of them from the Tutsi tribe, have sought protection at United Nations installations or at other areas under United Nations guard. ""The United Nations has a moral and legal obligation to maintain at a minimum the force that is in Rwanda, at least until those under its protection have been moved to safety,"" said Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch, based in New York. **********""The symbolic force the Security Council may be about to authorize would be a thin veil over another massacre,"" Mr. Roth added. **********According to BBC reports from Kigali today, some 5,000 Rwandans under United Nations guard in the Amahoro soccer stadium in the capital are threatening to commit mass suicide if the troops protecting them are withdrawn. **********The killing in Rwanda started after the country's President, Juvenal Habyarimana, and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed on April 6 when a plane they were on crashed at Kigali airport under suspicious circumstances. The elite Hutu presidential guard went on a rampage, killing Tutsis and Hutu rivals and prompting a new offensive by the forces of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front, whose troops have now invaded the capital. **********In a cable received here today, the United Nations mediator in Kigali, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh of Cameroon, reported that the Amahoro stadium was shelled again Wednesday, killing 11 refugees and wounding 40. **********He reported that Kigali is increasingly short of food, drinking water and medical supplies and said that, with the streets littered with hundreds of dead bodies, the risk of epidemics is growing."

""The rules of the market will dictate whether and how much we change."" **********Gordon Wu, who controls Hopewell Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong, recently said he put a brake on his activities in China when Beijing, worried about rising inflation and electricity costs, began talking of offering only a 12 percent rate of return, which he said no banker would look at. **********Electricity generation in Asia has traditionally been the preserve of the state. But government funding constraints and surging demand as the region industrializes have prompted many Asian countries to turn to the private sector, both local and foreign. **********A recent report by the World Bank estimated that Asia would spend $277 billion on electric-power expansion in the next five years and that China and India would account for 75 percent of the total. Indonesia is expected to be the third biggest source of new power plants. **********[On Wednesday, officials here said that British Gas PLC would lead a consortium to build a $350 million gas-powered plant in West Java along with Bakrie & Brothers PT of Indonesia, a diversified company with interests in telecomunications and plantations. **********[Industry sources said the agreement probably would be signed in November after British Gas and Bakrie signed a gas purchasing agreement with Indonesia's state-run oil company, Pertamina.] **********So far this year, India has approved seven private power projects. They include one by Enron Corp. of the United States to build a 2,000 megawatt plant near Bombay at a cost of $3 billion. **********A further 35 foreign-investment proposals for power generation, valued at more than $21 billion, are awaiting approval by Indian authorities. **********A. Arismunandar, director-general of Indonesia's Mines and Energy Department, said Indonesian authorities now could bargain with independent producers who want to sell power to PLN, the Indonesian state electricity utility. **********In doing so, Jakarta will reduce the rate of return to investors below the current 22 percent, compared with the 16 percent offered to private companies in India and the 15 percent maximum in China. **********An Indian official, who requested anonimity, said India's benchmark rate of 16 percent was more generous than it seemed because it was conditional on the plant being operational for 68.5 percent of the time. **********An efficient plant would be in service for more than 80 percent of the time and thus earn a higher rate of return, he said. **********China is resisting pressure from investors to improve its terms of private power production, which are considered among the least rewarding in Asia. **********But despite such complaints, Beijing says that foreign interest in its power projects remains strong. **********""Currently, there are still more than 10 joint-venture proposals in my office,"" said Chen Tong Hai, vice minister of China's State Planning Commission. **********Power-company executives and bankers said the tightening of terms outlined by Mr. Arismunandar was unlikely to dampen enthusiasm by the private sector for investment in Indonesian power generation. **********The head of a large Indonesian group of companies said his power unit had teamed up with British and American firms to negotiate agreements for two major projects under which PLN would buy electricity for the national grid."

""Marauders -- people who wreaked havoc in the country and the subcontinent. Assassins. Killers. A ruthless army which had absolutely no legitimacy, hated and vilified by our people."" **********With such a brutal resume, it may seem among the most miraculous of South Africa's many reversals that these enforcers of white rule have become heroes of the transition in a matter of months. **********In this twilight of white rule, blacks line the streets and cheer when troops arrive to pacify their embattled communities. **********The End Conscription Campaign, which for 10 years urged young whites to defy their draft orders rather than serve an evil system, now encourages them to honor the call because, said Chris de Villiers, chairman of the campaign, ""it is now really a call-up in defense of democracy."" **********The defense force publishes full-page newspaper collages of tanks and jets, with a slogan addressed to a generic black South African: ""Mr. Dube, these belong to you!"" **********In this scarcely imagined new world, Mr. Nyanda, who rose to become chief of staff of the guerrilla force, is now co-chairman of a joint committee overseeing the military. **********A few weeks ago he escorted his commander-in-chief, Nelson Mandela, to the mirrored-glass citadel in Pretoria where the white generals submitted their plans for his blessing. **********Afterward both sides spread the word that they were reassured. **********""I've come to believe that in spite of their past, these are soldiers and professional people,"" Mr. Nyanda said. Asked about speculation that an African National Congress government would retain the current white military chief of staff, General Georg L. Meiring, Mr. Nyanda smiles up from his breakfast tea: ""Nothing is impossible."" **********The congress and the military say the transformation is genuine, and the only alchemy here is realism. The military's loyalties, they say, have followed their paychecks and pensions. The government-in-waiting has accepted that it has little chance of running the nation without the army. **********The South African Defense Force is the biggest and best-armed military on the continent: 65,000 full-time soldiers, 250,000 reservists, and a budget of $2.8 billion. **********With the end of the whites-only draft last August, the military relies mainly on its volunteer force, which is nearly 80 percent black in the ranks and overwhelmingly white in the officer corps. **********The reserves are also white. They consist of a Citizen Force that is still subject to call-ups -- several thousand have been mustered to help quell violence in the Zulu homeland -- and a vast rural auxiliary, the Commandos, that the congress regards with special suspicion. Internal Security Duties **********The defense force has fought wars against leftist black liberation movements in Angola and Namibia, but much of its labor has been directed within its own borders. Defense force armor joined the police in suppressing township unrest. Military intelligence waged a covert campaign to undermine the congress. **********As recently as last October, the military raided a suspected hideout of Pan Africanist Congress ""terrorists"" in the Transkei homeland, killing five teen-agers who did not return a shot. The youngest victim, age 12, had 23 bullet wounds in his body, according to an autopsy. **********Still, Mr. Mandela had to trust someone to stabilize the country through elections and then help satisfy constituents' clamor for law and order. He had few choices. **********The South African Police are undergoing reforms, but in black townships they are still reviled -- especially the mainly white, notoriously brutal riot police. **********The police have been ridiculed by foreign specialists for incompetence and they have been badly tainted by scandal, including the recent charges that top police officials armed and aided Zulu nationalists in a murderous campaign against the African National Congress. After that scandal broke, the police reacted not by cleaning house but by closing ranks. New Force Is Formed **********A new joint peacekeeping force has just completed training; it is an amalgamation of soldiers from the army, the guerrillas, and the black homelands. But with only 3,000 soldiers, it is basically a symbolic force. **********That leaves the army, which got its first test as an instrument of democracy in February when, at Mr. Mandela's urging, 1,800 soldiers moved in to replace the riot police in two battle-scarred black townships east of Johannesburg, Katlehong and Tokoza. Township residents hailed the move as a resounding success. **********Since then soldiers have been sent into five troubled black homelands, most recently to KwaZulu, the Zulu homeland, where 3,000 troops are enforcing a state of emergency intended to subdue opposition to the elections. **********""We've got more South African troops deployed in the country at this stage than we had deployed in Angola and Namibia at any stage during the war there,"" said Maj. Gen. Gert Opperman, the military communications chief. New enlistees, he said, spend more time studying policing tactics than conventional warfare. **********Skeptics question how far the rehabilitation of the defense force is to be trusted. **********In a January briefing for President F. W. de Klerk and his Cabinet, the generals in charge of the defense force warned that the military's loyalty could be severely strained if, for example, the army was called on to put down white separatist violence. Concern Over Reservists **********General Opperman, who was present, said the concern was focused on the part-time Commandos rather than the career officers. **********""They live all over the country,"" the general said of the Commandos. ""They are part of the community. They can even take part in local party politics. Obviously they are influenced more by local crises, and many of them feel more excited about what's going on."" **********Yet sending black troops to put down a white uprising, he said, could also be dangerous: ""What starts as a political difference could escalate into a racial conflict."" **********General Opperman said the anxiety about the white reservists has abated since the retired chief of the defense force, Gen. Constand Viljoen, entered the elections as a right-wing candidate a month ago. That, he said, gave white separatists a nonviolent outlet for their fears. **********Mr. Nyanda, however, said the African National Congress is still suspicious of the Commandos and wants tighter controls. ""Those people were created specifically to guard against so-called terrorists,"" he said. ""That means us. At the moment the loyalty of the Commandos to the process of change is very suspect."" **********As for the career officers, he said, ""They have come to accept that it is possible to serve the A.N.C. government, to revert back to what a soldier should be, to defend a constitution."" **********One source of friction that lies ahead is the integration of some 16,000 former guerrillas, plus four black homeland armies, into the defense force. Few Nonwhite Officers **********Mr. Mandela has promised to protect the careers of loyal white officers, but he is also under pressure from supporters to promote blacks quickly. The defense force has only white generals and only one mixed-race brigadier, who is currently suspended on charges of embezzlement. **********General Opperman and Mr. Nyanda said the two sides have agreed that black officers from Spear of the Nation or the homelands' military forces will not automatically get their same rank in the remodeled defense force. They will be retrained and tested. But no one expects the integration to be painless. **********Another danger, critics say, is that the new army could become just as partisan as the old one, only now beholden to a new party, the African National Congress. **********Zulu nationalists of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which is boycotting the elections, contend they are unfairly targeted by the military in the townships and in the Zulu homeland. **********Right-wing whites, once the most ardent militarists, have also soured on the defense force. Mr. de Villiers, of the End Conscription Campaign, said right-wingers are now the most frequent callers to the organization's hot line that offers advice in avoiding military service."

Socialism's Noble Aims"," **********WITH Russia and China lurching toward capitalism, one hears a good deal these days about the triumph of the free market over the planned economy. **********Before we wallow in too much pride, though, we should reflect on the sole motivation behind capitalism: to make money. Government does place legal limits on this activity, and religion tries to curb the most avaricious instincts. But, within those puny constraints, anything goes. ""Greed is good,"" says the cliche from the 1987 film ""Wall Street."" **********What does this mean, in real life? Two episodes of recent years are revealing. *********** Shortly after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Chicago wheat futures took a sharp jump in anticipation that the Soviet Union, with its Ukrainian breadbasket irradiated, would have to buy more American wheat. *********** The day after Magic Johnson, the basketball star, disclosed in 1991 that he had contracted the HIV virus, a New Jersey condom manufacturer had a big jump in its stock price. **********Now, probably no person sat down and cynically planned to profit from the misery of Ukrainians or the sexual appetites of Americans. Nor were the human dimensions of these tragic events lost. Still, even capitalism's biggest champions must admit the bad taste left by the indifferent sweep of Adam Smith's hand in cases like these. **********Of course, there is plenty wrong with planned economies, both in theory and practice. Millions of people who until recently labored in these systems will attest to that. But socialism stacks up nicely against capitalism in one, very important regard: It goes beyond greed. **********Socialism calls for teamwork, concern for one's fellow citizens, cooperation. It calls for sharing and pulling together. It calls for people to see themselves as part of the whole. Its guiding principles are something more than Social Darwinism. **********In other words, socialism has noble aspirations. It reaches for the stars. It may be that faulty economic theory, or the usual human failings, have kept it from working. But it can claim a valiant effort. **********Not so capitalism. **********If I sound moralistic, let me confess that I have a stockbroker whom I expect to make money for me, under pain of being replaced. While my sensibilities are those of a European-style social democrat, I feel I have no choice in this capitalist society but to play by the rules. **********And no one who plays by the rules can escape some guilt. Wall Street, the temple of world capitalism, is like the house that Jack built; if you follow the trail of inquiry far enough, you will find that everything, every company and every product is connected, from the grocery stores to the newspapers to the wheat to the condoms. So I and others make do, morally. I, for example, avoid investing in the most nefarious enterprises, like gun manufacturers. **********That is a defensible position, and certainly more than many people do. But, unlike the aspirations of the late planned economies, it's not noble. **********This is a thought happy capitalists should consider as they exult in their global victory."

There were no signs of central bank intervention in the currency markets yesterday, traders said, though many expect the banks to return if the dollar resumes its slide. **********""People are nervous about the central banks coming back,"" said Earl Johnson, a foreign-exchange adviser at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. ""Their attack was very effective."" **********In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6668 German marks, up 1.5 pfennigs from 1.6531 marks on Wednesday. It rose as high as 1.6712 marks in London trading. **********The dollar also jumped to 102.90 Japanese yen from 101.88 yen. Propping Up the Dollar **********""Central bankers accomplished what they set out to do,"" said Kevin Lawrie, a foreign-exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. ""The dollar is higher, at least for now."" **********The Fed and its allies propped up the dollar as it tumbled toward a post-World War II low against the yen and a six-month low against the mark. The dollar fell in the first four months of the year as American stock and bond prices tumbled and traders lost confidence in the currency. **********Speculation that the Clinton Administration wanted a strong yen to balance trade with Japan also weighed on the dollar. It tumbled last year after American officials said a strong yen would curb Japan's trade surplus by making its exports more expensive. But traders said the Fed's aggressive action on Wednesday indicated that the Administration might have stopped talking up the yen. **********""There has been a significant change in U.S. policy on the dollar,"" said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. ""The dollar's weakness against the yen was seeping into other exchange rates and other markets."" Jobs Report Awaited **********Other traders said they were reluctant to sell the dollar before today's report on employment in April, which could be stronger than expected. **********In surveys, economists said the economy probably added 170,000 to 190,000 jobs in April, down from 456,000 in March. A larger number could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates to control the inflation that often accompanies an economic recovery, traders said. Higher rates usually make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. **********The Fed pushed up short-term interest rates three times this year. Many traders dumped dollars after the increases failed to drive the currency higher. **********""The dollar's problems aren't over,"" said Mr. Johnson at Harris Trust. ""People want to see the employment number before they do anything with it."" **********In New York, the British pound slipped to $1.4992 from $1.5021. And the Canadian dollar rose to 72.39 United States cents from 72.07 cents."

The other magistrates seeking transfers were Piercamillo Davigo, Francesco Greco and Gherardo Colombo. **********Their move drew an immediate and scathing response from Mr. Berlusconi's aides. Giuliano Ferrara, the Government spokesman, said a public institution such as the magistrature did not need ""heroes"" or ""charismatic figures."" **********And the leader of the Northern League, Umberto Bossi -- himself facing trial because of Mr. Di Pietro's investigation into illegal financing of political parties -- declared: ""If they want to go, let them. They can't put pressure on politicians."" **********Mr. Berlusconi, whose brother Paolo is facing trial on corruption charges after preventive detention in March, offered no immediate comment on what is bound to be interpreted as a further step to consolidate power by molding public institutions. **********Since taking office, Mr. Berlusconi's Government has forced changes among high-ranking personnel at the state broadcasting and intelligence services and is embroiled in a public row over appointments at the Central Bank, a supposedly independent body. Governing Style Criticized **********Sergio Romano, a columnist, said, ""Berlusconi and his ministers seem to be convinced that to govern, they need to enter the control room, open the strongboxes, control the microphones and the television cameras, put someone they trust at the mint, substitute the 'servants' of the old with 'servants' of the new."" **********""Employment, the public debt, health care and reform of the pension system can wait,"" Mr. Romano said. ""What counts is apparently to take over the three great powers of the prince: to speak to the people, to persuade them, to know what your adversaries are thinking and to print money."" He was referring to the prince of Machiavelli's book on political power. **********The Government's efforts to influence appointments at the state broadcasting authority have been particularly striking because Mr. Berlusconi, a media tycoon who entered politics only in January, has refused to give up his ownership of one of Italy's biggest commerical television networks. **********Not only that, Mr. Berlusconi built up his huge television, publishing, advertising and real estate empire at a time when his friend Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist Prime Minister, wielded great influence. Mr. Craxi is a leading suspect in many corruption cases and is now in self-exile in Tunisia to avoid arrest. **********Mr. Berlusconi himself has never been directly implicated in any corruption case, although senior executives of his Fininvest business empire have come under investigation. Jailings Drew Criticism **********The practice of jailing corruption suspects has been central to the magistrates' ability to crack open the Tangentopoli affair. But it was criticized not only by its victims but also by the United States State Department's 1993 global review of human rights. **********The magistrates argued that many suspects, if allowed to remain free, would have tampered with evidence or suborned witnesses. But many businessmen who underwent preventive detention said later that their incarceration seemed intended only to squeeze confessions from them, and some of them acknowledged to reporters that they had bought their freedom by identifying other suspects. **********The latest decree permits only the preventive detention of organized crime or terrorism suspects -- or of suspects who would flee the country if not detained. But its promulgation plays into the peculiarly Italian phenomenon of political cover. **********While the Italian magistrature is supposedly independent, Mr. Berlusconi and others have attacked some of its members as being left-wing.  During the years of the ""Clean Hands"" inquiries starting in February 1992, it was generally assumed that the magistrates were able pursue their investigations because the former political elite no longer had the power to block them. Amnesty Bid Failed **********The latest decree follows an earlier, failed attempt by the Berlusconi administration to order an amnesty for corruption offenders, and is bound to be interpreted by the Government's critics as a signal that ""political cover"" for the inquiries has been taken away. **********""There could be no more striking sample of the decisions by which the ancien regime rejuvenated itself,"" the opposition La Repubblica newspaper said today, referring to Mr. Berlusconi's actions. ""Things are happening as before, or even worse than before."" **********Massimo D'Alema, leader of the formerly Communist Democratic Party of the Left, urged Mr. Berlusconi to withdraw the decree. ""If he does that, he can avoid a tug-of-war not with the opposition but with the civil conscience of the nation,"" he said. **********The Democratic Party of the Left and some small centrist groups have a majority in the Senate, the upper house of Parliament, but it is not clear whether they will muster sufficient support to block the decree when it comes up for ratification."

A quarterly dividend is not posted. A trade is not executed. Mistakes like these can crop up in an investment account at any time. **********""There are so many things that can go wrong,"" said Bill Levine, chairman of Investors Arbitration Services of Woodland Hills, Calif. Often, the errors are caused by a computer glitch or a human failing, not by someone trying to take advantage of a client. **********Keeping that in mind, an investor should respond rapidly with a request for a correction. But to be successful, she has to have detailed records to support her allegations. **********Eric Kobren, president of the Mutual Fund Investors Association of Wellesley, Mass., recommends keeping a personal log of all conversations and transactions. The log, he said, should include details about an order, the name of the person at the brokerage firm or the fund company who took the order, the time and date of the conversation or transaction, and any reference number. **********When he ran into an account problem a few years ago, these details proved invaluable, Mr. Kobren said. With such information, he was able to show that a sale of $10,000 of mutual fund shares had not been executed on the date requested -- a correction worth several hundred dollars. **********Many companies make recordings of the phone conversations with their customers but may not be able to pinpoint one without specifics. **********""Remembering the date and time of a trade is an important factor in tracking down what might have happened,"" said Tom Taggart, a spokesman for Charles Schwab & Company, who insisted that Schwab's mistakes were few, but like other firms did not provide numbers. **********Mr. Levine advises investors to match the information on their personal logs with confirmation slips, which should arrive within 48 hours of a trade. If a slip is filed away without a look, an investor may not discover a mistake for a month or two. **********Then it becomes more difficult to prove an error, especially if it falls into the gray area of alleged miscommunication, said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. ""They will want to know why didn't you speak up sooner,"" he said. **********Mr. Levine said any phone complaint to a broker should be followed immediately by a letter. Some brokers have a habit of procrastinating, he said, especially if a time lapse could work in their favor.

Ferguson, had resigned. The carrier also reported lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. **********The announcements underscored that the nation's fifth-largest airline had not yet stabilized itself after emerging last year from its second tour through bankruptcy. **********Mr. Ferguson, who had been chief executive since 1991, was Continental's 10th leader in 12 years. Gordon Bethune, who joined Continental as president in February, will take over the day-to-day operations of the airline. **********Mr. Ferguson will become a principal in Air Partners, the investment firm that is run by the airline's chairman, David Bonderman, who helped bring Continental out of bankruptcy last year. Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Bonderman have been friends and associates for many years. **********Industry executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Ferguson had left after Continental's board decided that he lacked the operations background and interpersonal skills to lead the airline successfully. Mr. Ferguson, whose background is mainly in finance, said he wanted to pursue other career interests. **********""I believe I have now accomplished the goals I set for the airline when I was named C.E.O. at the time of the bankruptcy,"" Mr. Ferguson said yesterday. **********Mr. Ferguson will remain a Continental director and a consultant to the company. **********The financial results announced yesterday also reflected Continental's difficulties in trying to turn a profit from its fledgling Continental Lite division, a closely watched experiment within the industry to mimic the success of Southwest Airlines with a low-cost, no-frills operation. **********Continental said that it earned $30.6 million, or $1.03 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $12.4 million, or 53 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. But without a special gain of $23.4 million this quarter because fewer frequent-flier miles were redeemed than the company had expected, Continental's earnings were $7 million, or 22 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting 48 cents a share. **********Industry analysts said they were dismayed to learn that Continental had fallen short of its prediction earlier this year that Continental Lite would break even in July and August. Continental executives did not disclose yesterday how much money the operation lost in the third quarter, but they indicated that many other parts of its business were profitable. **********Continental has run into several problems in creating the new service. While adding many new flights at some airports, for example, it did not set aside an inventory of spare parts at those airports to quickly fix problems and avoid further delays. Continental has also consistently had among the highest customer complaint rates in the industry. **********""This raises the serious question of how long it will take for Continental Lite to become profitable and competitive,"" said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for Salomon Brothers. **********Daniel P. Garton, Continental's chief financial officer, said Continental Lite would be profitable ""soon."" He did not elaborate."

United States law already allows joint investigations with foreign governments of criminal and securities cases. **********Ms. Reno, in an appearance with two senior Congressional Democrats who support such legislation, said the cartels were virtually immune to United States prosecution because incriminating documents were in foreign countries, beyond American subpoenas. **********But the bill's prospects in Congress this year are murky because only a few more weeks remain in the legislative session. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees, through which the bill must pass before reaching the floor, are busy with the President's crime bill and may not have time to handle another ambitious measure. **********Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, who heads the House Judiciary Committee, and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, joined Ms. Reno in announcing the legislation. They said they would formally introduce the bill later this week or early next week. **********But Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the ranking Republican on Mr. Metzenbaum's panel, said that while he supported the bill's goal of bringing international range to the nation's antitrust laws, he wanted safeguards in the measure before he would support it. The bill should not allow foreign governments to use joint investigations with the Justice Department to obtain national security information, or to obtain American commercial information and pass it to companies in their home countries, Mr. Thurmond said. Safeguards to Be Added **********Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant Attorney General for antitrust policy, said the final version of the bill would include such safeguards. The United States and other nations would have full discretion in deciding what, if any, information they shared, she said. **********Even if the legislation is approved this year, it is likely to take two years to negotiate a series of agreements with foreign governments that would allow each country's law enforcement officials to serve a subpoena in another country, Ms. Bingaman said. Because each nation's officials would have the option of refusing to serve the subpoenas, most requests for foreign assistance would likely come as part of joint investigations. **********Speaking at the same news conference as Ms. Reno, Ms. Bingaman said there were at least 10 and possibly 20 cartels that the Justice Department could barely investigate now and where the proposed law would help. **********She declined to identify the cartels by country or product, but said the Justice Department had been frustrated in efforts to root out collusion in the international uranium industry because documents were in Scotland, Australia and elsewhere. **********Even without the legislation, Ms. Bingaman added, the department would file an international antitrust case within a month involving ""a major consumer product."" **********James F. Rill, Assistant Attorney General for antitrust policy under President George Bush, said Ms. Bingaman's estimate of up to 20 cartels was plausible. The illegal business alliances are probably as common in Europe as Japan, he added. **********Last month the Justice Department settled its first antitrust case in more than a decade involving allegations that a company used monopolistic practices to restrict United States exports. Pilkington P.L.C., a British glassmaker, agreed on May 25 to begin allowing all American licensees of its technology to set up factories abroad. Only one of the licensees had previously had the right to open overseas factories, and it only had that right in certain foreign markets. **********The Pilkington case was unusual because a private arbitration proceeding had brought all the crucial documents to the United States before the Justice Department stepped in. In most cases involving international businesses that appear to be colluding, the documents are in foreign countries, Ms. Bingaman said. **********In cases like Pilkington, which involve foreign restrictions on United States exports, the Justice Department believes that it has jurisdiction when the foreign company has an American subsidiary, said Diane P. Wood, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for antitrust policy. Many big international companies do business here and have American subsidiaries. **********For cases involving conspiracies to raise the price of American imports, the Justice Department can pursue a foreign company if it ships large quantities of goods to the United States, regardless of whether the company has an American subsidiary, Ms. Wood said."

And producers and executives said the end of Mr. Gordon's highly publicized venture served as a lesson in the fragile nature of Hollywood deal making and Japanese involvement in it. **********Separately, Mr. Gordon and Universal Pictures announced that the producer would set up an independent film company at the studio. ""I'm disappointed to be leaving some wonderful people and very happy to be getting back closer to the movie-making process,"" said Mr. Gordon, 57, a bearded, gruff Mississippian and Hollywood veteran. **********The collapse of Mr. Gordon's arrangement with JVC again raises the question of the Japanese commitment to Hollywood investments. Mr. Gordon's deal, announced in August 1989, was the most visible example at the time of Japan's growing involvement in the movie business. The following month, the Sony Corporation bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $3.4 billion. And a year later, MCA Inc., which owns Universal, was sold to the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company for $6.6 billion. Whether those investments have been fruitful is unclear because the studios involved have had some successes as well as big failures. **********When JVC agreed to back Mr. Gordon, the arrangement seemed relatively simple: The company would finance the production and marketing of the movies that Mr. Gordon would develop. Mr. Gordon was well known, well liked and successful. **********Although he had his share of flops, like any producer, his taste and credits ran to the highly commercial, including ""Die Hard,"" ""Die Hard 2,"" ""Predator,"" ""48 Hours"" and ""Hooper."" He was also the president and chief operating officer of 20th Century Fox Studios from 1984 to 1986. **********But with his Japanese investment, Mr. Gordon produced some films that missed the mark. Movies like ""Judgment Night,"" which grossed only $12 million, and ""Used People,"" which grossed $17 million, were flops. So was a film called ""The Super,"" and ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" On the upside, the action films ""Point Break"" and ""Unlawful Entry"" proved successful. **********Two films are to be released over the next few months. They are ""The Getaway,"" a remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw chase film, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and a Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure, ""Timecop."" **********A number of factors seemed to sour Mr. Gordon's relationship with the Japanese company, according to several executives. Too many of his early films were disappointing, leaving the Japanese company chilly about Hollywood. Mr. Gordon producing's skills often leaned toward big-budget, big-action movies that could, if successful, turn into highly profitable sequels like ""Die Hard."" **********Over the last year he devoted most of his energies to two action films, ""Waterworld,"" an adventure set to star Kevin Costner, and ""Die Hard 3,"" starring Bruce Willis. Each film cost upward of $50 million. The Japanese company rejected both films, which are now planned elsewhere. **********Mr. Gordon declined to discuss his problems in detail, except to say: ""You have to catch a franchise film. That was our goal. To be in business long enough you have to hit singles until you hit a home run."""

Add a play corner with toys for children while mother spends and a brightly lighted seminar room for beauty consultations and customers could be forgiven for thinking they were in an affluent Western city. **********The exceedingly modest incomes of most East European women have not stopped the big international cosmetic companies from hunting for new markets in the consumer-deprived region. The opening of the Estee Lauder store recently completed a triumvirate for the company: Budapest in 1989, Warsaw in 1993, now Prague. Guerlain and Christian Dior have glamorous stores in the three capitals and Elizabeth Arden has a spiffy boutique here. **********Nobody is making any money in what would seem, at first blush, a somewhat frivolous exercise in glamorous image making. The handful of women from the new monied class -- wives of former Communist politicians, some women with businesses of their own -- do not make enough of a customer base for profits. **********But the companies say they see big potential. The strategy is to get in fast with modest initial investments. The conversion of the dingy building off Wenceslaus Square here into an exterior confection of pink and white cost the Lauder company just $1 million. **********""If you wait until there are enough people to support a big business, they'll be enough competition and the market will be carved up so it will be 10 times more costly,"" said Leonard A. Lauder, president of the Lauder company and son of its founder. **********""What is the prognosis of Coca-Cola on what it will cost to catch up to Pepsi after all those years of Pepsi in the former Soviet Union?"" he continued. ""We're prepared for several years of no profits because we know as the economy strengthens we'll be well positioned."" **********The Lauder family, no stranger to Eastern Europe, originally came from Satoraljaujhely, in northeast Hungary, though Estee Lauder herself was born in New York City. Her younger son, Ronald S. Lauder, has bought into television stations in Poland and the Czech Republic. **********Guerlain, an early pioneer in the region with a much wider network that includes shops in provincial cities like Gdansk and Cracow in Poland, holds a similar philosophy. ""The fact is, it is investment for the future,"" said Antoine de Fommervault, Guerlain's manager for Eastern Europe. **********It's easy to forget after 40 years of Communism that women in Poland and Hungary and to a lesser extent the Czech Republic are no strangers to beauty products and skin care. Between the two world wars, women in these countries took great pride in preserving their skin. Two of the world's most successful beauty entrepreneurs come from the region: Estee Lauder and Helena Rubenstein, who was born in Cracow, Poland. **********In part, the cosmetic companies are hoping to tap into this tradition. When Guerlain opened its store in the opera building in Warsaw, the company ran nostalgic ads in the newspapers inviting women to bring in their old Guerlain bottles in exchange for an up-to-date product. ""We had a lot of old people with no monetary means come in,"" Mr. de Fommervault said. ""It just showed how passionate women are about the product."" **********The cosmetic companies have something else they can play off. A jar of cream, say Lauder's Advanced Night Repair priced at $59 -- the best seller on opening day in Prague -- or a lipstick at about $15 is a more realistic purchase than any of the other available Western luxury goods like cars and jewelry. Women's salaries in the Czech Republic are low but gradually increasing. The Czech statistical office reported that Czech women earned an average monthly salary last year of 3,349 crowns, or $124. This year, their average salary rose to 3,540 crowns, or $131. **********In Budapest, where an entrepreneurial class has been expanding, there appears to be a group of women with robust incomes, said the Lauder store manager, Laszlo Varadi. **********""Statistics are risky, but we estimate there are about 8,000 women earning over $3,000 a month net, probably from banking, insurance,"" he said. ""That's our key target."" **********The customers on the first day at Lauder's shop in Prague earned good incomes by the country's standards. **********""I was amazed, we had five dentists, various professional women,"" said Jana Brichnacova, 22, a former real estate agent who was chosen among hundreds of applicants as one of the five beauty advisers for the store. ""These are women who have been going to Christian Dior and read Cosmopolitan and Elle."" **********To make the store more accessible and the prices less forbidding, the front counter was loaded with come-ons -- miniature fragrances for $3.60 (100 crowns), a makeup purse with three samples for $5.35 (150 crowns), a mirror for $1.80 (50 crowns). **********All the companies have had to devise ways of marketing in countries where there are not many outlets for advertising and where ads are often treated with skepticism. **********Early on, Christian Dior found that direct mailing was a no-no. **********""We would ask clients for their addresses and they would be very reluctant. In the past if you gave your address to anyone it could be very dangerous,"" said Elizabeth Robert, the manager for Christian Dior in Eastern Europe. On a recent mailing in Budapest to a select list of 250 clients who had patronized the treatment salon at the store, 25 of the letters came back with wrong addresses, she said. **********Special offers, one of the basic selling techniques for cosmetics in the West, don't work either. ""We tried special offers when we first opened in Warsaw in 1991 and no one would buy,"" Ms. Robert said. ""They think there is something wrong with the product."" **********One of the most successful methods of selling is through the salons that Lauder, Dior and Guerlain run alongside their stores. In Budapest, for example, Mr. Varadi estimates that 50 percent of his store's sales of creams and cosmetics come from women who have facials, for about $40, at the salon. After a facial, he said, some of these customers spend up to $500 on skin products. **********Another selling point comes from the style of the sales clerks, who are carefully chosen and well trained to give service that contrasts with the almost universal surliness that persists in most stores even five years after the end of Communism. None of the sales clerks cum beauty advisers at Lauder's in Prague had previous store or beauty experience. ""I suppose they didn't want people spoiled with bad manners,"" Ms. Brichnacova said. **********Mr. Lauder hopes the Prague store will reach sales of $500,000 to $1 million in the first year. The Budapest store does about $1 million worth of business five years after it opened. **********But these are still early days for small investments, he said. ""One shop in one country is not like trying to conquer Brazil,"" he said. ""We're not even in Brazil. It would cost us $20 to $30 million."""

Analysts also speculated that Unitrin might solicit a higher offer from another bidder or offer its own alternatives to enhance shareholder value. **********""My view is that Unitrin is entrenched, they're digging in, they've got this highly dilutive poison pill,"" Paul S. Goulekas, an analyst with Conning & Company, said. ""This is going to be long and drawn out."" Disappointment Is Expressed **********American General executives expressed disappointment with the poison pill provision. **********""This is a clear attempt to entrench management"" at Unitrin, an American General spokesman said. ""Our objective is to sit down and discuss with Unitrin's management and board our offer, and what we get in return is a poison pill. It appears to us that Unitrin's management and board are not doing what is in the best interest of its shareholders."" **********American General, one of the nation's largest insurers, disclosed on Tuesday that it made a takeover offer on July 12 to Unitrin. Unitrin's board unanimously rejected the offer last month, saying that the company, which is based in Chicago, wanted to remain independent. **********Unitrin is already being sued by a shareholder about the spurned takeover bid. The suit, filed today in Chancery Court in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, by Moise Katz, an individual shareholder, sought class-action status and contended that Unitrin directors had improperly rejected the bid, which at the time represented a 30 percent premium over Unitrin's stock price. Unitrin Set to Fight Suit **********Unitrin said in a statement that it would ""vigorously"" defend the suit, which charged breach of fiduciary responsibility, and considered it ""meritless."" **********Unitrin shares fell $2 today to close at $46.75 in Nasdaq trading. They had jumped 23 percent on Wednesday in reaction to the offer and after Unitrin said it would raise its quarterly dividend to 40 cents from 35 cents. American General shares rose 12.5 cents today to close at $28.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Unitrin's shareholder rights plan would be triggered if any investor acquired more than 15 percent of Unitrin's outstanding shares without the board's approval. The provision would allow Unitrin to issue stock to current shareholders by issuing a preferred stock purchase right for each share of stock outstanding as of the close of business on Aug. 17. **********The board set an exercise price of $125, which would let all shareholders, except the acquirer not approved by the board, buy common shares having twice the value of the exercise price of the rights. That would, in essence, dilute the acquirer's position. **********""Whether the courts would uphold the poison-pill provisions is yet another wild card to consider,"" Mr. Goulekas said. **********To stave off a possible proxy fight for board representation, Unitrin also said today that it had amended its bylaws to require advance notice of a shareholder's intention to nominate board members or submit proposals at annual shareholders meetings. It was unclear how much advance notice would be needed. **********As of March 31, Unitrin's directors and executives owned 23 percent of the company's outstanding shares, which analysts said would be a significant voting block in a proxy vote. **********American General now holds 347,000 shares of Unitrin stock. A spokesman said the company had been talking to Unitrin's institutional shareholders and described them as ""enthusiastic"" about the offer. **********But Mr. Goulekas said he thought that Unitrin was probably worth at least $55 to $60 a share. He also said he expected American General to sweeten its bid by offering a stock swap in addition to cash, which would lower taxes on the deal, and possibly raising the offer to $53 to $55 a share. **********American General had said that it based its offer on publicly available information and would consider raising its bid if it found additional value after looking at Unitrin's books and structuring the deal transaction in other ways, including a tax-free exchange of stock. **********Unitrin, which analysts described as overcapitalized by more than $1 billion, also might try to distribute some assets to shareholders as another line of defense against a takeover bid, analysts said."

Data Compression at Issue **********The jury found that a feature included in MS-DOS versions 6.0 and 6.2 infringed Stac's patents for data compression, a technology that raises the storage capacity of personal computers' disk drives. The jury awarded Stac $120 million in damages. **********That finding made Stac the first company to prevail in a major judgment against Microsoft. Other companies that have entered into negotiations with Microsoft, including the Go Corporation, which is now part of AT&T, have contended that once Microsoft gains access to proprietary technology, it appropriates it. But Stac had patent protection. **********In many infringement cases, the guilty party agrees to pay a licensing fee or royalty to the patent holder to compensate for the products already in use. Microsoft has refused to negotiate any such settlement with Stac and is appealing the Feb. 23 verdict. **********Microsoft said today that it would seek an immediate review of Thursday's ruling by Federal District Judge Edward Rafeedie in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal District in Washington.  Stacker Offered in 1990 **********Stac has been selling its compression software under the brand name Stacker since 1990. Microsoft later began to offer the data compression feature, which it calls Doublespace, in MS-DOS 6.0. **********Judge Rafeedie ordered Microsoft to recall all unsold packaged copies of versions 6.0 and 6.2 of MS-DOS from distributors and dealers -- and, in a potentially more disruptive move to the industry, blocked the sale of any personal computers into which the software had already been loaded. **********Effective today, dealers must erase the infringing software and load the latest version of MS-DOS, 6.21, which deletes the infringing feature. Microsoft has just begun shipping Version 6.22, which contains what Microsoft says is a different data compression technology. **********But even if the injunction remains in place, ""we're very confident the logistics of this won't be difficult,"" said Brad Chase, general manager of Microsoft's personal operating systems division, pledging ""to make sure the impact is minimal."" **********Stac said it believed the only personal computer manufacturers not affected by the ruling would be those that have licensed its Stacker technology, including the International Business Machines Corporation and the Compaq Computer Corporation, the two largest personal computer manufacturers, with nearly 40 percent of the market between them. **********Among the companies affected are Hewlett-Packard, Dell Computer, AST Research, Packard Bell and Gateway 2000. Apple Computer Inc. is not affected, except for a few recent machines that use both MS-DOS and the Macintosh operating system. Jury Verdict in February **********""We had a jury verdict on Feb. 23, and Microsoft should have stopped shipping product that infringed our patents, but they didn't,"" said Gary Clow, Stac's chairman and chief executive. ""We recently did a survey and found that 80 percent of the computers currently in the distribution channel still contain our technology."" **********Mr. Chase of Microsoft responded, ""There certainly is some product out there; how much I'm not sure, and I'm sure Stac has no idea."" **********William Gates 3d, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive and a vigorous critic of the jury finding, was not available for comment today because his mother, Mary Gates, died this morning. **********Shares of Microsoft, which has annual revenues of more than $4 billion, showed no impact from the ruling, closing today at $52.56, up 31 cents, in Nasdaq trading. Analysts said that the recall would not be too costly. ""If you presume it would cost $10 million to pull all the product from the shelves, that is about 1 cent a share to Microsoft, and that is just not material,"" said Rick Sherlund, of Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Shares of Stac, which had just $37 million in revenues last year and only 150 employees, rose 11 percent, or 62.5 cents, to $5.25 in Nasdaq trading. **********Patent lawyers said an injunction requiring the recall of infringing product from distributors and dealers was not unprecedented, but that this ruling was unusually strong. **********An intellectual property case, this dispute is unrelated to the Justice Department's continuing investigation of whether Microsoft has engaged in unfair business practices. **********Although some kind of injunction had been expected ever since the jury verdict, the sweep of the ruling surprised retailers. Several said they believed they still had computers with the infringing software in inventory, and they continued selling them today in the belief that Microsoft would prevail in court. Retailers Unhappy **********""I'm surprised that a court would require a recall and affect third parties when damages would be sufficient to compensate for product shipped in the past,"" said Kenneth Waters, president of Micro Age Inc., a computer retailer based in Tempe, Ariz. ""Microsoft doesn't even have the capacity to enforce this. If they were unsuccessful in getting a stay, we would have to look at what legal rights we have, then we'd have to deal with Microsoft on how they work with us or compensate us,"" he said. **********Indeed, enforcing the injunction will be difficult, and some patent lawyers said distributors and computer manufacturers could ignore it with impunity provided they were outside the Southern California jurisdiction of Judge Rafeedie's court. ""If the computer companies want to say no, I'm not sure anything can be done,"" said Robert Barr, a lawyer with Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco. ""This court does not have jurisdiction over Dell or Gateway."" **********But Wayne Barksy, a lawyer with Irell & Manella in Los Angeles who represented Stac in the case, said: ""After the verdict, I.B.M. and Compaq both signed up, relieving them from the headache this injunction could create."" Other companies ""should keep in mind that by going after the biggest fish in the industry and succeeding, Stac has indicated its willingness to pursue those who infringe its patents,"" he said."

The board accepted the bid late Thursday night. **********The bidding process is by no means over, as other bids may yet be submitted for consideration by Federal Bankruptcy Judge Robert G. Mooreman. Other interested investors have included a group led by Michael Steinhardt, the New York money manager, who unsuccessfully lobbied America West's board on Thursday for acceptance of its offer of roughly $200 million for 49 percent of the Phoenix-based airline. The unsecured creditors committee said yesterday that it backed the Steinhardt plan. **********The leading bid from the investment group, AmWest Partners, is significant because of the potential it holds to link the route networks of America West and Continental. AmWest Partners has said it has no plans to merge Continental and America West, but it said that the two airlines would become marketing partners and coordinate their schedules and frequent-flier programs. **********The interest in America West also underscores a renewed confidence in formerly troubled airlines. Despite the recent financial difficulties of Continental and Northwest Airlines, for example, many industry analysts consider these and other low-cost airlines to be formidable competitors to bigger carriers like United and Delta. **********Continental emerged from a second tour of bankruptcy courts last year with a $440 million bid by an investment group that included Mr. Bonderman and Air Canada. Cash and Debt Involved **********The $220 million bid for America West comprises $120 million in cash and $100 million in new long-term unsecured debt. ""Under this proposal, America West will emerge from bankruptcy with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash reserves,"" Bill Franke, America West's chairman, said. **********Industry analysts have said the proposed ties between Continental and America West make strategic sense because of their complementary route networks. America West offers many flights throughout the Southwest, where Continental has little presence. Both airlines also have low operating costs and relatively flexible work rules. **********Mr. Bonderman's bid calls for Amwest Partners to get 37.5 percent of the reorganized company's stock, unsecured creditors to receive 45 percent, and an unidentified secured creditor to get 7.5 percent in return for concessions. Current America West shareholders would receive the remaining 10 percent unless that portion is required to satisfy unsecured creditors' claims in full. Before the bankruptcy filing employees owned 15 percent of the stock. **********Yesterday, in response to the board's backing of the AmWest bid, America West's stock jumped 62.5 cents, to $2.875, in Nasdaq trading."

He is to drop his highwayman's kerchief, reassume his real name and at age 43 start a new life driving his own taxi. **********We fought hard, but we didn't really achieve anything,"" said Flaco, who would not give his real name. He went underground 10 years ago after playing shortstop in an amateur baseball league and working as an import agent for a trading company in Turbaco, near Colombia's Caribbean coast. **********All around him on a rolling 10-acre farm here, guerrillas from the Popular Liberation Army worked in the blazing heat to raise tents, build showers and string electric wire for an army-protected demobilization camp for 150 rebels leaving the armed struggle. **********Colombia is relying on a three-pronged strategy to make headway against its guerrilla armies: military intelligence, counterinsurgency units and a generous  program to smooth the guerrillas' return to civilian life. **********""We thought we could do here what Fidel Castro did in Cuba, but it didn't work,"" Andres Perez, a disillusioned rebel, said of his passage through three of Colombia's rural Marxist guerrilla groups. **********Colombia has started to open its closed and authoritarian political system. Mayors and state governors, once picked by the President, are now elected. Some  seats in Congress are now reserved for blacks, Indians and former guerrillas. **********The Government's benefit package, refined over five years with the surrender  of seven groups, has become so standard that negotiators needed only six days to reach a deal here with a group that started armed actions in 1967. **********The accord, worked out over plates of chicken and rice at a whitewashed farmhouse, gives each guerrilla a $4,000 small-business loan, a $200 a month living allowance for one year, a clean legal bill of health and educational assistance. **********""Colombia has a tragic history of not attending these groups in an integral way,"" Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda said in an interview in Bogota. **********Here at the camp, the Government's peace negotiator, Carlos Jaramillo Castillo, brushed off conservative criticism of the program. ""All that the Government has invested in demobilization in the last eight years adds up to 3 percent of what the violence has cost the country, in terms of kidnapping, extortion and murder,"" he said. **********In the last three months, 1,200 guerrillas from three groups have negotiated  surrenders. **********""We can't cross our arms and wait for the magic formula,"" Mr. Jaramillo said, responding to criticism that the Government should try to negotiate a broad accord with Colombia's two remaining guerrilla armies. ""When I took this job last September, people said the administration is almost over, there is nothing  you can do. Since then, 1,500 guerrillas have come in."" **********President-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano has vowed to maintain the same strategy when he is inaugurated in August. The effect of the strategy can be seen in the  recent collapse of the People's Liberation Army, long Colombia's third largest guerrilla group. **********Last year the Government began a highly publicized campaign to pay rewards for information leading to the capture of guerrilla leaders. **********On June 22, after a tip, an army unit captured Francisco Caraballo, the Liberation Army's leader. Mr. Caraballo is to be charged with ordering the kidnapping and killing of a Spanish priest last year and the killing of any guerrilla who surrendered, resulting in more than 100 deaths. **********With Mr. Caraballo behind bars, more guerrilla units are expected to come down from the mountains. **********""Eight years ago a desertion from the guerrillas was something rare,"" Mr. Jaramillo said. ""Now it happens almost daily."" **********In another strategy, the army increasingly hunts guerrilla bands with professional counterinsurgency units rather than draftees and paramilitary death squads. **********""In the last year, the Government has been tough on us -- the army killed about 20 of our men,"" said Mr. Perez, 32, a former ranch hand. **********Today, Colombia's guerrilla groups are reduced to the National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. These largely rural movements, with about 9,000 members, have shown a tenacity for regeneration since they started in the early 1960's, feeding on Colombia's deep class, race and regional resentments. **********""Where I was growing up there was no electricity, no running water,"" Mr. Perez said, in a description that still applies to much of rural Colombia. ""I worked on a ranch where the owner hit the workers. Sometimes, he did not pay our salaries."" **********To Flaco, a black from a city shantytown, Colombia's racism and social injustice endure. **********""When I was in high school, I wanted to go to college,"" he said bitterly. ""But I saw that only kids from 'nice families' were in university. So I joined the armed struggle."" **********A decade later he stood by a camp cook fire here and studied a news magazine  cover that showed 20 of Colombia's latest Cabinet prospects.

A third brokerage firm, Smith Barney Shearson, a subsidiary of the Travelers Corporation, also posted strong results. **********But investors could be in for a surprise, brokerage analysts said, if the financial markets are as busy over the next two months as they have been so far in January. **********Investors in brokerage firms have been betting that business would slow this year and because of that have pushed the price of brokerage-house stocks down about 20 percent in the last three months. But the fervent activity on Wall Street this year, including a succession of record highs for the Dow Jones industrial average, is creating the possibility of a more promising scenario, although such a notion is not at this point widespread. **********""If we continue on the pace we are on, the first quarter will be better than last year,"" James P. Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder, said. **********The fourth-quarter and 1993 earnings reports that will flow from Wall Street firms through the week reflect last year's nearly ideal conditions, which included falling interest rates and a buoyant stock market. **********It was hard in such an environment not to make money, and Wall Street took advantage by raking in billions not only as brokers and underwriters, but as advisers to corporations and individuals who poured $1 billion a day into mutual funds. **********Fourth-quarter earnings were so good at Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber that both brokerage houses took the opportunity to prepare for a possible future downturn by adding to reserves. **********""They are battening down the hatches a little bit and still presenting exceptionally good numbers,"" said Guy Moszkowski, a securities-industry analyst with Sanford C.

Merrill Lynch stock fell 75 cents, to $40.375, and Paine Webber's shares lost 62.5 cents, to $25.75. **********The stocks' performance have been a surprise to analysts, particularly since the conditions that spurred record profits in 1993 remain in place. **********""My outlook is that these companies will have good levels of revenues and profits in 1994,"" said Perrin H. Long, an analyst at First of Michigan. ""They may not be records, but the focus will be totally directed at keeping costs in line.""  Good News at Merrill Lynch **********In the fourth quarter, Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, reported income of $347.2 million, or $1.53 a share on a primary basis, up 57 percent from the corresponding period in 1992, on record revenue. **********Quarterly revenue records were established in commissions, investment banking, asset management and portfolio service fees. **********Reserve charges included $45 million for severance costs, Mr. Moszkowski said, and $25 million in merchant-banking charges related to proprietary trading. **********For the year, Merrill said it made $1.36 billion, or $5.98 a share on a primary basis, up 52 percent from the previous record of $893.8 million in net income for 1992. 1993 revenue totaled $16.6 billion, up 23.7 percent from 1992 levels.  Emphasis on Asset Paine Webber Management Fees **********In the fourth quarter, Paine Webber reported net income of $56.9 million, up from $41.4 million during the similar period of 1992. **********The firm, which has sought to build its asset-management business, said revenue from that activity rose 29 percent in the fourth quarter, to $91.5 million, from $70.9 million a year ago. Assets under management rose 11 percent, to $38.9 billion. **********For the year, Paine Webber made $246.2 million, or $4.66 a share, compared with $213.2 million, or $4.24 a share, a year earlier. **********""The main issues that drive our organization, and many firms in our industry, are the continued flow of assets under our control,"" Donald B.

Industry executives believe any such measure could cost as much as $300 million, so that they would have to seek higher rates from customers. Civil rights groups argue the measure is largely unnecessary and poses potential threats to privacy. **********""We're not objecting to wiretaps,"" said Marc Rotenberg, director of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit group in Washington. ""We're saying they don't have the right to pass a law that requires people to make it easier to wiretap."" **********Telephone and cable companies are building advanced networks that will also be used for shopping, education and personal business, so more than tapping telephone calls is at stake. **********""We're not only talking about voice communications,"" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington that lobbies on social issues related to electronics. ""What kind of movies we watch, what kind of commerce we engage in, what kind of political parties we want to communicate with -- all of these things are going to be on the information highway."" **********The new bill, which is a revised version of legislation proposed two years ago by the Bush Administration but never introduced in Congress, would not change any of the legal standards set for law enforcement agencies' wiretaps. Rather, it would require companies to install technology that makes it possible to continue traditional wiretapping. **********Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the plan's main proponent, and at other law enforcement agencies, argue that traditional wire-tap techniques, which entail little more than splicing into a telephone line and listening, are insufficient for today's digital networks. Beyond that, they contend, the telephone industry is now using new computerized routing technology that makes it harder to isolate particular calls or figure out where they are going. **********However, Martina Bradford, vice president of government affairs for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said today that the company saw no need for mandatory requirements on the industry. **********""Our main concern in the past was that the Bush legislation appeared to be too broad, too sweeping and premature,"" she said. ""We can work these things out under the broad guidelines of current law."" Narrower Proposal **********Administration officials said the new bill would be narrower than the Bush Administration measure, which was also pushed by the F.B.I. That bill would have forced almost any company providing communication services, including private computer networks, to include software permitting law enforcement agencies to decipher the streams of digital data. **********Clinton Administration officials said the new bill would be more ""focused"" that the Bush Administration bill, which encountered vigorous opposition from both civil rights groups and telephone companies, and would attempt to meet some of the industry's concerns. **********People familiar with Administration thinking say the new bill will probably exempt private networks, like those used within companies to exchange data among offices. **********Civil rights groups are hoping the Administration will also propose new measures to expand privacy protections against unauthorized eavesdropping; for example, by broadening the scope of current laws against unauthorized eavesdropping on cellular telephone calls, which are transmitted via radio waves, and increasing the penalties for violations. Discussions Continue **********Within the White House, the Office of Science and Technology Policy has led an effort to develop a measure to satisfy the conflicting demands of security agencies, the communications industry and civil rights organizations, and Administration officials emphasized today that discussions with these groups were continuing. **********Nevertheless, one Administration official strongly suggested that the bill would impose new obligations on a wide range of companies -- local and long-distance carriers, cable television companies that enter the telephone industry, cellular carriers and specialized fiber optic companies. **********The official said all companies that offered communication services must be treated similarly. If the telephone company is required to install new technology, but other local carriers are not, Administration officials fear, the other carriers could market themselves as offering services that are free from surveillance. **********F.B.I. officials contend that unless they can keep up with new technology, they will lose an invaluable tool for investigation."

MCI lodged a formal complaint with state regulators. At issue are toll calls that are farther than 16 miles but still within the coverage area of the local telephone monopoly. Customers who want to place calls from one local toll call area to another through one of the 95 new competitors will need to dial a five-digit access number before dialing the phone number.

Some analysts suggested the merger could fall through if Novell's share price fell too low. **********Novell shares closed today at $19, down $1, on extremely heavy volume of 21.8 million shares in Nasdaq trading. Novell shares fell $3.75 on Tuesday on still heavier volume, after Monday's announcement that the company would swap 59 million shares, then worth about $1.4 billion, for privately held Wordperfect, and pay $145 million in cash for Quattro Pro. **********Analysts say Novell's entry into the market for software applications, like Wordperfect's word processor, and Borland's spreadsheet, is a significant departure from the company's stated strategy of concentrating on systems software, where it is far and away the dominant player in network operating systems. In addition, they said the terms of the deal remained fuzzy and Novell had not offered any explanation, going so far as not returning calls from Wall Street analysts for the last two days. The company did not return a reporter's calls today. **********""Investors are irate and they voted with their shares,"" said David Readerman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. Novell ""is increasing the shares outstanding and paying over two times revenues for Wordperfect, which has a mid-teens growth rate and profit margins lower than their core business,"" he said. ""The motto at Novell is customers first, employees second and shareholders third, and that seems to be what this transaction is all about."" **********""This is about what we anticipated,"" said Adrian Rietveld, Wordperfect's president and chief executive, referring to the drop in Novell's share price. ""The shareholders are committed to the transaction and did not make their decision based on short-term movements in the stock price,"" he said. **********The deal raises new worries about who will succeed Raymond J. Noorda as Novell's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Noorda has said he will step down before turning 70 in June, and has disclosed that he is suffering slight memory lapses. And although Mr. Noorda has built Novell partly on a series of masterful acquisitions and mergers over the years, the deals he has done in the last 12 months, including the purchase of the Unix Systems Laboratories division of A.T.& T., have yet to pan out. **********Many analysts said they were mystified as to why Novell would enter the applications business now, when prices have dropped from $795 a package to $49, and the profitable business has shifted to office ""suites,"" groups of related word processors, spreadsheets and data base applications. As part of the Quattro deal, Novell obtains one million copies of Borland's Paradox data base, but there is no way to integrate that product as well as the Microsoft Corporation or the Lotus Development Corporation can integrate similar offerings in their own suites. **********""This looks to us like a rear guard action on Novell's part that could be more motivated by a mistaken desire to go head-to-head with Microsoft than part of a strategy to conquer new lands,"" said Rich Edwards, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens & Company. ""Frontal assaults by a smaller army against a larger army are doomed to failure."" Other Concerns Are Cited **********Another concern is that Wordperfect, although one of the biggest names in software, has never been particularly profitable, earning, by analysts' estimates, just $10 million on sales of nearly $700 million in 1993. One reason is that the company's work force, at nearly 7,000 employees, is considerably greater than most software companies' when measured against revenues. Analysts say layoffs would be necessary for Wordperfect's profit margins to improve. **********""Are they overpaying?"" asked Paul Johnson, an analyst with First Boston. ""Probably, but there weren't a lot of comparable companies to buy, so you almost had to overpay."" After talking to many big institutional holders of Novell stock, Mr. Johnson said most wanted to give the company the benefit of the doubt, but were concerned about the lack of warning about a move into applications, and the lack of explanation about the terms of the deal. **********For example, it is not clear whether the deal contains any mechanism to compensate for the drop in the share price, such as a corresponding increase in the number of shares to be exchanged to Wordperfect's shareholders. Otherwise, the value of the deal has already dropped from $1.4 billion to $1.12 billion, or 20 percent. **********Analysts said there was undoubtedly a floor beyond which the deal would be killed, but that given Wordperfect's inability within the last year to sell shares in a public offering because of its lackluster earnings record, its founders would probably want to close the deal, even at a discount."

Dramatic Deterioration **********Foreigners -- the largest contingent is French -- are moving out, tourists are staying away, and France is worried about a tide of refugees. **********Those who have left Algeria point to the dramatic deterioration in law and order throughout the nation, reflected in a near paralysis of public and government services and a notable increase in armed attacks and counterattacks by fundamentalist and secularist vigilante groups sponsored by various clans. **********""We are slipping toward a Kabul-like scenario, where the Afghans are shooting at each other and everyone else,"" said Said Saadi, leader of the Assembly for Democracy and Culture, a vehemently secularist political opposition party, in an interview here. **********The two-year spate of bloodshed began when a fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation Front, won the ruling majority in the first round of free parliamentary elections in 1991.  The military Government canceled the next round of elections and outlawed the party, which is known as F.I.S. **********The Islamic Salvation Front retaliated with a campaign of violence that has continued unabated since the party went underground. But while much of the killing in the past 24 months has been started and carried out by Islamic fundamentalists and aimed at Algerian intellectuals and officials, there is little doubt that pro-Government forces have indulged in subterfuge and killing as well. **********And those who speak out in favor of negotiating and end to the killing are often putting their own lives at risk. **********A senior Islamic leader who embraced pacifism, Sheik Mohammed Bouslemani, was killed because he supported negotiations. **********President Mohammed Boudiaf, who was assassinated in 1992 by one of his bodyguards, is believed to have been killed on orders of some of the military clans in the army. Several pro-fundamentalist activists and senior officials who favored negotiations suffered similar fates. More Than 4,000 Killed **********The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 Algerians and some 34 foreigners in two years, and Mr. Saadi, a major Algerian opposition figure, warned there would be no winners in this war. **********He said the secularist forces were arming themselves, creating militias without central command. **********Mr. Saadi's comments carry additional weight because his movement enjoys considerable support among the estimated three million ethnicBerbers in the mountainous Kabylia region of Algeria. **********Many of these Berbers have ties to France and, while devout Muslims, they oppose the idea of a Muslim theocracy. Seeking refuge in their ethnicity in the face of an unfolding Islamic wave engulfing the country, they are now demanding the reinstitution of Berber as the official language. An undetermined number among them have formed self-defense units, according to well-informed Algerians. **********The violence has gone beyond the assassination of intellectuals and secularist enemies of Muslim fundamentalists, which have now become routine, to include the burning of dozens of trains, buses, farms, schools and forests and the killing of women, some apparently because they were in public unveiled. **********Such acts of violence are too diffuse and contradictory in their aims to be attributed clearly to one side or another. **********According to these officials, at least two factions and perhaps as many as four have emerged within the military establishment, which has largely ruled the country since it became independent from France in 1962. **********The army's Chief of Staff, Gen.  Mohammed Lamari, and the Interior Minister, Gen. Selim Saadi, are pressing for a fight to the end with the fundamentalists, buttressed by a call from the army reserves of 170,000 soldiers and officers to carry it out. The two hard-line military men enjoy considerable support among top generals in the navy and air force, as well as from the police and the Prime Minister, Reda Malik, a determined foe of Muslim fundamentalism who has vowed to oppose talks. **********Another Algerian army faction is led by Gen. Lamin Zeroual, the country's new President, who was installed in January. Mr. Zeroual has publicly said he favors a negotiated compromise solution. **********So far his efforts have come to nothing, partly because of internal Government opposition but largely because even deeper divisions have split the leadership of the Islamic forces. **********The Islamic Salvation Front, once ranked as the country's primary fundamentalist opposition group, appears to have lost its hold on other militant Islamist forces, according to some of its own leaders.  Armed Islamic Group **********Senior leaders of the party, who have been jailed for nearly two years, appear to have been displaced by younger, far more militant leaders who command the armed groups that are successfully battling the authorities throughout the country, particularly the Armed Islamic Group, which is said to have some 5,000 to 10,000 underground fighters. **********Over the past few weeks, the Armed Islamic Group, in pamphlets and a variety of statements, has indicated its total rejection of reconciliation with the Government, insisting that authority was falling into its hands in large parts of the country. **********The group has carried out a series of assassinations of foreigners, including the slitting of the throats of 12 Croatian technicians and the shooting of unveiled Algerian women over the past 12 weeks. This is part of a strategy clearly designed to create shock in the West and irreconcilable differences with the largely secularist Algerian middle class. **********In an appreciation of how chaotic the situation in Algeria has become, France decided last week to pull out most of its teachers and technicians, closing French-operated schools in several Algerian cities. AT A GLANCE THE SPLINTERING OF ALGERIA Daily armed clashes between the Government and splintering factions of Muslim fundamentalists are pushing the sprawling North African country to the brink of civil war.  THE LAND -- Algeria, on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, is the world's 10th largest country and Africa's second-largest, covering 919,595 square miles. Major cities and farming areas lie in a strip along the coast, while the interior is mostly uninhabited desert. PEOPLE -- The population is estimated at 27 million, overwhelmingly Arab and Muslim with a significant Berber minority in Kabyle Mountains and Algiers. More than 40 percent of the population is under age 15. BABLANCE SHEET -- A founding member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, at one point Algeria earned more than $12 billion a year, 97 percent of its export income, from oil and gas. The oil bonanza ended in the 1980s while the population explosion continued, causing economic crisis and shortages of food and consumer goods that provoked major riots. Unemployment above 30 percent. POLITICS -- Islamic militants began their insurgency after the Islamic Salvation Front swept the initial round of first free parliamentary elections in December 1991 and the military ousted President Chadli Benjedid and canceled the second round of elections. When the military banned the Front and cracked down on its supporters, the fundamentalists responded with a campaign of violence, including bombings and assassinations, that has claimed nearly 4,000 lives."

But Ms. Orlins neglects to mention that J.A.L.'s service comes at a high price. **********With one of the airline industry's highest cost structures, J.A.L. has expenses that are an estimated 30 percent higher than United's (and 60 percent higher than the average for United States airlines). These high costs produce the ""attention to detail"" service of which Ms. Orlins is so fond. But J.A.L. survives only on the basis of Government subsidies and protection. **********Yet since deregulation 14 years ago, United and other American carriers have  slashed costs to emerge as the world's most efficient and lowest-cost providers  of air transport -- without Government subsidies or protection. Perhaps Ms. Orlins would like to go back to the old days of high fares and lavish service in United States skies. But as the success of the bare-bones carriers like Southwest Airlines demonstrates, the overwhelming majority of American consumers prefer low fares to gourmet cuisine.

Owades, founder and president of Calyx & Corolla, said her company planned to use the money to expand. ""This partnership will really catapult us into the big leagues,"" she said. **********Mrs. Owades declined to say how much Capital Cities Capital had paid for its stake of somewhat less than 20 percent, but Capital Cities will take a seat on her company's board. **********Calyx & Corolla had about $15 million in sales last year, Mrs. Owades said, compared with $10 million in 1991, the last year for which information is available. **********Unlike its bigger competitors, which use local florists to fill orders, Calyx & Corolla sells flowers that are shipped directly from growers to customers. By eliminating several links -- and a week to 10 days -- in the distribution chain, it can sell fresher flowers at roughly the same cost as its larger competition. **********The Capital Cities investment included a substantial package of advertising credits that will give Calyx & Corolla access to Capital Cities/ ABC's many media outlets, including the ABC television network and 8 television stations, the ABC radio network and 19 radio stations and other cable and television programming and networking services. **********Calyx & Corolla hopes to use the advertising and marketing expertise of Capital Cities/ABC to take on the behemoths of the $13 billion flower distribution market, like Teleflora, FTD and 1-800-FLOWERS. Mrs. Owades estimated that their revenues exceeded $1 billion. **********""There's no reason why we can't be at least almost as big,"" she said. **********George M. Cain, president of Capital Cities Capital, said Calyx & Corolla fit his company's goal of financing small consumer-product companies with strong managements and products whose appeal could be extended through advertising. **********""I think Calyx & Corolla's continuing focus on delivering better quality is a true point of differentiation that can be exploited so the company can grow many-fold its current level,"" Mr. Cain said. **********Mrs. Owades said the cost of mailing and printing catalogues was increasing and that people were overwhelmed by the many catalogues they received. The alliance with Capital Cities/ABC addresses many of those problems in a way that other methods of financing could not, she said. **********""Over the last 12 months we've been assessing different opportunities for Calyx & Corolla,"" she said. ""This one seemed the best one."" **********The company has experimented with home shopping ventures, apparently with mixed results. Mrs. Owades even appeared on Joan Rivers's shopping show, which is no longer broadcast. **********Mrs. Owades sold her first business, Gardener's Eden, a catalogue offering lawn furniture, tools, seeds and other gardening paraphernalia, to Williams-Sonoma for $1 million.

And global bond markets aren't the only inhabitants of the investment universe to be glad that this one is over. Equities nearly everywhere should also be feeling giddy when the clock strikes 12 on Saturday night. **********Consider stock-index performances around the globe, as of late this week, calculated in local currency by Bloomberg Business News. First, the major ""mature"" markets. **********In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average gained just over 2 percent this year and the S & P 500 lost nearly 1 percent. Last year, the Dow was up over 13 percent while the S & P gained 7 percent. **********In 1993, England's FT-SE 100 index gained almost 20 percent while the DAX in Frankfurt rose nearly 50 percent and France's CAC-40 returned 23 percent. This year is quite another story, with the British index falling 10 percent, the German 8 percent and the French 17 percent. The International Herald Tribune World Stock Index posted a healthy 22.86 return in 1993, but this year it's up only 2 percent. **********But perhaps a more painful story is that of the emerging markets, some of which rose dramatically in 1993, seducing wowed investors to get in in a big way. The casualties: Poland, up a staggering 1,034 percent last year, down 44 percent this year; Thailand, up 89 percent in '93, down 22 percent in '94; the Philippines' Manila Composite Index gained 151 percent last year and lost nearly 16 percent this year. The litany goes on. **********Emerging-market bulls say that such wide swings represent merely growing pains for a host of long-term happy endings. Maybe they're right. But this year's losses still hurt. **********As for 1995, who knows? But this reflective moment of the year often conjures up a thought worth remembering: In mature markets or emerging ones, in hedge funds or bond funds, in options or futures, as in bebop and in love, timing is everything."

Poverty has been worsening in the crowded slums of the capital and among the 80 percent of the people who live in rural areas. And corruption flourishes in an illegal economy that is reported to be much larger than the official economy. **********A scandal over the exporting of timber from the nation's forests, long pillaged by the military, erupted in late June, heightening a crisis of confidence in the Government and causing ambassadors from countries that provide economic aid to send alarm signals to their capitals. **********The elections were won by the United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia, led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a son of King Norodom Sihanouk. It defeated the People's Party, the party of the Vietnamese-installed Communist Government that ran Cambodia since 1979. But a virtual Communist coup, consisting of a declaration of secession of seven provinces in protest against the results, led Prince Sihanouk to impose a coalition Government on the victors to avoid strife. He was subsequently chosen as King. **********The dominance of the People's Party is reflected at the top of the Government. Prince Ranariddh is First Prime Minister and Hun Sen, the Khmer Rouge defector who headed the Vietnamese-backed Government before the elections, is Second Prime Minister. **********Yet Mr. Hun Sen is believed by ambassadors, many of the Prince's associates in the Cabinet and what seems to be a majority of private citizens to hold the upper hand because of Communist discipline in this nearly anarchic nation. **********The royalist party, known by the acronym Funcinpec, is deeply divided over what many of its top figures consider Prince Ranariddh's disdain for them and submissiveness to Mr. Hun Sen. King Sihanouk, being treated for cancer in Beijing, has sent a stream of fax messages critical of his son's actions, contributing to the party's disarray. **********Angered by a proposal backed by the Communists and Prince Ranariddh to outlaw the Khmer Rouge, which the King and many here consider an empty gesture endangering chances of peace and reconciliation, the King announced on Thursday that he would not return. **********The timber scandal came to light when leaders of the royalist party, including the Foreign Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, a half-brother of the King, and Economics and Finance Minister Sam Rainsy, obtained copies of a letter that the two Prime Ministers, in the name of the Government, addressed to Prime Minister Chuan Lekpai of Thailand on June 17. They informed the Thai leader that effective immediately, timber could be exported only by the Defense Ministry. **********The disclosure caused consternation on many counts. Under an earlier Government decision, timber exports have been ""prohibited under any circumstances"" since April 1. Also, the Prime Ministers made the new ruling on their own, without consultation with the four ministries previously concerned with timber exports. Moreover, it was communicated only to Thailand, not to the Cambodian Government. Khmer Rouge Gains From Timber Sales **********Cambodians resent the fact that precious woods, their country's most lucrative product, have been pillaged by the military and sold across the Thai border. The commerce began under the American-backed Government of President Lon Nol during the 1970-1975 war. Since the defeat of the Khmer Rouge by Vietnam in January 1979, the Maoist-inspired rebels, who enjoy strong backing, have financed their guerrilla war through this trade. **********Giving the military the right to sell timber independently also violates the budget law, said Mr. Rainsy, the most respected member of the Government among many Cambodians and foreigners because, rare among ministers, he is regarded as competent. ""All state revenues should be centralized in the budget,"" he said. **********Although legislators have expressed dismay in conversations, the issue has not been raised in Parliament. Members of the two non-Communist parties said in interviews that the legislature functioned mainly when the Government submitted draft bills, which it rarely does. **********The Parliament. whose election was the cause of the claims of success for the United Nations operation, is a dormant body presided over by Chea Sim, the People's Party's leader who is considered Cambodia's strongman. His party's 51 lawmakers vote as one, said Son Soubert, the second deputy chairman of Parliament, whose Liberal Democratic Party, a Buddhist group, holds 10 of the 120 seats. **********Mr. Soubert, an art historian, could recall only two measures that had been passed since Parliament became a legislature after adopting a Constitution last September: the budget and a financial reorganization. He smiled in embarrassment when asked how many days Parliament had been in full session. ""Maybe one week in '93,"" he said, and fewer than 20 days altogether. **********Om Radsady, the royalist who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said of his party, which holds 58 seats, ""We won, but we don't have the keys to the house yet."" Communists Remain From Top to Bottom **********A senior official in the Interior Ministry, which controls administration down to the village level and the pervasive, Communist-style security apparatus, said People's Party officials were in disarray when their election defeat was announced by the United Nations and expected the victors to move in and claim the spoils. **********But he said that because of lack of organization, the royalists never did, and as a result the repressive Communist apparatus remained in place ""from top to bottom."" **********In consequence, the official said, confirming a view shared by many international agency officials and aid workers based here, villagers believe that the feared Communists remain in power. **********High officials of the two non-Communist parties in the governing coalition reported threats and pressure from People's Party followers. Voicing opposition puts one's life at risk, said Say Bory, the Secretary of State for Relations With Parliament. Asked whether he meant his political life, he replied, ""No."" **********Officials of the old regime continue to surround royalist ministers, controlling access and the information that reaches them. Prince Sirivudh, the Foreign Minister, said a protest by the Japanese Embassy against the timber ruling, delivered to the Foreign Ministry on June 21, did not reach him until June 27. **********The war against the Khmer Rouge continues. Earlier this year the army, in two major actions, captured the stronghold of Pailin in the west and threatened Anlong Veng, a major redoubt, in the north. **********But the offensive ended in embarrassment when, with far fewer troops, the rebels regained all that they had lost and got within six miles of Battambang, the country's second-largest city. A foreign specialist who visited Pailin while it was held by the Government said officers ""stole like rats"" in the town, which is the center of sapphire mines that help to finance the Khmer Rouge, which sells the gems, along with timber, in Thailand. **********The army numbers 145,000 on paper, but a Western expert said that many were phantoms, for whom officers drew pay. Officers and noncommissioned officers far outnumber privates, and the number of generals is estimated at 2,000 to 3,000. The two Prime Ministers are among those holding five-star rank. **********Military corruption often takes violent forms, said Christophe Pleschoux of the Cambodia office of the United Nations Center for Human Rights. He said the office, for which the organization's Geneva headquarters has yet to appoint a director and whose budget trickles in belatedly, had gathered evidence in more than 100 cases in which officers and enlisted men were running rackets involving illegal detention, murder, torture, rape and blackmail. **********Most of the cases investigated are in Battambang Province, which is crisscrossed by traders from the Thai border carrying money. Suspicion extends to the top officials of the province, which is controlled by the People's Party. The cases reported to the agency are only ""the tip of the iceberg,"" Mr. Pleschoux said. **********Corruption became visible when the Communist Government, after the cutoff of Soviet and Vietnamese aid in the late 1980's, officially foreswore its doctrine and opened Cambodia to foreign trade and investment. It grew rampant with the large United Nations presence in 1992 and 1993. **********The 1991 Paris Agreements for a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodian Conflict was imposed upon the Cambodian factions by 18 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union and China. It brought to this underdeveloped, long-isolated country of perhaps nine million people 16,000 soldiers from 32 nations, 4,000 police officers and 2,000 diplomats, experts, secretaries and guards. They were well paid, many of the civilians receiving a daily allowance of $130 in addition to their pay. **********When the present Government brought non-Communist officials into positions of influence, many are known to have taken little time to profit from them. Asked about officials of his royalist party, Economics Minister Sam Rainsy said, ""Corruption touches the whole country, everybody."" **********It flourishes in an environment in which, says Tioulong Samura, vice governor of the National Bank, the illegal economy is two or three times as big as the official economy. Cambodia is ""a paradise for money launderers,"" said Mr. Rainsy, who is Ms. Samura's husband. ""It is a cash economy, and the legal framework is weak,"" he said. His wife, interviewed separately, said Thais and overseas Chinese from all of Southeast Asia profited most. Prospects for Most: Disease and Poverty **********The poverty of those who have no share in the boom -- that is, most Cambodians -- reeks powerfully in the densely crowded quarters that lie right off the main streets of Phnom Penh. In what before 1970 was one of Southeast Asia's cleanest cities, large sections now consist of shacks packed against one another, surrounded by children and heaps of fetid garbage that stays and stays. In this monsoon season, the ruined drainage system often backs up, spreading foul smells. **********The average Cambodian dies before reaching 50. Of every 1,000 children born, 184 die before they reach 5; 120 do not live a year. The comparable figures for neighboring Thailand are 33 under 5 and 28 under 1. The World Health Organization reports that 900 mothers die per 100,000 giving birth but believes the real number to be much higher. **********Only 18 percent of the population has access to safe drinking water, and the United Nations Children's Fund estimates that only 13 percent benefit from adequate sanitation. **********Dr. Beat Richner, a Swiss pediatrician who has established a large children's hospital, said the declining state of nutrition among children and parents indicates that poverty is rapidly increasing. He estimates that every third Cambodian has had tuberculosis. **********Anne H. Dykstra of the United Nations Children's Fund said 65 to 70 percent of children started school, but many repeated first grade two or three times and dropped out by the second grade, particularly girls. ""This is a lethal combination,"" she said. ""They can't build an economy on that, not even agrarian."" **********Cambodian officials look hopefully for outside help. Om Radsady, the parliamentary Foreign Affairs chairman, said: ""The big powers should take responsibility. When you buy a car, you get a service guarantee. Maybe we drove the car badly, but you should share responsibility."""

But a Government-financed study released last week by the Manhattan Borough President's office says there is a compelling reason for all that attention: despite the convulsions of the last 20 years, New York is still by far the largest book publishing center in the country. **********New York's position is faltering in some ways, the report says. The study provides figures that bolster the impressions of New Yorkers in the industry, who have watched big publishers acquire smaller publishers or merge with other companies, and who have lived through round after round of dismissals and cutbacks at some of the city's largest companies. In fact, the industry is growing at a much larger rate nationally than it is in the city, meaning that New York's share of the nation's publishing work force has fallen significantly in the last 15 years. **********In 1978, New York's share was about 29 percent; by 1990, it was just under 19 percent, or 13,964 workers, the report said. But New York's total was still almost triple the number of publishing employees in Chicago, which was second on the list. Too Expensive, Too Crowded **********Much erosion can be attributed to the rising cost of doing business in New York, and to the growing impracticality of housing publishing-related services like printing and warehousing in the city, according to the report, prepared by the office of the Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger. **********""New York's continued strength in the publishing industry is challenged by improvements in communications technologies that make it increasingly possible to publish anywhere in the country while still tapping into New York's pool of talent,"" the study said. ""New York is losing its market share, and one reason is that New York is not generating new business or retaining smaller firms."" **********The report was based on interviews with publishing employees and on figures drawn from various industry and government studies. **********New York remains home to many of the biggest publishing houses, the report noted. While the city has only 207 of the country's 2,144 book publishing companies, or less than 10 percent, it has 30 percent of the publishers employing more than 1,000 workers. **********The report also said that more than half of the nation's publishing houses were small operations, employing fewer than five workers each. But in New York, only 38 percent of the publishing companies were in this category. **********""Publishing continues to be one of the city's largest sources of jobs,"" the report said. ""However, trends in technology and the marketplace offer several challenges to New York's dominance. Mergers and acquisitions have altered the composition of the industry; in some cases traditionally family-owned operations now find themselves divisions within diversified, multinational communications empires."" **********These diversified companies, which put greater emphasis on the bottom line than traditional publishers, are more likely to jettison parts of their publishing operations or move divisions out of New York, the report said.  Heartbeat of an Industry **********But New York has many obvious advantages, the report said, including a qualified work force and a reputation for being the country's intellectual center. The city was also seen as satisfying publishers' desires to be near other publishers and near the national newspapers, magazines and television shows that they depend on to promote books. **********Interestingly enough, many authors do not live in the city, the report said, because they find it too expensive or too stifling to their creativity. At the same time, the literary agents who represent authors tend to work in Manhattan. ""New York has some 250 literary agents, almost 50 percent of the nation's total, and virtually all of the prominent ones,"" the report said, failing to mention any agents in Los Angeles. **********The report saw another reason for New York's desirability as a book publishing center: food. **********""While many agents work out of their homes, which may be anywhere in the area, they often meet with publishers at restaurants near the publishers' Manhattan offices,"" it said. ""The wide variety of restaurants in Manhattan was frequently cited by publishers as a factor weighing in favor of staying in New York."""

They will be contained in a report to the EU summit meeting on the Greek island of Corfu on June 24 and 25. **********The commission has no power to compel member governments to act on the white paper, so its only weapon is moral suasion. It will use its scorecard to analyze the countries' performance on key recommendations such as reducing social security charges, especially for low-paid workers; deregulating labor markets; and improving education and job training, particularly for the one-half of Europe's jobless people who have been without work for more than a year. **********The report will be compiled by aides to Jacques Delors, the commission's president, Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, and Padraig Flynn, employment and social affairs commissioner. **********Mr. Flynn, 53, an energetic former politician from Ireland, last week began a tour of European capitals to discuss jobs and other issues addressed in the White Paper. He said in an interview that the findings would be presented ""in a table on who is doing what, on who is following the white paper."" **********A commission official was more blunt: ""This is an attempt to give the process real impetus. There is a risk that this thing could just die."" **********While Mr. Flynn was reluctant to describe his tour and the report as an attempt to pressure European leaders, he is clearly embarked on on an aggressive campaign to convert Europe's words into action and get the white paper implemented. **********""It will make no impact unless they act on it,"" Mr. Flynn said. ""If they decide not to do it, they will be in contradiction of their own request."" **********His message is that national governments, not the executive commission itself, must make changes in labor laws, taxes and regulation if the Union is to reverse a nearly 30-year-old trend of rising unemployment. The number of jobless in the EU is nearly 18 million, and Mr. Flynn said it could rise to 20 million before beginning to level off next year. **********""It's really our only catalyst,"" a commission official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. ""The idea is to use this as a means of pressure."" **********Mr. Flynn's tour started last week with a visit to The Hague for meetings with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Delors as commission president. The Netherlands gets high marks from the commission for some steps it is taking, including a proposed wage freeze and attacks on welfare abuse. **********On Friday, Mr. Delors, the driving force behind the white paper, went to Rome, where he joined Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi in a conference on unemployment. **********The going may be tougher later in the month when Mr. Flynn visits London. Britain's almost exclusive focus on slashing the welfare state and labor costs conflicts sharply with the thrust of the white paper, which says that low wages alone will threaten social peace in Europe without necessarily boosting jobs and competitiveness.

But, although those infrastructure projects are considered crucial to Europe's ability to compete in the 21st century, they will give almost no near-term boost to employment, Mr. Flynn said. **********The structural barriers that Europe must tear down to begin creating jobs are almost the exclusive province of national governments, he added. **********The commission wants to see structural problems tackled before an economic recovery takes hold. **********""As soon as they get a bit of growth they'll forget about it, and we'll be back in five years' time in an even worse position,"" a commission official said."

W. de Klerk served notice today that the moral high ground is no longer big enough for both of them. **********In the first blazing battle of what is now a full-scale campaign for the first national election open to all races, the reformist President and the patriarch of the liberation movement warred over who really freed South Africa. **********Mr. de Klerk today formally proclaimed the dates for the election -- April 26, 27 and 28. The voters will choose members of the national and regional legislatures. A president will be chosen later. **********The frantic day of moral one-upmanship went like this: **********First Mr. de Klerk chose today, the anniversary of his 1990 speech renouncing apartheid and announcing Mr. Mandela's imminent release from prison, to launch his party's campaign officially by claiming to be the real agent of South Africa's liberation. **********To pre-empt the white President's claim, Mr. Mandela returned this morning to the bucolic prison outside Cape Town where he spent the last months of his 27 years in prison. Surrounded by other former inmates, he lighted a ""flame of freedom"" honoring those who suffered to end apartheid. **********As soon as the prison visit was announced, Mr. de Klerk's party rushed full-page ads into many newspapers claiming the accolade for their own: ""Today Mr. Nelson Mandela honors President de Klerk with a 'Flame of Freedom.' "" **********But the A.N.C., anticipating something of the kind, was ready with a two-page ad of its own. It featured a cartoon of Mr. Mandela as a boxer standing over a fallen giant, labeled ""apartheid,"" while Mr. de Klerk leapt up from his ringside seat shouting: ""I did it! I did it!"" The Moral Edge **********In the game of moral trumps, most South Africans would say Mr. Mandela's advantage is incontestable. He spent half his adult life in prisons for demanding the vote, and then emerged preaching not revenge but reconciliation. **********But Mr. de Klerk is bound to try. Polling organizations have concluded that this will be what they call a ""liberation election,"" in which black voters are moved less by campaign promises than by a yearning for emancipation. **********As the two rivals laid into each other, negotiators were still working on a compromise that might woo black and white conservatives into the election process. Today's announcement of the election dates leaves any party that wants to participate 10 days to register its intention. **********African National Congress leaders said today that they were prepared to drop their insistence that South Africans cast a single vote for both national and provincial elections. The congress has contended that letting voters split their ticket, supporting one party for the national Parliament and another party for the provincial legislatures, would confuse first-time voters. **********Others, including many foreign election specialists, said the single ballot would give the African National Congress an unfair edge and could mean extinction for opposition parties whose power is based in a particular region. **********The concession could provide the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and white separatist parties a face-saving way to join the election campaign. The negotiations are to resume on Thursday. **********With Inkatha and the right-wing white parties still sidelined, Mr. de Klerk's National Party has focused on challenging the African National Congress for black votes. A New Image Is Sought **********To bolster black support that polls put in the very low single digits, Mr. de Klerk has tried to recast the image of his party, which institutionalized apartheid, as the party of change and multiracial unity. **********As he opened his party's convention tonight in a suburb of Johannesburg, the new image seemed an awkward fit. **********Although there were a few blacks and a few hundred delegates from the more conservative mixed-race and Indian constituencies, it was a gathering mainly white and still clumsy with the cadences of Africa. **********As the lyrics were projected on a giant screen, the delegates struggled painfully with the African words and harmonies of the freedom hymn, ""God Bless Africa."" The cocktail-lounge combo hired for the occasion, too, was more at ease with ""When the Saints Go Marching In."" **********The party found a former black exile, David Chuenyane, to introduce Mr. de Klerk as the man who ""stood up and said 'I am going to liberate South Africa.' "" When the President bounded on stage, delegates punched the air and shouted ""Viva de Klerk!"" in the style of anti-apartheid rallies. 'Baccak Into the Dark Ages' **********""The A.N.C. would cast us back into the dark ages,"" Mr. de Klerk thundered. ""It is a party secretly controlled by Communists, militants and extremists."" **********Mr. de Klerk said, ""The truth is that it was the National Party which initiated and made the changes."" **********Outside Victor Verster Prison in the wine country northeast of Cape Town, where scores of former prisoners assembled this morning, Mr. de Klerk's claim to have freed South Africa was variously greeted with florid indignation or gentle derision. **********""These Boers will try anything,"" scoffed Allan Boesak, the Dutch Reformed minister who is regional head of the congress. **********""If they want to light a flame for F. W. de Klerk, let him come and show the places he has suffered in jail,"" said Mr. Boesak, who was never sentenced to prison but was repeatedly arrested. ""Let him come and show us his children who have been tear-gassed."" **********Under the banners labeled with names of their prisons -- ""Robben Island,"" ""Pretoria Central,"" ""Pollsmoor,"" ""Death Row"" -- the alumni awaited Mr. Mandela and reminisced. **********Matthews Meyiwa, who spent 22 of his 69 years in prison for plotting against the apartheid state, said Mr. de Klerk had simply bowed to the pressure from home and abroad. **********""It was not a change of heart,"" he said. ""It was the fruit of bitter struggle."" **********""If it was up to him, we'd still be in jail,"" agreed his friend, Henry Fazzie, who survived 24 years in apartheid prisons. Mr. Mandela arrived, lighted a torch, freed some doves, and put a wreath on the razor wire hedge erected at the prison entrance. Then he rode past adoring crowds to a soccer stadium in Paarl, where perhaps 8,000 ecstatic people sang him ""God Bless Africa"" without cue cards."

Wladyslaw Ciaston and Gen. Zenon Platek was seen here as a test case for bringing former Communists to account for past repressions. **********The verdict acquitting them on Friday was met with a brief stunned silence in the courtroom followed by shouts of ""Communist cover-up!"" ""Shame!"" and ""Injustice!"" from angry spectators, who were ordered removed from the court. **********The Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a charismatic young Roman Catholic priest who denounced the Communist Government in his sermons, was tortured and killed by the secret police in 1984. Over a quarter of a million Poles defied a ban on public gathering to attend his funeral, and the priest instantly became one of the country's most revered martyrs. **********""This decision absolves an evident crime,"" Archbishop Tadeusz Goclowski of Gdansk told the Polish press agency. ""It will also cause great anxiety among Poles who experienced the repression of the Communist system."" **********The killing of Father Popieluszko created such outrage here in 1984 that the Communist authorities feared widespread demonstrations. Four secret police agents were convicted of the murder in 1985, but few Poles were satisfied that the killers could have acted on their own, and the case reopened after Communism collapsed. **********The agents convicted in 1985 later said they had acted on orders from General Ciaston, the former chief of the Communist Party's Political Security Service, and General Platek, who headed the branch responsible for surveillance and infiltration of the Catholic Church here. **********But Judge Jaroslaw Goral, speaking for the five-judge panel that heard the case, ruled that ""although the generals were probably responsible for the murder,"" there was no evidence to corroborate the accusation. Judge Goral said the secret police removed damaging evidence in 1984. **********The trial, which had dragged on for more than two years, was marked by assertions of memory lapses by former security agents called to testify. Neither of the defendants testified. **********Earlier this year, prosecutors reduced the charges against the two generals from ordering the priest's murder, which would have carried a possible death penalty, to ""instigation to murder,"" a lesser offense that they that carried a maximum 15-year prison term."

McCaw, who became both a billionaire and unemployed when he sold his cellular telephone company in September to the AT&T Corporation, says he is browsing for new ventures but still does not know what to do with the rest of his life. **********Mr. McCaw, who is 45, caused a stir last week by applying to bid in the Federal Communications Commission's December auction of new licenses for wireless telephone and data services. **********Speculation began almost immediately. Did the founder of McCaw Cellular Communications plan to compete against his old company? Did he have some radically new idea for using radio frequencies? **********Maybe, maybe not. ""People shouldn't believe that, just because I got a catalogue from Christies, it means I'm going buy anything,"" Mr. McCaw said in his first public comment on the issue this week. **********""I'm really doing a lot of soul-searching,"" he said. ""Is this going to be embarrassing? Is this going to cause trouble?

The entrepreneur, who is now AT&T's's biggest shareholder, said he wanted to avoid conflicts of interest. **********Mr. McCaw has assembled about a half-dozen associates around him, and he clearly does not plan to retire.

In the main hotels, which were filled with refugees, the mood was one of doom. **********The fighting was so intense at times that Belgian troops stationed at the airport were unable to reach a group of more than a dozen Western journalists stranded in a hotel at the center of the city. Airport Hit by Mortar Shells **********With the streets too treacherous to negotiate, the hotel appeared to be sealed off from even well-armed rescuers. But this evening, a convoy of abandoned cars assembled by the journalists and escorted by an armored United Nations military vehicle, made its way through roadblocks to the airport. The convoy was not fired upon, but the airport was hit with at least 10 mortar rounds. The journalists flew out to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on a C-130 transport with about 40 Rwandan refugees.  Five journalists remained in Kigali but moved, with the help of the United Nations, to a hotel away from the heaviest fighting. **********With the city descending further into chaos, the role of the 2,000 United Nations troops in Rwanda has become increasingly difficult. The soldiers, most of them in Kigali, have witnessed massacres that they were unable to prevent because the United Nations contingent was deployed under a mandate that restricts it to monitoring a since-broken peace agreement between the Rwandan rebels and the Government. **********Their movements are also limited within Kigali, and their sole mission since fighting broke out last Wednesday has been to try to broker cease-fires and bring the warring factions together. Renewed fighting prevented the United Nations from convening talks between representatives of the Government and the rebels today. **********""We have been sitting now eight or nine days in our trenches,"" said the United Nations commander, Gen. Romeo Dallaire of Canada. ""The question is how long do you sit there or attempt to get it settled? This is not a peace enforcing mission. They haven't stopped firing so I'd say I'm not yet effective. If we don't see any light at the end of the tunnel, if we see another three weeks of being cooped up watching them pound each other then we have to seriously assess the risk of keeping these soldiers here."" **********Kigali erupted in ethnic and political violence on April 6 when President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed in a suspicious plane explosion. His death set off a centuries-old tribal hatred between the minority Tutsi ethnic group and the majority Hutus. Since then, tens of thousands of Rwandans have been killed, most of them in massacres. **********According to the United Nations, 17,600 people have fled Rwanda since fighting began. These include 8,000 Burundi refugees who returned to Burundi from Rwanda and 8,000 Rwandans who have sought sanctuary in Zaire. The United Nations said it had no figures on the number of displaced people. **********All Americans and Europeans were evacuated from this former Belgian colony, and the last Western troops, from France and Rwanda's former colonial master, Belgium, were expected to leave their airport bunkers today or Friday. Relief officials and Rwandans expect the fighting to worsen after the troops leave. **********After an overnight lull, fighting resumed at dawn today. Heavy mortars and machine-gun fire shook the center of the city for most of the day. Increasingly, it appeared that the Rwandan Army was ceding control of the streets to bands of drunken men armed with machetes, spears, truncheons and automatic weapons that manned checkpoints throughout the city. The International Committee of the Red Cross temporarily suspended relief operations today when gunmen stopped one of its trucks carrying six wounded Rwandans, pulled the Rwandans out and killed them. Earlier, Red Cross officials came across 15 bodies hacked to death in front of a religious school. 'Machete Massacres' **********""It is machete massacres,"" said Philippe Gaillard, the chief Red Cross representative here. ""More and more the civilian population armed with machetes is ruling the streets. The army cannot control them. **********""You want to hold back those people when you are witnessing it,"" he said, ""but you have your blue beret and there's no respect for it."" **********In Kigali, scores of Rwandans have taken refuge at the Hotel Mille Collines. There is an uneasy, nervous coexistence there between the families of the Rwandan military and some middle-class Tutsis who were unable to leave the city. **********Both are convinced they will be massacred. They congregate in the dark hallways, whispering for hours, virtual prisoners. As United Nations soldiers came to take the foreign journalists to the airport, dozens of the Rwandans crowded around and begged to be evacuated, fearing that the departure of Westerners would mean sure death for them. Their pleas were rejected by the troops. As the convoy left, many gathered silently in the driveway and stared. **********On the road to the airport, one neighborhood had been emptied by fighting, the houses burned and shops ransacked. In one place corpses were still piled up. Towering over the deserted shacks, a poster for Guinness stout -- two hands clinking beer mugs -- seemed grossly out of place. ""The Power of Love,"" it declared."

To play a Virtual Boy game a user must look directly into two miniature displays to view stereoscopic images created by arrays of red-light-emitting diodes, or LED's. **********Nintendo also said it had made a minority investment in Reflection Technology, which has 20 employees, and would manufacture in Japan the tiny screens used for the game under a licensing agreement. **********Nintendo currently sells a portable system called Game Boy that is designed to run versions of the company's 16-bit video games. **********""The only similarity between this new game and the existing Game Boy product happens to be the second half of its name,"" said Peter Main, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing. ""This is a new genre of game-playing device."" **********Both Nintendo and Sega, its Japanese competitor, have been searching for ways to reignite the market for their games while they await the arrival of more powerful 32-bit game systems some time next year. Many analysts of the video game industry expect this Christmas selling season to be disappointing because the two companies have already sold about 33 million 16-bit game systems, effectively saturating the market. **********And next year, competition is expected to be stronger. The 3DO Corporation of Redwood City, Calif., and the Atari Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif., are already selling 32-bit and 64-bit games and the Sony Corporation is expected to enter the United States market with its own game, introduced recently in Japan. **********""Next year there will be a big sorting out,"" Mr. Main of Nintendo said. **********Sega, trying to pick up momentum in its Christmas sales, has recently begun selling a system known as the 32X, which works as an add-in with the company's current 16-bit games, giving them more power and better performance. Sega's next-generation system is expected to be available in the United States for next year's holiday season. **********Nintendo, meanwhile, is developing a new generation of video games, known as Project Reality, with Silicon Graphics Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. That system is also expected to be available during the 1995 holiday season. **********For this year's holidays, Nintendo and Sega executives hope consumers will be attracted by new programs. Nintendo is counting on Donkey Kong Country, the latest addition to its Donkey Kong series, while Sega has introduced a new character, Knuckles, to its Sonic the Hedgehog lineup. **********""Contrary to most opinions the cartridge game market is alive and well and exceptionally healthy this Christmas,"" said Lee Isgur, a financial analyst at Jefferies & Company in San Francisco. **********Nintendo executives said they thought the market for 16-bit systems would continue to evolve with new software. ""If you look at the tail end of the first generation of video game systems, we're still selling at the range of 800,000 to one million machines annually,"" Mr. Main said. **********He said that he believed that the same phenomenon would be true in the second-generation 16-bit game market. ""We have a sophisticated, although young, core audience,"" he said. ""The average 12-year-old has been embracing video games for seven or eight years."" **********The Virtual Boy's LED display provides only shades of red against a black background, but Nintendo officials said that the game created a feeling of depth that was not possible with conventional television or computer monitors. **********A single array of LED's is projected off the surface of a vibrating mirror to create the effect of a television screen or a computer monitor. **********The game, which has a 32-bit microprocessor and which will require specially written software, will sell for about $199. It will be demonstrated in the United States for the first time at a consumer electronics show in January. **********The company said that three software titles would be available when the new system was introduced and that it hoped to offer three new games each month after that. **********Reflection Technology officials said they had been discussing the technology with Nintendo for more than three years. **********The new game system is designed to be used while seated at a table. It offers stereo sound and it is operated by a special controller that permits three-dimensional movement.                    --------------------       Sega's Profit Drops 47% **********TOKYO, Nov. 13 (AP) -- Sega Enterprises Ltd., the video game maker, said on Friday that first-half profits had dropped 47 percent because of weak sales and the strong yen. **********The company earned 8.42 billion yen, about $86.1 million, in the six months that ended on Sept. 30, compared with 15.91 billion yen in the corresponding period last year. **********Sales dropped 25 percent, to 151.07 billion yen, or $1.54 billion, from 200.65 billion yen because of weak demand in Europe and Japan, the company said. **********Sega said sales of home-use games and software had been stagnant. The company is trying to bolster earnings by diversifying into theme parks. **********Sega already has two theme parks in Japan. It plans to open a park near Universal Studios in Los Angeles in conjunction with MCA Inc., the parent of Universal Studios, by the end of next year."

Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, that would demand that the President unilaterally lift the arms embargo by Nov. 15. Thirty-seven Republicans and 21 Democrats voted in favor; 35 Democrats and 7 Republicans voted against. **********The Senate also voted tonight, 56-44, to approve a conflicting amendment more to the President's liking. This one, sponsored by Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, called on Mr. Clinton to urge the United Nations to lift the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs have not approved the peace plan by Oct. 31. **********Forty-six Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to approve it, while 34 Republicans and 10 Democrats voted against. **********Afterward, a White House official said, ""The two votes send a strong signal both to our allies and the Bosnian Serbs that Congress shares our concern that the time for peace is now."" No Immediate Effect **********Lawmakers said the amendments, attached to the defense appropriations bill, would have no immediate effect because the House has not voted on the arms embargo as part of that bill. **********Like Congress, the Administration has long been uncomfortable with the three-year-old embargo because it favored the Bosnian Serbs, who acquired most of the tanks, artillery pieces and other weapons of the old Yugoslav Army, at the expense of the sparsely armed Bosnian Government forces. **********But the President has insisted that a multilateral decision on the embargo is necessary out of concern for the Western allies involved in the United Nations embargo. **********President Clinton informed Congress of his plans in a letter to Senator Nunn. **********Referring to the Bosnian Muslims, President Clinton wrote, ""It has been my long-held view that the arms embargo has unfairly and unintentionally penalized the victim in this conflict and that the Security Council should act to remedy this injustice."" **********In an effort to reassure Congress, his letter also said: ""We will not allow the process leading to a Security Council decision on the arms embargo to be delayed indefinitely.""  Concern About the Allies **********Mr. Clinton's decision to push to end the arms embargo worried the other major powers that have helped broker the peace initiative, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. They fear that ending the embargo would aggravate the fighting. **********""It's not something we would think is a particularly good idea,"" said one European diplomat. ""It could plunge this back into an all-out war."" **********The British and French have indicated that they would pull out their peacekeepers if the arms embargo is lifted, even though they acknowledge that ending it might be inevitable if the Bosnian Serbs continue shunning the peace proposal. **********Under that plan, the Serbs would be given 49 percent of Bosnia's land, considerably less than the 72 percent they now control. Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government, in federation with the Bosnian Croats, would receive the remaining 51 percent. **********The five countries known as the ""contact group"" that developed the peace plan have succeeded in persuading the Muslim-led Bosnian Government to back the plan. Not only that, but Serbia, which has long provided logistical support to the Bosnian Serbs, has thrown its weight behind the peace plan. **********Mr. Clinton's letter also expressed a fear of imperiling Washington's efforts to work hand-in-hand with its allies to end the 28-month-old civil war. **********""I believe lifting the embargo unilaterally would have serious implications going well beyond the conflict in Bosnia itself,"" he wrote. ""It could end the current negotiating process, which is bringing new pressure to bear on the Bosnian Serbs. Our relations with our Western European allies would be seriously strained and the cohesiveness of NATO threatened. Our efforts to build a mature and cooperative relationship with Russia would be damaged."" **********Many Russians support Bosnia's Serbs over its Muslims. **********Administration officials said they opposed part of Senator Nunn's proposal that would require the United States to end its cooperation in enforcing the embargo if the United Nations failed to exempt Bosnia from the embargo by Nov. 15. **********At present the United States, under NATO's aegis, works with its allies to patrol shipping into Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics. **********Last June, the House of Representatives voted to unilaterally lift the embargo, but the Senate rejected thatmeasure in a 50-50 tie vote."

Grachev, returned today from a trip to Serbia in a coordinated Russian effort to get the Bosnian Serbs to change their minds and accept the ""take it or leave it"" peace plan that they rejected last week. **********Mr. Kozyrev said the Russians decided that General Grachev, better than any diplomat, would be able to speak to Bosnian Serb military commanders, like Gen.  Ratko Mladic, in terms they would understand. **********'No One Controls Them' **********""We're trying to provide them as persuasive an argument as possible,"" Mr. Kozyrev said. ""That's what the international community wants and expects us to do, as traditional friends of the Serbs."" **********But he admitted to frustration with the Bosnian Serbs, saying, ""No one controls them."" **********The United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, which drafted the current Bosnia peace plan, have warned the Serbs that they face tighter economic sanctions, increased military pressure and a removal of the international arms embargo if they do not back the plan. **********But Western diplomats say there is reluctance on the part of the Russians, as well as the British and French, to start punishing the Serbs immediately if the  plan is rejected. That is a topic Mr. Kozyrev refused to discuss. **********Mr. Kozyrev said the Russians were offering the Bosnian Serbs another inducement to agree: a larger contingent of Russian peacekeeping troops, not only around Sarajevo but also in other areas the Serbs may specify. **********But he emphasized the Russian position, also stated by General Grachev, that  any Russian peacekeepers must be under the command of the United Nations, not NATO. ""Who on earth would commit their forces under the command of an alliance they don't belong to?"" Mr. Kozyrev said."

The most recent example was the 1992 exchange-rate crisis that resulted in the devaluation of sterling and the lira. A decade earlier, repeated devaluations of the French franc obliged the Socialists to adopt policies as conservative as their right-wing opposition. **********The so-called external constraint has always existed. **********What is new, however, is the speed with which markets react and the instantaneous transmission across borders. What's more, the United States - whose insulation from such injunctions so infuriated the French in the 1960s - is as obliged as any other nation to keep faith with investors. **********This is the result of several trends: the internationalization of capital movements, the revolution in information systems and communications technology, and the innovation in financial products - notably the complex hedging instruments used to defray the risk of changes in interest or currency rates, or prices of stocks or commodities. **********The volume and speed of the capital flows and the increased integration between markets spreading contagion in unexpected ways mean much less tolerance for governments pursuing policies that are deemed to be unstable. **********While much official attention has been focused on ways to harness the interaction of markets through possible controls on the new financial instruments, no less an expert than the head of the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements has warned that policymakers are looking at the wrong end of the problem. **********""Credible policies,"" said Andrew Crockett in the BIS annual report, are what's needed. ""What capital market innovations demonstrate is the need for stable monetary policies, implemented in a medium-term framework."" **********Elaborating in an interview, he added: ""It means that government will have to deal with unwelcome developments by making sure economic fundamentals are correct and mutually consistent across countries - and that can't be bad."" **********Richard O'Brien at American Express Bank in London puts it more pithily: ""The privilege of government is being squeezed away."" **********Alexandre Lamfalussy, who heads the European Monetary Institute, the fledgling European central bank, disputes the view that all erratic price movements are caused by policy mismanagement. Nevertheless, he agrees that ""the best way to avoid asset- market 'bubbles' is to stick to a cautious monetary policy. **********""This may not eliminate all misalignments nor significantly reduce short-term volatility,"" he said, ""but it would at least mean that monetary policy ceased to be a contributory factor to both types of disturbance."" **********But Mr. Lamfalussy also fingers the difficulty that lies ahead: ""In a world of rigid fiscal policies, international agreement on a correct configuration of policy mixes will be even harder to come by than agreement on the appropriate domestic policy mix."" **********This is one of the primeval issues in international relations, what the experts call the question of burden-sharing. Is it the nation running a balance-of-payments deficit that needs to adjust by devaluing its currency and cutting domestic demand? Or should the nation running a surplus share in the required adjustment? **********The inability to negotiate this question was the undoing of the post-war Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. The move to a system of floating exchange rates was supposed to resolve this problem, but governments quickly realized it is a mistake to leave such a key price as the exchange rate to the vagaries of the market. The issue remains as alive as ever. **********Thus, today the yen - despite heavy daily intervention by the Bank of Japan - is driven by market forces to a record high level against the dollar as Tokyo continues to run a substantial international surplus. **********But the United States, running an ever-increasing international deficit, also finds itself sanctioned by market forces. The substantial increase in long-term interest rates since the initial breakdown of trade talks with Japan in early February is an effective curb on U.S. domestic demand. **********""The assignment of the burden of adjustment is much more left to the workings of the market,"" asserts John Lipsky at Salomon Brothers in New York. **********Mr. Lipsky describes the emerging system as one where ""if all the principal countries simultaneously pursue vigorously the achievement of good domestic balance, the international problems of adjustment essentially should take care of themselves. The creation of a market-based deregulated system should aid that process because it much more quickly disciplines an individual country following idiosyncratic inflationary policies than was the case in the past."""

Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the new United Nations commander in Bosnia, in a meeting at Sarajevo airport this afternoon with leaders of both the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces and the Bosnian Serb militias. **********The accord was reached even as NATO ministers, spurred by public outrage over a mortar attack on Saturday that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo market, set a deadline of Feb. 20 for the Bosnian Serbs to end their siege of Sarajevo and threatened air strikes against their positions if the deadline is ignored. **********""This is perhaps the beginning of a process for a return to normalization for the people of Sarajevo, who have shown so much indomitable spirit,"" General Rose said in announcing the agreement.  NATO Threat Prompts Serbs **********General Rose implied that it was the looming threat of NATO air strikes that had caused the Bosnian Serbs to agree to the cease-fire plan. **********""They fully understood the serious nature of their position and the changed strategic circumstances in which they find themselves,"" he said, referring to the Bosnian Serb commanders. But the British general also cautioned, ""this is a very small start to a very large problem, and people should not read too much into it."" **********Indeed, dozens of cease-fires have come and gone here, and as darkness fell the news of the latest one was greeted with widespread cynicism among residents of the Bosnian capital. **********""I don't believe it,"" shrugged Gen. Jovan Divjak, who headed the Bosnian Government team at the talks. ""This is a trick similar to the ones that have gone before. But the U.N. is trying.""  U.N. Troops in Key Sites **********The noon cease-fire is to be followed, General Rose said, by the posting of United Nations troops at ""key positions and sensitive places"" around the city to monitor the situation and then by the collection of ""all heavy weapons and artillery."" **********The difference between this agreement and those that have gone before, the United Nations commander said, ""is the agreement by the Bosnian Serb army to withdraw their heavy weapons and to place them under U.N. control."" **********General Rose acknowledged that the agreement was not written down or signed, and that ""many details and timing and places have yet to be agreed."" But he said that the weapons turnover would cover everything over 12.7 millimeters in caliber. **********General Rose said specifics would be worked out by a joint commission headed by Brig. Gen. Andre Soubirou, a French officer who is the United Nations commander for Sarajevo. **********The Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, complaining that General Rose was ""not clear enough and not precise enough"" in his decription of the cease-fire, held a news conference tonight to spell out details of what he said were the specifics of the plan. **********Mr. Izetbegovic said the agreement called for the Serbs to turn over their heavy weapons within five days. **********""These weapons will be demobilized, gathered together, their ammunition separated, and put in several places -- we suggested some barracks -- under the control of Unprofor,"" he said, referring to the United Nations Protection Force. ""If this is not to be respected, we will consider the agreement null and void."" **********Bosnian officials said they would give their detailed maps and coordinates of Serbian positions to the United Nations on Thursday. **********General Divjak, a top Bosnian commander who is himself an ethnic Serb, says the Bosnian Serb militias have about 1,500 artillery pieces in the mountains around the city. He says there are also about 80 tanks. The Bosnian Army has few heavy weapons, but has an effective infantry. **********The Bosnian officials said the agreement called for United Nations troops to be stationed in five areas of confrontation: Zuc, Dobrinja, Grbavica, Borije and Vidikovac. **********Mr. Izetbegovic said his Government was ""not obliged"" by the agreement to turn over heavy weapons, but he said that if the Bosnian Serbs put their artillery under United Nations control, the Bosnian Government forces would ""most probably"" follow suit. **********But Bosnian officials and citizens were dubious about the cease-fire plan. Asked if the Bosnian Government had spelled out the specific details of the plan because it expected the agreement to be soon broken, the Deputy Information Minister, Senada Kreso, replied, ""Exactly."" **********""It's all talk,"" said Vice President Ejup Ganic. ""We've had hundreds and hundreds of meetings at the airport and nothing comes out of it.""  'Trying to Buy Time' **********""It's nonsense,"" said Senad Hamzic, a young man who has watched his city destroyed by the siege. ""The Serbs are just trying to buy time. Then these new threats will be forgotten just like everything else."" **********A friend added, ""Cease-fire number one zillion."" **********But General Rose, who has pledged himself to what he terms a ""more robust"" role than the one played by his predecessors as United Nations commander in Bosnia, reacted icily to journalists' skepticism this afternoon. **********""You have sketched out a whole series of hypotheticals which, I must say, come from a rather negative position,"" General Rose, a former commander of Britain's Special Operations units, told one. ""My view is we are here with a complete change of attitude and I fully intend to make this thing stick."""

Marine commanders said today that the shootings were in self-defense after the Haitian security forces brandished their weapons at the patrol. **********[ Administration officials in Washington have warned since the beginning of the Haitian operation that it was full of risks. President Clinton, after speaking Sunday at a church in Harlem, issued a statement saying, ""It must be clear that U.S. forces are prepared to respond to hostile action against them and will do so."" ] **********The only American casualty was Francis Jose, a Navy Creole-speaking interpreter who suffered a flesh wound in the leg and was evacuated to an American ship offshore for treatment. **********The marines did not stop the looting and pillaging of the main police headquarters and more than 45 minutes lapsed before American troops arrived at the military headquarters. **********At the police station, crowds crammed through the barracks, grabbing everything from electrical fuse boxes to wooden benches to tubas, and soon boys wearing the khaki caps of the military police were jauntily parading through the streets like mock soldiers. **********""This is only the beginning of the worse,"" said the owner of one of the operating bars in town. ""The pulse of Haiti is Cap-Haitien."" **********The disorder in this city of 65,000 was the most serious outbreak of violence since the United States military swept into Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien six days ago to establish order and to pave the way for a peaceful restoration of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. **********The commander of the American operation Haiti, Lieut. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, and the United States Ambassador, William L. Swing, flew here from Port-au-Prince this morning with the leader of the Haitian junta, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to discuss the shootings and the growing tensions that have turned this city into a tinder box in the past 48 hours. **********General Cedras angrily demanded the court-martial of the Marine commander here, Col. Tom Jones, but the request was summarily dismissed by American officials. **********Colonel Jones later told reporters that General Cedras was seething.  ""Cedras accused us of atrocities and demanded my transfer and court-martial,"" the colonel said. **********Marine officers here said that the disorder was largely a result of the lack of control by local Haitian commanders. All 400 of the Haitian security personnel stationed here seem to have fled the city, leaving a vacuum of power. **********But many residents questioned why the marines had failed to respond more quickly to the looting at the police barracks and the army headquarters downtown. **********The looting began when a throng, mostly young men, gathered at the tree-shaded two-story military compound about 9 o'clock this morning. **********They first routed two of the last remaining police officers in the barracks, chasing them up a dry river bed. With their courage growing, a few men in the crowd took halting steps inside the wrought iron gates of the compound and picked up rocks to hurl. Meeting little resistance, scores more coursed through the gates. Within minutes, many were triumphantly holding aloft rifles and automatic weapons. **********Marines said that hundreds of the weapons that the mob seized were later returned to American forces throughout the city. Haitians even made citizen arrests of people they said were paramilitary officers who had made threats against the American troops. **********By 10:30, the street was littered with green uniforms, sandbags and the khaki-colored hats. The shooting that set off today's rampage occurred at the police station, the headquarters of the First Military Police Company, at about 7 o'clock Saturday night. **********Marine commanders gave the following account: **********Two members of the Haitian security forces in front of the police headquarters had brandished pistols in front of a crowd of supporters of Father Aristide who were chanting anti-Cedras slogans, said Colonel Jones. **********As the taunts intensified, he said, one of the Haitian troops raised his Uzi machine gun in the direction of the Marine lieutenant who commanded the 10-man patrol. The lieutenant immediately opened fire. **********""It's hard to tell who fired first,"" said Colonel Jones. ""I hope our lieutenant shot first. There's no doubt in my mind he made the right decision to use deadly force. He saw his life in danger and took appropriate action."" **********The colonel did not identify the lieutenant but The Associated Press, quoting military sources, said his name is Virg Palumbo, 24, of Windber, Pa. **********Colonel Jones said all 10 Haitians who died belonged to either the Haitian police or to the military. Only two of the dead wore uniforms, but in recent days many members of the Haitian security forces have worn civilian clothes to prevent reprisals from angry residents. **********The commander of E Company, Capt. Rich Diddams, said the patrol had been stationed outside the police headquarters to prevent the police from beating the crowds. On Wednesday night, Haitian security forces had clubbed and fired into a crowd of Aristide supporters who were trailing two Marine trucks broadcasting messages in Creole. **********After the shooting, Colonel Jones angrily demanded that the Haitian commander here control his forces or else the Marines would. As security by the American troops tightened, the impoverished residents of Cap-Haitien took the opportunity to humiliate the police. **********Captain Diddams, the commander of E Company, said the Haitians had pointed guns at the Marines and thus set off the gunfight. He also said the Haitians fired Uzis, M-1 rifles and 30-caliber revolvers. The Marines fired back with M-16 rifles and belt-loading machine guns. **********There were some discrepancies in the details offered today by the Marine commanders. Captain Diddams said he was not sure whether the crowd's behavior had helped set off the incident. Colonel Jones said it did. Captain Diddams said the gunfight lasted only 15 seconds; Colonel Jones said it lasted about five minutes. **********The shooting Saturday night was the most serious of three incidents involving marines. **********At about 6:45 P.M. on Saturday, a Haitian-American resident who supports the military Government fired from his second-floor balcony into a crowd of Aristide supporters. The Marines detained him but he was not identified. **********About an hour after the shooting at the police station, an unidentified Haitian man pointed a shotgun at a marine on patrol at a basketball court. The marine fired at the man but missed, and the man fled. **********By this afternoon, Cap-Haitien had settled into a uneasy calm. Street lights began to return to normal but there were still signs of increased security on the part of marines. **********Some residents said they fear that the mobs that turned violent today might soon go after the wealthier citizens and supporters of the military. **********""There are a lot of people who have not been sleeping at home in their beds these past few nights"" said Prosper Cadet, 54, a taxi driver. ""They're all afraid of what could be next."" **********--------------------       2 Held in Gonaives **********PORT-AU-PRINCE, Sept. 25 (Special to The New York Times) -- In the coastal city of Gonaives, a United States Special Forces team took two men into custody late Saturday when they were seen carrying M-1 rifles, the American military spokesman in Port-au-Prince said today. **********The men are ""attaches,"" the armed civilians who supported the military government, the spokesman said. **********The men were captured during a pro-Aristide demonstration on Saturday night. **********One of the men, according to Haitian sources, was Jean Tatoune, a one-time opponent of the government who was widely disliked for going over to the military rulers and was presumed to have informed on his former colleagues."

Earnings Strong for Big Banks"," **********Several of the nation's largest banking companies, including No. 1-ranked Citicorp, reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter financial results yesterday, bolstered by growing credit demand, fewer bad loans and rising trading revenues. **********""It's turning out to be a surprisingly good quarter for the major banks,"" said James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a brokerage firm specializing in banks. ""All the big banks are exceeding or at least meeting expectations"" for earnings. **********Citicorp led the pack, reporting that its earnings had climbed 69.3 percent, well exceeding Wall Street's expectations. In response, Citicorp's shares jumped $1.25, to $44.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Net income at two other New York-based banks also exceeded expectations. The Chase Manhattan Corporation reported a 14.2 percent gain, while the Chemical Banking Corporation posted a 23.7 percent increase. To maintain its earnings momentum by cutting costs, Chase also said it would restrict its spending growth and would offer voluntary retirement to 2,600 employees. **********On the West Coast, Wells Fargo & Company also did better than expected, reporting a 31.5 percent rise in net income for the quarter. **********Of the major banks reporting results yesterday, only the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, had lower third-quarter earnings, posting a drop of 4.4 percent. Unlike many banks, Banc One came under pressure from rising interest rates in the quarter. **********Most of the major banks also reported higher-than-expected revenues in the third quarter. ""Revenue growth was a question mark going into the quarter,"" Mr. McDermott said. The perception was that the banking industry ""was facing a revenue wall during the quarter,"" he said. ""But the industry seems to have handled bumping against any revenue wall quite successfully."" **********Higher revenues at many banks resulted in part from an increase in loans. Among the large money center banks, Citicorp benefited from ""a broad-based earnings gain"" from lending, said Thomas H. Hanley, an analyst at CS First Boston. **********Citicorp is one of the world's largest banks. Analysts said the bank's 5 percent increase in loans, to $146.3 billion, was another sign of a global economic recovery. ""Credit demands are rising in some of the emerging markets"" like Brazil, said Robert Albertson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. Credit-card receivables, he said, are increasing worldwide.. **********Over all, Citicorp reported net income of $894 million, or $1.87 a share, on record revenues of $4.6 billion, excluding trading. A year earlier, Citicorp earned $528 million, or $1.06 a share. Analysts had predicted earnings of $1.30 a share in the latest quarter. **********Meanwhile, Chase earned $305 million, or $1.49 a share, beating analysts' expectations of $1.28 a share. In the quarter last year, Chase earned $267 million, or $1.25 a share. **********Expecting revenue growth in some business segments to level off in coming quarters, Chase Manhattan plans to cap expense growth at 2 percent next year. To meet that goal, Chase said it planned a voluntary retirement plan for up to 2,600 employees that should result in about $55 million in savings in 1995. **********Other major banks ""have done reasonably well with getting people to take early retirement,"" said Norman Jaffe, analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc. ""I don't see why Chase would be any different."" **********Chase said it would take an estimated $100 million pretax charge to earnings in the fourth quarter for the cutbacks. The one-time charge, Chase said, will be offset by extraordinary gains, resulting in little or no impact on earnings. **********As for the other three banks, Chemical said it earned $439 million, or $1.60 a share, besting analysts' forecasts of $1.17 to $1.46 a share.  The results exceed last year's income of $355 million, or $1.26 a share. Reported net income in last year's third quarter was $502 million, or $1.84 a share, which included some one-time gains and charges. **********Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, earned $217 million, or $3.86 a share, up from $165 million, or $2.74 a share, in the quarter a year ago. Analysts had projected earnings of $3.74 a share in the latest quarter. **********And Banc Once earned $283.2 million, or 68 cents a share, down from $296.2 million, or 73 cents a share, in the quarter last year. Analysts had expected earnings of about 81 cents a share in the latest quarter. **********While loans increased, credit quality improved for the major banks. The improvement was ""at a faster rate than thought possible,"" said Mr. Hanley, the CS First Boston analyst. **********Wells Fargo said loan charge-offs in the third quarter totaled $60 million, or 0.69 percent of average total loans, down from $121 million, or 1.42 percent of average total loans, a year earlier. **********Chase's provision for potential credit losses was $100 million in the third quarter, down from $215 million in the same quarter last year and $150 million in this year's second quarter. And Chemical's provision was $100 million, down from $268 million added in the third quarter last year and $160 million in the second quarter this year. **********The loan provisions or reserves are subtracted from earnings. The decrease in provisioning not only pushes up earnings for the quarter but also suggests that the banks are comfortable with the amount of money they have set aside to protect against future loan losses. **********Revenues for Citicorp and Chase also rose on higher trading volume. Trading revenues of $287 million at Citicorp were at the high end of ""what Citicorp calls its normal range,"" said Diane Glossman, analyst at Salomon Brothers. That was up from $71 million in the first quarter of 1994 but down from $478 million in the third quarter of 1993. Last year was a record year for trading revenues. **********At Chase, trading revenues totaled $188 million in the third quarter, compared with $186 million in the period a year earlier. While foreign exchange revenues fell to $50 million from $93 million, global capital markets trading and underwriting revenues rose to $114 million from $25 million in the year-ago quarter. **********Aside from the surge in Citicorp's shares, the stocks of the other banks were mixed in New York Stock Exchange trading. Chase shares rose 75 cents to close at $35.75. Chemical shares were unchanged at $37.625. Wells Fargo shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $149.375. And Banc One shares hit a 52-week low of $27.75 before rising later in the day to close at $28, down 87.5 cents."

""The bus seemed to be lifted into the air. The roof flew. The place looked like a battlefield."" **********Responsibility for the attack was taken by Islamic militants from the Hamas organization, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed angrily tonight to crack down on the group and ""wage a battle to the bitter end."" **********Mr. Rabin did not spell out what actions he had in mind, saying he would raise them with his Cabinet ministers at an emergency meeting on Thursday, but he suggested that some proposals would bring objections from civil-rights advocates. **********""I think that ways need to be found for Hamas suicide attackers to know that not only they may be killed by their actions but that their homes and the homes of their families may be damaged,"" he said in a television interview held a few hours after he had cut short a visit to Britain and returned to Israel. **********He also raised the possibility of arrests for long periods without formal charges, a procedure known as administrative detention. **********""We, the executive arm, must be allowed by the legislative arm to use the tools that will enable us to combat terrorism of such a radical nature,"" the Prime Minister said. ""They are not in our hands today."" **********In December 1992 -- after several Israeli servicemen were killed in attacks not nearly as deadly as the one today -- the army rounded up more than 400 suspected Hamas members and supporters and deported them to Lebanon, an action that led to worldwide condemnation of Israel and backfired on Mr. Rabin by increasing Palestinian support for Islamic militants. **********In a macabre touch, loudspeakers over mosques in the Gaza Strip announced today that the bus attack in Tel Aviv was carried out using techniques that radicals had learned during their yearlong exile in Lebanon. **********Israeli police commanders said the attack was similar in major respects to a Hamas suicide bombing that killed eight Israelis in April in the northern town of Afula. **********A considerable amount of explosives was used -- an estimated 20 to 40 pounds, police officials said -- enough to blow apart the bus, shatter windows and wound passengers on a bus that was passing from the opposite direction, and injure passers-by on Dizengoff Street. The blast was so powerful that parts of bodies ""reached the top floors of buildings,"" said Gabi Last, the city's police chief. **********Mr. Last said a woman who had got off the bus a few stops before the bomb went off later reported having seen a man in his 30's sitting in the fourth or fifth row with a large bag. If her memory was correct and if the man indeed had a bomb in the bag, it would be consistent with the fact that the most severe damage was in the front of the bus. **********But nothing was certain, including, Mr. Rabin said, whether the bomber had come from the Gaza Strip, under Palestinian rule, or from the West Bank, which except for Jericho is under Israeli control. **********Despite anger here over the bombing, Israeli officials said they would pursue peace negotiations with Yasir Arafat and his Palestine Liberation Organization, arguing that the P.L.O. had as much interest as they in isolating Hamas and in reinforcing Palestinian self-rule in Gaza. **********Hamas wants Israelis to ""lose our heads and stop the peace process,"" Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said tonight, adding, ""No way on earth."" **********""As immersed as we are in our grief, that is how much we should be determined to continue the peace process,"" Mr. Peres said. **********There certainly will be no effect, other officials said, on the peace treaty with Jordan that Israel initialed this week in Amman and that is to be signed at the border next week with President Clinton on hand. **********But the officials added that they could not be blind to the rage building among Israelis after a series of Hamas attacks, which in the last 10 days have included a raid on a night-life area of Jerusalem that killed two people and the kidnap-killing of an Israeli soldier that traumatized the country. **********""It's very clear,"" a person close to the Prime Minister said, ""that a couple of more events like this and there's no more peace process."" **********Apparently concerned about the latest turn of events, and under continuing pressure from Israel to get tough with Hamas in Gaza, Mr. Arafat deplored the Tel Aviv attack, phoning Mr. Peres to deliver his condemnation personally. It was his most unequivocal attack on a Palestinian terrorist act. **********In a statement issued in Gaza, the P.L.O. leader, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last week along with Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres, said: **********""Pushing forward with the peace process and implementing the rest of the agreement is the only way to respond to the enemies of peace who are getting their support, their training and financing from well-known outside parties."" The reference to outside support was to Iran. **********Other officials in the Palestinian Authority, which now governs Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, added their condemnations, as did world leaders including President Clinton, Pope John Paul II and the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. **********But not everyone in Gaza was appalled by the carnage. **********Ibrahim Yazouri, a Hamas founder, compared the Tel Aviv bombing to the Hebron massacre in the West Bank last February, when an Israeli settler gunned down 29 Palestinians at prayer and wounded dozens more. ""This is a natural outcome of the Israeli occupation and its oppression of the Palestinians,"" he said. And a Gaza City grocer, Ibrahim Shurafa, said: ""Everybody's pleased. The Israeli civilian is like the Israeli soldier. They all serve in the army."" **********As often occurs after killings inside Israel, the army sealed off Gaza and the West Bank in the hope of improving Israelis' sense of security but at the same time keeping Palestinian laborers from reaching jobs. **********Lieut. Gen. Ehud Barak, the army Chief of Staff, suggested that the territorial closing could last a long time. But Mr. Rabin called the measure a short-term solution, saying that the real answer lay in expanding peace arrangements with the P.L.O. and taking off ""the kid gloves"" against Hamas. **********For Israelis, the last few days have amounted to life in a whipsaw, between elation over events like the treaty with Jordan and despair over acts like the bus attack. **********This is a country familiar with terrorism. But rarely has there been a death toll as high as the one today, and certainly none since 37 Israelis were killed and 82 others wounded in 1978 when Arab gunmen infiltrated from the Mediterranean, attacking a coastal highway north of Tel Aviv. **********""This is a peace agreement?"" said Chaim Jerach, who owns a games arcade around the corner from the bombing today. ""Heads are rolling in the street, and this is peace?"" **********The opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited the scene, asserted that Mr. Rabin was ""personally responsible"" for a wave of Palestinian attacks that has led to more than 80 Israeli deaths since the agreement with the P.L.O. was signed in September 1993. Specifically, Mr. Netanyahu blamed the Prime Minister for opening the Gaza Strip, which was ordered closed last week after the kidnapping of the soldier. **********Anti-Rabin demonstrations were held in various parts of the country tonight, including Jerusalem, where the police reportedly arrested 18 protesters."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/business/patents-hand-held-zip-code-imprinters-for-public-could-help-send-letters.html,Sabra Chartrand,1994-10-24,,1018,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Patents; Hand-held ZIP Code Imprinters for the Public Could Help Send Letters Speeding on Their Way,Patents; Hand-held ZIP Code Imprinters for the Public Could Help Send Letters Speeding on Their Way," **********MILLIONS of letters surge every day through the Postal Service's automated sorting machines, which scan ZIP codes to direct the mail around the country. James Kinstrey and Reynaldo Mustafa work with those sorters, watching some letters scoot through easily while others are spit out and rerouted for costly manual processing. **********The culprit is handwriting. About 30 percent of letters have scribbled ZIP codes that the machines cannot read. So the two men have patented a hand-held stamp that will let people imprint ZIP codes on envelopes in bar code. **********""Almost all companies doing any kind of business-reply mail use envelopes that are preprinted with bar codes,"" Mr. Kinstrey said. **********The scanners are also pretty good at reading typed ZIP codes. But they reject illegible handwriting, leaving a postal worker to key in those numbers by hand. That task costs about $600 million a year, Mr. Kinstrey said. The Postal Service says it would like most mail to carry bar codes by the end of the century. **********Mr. Kinstrey said he and Mr. Mustafa developed their bar-code stamper after a staff meeting three years ago at the Monmouth Processing and Sorting Center in Eatontown, N.J. Managers urged employees to help solve the sorting problems by telling their friends and relatives to type envelopes. In the meantime, the Postal Service was planning a new system of cameras, computer networks and satellite relays to process illegible ZIP codes. **********""When we walked out of that meeting, we said this is really stupid -- they're not addressing the problem where it begins,"" Mr. Kinstrey remembered. ""People don't have typewriters for envelopes. The Post Office shouldn't be spending all this money on video cameras and computer equipment."" **********Instead, he and Mr. Mustafa designed a lightweight, hand-held stamper that turns ZIP codes into the black lines of bar code. The invention has a manual version that looks like a traditional date stamp, with columns of rotating numbers from zero to nine. A user turns the thumb wheels to line up the ZIP code of choice across the top of the stamp. The numbers are rendered in bar code on the bottom, which is inked and pressed against the envelope. Another version has a microchip that lets users punch in a ZIP code number to establish the bar code. **********""Binary code uses three long bars and two short bars for each number,"" Mr. Kinstrey explained. ""So there are five bars on each band for each number."" **********Letter writers can stamp the bar code anywhere on an envelope. The most efficient code is the increasingly common nine-digit ZIP code -- giving city, neighborhood and street information -- but the traditional five-digit city ZIP code also helps to speed processing. **********Mr. Kinstrey and Mr. Mustafa presented their invention to the Postal Rate Commission three months ago, but have yet to hear what the agency thought of it. **********The two postal workers received patent 5,339,734. An Odorless Way Of Testing Diapers **********How do diaper manufacturers test new products? **********Not necessarily with teams of volunteer babies. **********What scientists have spent considerable time and money to come up with is synthetic feces. And now they are patented. **********The invention belongs to the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the Dallas-based company that makes, among other things, diapers, training pants, incontinence garments and baby wipes. The papers that go into those products have to be tested for strength, absorbency and comfort. So ideally, researchers subject them to lab tests that mimic the burdens imposed on diapers by babies. **********""But the technicians have some objection to handling the real thing,"" explained Richard Yeo, a senior research scientist who developed the synthetic compound with another Kimberly-Clark researcher, Debra Welchel. ""The real thing is a form of biologically hazardous material. Also, it's a bit difficult to obtain, even from infants."" **********Technicians tried to get around the problem by using mashed potatoes, peanut butter or canned pumpkin pie mix. Messy, yes, but apparently not chemically accurate enough for science. The foods broke down too quickly, their liquids and solids separating faster than human wastes tend to do. **********""We had some fundamental studies of real feces, so we knew what properties we needed,"" Mr. Yeo said. ""So we developed a synthetic one as close to the real thing as possible. There's no odor -- the technicians wouldn't consent to work on a project like that -- and it can be any color we want."" **********The compound comes in a dry mix to which water is added for the desired consistency. The mix is made up of water-soluble components like polyvinyls, starches, natural gums and gelatins and insoluble ones like fibers and resins. It is usually brown. Kimberly-Clark is making the compound for its labs and has no plans to sell it to anybody else. **********Mr. Yeo and Ms. Welchel received patent 5,356,626. Showering in a Spray That Includes Soap **********Add Nicholas Conte's shower dispenser to the list of gadgets intended to make life easier. A plastic box with separate reservoirs for soap, shampoo and hair conditioner, the dispenser attaches to shower pipes between the wall where the pipe comes out and the shower head. **********""All you do is turn on the shower water, adjust the temperature and flow, and then turn a knob to start drawing soap into the shower head,"" Mr. Conte explained. The user presets the soap-to-water ratio; suction created by the water passing over each reservoir aperture draws the soap or shampoo into the flow. **********""Turn the dial again if you want to rinse with pure water,"" said Mr. Conte, a funeral home director in Jersey City. ""If you want shampoo, turn to the shampoo setting."" **********Mr. Conte said that with a prototype of his invention he used half a gallon of liquid soap every month for daily showering and shampooing. He would like to see his dispenser installed in homes, gymnasiums, hotels and hospitals. It received patent 5,351,892."

But now that the opposition has cracked under pressure to reduce the Federal budget deficit, true believers are beginning to realize that the job is only half done: design of the spectrum auction may prove almost as difficult as establishing the principle. **********Last month the Federal Communications Commission offered tentative thoughts on how space on the spectrum for ""personal communications services"" -- a souped-up version of cellular phones -- would be sold. And in the view of Chuck Jackson, a communications consultant at Strategic Policy Research Inc. in Maryland, the F.C.C. has done its homework. ""The caliber of input from economists was remarkably high,"" he concluded. But the route to a well-managed auction still has more than a few potholes. **********Truly embarrassing missteps are unlikely, saysJohn McMillan, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, because other countries have already made them. **********Consider the pioneering effort by New Zealand in the late 1980's. By one respectable (if unintuitive) theory, the best way to get bidders to reveal what winning is really worth to them is to award the prize to the highest bidder -- but charge the winner the price bid by the second-highest. That way, points out Vernon Smith of the University of Arizona, it does bidders no good to try to ""game"" the auction by guessing what the competition is doing and bidding just a tad higher. **********New Zealand tried this ""second price"" strategy in the late 1980's in a sealed-bid auction for television and cellular phone licenses, only to find that in a handful of cases the second-highest bids were frivolously low -- as little as a few dollars. The moral: While the method did insure that the bidders who valued the licenses the most got them, ""reserve"" or minimum bids are needed to generate revenue if bidders are scarce. **********Australia faced a parallel fiasco last year when it auctioned two separate licenses for direct-broadcast satellite television, only to discover that neither winner had any intention of paying the full price. Each had made dozens of bids at sequentially lower figures, with the plan of defaulting on all but the lowest figure needed to win. And since the Government had made no provision for penalties for defaults on bids, this strategy worked like a charm. **********The most difficult problem faced by Washington is how to hold an auction when the value of a license depends on the ability to serve adjacent localities as well. Indeed, it is no secret that a half-dozen companies are aiming to provide nationwide service or none at all. **********One solution would be to auction preassembled national packages. That, however, would close the bidding to all but the deepest pockets and preclude assembly of custom-tailored combinations intended to mesh personal communications system markets with existing cellular phone markets. **********The straightforward solution would be a simultaneous auction in which all parties could bid for any or all localities, withdrawing bids as their strategies changed in response to the competition. But this might take a very long time. In fact, there would be no obvious end, since every bid could lead to a new round of bid withdrawals and rebidding. **********The rules announced reflect a variety of compromises. In recognition of the interdependence problem, licenses for the largest markets will be auctioned simultaneously. Smaller markets, considered less vital in assembling networks, will be auctioned sequentially to save time and reduce complexity. But the F.C.C. is reserving the right to stop after a fixed number of rounds in the simultaneous auction. And those who withdraw bids will be forced to pay a penalty equal to the difference between the withdrawn bid and the final auction price, if the latter is lower. **********Yet to be decided is how much information should be made public in the midst of the bidding. Full disclosure sounds right on general principles. But the F.C.C. staff, worried that truly transparent bidding might facilitate collusion or encourage a predator to knock a poorly financed competitor out of the game, is urging a compromise: continuing disclosure of the high bids, but not the bidders' names. **********Will the auctions, likely early in 1995, be free of surprises? Probably not: the sale of rights to use technology that is changing rapidly cannot be entirely predictable. **********""But don't lose sight of the big picture,"" cautions Peter Pitsch, a consultant and former adviser to the F.C.C. chairman. ""An auction is bound to be better than the alternatives"" of giving away licenses by lottery or awarding them to the best lobbyists."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/world/japanese-chief-due-in-the-us-faces-impasse.html,David Sanger,1994-02-10,,1625,,The New York Times,World,News,article,"Japanese Chief, Due in the U.S., Faces 'Impasse'","Japanese Chief, Due in the U.S., Faces 'Impasse'"," **********From the first time they met seven months ago, a new American President and Japan's most prominent reformer, Bill Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa agreed that their countries needed a radically new way to deal with each other. **********Neither Washington nor Tokyo could afford to continue the bickering, stonewalling and threats of retaliation, they said, that have gradually poisoned the trade relations between the two countries for a decade. Aides of both men kept talking enthusiastically about their special bond, two young Southern governors, both with a mandate for reform and a common outlook on the world. This time, everyone said, things would be different. Everything at 'an Impasse' **********But just a day before Prime Minister Hosokawa flies off for his first trip to Washington -- the White House, Capitol Hill and Georgetown University in 36 hours -- very few are talking that way anymore. After three weeks of lurching from one crisis to another that threatened to oust him from office, Mr. Hosokawa admitted to Japanese reporters today that the negotiations over carrying out a broad new ""framework"" for trade relations between the two countries had gotten nowhere. **********""Everything has come to an impasse,"" he said. The two sides have yet to move beyond a fundamental disagreement on how to measure progress -- an issue that was papered over in July, left for later resolution. **********Later has arrived. In a frenzy of last minute activity, Mr. Hosokawa sent a secret envoy, Akitane Kiuchi, a former ambassador to several countries, to see President Clinton late Tuesday to plead for more time. His presence was disclosed by American officials. The Prime Minister's intentions are good, Mr. Kiuchi said, but his coalition Government is in such chaos than he cannot yet deliver. **********American officials say the special envoy had been politely told by both Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore that six months of negotiations had been plenty of time for the Japanese Government to get its house in order. Mr. Kiuchi, a close friend and adviser of the Prime Minister's, rushed back to Tokyo early today in time to brief Mr. Hosokowa before he departs for Washington and the summit meeting Friday with Mr. Clinton. **********American officials said that when Mr. Kiuchi first met with Mr. Gore on Monday and appealed for more time, Mr. Gore looked at his watch and responded with an innocent smile: ""Why? He has four days."" **********Last night, Mr. Kiuchi was brought into the Oval Office for a meeting with Mr. Clinton. He told the President that Mr. Hosokawa ""agrees with you"" on the need to deregulate Japanese markets, provide more consumer choice, stimulate the Japanese economy and generally open markets to more competition. Achievements Cited **********Mr. Kiuchi pointed out that Mr. Hosokawa had already opened Japan's previously closed rice market, begun political reform, opened the construction market and last week moved to stimulate the economy with a tax cut. **********The envoy insisted that the Prime Minister ""can only take on so many battles at once,"" according to an American official. Therefore, he appealed to Mr. Clinton not to turn the summit into a confrontation, or bring excessive pressure on Mr. Hosokawa, who is already sinking in popularity at home. **********American officials said Mr. Clinton's response was that ""sometimes in a great relationship you achieve more by disagreeing"" and facing up to your disagreements than by papering them over. The President also argued that the Japanese leader should be aligning himself with the Japanese public, and indirectly with the United States, in pressing for sweeping change. **********Mr. Kiuchi was politely sent packing, reminded that for months now Mr. Clinton has sent envoys of his own to Tokyo to urge the political leadership to get involved in the talks and overrule the country's powerful, turf-protecting bureaucrats. ""They still didn't get the message,"" an American official here said. Each Wants Concessions **********Both the Prime Minister and Mr. Clinton appear to be counting on a last-minute concession from the other that can keep the talks from becoming what editorial cartoonists here were picturing today as an impending train wreck. Mr. Hosokawa has already survived two near misses in a month, and has proven that he is the master of the last-minute compromise, an art that is highly valued in Japanese brinkmanship. But there are doubts among his advisers that he can sidestep this one. **********Tonight, Mr. Hosokawa sent another envoy, Tsutomu Hata, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, in hopes that on Thursday he can patch something together. **********But by Friday in Washington, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa will face a choice: to word their way around the disagreements, or face a confrontation with his most important ally and second-biggest trading partner. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has already said he would rather have no deal than a bad one. ""We will not settle for anything cosmetic,"" he vowed during a visit here two weeks ago. **********Already senior Japanese officials are urging the Administration to look at Mr. Hosokawa's intentions rather than his results so far. ""He won't be able to say 'I have done this,' "" a senior Japanese official said the other day. ""Instead, he will have to say 'I tried.' "" Japan Cites Security Issues **********Fearful that the White House is focused exclusively on trade, Japanese officials are again warning of the need to give equal weight to security issues in Asia and the ""global cooperation"" programs between the two countries, in AIDS research, space and other scientific pursuits. A top official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry went so far the other day as to warn that a breach in the Japanese-American relationship would be the wrong signal to send North Korea, at a time of growing tension over nuclear inspections. **********""It is important not to let the assessment of the framework agreement affect the other dimensions of the relationship,"" said Yukio Sato, who oversees the Government's relations with North America. **********Efforts to change the subject have clearly frustrated the American Ambassador here, Walter F. Mondale. Mr. Mondale arrived in Tokyo brimming with ideas about how to get the two countries out of their rut of charge and countercharge, in which one trade barrier is eliminated and another magically pops to the surface. But after a few months of receiving promises from senior Japanese politicians that they would step in to overrule the bureaucrats, Mr. Mondale is still waiting. **********""We get in there and they say there is no problem, their market is open,"" he said recently. ""If that's the case, why are we negotiating?"" **********In word, if not yet in deed, Mr. Hosokawa has embraced an agenda once put forth by Japan's critics: He wants radical deregulation, a shift of power from producers to consumers, and a country that buys car parts and insurance and banking services on the basis of price and quality, rather than corporate or political relationships. **********In practice, Mr. Hosokawa is greatly hamstrung. He has repeatedly backed down from his ambitious goals -- first on reforming the political system, then on a stimulus package to spur a recession-bound economy -- because of rebellions among the Socialists, the biggest party in his coalition. In the end he has been forced to ally himself with the Liberal Democrats or the bureaucrats, the forces he had vowed to defeat. **********Mr. Hosokawa's first love, like Mr. Clinton's, seems to be domestic politics. Dealing with the country's $50 billion trade surplus is guaranteed to be a political nightmare at home, and he often seems detached from the details, leaving it to the trade negotiators. **********The framework talks are the latest incarnation of an old idea: to find a comprehensive approach to bringing down the trade gap, mixing broad economic techniques -- mostly to encourage Japanese consumers to buy more imports -- with specific attention to key industries and markets. But the United States insisted from the start that they quantify the results, something that was missing from the last effort, the Bush Administration's awkwardly named ""structural impediments initiative."" **********Japan rejected that idea, with an argument that makes perfect economic sense: One cannot set ""targets"" for America's share of the market without abandoning free-market principles. For days at the Tokyo summit meeting last summer there were heated arguments about how to set targets without managing trade. Mr. Miyazawa and Mr. Clinton retired to the sushi bar at the Hotel Okura. 'Objective Criteria' Undefined **********A few hours later, as Japanese bureaucrats still argued bitterly among themselves, the two countries announced a new system in which ""objective criteria"" would be used to measure progress in some key problem areas: autos and auto parts, which make up three-quarters of the trade deficit; insurance, intellectual property rights and government purchases of telecommunications equipment and medical technology. The agreement calls for a meeting every six months between the President and the Prime Minister, to insure that political pressure to make progress remains at a consistently high level. **********The problem is that the ""objective criteria"" were never defined, and Japan and the United States have spent six months and untold millions of dollars arguing over what they mean. **********Japan now says that agreement was a huge mistake it will never make again. Failure to meet even ""informal"" targets invite American threats of retaliation. The only acceptable indicators, the Japanese insist, are historical ones. How many right-hand drive cars did Detroit produce last year for Japanese roads? How many seminars did Japanese car makers hold for their American suppliers? **********""That's how far the distrust has come,"" a senior Japanese official mused recently. ""We're counting car bumpers."""

Progress toward an integrated international investment market for small investors has suffered another setback with the recent decision by U.S. discount broker Charles Schwab to stop marketing U.S.-registered mutual funds in Britain. **********The Schwab move raises some difficult issues for an international fund industry that is trying to retain credibility as the best medium for investors seeking exposure to global share and bond markets. **********The first and principal difficulty is how to live with the difference between a fund's legal status and the way it is marketed. This dilemma poses problems for regulator and fund-provider alike. **********For regulators, the legal status of a fund is the subject of an international power play. The chief U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, appears to believe that it is the best in the business at keeping a watchful eye on what happens in the markets while allowing for the cut and thrust of normal commerce. **********It may be right to think itself better than the competition, but that may say more about the poor quality of international regulation than the merits of the SEC. **********In any event, one consequence of the SEC's perceived excellence is its wish to impose its own standards in share and fund regulation as the international norm. There is considerable resistance to this from other regulators intent on keeping their domestic legal structures and using information-sharing agreements to police the markets. **********If agreement on standard forms for investment vehicles is a long way away, however, finding a common marketing strategy is not even a speck on the investment horizon. And while the U.K. authorities' disapproval of Schwab's sales technique is indeed a setback for the industry and its investors, the real question concerns what really caused the problem. **********Was it Schwab's marketing, or the fact that its funds were SEC-registered?"

Overly generous regulators have allowed the Bells to increase their rates of return to levels that are twice as high as long-term interest rates. Yet, the Consumer Federation of America says that in 1992 alone, the Bells managed to overcharge customers by $5 billion. **********The hope behind this regulatory generosity was to give the monopolies greater incentives to invest in their core local networks. Where did the money go? Mostly into investments that had nothing to do with the Bells' principal obligation to provide local service. In fact, for every $1 of net new investment in the local network, the Bells have invested $13 in nontraditional activities. Their spending on the local telephone network has actually declined over the decade from 80 percent of cash flow, to 65 percent. **********Now comes yet another study examining the Bells' announced plans to finally upgrade their local networks and pave the last mile from the information superhighway to America's homes. But the consumer federation and groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Council of La Raza have accused the regional Bells of engaging in ""electronic red-lining"" by focusing only on affluent neighborhoods. **********Any monopolist under attack will try to deflect attention by striking out at other parties. And so, through Kenneth G. Robinson, a hired consultant and lobbyist, the Bells have lashed out at AT&T, MCI and Sprint, accusing them of being cozy competitors. **********In fact, while Americans are reaping the benefits of competition in long distance, including huge investments in new technologies and huge improvements in call quality, they enjoy none of these benefits with regard to local telephone services. A decade after the breakup of the AT&T, the regional Bells still control close to 100 percent of their local service markets. **********Congress is considering legislation that will revamp telecommunications policy. MCI can't support anything less than full competition in all markets. We will welcome the regional Bells into long-distance services -- as long as they give up their monopolies first. But until that happens, they can and will take unfair advantage of their stranglehold on the local market to abuse customers and competitors. BERT C.

And bonds posted modest gains early in the session on the well-behaved data. **********But on second thought, the new data apparently did not provide convincing enough proof of restrained inflation to bring buyers into the market in meaningful numbers. Traders said that instead traders used the bounce in prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, to sell Treasuries and cut the early rally short. 30-Year Bond Issue Down **********The 30-year bond, while still in the middle of its most recent trading range, was down 19/32 by late in the day to 8727/32 to yield 7.26 percent, up from 7.20 percent on Tuesday. Selling was also evident in intermediate- term notes, where the 5.125 percent two-year note due March 1996 is trading at a price to yield 5.41 percent, up from 5.38 percent, and the 5.875 percent five-year notes due March 1999 was at a price to yield 6.46 percent, up from 6.40 percent. **********""While today's consumer price and retail sales data were moderate, the point is that they are still up,"" said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities. **********""While retail sales were considerably lower than the consensus forecast, the fact is that over the last 12 months retail sales have only declined in one month and that was in weather-affected January,"" Mr. Fine added. ""Not only that, but retail sales growth for the past 12 months is a shade under 9 percent. That's good growth."" **********Economists had generally expected increases of two-tenths of one percent in the overall Consumer Price Index and a thrre-tenths of a percent increase in the core rate, which excludes food and energy prices. The core rate was up three-tenths of 1 percent. On Tuesday the Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent. **********Retail sales last month were also up four-tenths of 1 percent excluding automobiles. February's figures were revised to show increases of 1.6 percent over all and 1.3 percent excluding autos. **********A number of investors and dealers said the collection of data continued to reflect moderate economic growth against a backdrop of some consumer retraint. And while the Consumer Price Index yesterday may have suggested that inflation remains in a holding pattern, it is not any worse, or any better, they said. **********Analysts at MMS International saw yesterday's retail sales figures as a confirmation of a slowing in activity through the first quarter that will depress gross domestic product growth through the first half of the year and should deflate the myth of an accelerating economy that has dogged the market since the fourth quarter of last year. Acceleration in the Economy **********""The bears in the market must come to grips with the fact that talk of further acceleration in the economy in the first quarter was greatly exaggerated,"" said James C. Hale, a fixed-income analyst at MMS. **********Also weighing on the market have been expectations of another rise in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve. Analysts said investor concern might have been turned up a notch following a Market News Service report in which an unnamed Fed source was quoted as saying that the weaker than expected retail sales and the moderate price data do not eliminate the possibility of another rise in interest rates soon. The Fed has already raised its short-term interest target twice this year, moving it to 3.50 percent from 3 percent. **********In the municipal bond market, prices of tax-exempt issues, like Treasuries, gave up early gains. But the speed of the reversal surprised some traders. **********The City of Atlanta sold $272 million in airport revenue bonds before the market turned sour near midday. **********The bonds were initially priced to yield as much as 6.35 percent for an issue due in 2021, with the demand good enough to lower yields by 10 basis points on some maturities. **********Underwriters led by Merril Lynch said the financing was triple-A rated by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's because it was insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation."

But the German Government immediately challenged the Russian denial, saying Bonn had clear evidence of Russian manufacture for some of the highly enriched, weapons-grade contraband. **********Germany said three separate shipments of weapons-grade nuclear material from the former Soviet bloc had been seized within the last four months. Last week in Munich, German officials arrested three non-Russian couriers on a flight from Moscow with what the officials said was 300 to 350 grams, or 10.6 to 12.3 ounces, of plutonium 239. Conflicting reports have said the amount was as little as 7 grams and as much as 500 grams. **********But Russian officials continued today to deny that any plutonium 239 was missing, and some are suggesting to Russian news agencies that the West is trying to undermine Russia's commercial position and reputation for reliability. **********""The ministry can now officially say we have had no thefts of plutonium 239,"" Georgi Kaurov, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Ministry, said at a news conference today. ""Very recently we carried out an inventory of all sources linked to plutonium, and we registered no thefts or losses of plutonium 239."" 'No Contact' From Germans **********Mr. Kaurov also said, ""We have had no contact from German specialists, Government or firms, so we have nothing to react to."" **********But Mr. Kaurov's denial was immediately challenged in Bonn by the German Government spokesman, Norbert Schaefer, who told reporters that Germany had already sent Moscow a detailed analysis of a sample of weapons-grade plutonium seized in May. **********""The laboratory tests show the material originated in Russia, and I'm told that they allow conclusions to be drawn about the laboratory it comes from,"" Mr. Schaefer said. **********But Vladimir Tomarovsky, a spokesman for the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, the domestic branch of the former K.G.B., told the Interfax news agency today that the May seizure of some six grams of plutonium 239 had been traced to Bulgaria, not Russia. Kohl's Letter to Yeltsin **********Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, has exchanged letters with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on the issue, and is sending his intelligence coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, to Moscow this week. Mr. Schmidbauer will bring an analysis of the plutonium seized last week. **********Russia is not believed to have a single agency that monitors stockpiles of nuclear materials from all sources, with the Atomic Energy Ministry and Defense Ministry keeping their own accounts. **********Russia has been defensive on the issue of its nuclear materials, and Russian officials have emphasized that they are not responsible for material that originates in other countries of the former Soviet Union. They have said that at least 50 criminal cases are pending over the thefts of lower-grade radioactive materials, mostly from medical centers and welding machines. But they say no weapons-grade material is missing. **********Some Russian officials have also questioned the German motivations in disclosing the smuggling. Unnamed Russian ""nuclear experts"" and officials told Interfax today that ""it is no coincidence"" that all these ""so-called nuclear smuggling incidents"" are coming from Germany, ""where a strong black market in radioactive materials exists."" Commercial Rivalry? **********Interfax's experts also suggested that the Germans were trying to undermine Russia's ability to compete on world nuclear markets, as well as create the impression that ""Russia, in its current state, is not capable of independently controlling its nuclear potential."" **********Still, Mr. Tomarovsky, the intelligence spokesman, said Russia would happily take part with Bonn in any investigation of the smuggled materials. ""But first we must have something concrete,"" he said. ""In all countries with military potential, including Russia, a system has been established to monitor the storage and use of radioactive materials, especially weapons-grade ones. Within the framework of this system we are ready to examine any fact, so long as it is proven beforehand."" **********Mr. Kaurov also promised cooperation, but said there was only speculation about the source of the smuggled material. **********""Our specialists do not have trustworthy information about the exact amount of confiscated plutonium,"" he said. ""First they talked about 500 grams, then 250 grams, then 7 grams of plutonium. They said it was from Chelyabinsk, Tomsk or Krasnoyarsk, then the papers said it came from Bulgaria. The German side has to produce some material so we can discuss it."""

But they haven't acquired a taste for that American staple, the corn chip, a failing that the king of salty-snack marketers, Pepsico Inc., is now out to remedy. **********Pepsi, the owner of Frito-Lay, will officially introduce Doritos to Britain today. It is spending $9 million on advertising and promotion to do so, more than half of it on a television campaign from BBDO New York that is scheduled to begin in the next few weeks, not to mention another $18 million it spent to build a state-of-the-art corn chip factory. **********Pepsi and its British snack-food subsidiary, Walkers Smiths Snack Foods Ltd., have high hopes for Doritos in Britain, a nation whose per capita consumption of potato chips, or crisps as they are known here, almost matches that of the United States. **********But Britain is merely a test-bed for Pepsi's real dream: transforming the snack food industry from a highly fragmented business dominated by local favorites into one dominated by global brands that can be packaged and advertised much the same way anywhere, just like, say, Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola, with all the economies of scale that would bring. **********After Doritos could come global campaigns for Pepsi-owned products like Cheetos cheese puffs, Ruffles potato chips and 3D's, a snack product developed by Pepsi and General Mills in Europe. **********Or, in the marketing jargon used by Christopher A. Sinclair, the president of Pepsico Foods and Beverages International, ""If we can get three or four major global platforms on the brand front, that's where we can really build the franchise."" **********Pepsi's international sales of snack foods, he said, could triple over the next 5 to 10 years, to $13.5 billion annually from $4.5 billion currently. **********Pepsi has invested heavily in its international snacks business, spending $1.5 billion in recent years to acquire local manufacturers and distributors, including $600 million for Walkers Smiths, the leading crisp maker in Britain. **********Because local tastes and snacking habits vary so much, Pepsi has largely viewed each market as distinct and has done little to send its brands across borders. But now the company is taking the next step in the belief that adroit product development and marketing can create brands with international appeal. **********Britain, for example, is potato-chip crazy. Consumers eat 5.28 pounds of potato chips per capita each year in Britain, and are the closest rivals on that front to Americans, who gobble 6.16 pounds of potato chips per person. Yet while Americans eat another 6.16 pounds each of corn chips every year, the British eat almost none. **********Wondering if that void could be filled, Pepsi and Walkers Smiths spent several years testing corn chips. They found that the British liked corn chips just fine, as long as they were cut slightly thinner than Americans are accustomed to -- more like the potato chips the British are used to -- and as long as they were flavored to British tastes. **********If Pepsi has learned a single important lesson from its experience with Doritos in Britain, in fact, it is that even global snack-food brands have to be adapted somewhat to local tastes. **********""We could not simply copy the Doritos mix, we had to treat it as a new product opportunity,"" said Martin Glenn, the director of new product development for Walkers Smiths. **********But Pepsi is betting that advertising and packaging will be transferable across borders. The BBDO New York campaign that will begin for Doritos in several weeks will also be seen soon in the United States. Mr. Sinclair declined to disclose details, other than to describe the theme as ""cutting loose or letting loose"" with Doritos. **********The new packaging developed for British consumers is also expected to become the standard for the brand as it is gradually introduced in other markets around the world. Moreover, the packaging is being test-marketed in the United States, and Mr. Sinclair said it would probably be adopted there as well."

But investors remain mindful that the central bank may have more stones to throw. **********Short-covering in early trading helped to move Treasury prices up off their early lows, as the release of February merchandise trade data caused some economists to shave their estimates for economic growth in the first quarter of this year. **********The Government said that the February trade gap widened to $12.36 billion, from a revised $10.17 billion in January. Including a surplus in services exports, the total trade gap expanded to $9.71 billion, from a revised $6.64 billion shortfall in January, the report showed. **********Some economists said the bigger deficit suggested that the net export sector could turn out to be more of a drag on first-quarter growth than people were expecting. **********""I think there will be considerable slowing going into the second quarter,"" Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities, said. **********By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 17/32 , to 8622/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.36 percent, from 7.41 percent on Monday. Shorter-maturity bills were mixed, with a three-month bill rate at 3.74 percent, down from 3.76 percent the previous day, and a six-month bill 4.20 percent, down from 4.21 percent. A one-year bill rose to 4.66 percent from 4.63 percent. **********Traders think the overall bearish sentiment will continue to weigh on bond prices ahead of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting on May 17, when most market participants expect another credit tightening and possibly an increase in the Fed's discount rate, which is now 3 percent. **********""As you get close to 4 percent, 4.50 percent, people will begin wonder how far you have to go,"" Mr. Canelo said. **********Comments by Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, were taken by many traders as another indication that the Fed would raise its target for short-term interest rates again in the near future. Monday's move raised it a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.75 percent. **********Traders and analysts said Mr. Parry mentioned that the Fed's goal was inflation near zero, and that the economy was likely to keep growing above long-run potential. **********While Mr. Parry had made similar comments in the past, analysts said the impact was greater because they were the first words from the Fed after its latest interest-rate move. **********The market's rebound was helped by a realization that second-quarter borrowing needs by the Government are much lower than originally thought. Traders said the Treasury cut the size of the weekly bill auctions by $800 million, to $22.8 billion. It was the third straight cut of this size, reflecting greatly reduced second-quarter borrowing needs and possibly stronger-than-expected tax receipts. The Government will announce today the size of next week's auctions of two- and five-year notes."

The roots of the new aggressiveness lie in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Britain. **********Indeed, insider trading - broadly defined as when people in a privileged position use information they have gained by virtue of that position to deal on financial markets - has prompted disquiet in Anglo-Saxon culture for many centuries. There is a reference to it being discussed in the House of Commons as early as 1696. **********In countries outside the United States and Britain, however, it has only concerned policy makers relatively recently. Some analysts even see the adoption of insider trading legislation by many countries - particularly emerging economies - as no more than a cynical ploy to give their stock markets badges of respectability. **********""In the securities markets you are not respectable unless you have an insider dealing law,"" said Barry Rider, dean of Jesus College at Cambridge University and the author of several books on insider trading. **********Insider trading was first outlawed in securities legislation passed in the United States in the early 1930s. Subsequently, a number of civil actions in the 1960s built up U.S. case law. And in the last decade, more legislation has been passed. **********According to Mr. Rider, however, the U.S. legislation of the 1930s was not very substantive. The first truly effective laws, he said, are those that have come into existence within the last 10 years. **********Curiously, while insider trading is theoretically a criminal offense in the United States, it is normally tried, at least initially, under civil law. Some regulators around the world who pursue insider traders say this is the case because it is more practical. In other words, it is easier to prove insider dealing under civil law than it is under criminal law. **********Japan has had insider trading legislation almost as long as the United States. The country's securities legislation was passed during the U.S. occupation after World War II. But it was not until very recently that insider dealing laws were actually enforced, say observers. **********The first real case in Japan began last June and is still in progress. The Japanese Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, which was not created until 1992, is investigating 175 officers and employees of Nippon Shoji Kaisha Ltd., an Osaka-based drug manufacturer, who allegedly sold their shares in Nippon Shoji shortly before the public announcement that a drug recently marketed by the company had caused fatal side effects. The announcement caused the shares to plummet. **********Charles Stevens, a Tokyo-based partner in Freshfields, an international law firm, suggested that enforcement of insider trading laws in Japan has been less than fervent. ""A Japanese sociologist used to say that the Japanese law is like a family that has an ancient samurai sword,"" he said. ""They take it out of the closet every now and again, but they would never dream of using it on anyone."" **********Other experts concur that there has been little enforcement of insider dealing or any other securities legislation in Japan until recently. This has been due in part, some add, to the discreet ways of Japanese executives which have provided little if any evidence of wrongdoing even when laws may have actually been broken. **********Some observers add that Japanese authorities have been galvanized into action by securities scandals that rocked the country in the late 1980s. **********Hong Kong is another place where insider dealing legislation has only recently been enforced aggressively, say some analysts. One joke going around town quotes a company director who, upon learning that the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's financial regulator, was serious about hounding insider dealers, said that he would not be able to get anyone to sit on his board anymore. **********Gerard McMahon, the director of enforcement at the Securities and Futures Commission, defends the territory's reputation, however, and says he does not think insider dealing is any more common in Hong Kong than elsewhere in the world. Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission was set up in 1989. Mr. McMahon says the first three years were absorbed with policy making and that the regulator only ""shifted into higher gear"" in 1992. **********Mr. Rider of Jesus College reckons that much of the insider trading legislation around the world has been passed as a result of pressure from the United States. He said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has forced insider dealing legislation on Germany, Switzerland and Japan. **********Michael Mann, director of the office of international affairs at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said that its insider trading cases have had an impact on countries that are developing their securities markets. In this regard, he added, insider dealing legislation has become viewed as a benchmark for how markets treat investors. **********As for putting pressure on other countries to introduce insider-trading legislation, he said: ""Our approach and our central concern has not been lex americana, but mutual respect for law."" **********He explained that this means countries should assist each other in enforcing the laws of the marketplace no matter where a trade originates. Thus, he said, anyone trading in the U.S. market should be subject to U.S. laws."

Israeloff, chairman of Israeloff, Trattner & Company, an accounting firm, said that when an individual retirement account is taxed in a certain way for Federal purposes, it is generally taxed the same way for state purposes. States view income from such an account as I.R.A. income, rather than as income from the Treasury securities within the I.R.A. **********Seymour Goldberg, senior partner of Goldberg & Ingber, a law firm, agreed. ""The Treasury bond in an I.R.A. loses its character as an exempt item for state tax purposes,"" he said. Annuity Beneficiaries **********What are the tax consequences to a beneficiary of a single payment tax-deferred annuity on the death of the owner of the annuity? HELENE MORGENSTERN, Westport, Conn. **********With a pure annuity, the payments cease at death. But many people hedge their bets in an annuity by buying one that provides for some sort of refund to a beneficiary. **********An annuity is considered ""income in respect of a decedent"" and does not get a new tax basis at death. Any amount beyond the original investment becomes taxable income to the beneficiary.  ""The beneficiary would be entitled to recover the balance of the decedent's investment tax-free,"" said David S. Rhine, a partner of BDO Seidman, an accounting firm. ""Any excess constitutes taxable income."" **********When an annuity holder dies, the balance in the account is subject not only to income tax, but also to estate tax. The beneficiary can deduct the portion of estate tax owed on the annuity on his or her individual income tax return. Assets in Trust **********If someone wants to create a bypass trust in a will and the only asset of significance is an I.R.A., how can the trust be funded and still avoid the taxes that result from an effective distribution from the I.R.A.? STEPHEN J. BLABER, Brooklyn **********If other assets are available, an individual retirement account should not be used for a bypass trust because distributions after your death will continue to be subject to income tax. But if no other choice is possible, try to avoid accelerating withdrawals from the retirement account and thus incurring higher tax payments. **********""Under the minimum distribution rules, naming a designated beneficiary can defer required withdrawals from the I.R.A.,"" said Tricia K. Bonner, a partner of Thacher Proffitt & Wood, a law firm.  ""The bypass trust would have to be created under an irrevocable living trust to qualify as a designated beneficiary at the I.R.A. owner's required beginning date. Authorizing the trustee in the trust instrument to take the minimum amount each year from the I.R.A. will also help to defer income taxes."""

Delegates from places like Burma and Cuba will impose their will on the United States, preventing it from enacting its own laws to protect the environment and the health of its population - even from raising its own taxes. **********This sinister bid for world governance will be launched by the new World Trade Organization that is to start operations next year, probably in Geneva, as successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. **********Equally fervently, supporters of the WTO, including the U.S. administration, argue that it will not diminish the country's sovereignty over its own affairs by one iota. **********Both are wrong. **********The WTO is not the monster portrayed by its opponents but, like many other international treaties and agreements, it does impinge on U.S. sovereignty. The point is that it is well worthwhile to sacrifice a little autonomy to gain the WTO's benefits, which will be considerable. **********It is difficult, however, for the WTO's supporters to make this argument in Washington, where any perceived loss of national sovereignty arouses strong opposition - particularly in a U.S. Congress anxious to guard its right to conduct trade policy. So, as the administration tries to persuade Congress to ratify the latest world trade agreement, which sets up the WTO, it is having to be a little deceitful on the sovereignty issue. **********But the WTO's opponents are being deceitful too, disingenuously arguing the organization could actually be rejected without upsetting the rest of the agreement. **********That is simply wrong. Washington's acceptance of the WTO was an essential part of the final package deal struck in Geneva last December and it cannot be reopened. **********Nor is it true the United States is going to be pushed around by the likes of Cuba and Burma. The way the WTO makes decisions will not be all that much different from GATT, and the United States, as the world's largest economy, is certainly going to maintain its ample weight. **********What is true, on the other hand, is that all nations are losing sovereignty as the world economy goes global. Even the United States, for instance, has little control over its currency. As traditional economic barriers fall, policy instruments that used to be of solely domestic concern can be used to impede trade. **********U.S. rules on automobile fuel efficiency, for example, are legitimate grounds for complaint if they discriminate a gainst imported cars that are engineered to a different standard, as the European Union is currently alleging in GATT. **********It will certainly be possible to challenge many such practices in the WTO - which does not mean, of course, that the WTO will automatically uphold the challenge. If it does not blindly uphold such challenges, it will no longer be possible for Washington - or anyone else, for that matter - to veto the outcome. That is one of the real transfers of power to the new organization. Another is that U.S. use of unilateral trade action, and retaliation, will be much restricted. **********The point is that these are all very good things. It is good for everyone, including the United States, if Congress's protectionist tendencies, and its fondness for unilateral bullying, are restrained. In fact, it was the United States, which brings the most trade complaints, that quite rightly wanted to end the national veto over GATT rulings. **********The United States, arguably the world's most open economy, can only gain as more countries are required to play by the same rules. It should be happy to have a stronger policeman to enforce those rules, even if it has to obey them itself."

'A crook is a crook,' but now he could wind up in prison for it."," **********GERMANY'S financial markets underwent a remarkable change on Aug. 1, when a new Securities Trading Law took effect, making certain insider trading a criminal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison. **********But what the new law will mean for investors, banks and businesses remains open to question. Market experts are certain it will make Frankfurt more competitive as an international financial center and believe the regulations will breed a new information culture among German companies in which news that might affect the market will be made public much faster than it has been. **********""The law was intended to improve Germany's competitiveness as a financial marketplace and to make the markets more attractive, particularly to foreign investors,"" said Lydia Kortenkamp-Adam, an economist at Westdeutsche Landesbank A.G. in Dusseldorf. ""It will do that. But there are still a number of questions about how it will apply."" **********Among those questions are: What types of news can be classified as affecting stock prices? At what stage must disclosures be made? What is to be understood by what the law calls ""substantial potential"" for influencing share prices? **********Those questions will be cleared up in time, as regulators and traders become familiar with the law, and legal precedents are established. **********New rules also require German companies to disclose all information that might affect securities prices. To give the new law teeth, Parliament created the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading in Frankfurt, which starts up Jan. 1. **********The agency will also supervise banks' compliance with the new requirements, including the duty to disclose the acquisition or sale of shareholdings. **********Issuers must immediately disclose any facts that could influence a company's assets, finances or general business performance and might substantially affect its stock price. Failure to comply could result in fines as high as three million marks -- $1,950,000 at current exchange rates. **********German commercial banks, which often hold sizable stakes in companies, have been nearly unanimous in welcoming the law and adjusting their operations. **********Westdeutsche Landesbank, for example, is drawing up compliance rules, Mrs. Kortenkamp-Adam said. It is also introducing stricter regulations governing employee transactions for trading in their own accounts and is establishing internal information barriers and areas of confidentiality. **********At Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt, so-called Chinese walls separating securities sales and trading were put up before the new law took effect. **********The law brings regulation of Germany's financial markets up to international standards, ending the informal policing of insider trading on the nation's eight stock exchanges. In the rare instances in which someone was found guilty of trading on inside information, there were lesser penalties, such as forfeiting part or all of their profit. **********Those practices had been widely criticized, particularly abroad. **********""The new law will make a difference to foreign investors,"" said Dennis Phillips, a spokesman for Commerzbank. ""Now they get the same protection in Germany as in London or New York. It does not mean that insider trading will become a thing of the past. A crook is a crook, and if someone wants to do a dirty deal, they will find a way. But now, they'll be facing federal prosecution and prison."" **********German authorities are investigating allegations that as many as two dozen stockbrokers may have engaged in ""front-running,"" buying securities knowing that big orders were about to be executed. **********The investigation began late in July, just before the insider-trading law took effect. ""It shows how badly we need the new law,"" said August Schafer, who will head the federal regulatory agency. ""We won't be able to get a hold on everything, but at least it will be more than in the past."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/01/world/mood-swing-hits-tokyo.html,James Sterngold,1994-05-01,,834,,The New York Times,World,An Analysis; News Analysis,article,Mood Swing Hits Tokyo,Mood Swing Hits Tokyo," **********When Morihiro Hosokawa took office last summer promising to clean up rampant political corruption and open up the minutely regulated economy, he was greeted with almost giddy optimism. Nobody expected change overnight, but just placing it on the agenda after 39 years of one-party rule gave Mr. Hosokawa the highest approval ratings of any Prime Minister in the postwar era. **********On Monday a close ally of Mr. Hosokawa's, Tsutomu Hata, became Prime Minister and pledged to continue the reforms, but the mood this time is a mixture of wary hopefulness and cynicism. **********The realization that change can also mean instability has left the Japanese far more sober-minded about what lies ahead in the remarkable reform effort they have begun. On a Knife's Edge **********The coming week is a holiday period known as Golden Week, and it will give Mr. Hata and his Cabinet some respite after the open bitterness of the succession battle. But once parliamentary business resumes, one fact is likely to dominate public perceptions and the political maneuvering: Mr. Hata is head of a minority Government that can be brought down any time the opposition chooses. **********In short, his conservative Government will be operating on a knife's edge. The news media here have already declared that its lifespan may be measured in weeks, which means that the prospect of its producing strong policies on several pressing crises -- ending the recession, changing the tax structure and reducing the yawning trade surplus -- are slim. **********""It is impossible to expect anything from the minority Hata Cabinet on big policy issues,"" Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's most respected daily business newspaper, said in an editorial. It added that a new election was likely, and soon. **********That means Mr. Hata is unlikely to have the support to negotiate a broad trade agreement with the United States soon, despite his stated intention of opening the economy in ways that Washington has demanded. **********That prospect is one reason the value of the yen soared against the dollar in New York on Friday, some traders said. Despite occasional assertions to the contrary, the Clinton Administration is believed to favor a strong yen as a weapon for attacking Japan's trade surplus. A strong yen makes exports more expensive in foreign markets, and boosts imports by reducing their cost to Japanese. Traders Push Yen Higher **********So when trade frictions and the surplus grow, traders tend to push the yen higher, as they did on Friday. **********Today Japan's largest-circulation newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, ran the results of an opinion poll capturing the ambiguous public mood. A surprisingly strong 56.8 percent of those polled said they supported the new minority Government, compared with 71.9 percent approval when Mr. Hosokawa took office. **********But the public responded negatively to the way in which Mr. Hata had forged his six-party coalition Government. When the conservative parties in the coalition sought to band together and overpower the Socialists, the Socialists quit in anger. That left Mr. Hata with his minority Government. **********In the Yomiuri poll, 57 percent said they thought Mr. Hata's methods for forming his coalition were ""forcible."" The feeling, even among some of those who disagree with the Socialists' policies, was that Mr. Hata's raw power play against the Socialists violated the old political rules. **********As members of Mr. Hosokawa's Government, the Socialists proved unreliable partners. Some fought against bills reforming the electoral and campaign financing systems. But the public seems to have found them a buffer against the more rightward-leaning policies of Mr. Hata's core supporters. Cabinet More Conservative **********Indeed, Mr. Hata's Cabinet is considerably more conservative than Mr. Hosokawa's, and even more conservative than some of the previous Liberal Democratic Governments. **********For instance, for the first time in the postwar era, the Cabinet includes a retired general. Shigeto Nagano, 71, the Justice Minister, was the highest officer in the Ground Self-Defense Force, as the Japanese Army is known, before retiring and winning a seat in Parliament in the 1980's. **********The Foreign Minister is Koji Kakizawa, 60, an articulate former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who has argued that Japan should end its postwar pacifism and allow its military to be used abroad in peacekeeping missions. That independent stance is anathema to Japan's leftists, and even to many older Liberal Democrats who remember World War II and distrust the ability of civilians to control the military. **********""In international affairs we have to be open to collective security arrangements, to have shared responsibility in our security affairs,"" Mr. Kakizawa said in an interview. ""I don't just mean financial responsibility, but shared risk-taking in maintaining the security of this region."" **********Ultimately, the question is whether the Government will last long enough for its security policies to be tested. Its first task will be to pass a long-delayed budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1. After that, the Government's existence could grow more precarious by the day."

In France, the proportion is a mere 0.9 percent. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark, private school pupils are, statistically speaking, non-existent. **********Worldwide, Japan is the only OECD country in which more than 10 percent of the five-to-29 age group is enrolled in full- time private education. The OECD identified 11.7 percent of Japanese students as attending a purely private school. In the United States that figure is 6.7 percent and in Canada only 2.2 percent. Generally speaking, the OECD found that the popularity of private schooling varies widely in developed countries. **********Of the 27 countries reviewed by the OECD in a recent report, only Portugal and Turkey had fewer than 90 percent of its 14-year-olds enrolled in secondary education. But significant discrepancies become apparent after age 15, when enrollment declines rapidly in some countries. The most startling drop occurs in Britain, where only 62.4 percent of 16-year-olds are still in school. **********By age 18, enrollment is secondary education has dropped to 50 percent in most countries. The exceptions are the Nordic countries, France and the Netherlands, where this shift occurs at 19 years of age, and Germany, where more than 20 percent of 20-year-olds are still enrolled in secondary education. **********Similarities in English-speaking countries, and their differences compared with other countries, are conspicuous. For example, in all OECD English-speaking countries, the vast majority of students in secondary education are enrolled in general programs. In most other countries, the majority are enrolled in vocational and apprenticeship programs. **********Beyond secondary education, at least 25 percent of the relevant age group goes on to higher education in OECD countries. In Australia, Finland, Japan and the United States, that figure is more than 50 percent. Students entering bachelor's degree programs outnumber those entering non-university higher education - such as technical schools, vocational schools and all two- year associate's degree programs - in all OECD countries except Hungary, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden. **********The educational strides made by women over the past two decades in most countries is apparent in the almost equal numbers entering tertiary education. Only in Japan and Turkey do the opportunities for men and women appear to be markedly different. In Japan, nearly twice as many women as men enter non-university programs, but fewer than half attend a university. In Turkey, men outnumber women by substantial margins in both categories. **********The enthusiasm for a university degree in the United States, where 20 percent of people aged 18 to 21 years are enrolled in university programs, is not shared by students in most other countries. Only Canada and Spain have similar enrollment levels. In more than half the European countries studied, the figure was under 10 percent. In Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland, less than 5 percent of that age group was enrolled at a university. **********Very few students in any of the OECD countries, moreover, register in part-time university programs. Part-time participation is highest in the English-speaking countries, but even in these, the rate is less than five percent. **********Differences in participation at all levels of part-time education may be affected by availability, however. According to the OECD, the higher proportion of part-time enrollment in the English-speaking countries may reflect greater opportunities for this type of education in those countries. **********The prodigious value attached to education in every developed country is starkly illustrated by the relationship of educational attainment to employment. **********In Canada, for example, where 9.1 percent of the population was unemployed in 1991, the OECD found that 14.1 percent of people who stopped school at a lower-secondary or earlier level were out of work. Unemployment dropped to 9.5 percent for those with an upper-secondary education, to 7.8 percent for those with a non-university tertiary education, and to 5.1 percent for those with a university degree. **********In France, Portugal, Switzerland and the Netherlands, the OECD found that more people between the ages of 25 and 64 with a university education were out of work than those with a non-university tertiary education. But these differences were slim. In most cases, each level of education engendered markedly higher chances of employment. **********Higher education also means more money, and the relationship between education and earnings is most striking in the United States. For example, an American man between 25 and 64 years old with only a grammar-school education makes just 69 percent of the average salary earned by a man with a high-school diploma. A man with a university education, in contrast, earned 164 percent of the high-school graduate's income. **********This gap, which is similar for women of the same educational levels, is almost twice that found in most European countries. In all developed countries, however, higher levels of education corresponded to substantial gains in earnings."

Wooed away from the Chase Manhattan Bank, where she managed Texaco's pension account as a vice president, Ms. Roberts says Texaco's recruiters assured her that the company was looking for talented black executives to catapult up the ranks. **********But once inside the company's headquarters in Harrison, N.Y., Ms. Roberts quickly became frustrated and then angry. A pension analyst for 20 years, she said she was insulted, rebuffed and eventually ignored by a management that seemed interested only in having a black ""statistic"" in its human relations flow chart. **********She said she was chastised by a supervisor for ruining the ""lily white"" composition of the department. And after publicly disagreeing with a senior manager during a meeting, she said her performance rating was lowered sharply because that white male executive found her ""uppity."" **********Last summer Ms. Roberts banded with five other black Texaco employees to file a discrimination claim in Federal court in White Plains seeking class-action status. The six plaintiffs, who all remain at Texaco, contend that they are the victims of a companywide pattern of racial bias. Their suit provides details of Ms. Roberts's allegations as well as other charges that blacks have received lower pay than whites performing comparable tasks and have been denied the kind of assignments and responsibilities needed for promotion. **********At the suggestion of a Federal magistrate, the two sides are in mediation. Texaco denies that its official policies and procedures are unfair to minority employees. ""The fact that six employees out of 32,000 didn't get the assignments they wanted hardly proves that point,"" a spokesman, David Dickson, said. And in its court papers, Texaco either denies the specific allegations made by the plaintiffs or says it has no knowledge that they occurred. **********But Texaco also says that isolated incidents of a discriminatory nature could occur in a company of its size and traditions, and that it is working hard to prevent them. ""We are part of an old industry and we have some cultural changes to make,"" said Edward Gadsden, the company's manager for diversity and equal employment, who was brought in nine months ago from Johnson & Johnson to help speed the effort. ""But it is a slow process, even if some people would want to see it done faster."" **********In any event, the lawsuit puts a spotlight on one of the oil industry's least talked-about skeletons: After many years and countless dollars spent on affirmative action, Texaco and other big oil companies have virtually no blacks in the senior ranks of their core businesses. **********The key reason is the difficulty the industry has had in shedding its ""good old boy"" culture, say dozens of executives, both black and white, at Texaco and other oil companies. That culture has apparently allowed pockets of outright bias to exist -- directed against women as well as blacks and other minority employees -- even as top management has spent time and money on diversity programs. But the culture expresses itself in more subtle ways as well, particularly as the scaling down of operations has heightened competition for advancement and encouraged old-timers to close ranks. And while oil companies have made progress in the treatment of white women, critics say, blacks still face institutional impediments. **********Making matters murkier is the subjective nature of some of the discrimination about which blacks complain -- not getting their share of high-profile assignments, for example -- and the corresponding difficulty of proving illegal discrimination. For a class action, that requires demonstration of corporate practices resulting in prejudicial impact to a particular group. **********""A lot of times it just comes down to statistical evidence,"" said Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer with Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll in Washington who represents Ms. Roberts and the other plaintiffs. **********Indeed, blacks appear to have less chance of moving into management in the oil patch than in many other industries where regional demographics or a more consumer-oriented focus has forced speedier change. In the oil business, 3.8 percent of corporate managers are black, compared with 5.3 percent in all American industry. Over all, blacks account for 9 percent of oil workers and 13 percent of the country's work force. **********THE record at seven of the country's eight major oil companies (only Arco declined to provide data) is close to the national figures for blacks, at 5.1 percent for corporate managers and 11 percent for the overall work force. But the statistics do not tell the whole story, industry executives agree. Most black professionals in the industry work in support functions like human resources and legal departments that rarely feed into the top echelons of the companies. **********""It's been the history of the oil industry that talented minority professionals have left frustrated,"" said Frederick A. Miller, head of the Kaleel Jamison Consulting Group, a diversity specialist in Cincinnati. **********While Texaco's record on black employment is not out of line with the industry as a whole, it lags that of the majors. Last year, 3.97 percent of its corporate managers were black, a bit better than the industry figure but far below the average for the majors. And the percentage of black employees in its domestic operations -- 8.4 percent -- was the lowest of any major. **********Moreover, Texaco has been one of the slowest to implement diversity programs. It still does not have a companywide mentor program for its 2,086 black employees or formal sensitivity training for its managers. In recent years, Texaco has consistently had difficulty meeting employment practice standards for Federal contractors, unlike many of its peers, according to Labor Department records. Though Texaco conducted a companywide diversity survey last year, and established a diversity team, no significant actions have resulted. When pressed for details recently, the company pointed to a new brochure for employees on the subject of promotion. **********""The petroleum industry is probably the least progressive industry when it comes to recruiting, promoting and retaining minority professionals,"" said Lawrence Otis Graham, author of ""The Best Companies for Minorities,"" which ranks the Fortune 1000 partly on their special programs for minority employees. ""And Texaco stands out for its failure to embrace a comprehensive approach."" **********Texaco says it is making steady progress on the issue. It has not responded broadly yet to last year's survey because it is still looking ""at what is the best way to achieve these ends and not just at window dressing,"" said Mr. Gadsden, the diversity manager. **********Still, Texaco says, the company can point to the promotions in the last year of three blacks to senior positions, including the assistant to the vice president of Texaco U.S.A. and an assistant auditor. One black, Dr. Franklyn G. Jenifer, the president of the University of Texas at Dallas, is on its 14-member board. But the company confirms that it has no black corporate or divisional vice presidents. In addition, it refuses to disclose the number of blacks who are departmental managers. **********SOME things, however, are hard to keep secret. At the company's Harrison office, for example, only executives of a certain rank get offices with three windows. ""You can just take a walk around the headquarters and see there are no minorities in three-window offices,"" said Sil Chambers, a plaintiff in the discrimination suit. **********Mr. Dickson, the Texaco spokesman, said, ""Who's in what level of visibility is not an appropriate barometer of this company's policies."" He noted that Texaco had managed to reduce its size without significant losses of minority personnel. From 1990 to late 1993, Texaco saw a reduction of 9 percent in the size of its domestic work force, but a decline of only 5.6 percent in black employees, according to Government filings. And its percentage of black corporate managers actually rose during that period, from 3.75 percent to 3.97 percent. **********Texaco acknowledges that it ""aggressively"" recruited Ms. Roberts and other black executives in 1990, after a Labor Department audit found that the company was deficient in its minority representation at some levels. But it says the hirings were motivated by other reasons, too, including Government projections that women and blacks will account for a growing share of the national work force. **********""The 1990 audit just reaffirmed that we could do better,"" Mr. Gadsden said. **********The company was found to have problems in a follow-up Labor Department audit in May, however. The findings included a failure to provide equal pay to a minority ""office assistant"" and a failure to adequately track minority promotions. As a result of the May audit, the department ordered Texaco to develop a corrective program. **********Still, Mr. Gadsden rejects the notion that Ms. Roberts was passed over for promotion because she is black, saying it is not unusual for a person of her seniority and salary level to remain in place for four years, particularly during a period of reductions. In fact, Mr. Gadsden characterizes all six plaintiffs as employees ""who think that just because they said they wanted some assignment, it automatically means they were entitled to get it."" **********One plaintiff, Marsha Harris, strongly disagrees. ""Getting promoted at Texaco is like a popularity contest,"" said Ms. Harris, who has worked for Texaco for 20 years. She said she was turned down for a number of promotions given to white males with less direct experience, because they were ""in favor with the guy in favor with the guy moving up on a roll."" **********Ms. Harris, an assistant to the controller in the Universal City, Calif., office, contends that only once in her 19 years in the Houston office was a black given the prestigious assignment of presenting the weekly refinery profitability report to the controller of Texaco Refining and Marketing. In its legal papers, Texaco denied that charge, but the company declined to elaborate. **********DIVERSITY consultants generally agree that direct involvement by a company's most senior executives is the best way to make a disparate work force run more smoothly. **********In Texaco's case, the chairman and chief executive, Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., met twice with Mr. Chambers, one of the key organizers of the lawsuit and the only black on Texaco's corporate diversity panel, many months before the suit was filed. Mr. Chambers says Mr. DeCrane was sympathetic and responsive. **********""He has a commitment to diversity,"" Mr. Chambers said, ""but no changes were forthcoming throughout the company. There are good procedures on paper but people aren't adhering to them. They are still using the 'good old boy' network."" **********Mr. Chambers, who had previously been a lead trader of Treasury issues with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he had to bear the insult of a fellow executive at Texaco who said he had been hired to improve the company's basketball team. **********That was not the only sign of bias, Mr. Chambers said.

The company said Mr. Ulrich was not able to get a clear explanation of the discrimination Mr. Chambers thought he had experienced. **********That is not how Mr. Chambers remembers it.

Skeel Jr. fails to demonstrate how the so-called ""bankruptcy mess"" will be cleaned up by transferring such cases to the states. No judicial system will ever be perfect. The Bankruptcy Court system, however, works remarkably well considering the number of cases filed and the dollar amounts involved. There clearly have been some abuses, but their number is remarkably small. That the bankruptcy system works so well is testament to the excellence of the judges appointed since the adoption of new bankruptcy laws in 1978 and the professionalism of the staffs assisting in their administration. **********Delegating the duties and responsibilities of administering bankruptcy laws to the states would be an unmitigated disaster. To suggest that there is a bankruptcy mess because of a few large cases that are atypical of the more than 900,000 cases filed each year and that the existing system must be eliminated can only be considered as academically irresponsible and without any factual basis.

They also said that the United States is likely to provide noncombat assistance for the rescue operation -- probably communications and logistics experts. The Security Council, they said, is likely to meet today to review the situation in Rwanda. **********Rival tribal factions waged vicious street battles Friday for control of the city, reports from Rwanda said. The death toll of civilians, Government ministers and soldiers -- including at least 10 United Nations peacekeeping troops -- was estimated to be in the thousands. **********A French Foreign Ministry statement issued in Paris today said the decision to send troops had been taken ""in the face of the spread and the worsening of the violence in Kigali."" **********The aim was ""to provide the security necessary for a possible evacuation of the French nationals,"" the statement said. It gave no information how many soldiers would be involved nor any other details. **********With Kigali virtually cut off from the outside world, save for radio links and a few working telephone lines, the United States, Belgium and France discussed steps to begin evacuating their citizens, trapped since the fighting plunged the city into chaos Wednesday night. **********In Brussels, Government officials said 800 paratroopers were standing by to evacuate about 1,500 Belgians now estimated to be in Rwanda, a former Belgian colony, if United Nations troops are able to secure the airport, until now the scene of some of the heaviest fighting. **********The French, with 600 citizens inside Rwanda, also had troops on alert in the Central African Republic, and the State Department said it was considering plans to evacuate 255 Americans who are living in Rwanda. So far, no Americans have been reported hurt in the fighting. **********But as Belgium pressed the United Nations to allow the 2,500 peacekeepers already based in Rwanda to use force, the commander of the 400-member Belgian contingent, Col. Luc Marchal, said on Friday that there was a possibility a cease-fire between the warring factions could be reached as soon as this morning. **********At the United Nations the Security Council president, Colin Keating of New Zealand, said the police and the army in Kigali had agreed to terms for a cease-fire and had nominated a new interim Government. It was unclear, however, if the Presidential Guard, which was responsible for much of the killing, had also agreed to ending the hostilities. **********The interim Government would include a President, Theodor Sindikuwabo; a Prime Minister, Jean Kambanga, and five other Ministers, Mr. Keating said. **********The council president said the situation in Kigali improved Friday afternoon and the Red Cross was able to move around the city freely and evacuate wounded people to hospitals. Outside the capital conditions were reported calm. Need 3 Battalions of Troops **********Senior United Nations officials have said they need an additional three battalions of soldiers in order to secure the airport and allow United States, Belgian and French forces to evacuate their nationals. **********The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, now in Geneva, sent a message to the Security Council in New York saying that any rescue operation would require 1,000 to 1,500 more troops. There are an estimated 2,500 United Nations soldiers in Rwanda now, but they are lightly armed and have stayed in their barracks since 10 Belgian peacekeeping soldiers were killed Thursday. **********Since gaining independence from Belgium in 1962, both Rwanda and Burundi, its equally small and poor neighbor to the south, have experienced tensions between the Hutus, who make up about 85 percent of the population, and the Tutsi tribe, who are about 14 percent. Presidents' Plane Crashed **********The violence that has consumed the capital began late Wednesday night after an airplane carrying Juvenal Habyarimana, the President of Rwanda, and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, both of the dominant Hutu tribe, crashed as it was approaching Kigali airport. **********The Rwanda Government said the plane was shot down by a rocket fired by unnamed attackers, and the Presidential Guard loyal to Mr. Habyarimana immediately set out to settle scores with Tutsis inside Kigali. **********While reports from the capital remain incomplete, the staggering scale of the carnage began to emerge today. Red Cross Officials said their workers inside Kigali had counted more than 400 bodies in the morgue of one central hospital alone, and that the corridors of the hospital overflowed with wounded. **********Along the borders of Rwanda, relief workers also reported a steady stream of refugees fleeing toward Tanzania, to the southeast, and diplomats here and in Europe feared that unless the fighting could be stopped soon, the country was lurching toward all-out civil war. **********The leader of the Rwanda Popular Front, a rebel group dominated by the Tutsis and bitterly opposed to the Hutu faction that controls the central Government, said on Friday that the main body of the guerrilla force was moving toward the capital from strongholds in the heavily forested areas near the Uganda border. **********While a leader of the rebel group, Paul Kagama, said the advance was intended only to restore order in the capital, diplomats feared it would almost certainly mean an increase in the fighting. **********In interviews conducted over patchy telephone and radio links and appearing mostly in French and Belgian newspapers and radio, diplomats, foreign residents and aid workers living in Kigali contributed to a growing description of the terror that has overtaken the capital. **********In the center of the city, machine gun fire raked a hotel owned by Sabena, the Belgian airlines, slightly wounding a pilot and officer from a Sabena crew trapped in the city. **********Of the reports coming out of the capital, witnesses said the killings so far were directed at Rwandans rather than foreigners. In one case, armed men killed 11 nuns and eight priests -- all of them Tutsis -- but spared three European Jesuits who were with them. **********But the fighting has imperiled foreigners. Alongside the United States Ambassador's residence, where an estimated 200 Rwandans have sought refuge, rebels and Government troops were engaged in a furious firefight Friday, United States officials said. They also said a group of Rwandans had entered a Seventh Day Adventist School outside the capital, which is part of a compound where 21 American citizens live. **********The growing list of victims killed by the rampaging troops and gunmen looking to settle old tribal scores now includes the Prime Minister, more than 20 Rwandan nuns and priests, dozens of Rwandans employed by international relief organizations and a French soldier and his wife, who were killed in their home. **********The 2,500 United Nations peacekeepers now on duty in Rwanda have been mostly hunkered down in barracks since Government troops turned their guns on them Thursday, killing 10 Belgian soldiers who tried to protect Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyamana, one of the handful of Tutsis in the Hutu-dominated Government.                    --------------------       U.S. ORDERS AMERICANS OUT **********WASHINGTON, April 8 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States has ordered Americans to leave Rwanda and is making plans for an evacuation, the State Department said today. **********""We issued an ordered departure, and what that means is that we are going to be looking at plans to take out the Americans, the official Americans and their dependents, and American citizens,"" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Prudence Bushnell said. **********She added that there is no indication that any of the 255 Americans living in Rwanda are being targeted by the country's warring tribes. **********Ms. Bushnell declined to give details of the evacuation. Assembling the Americans and then evacuating them from the country is complicated by the fierce fighting around the airport in Kigali. **********""There is fighting and there is chaos,"" Ms. Bushnell said. ""There is no date, there is no time. We're looking to see how best we can do this."""

Because of misgivings that lifting the embargo could itensify the war, the resolution did not get as much support as its backers hoped. **********A resolution of the General Assembly does not have the force of a Security Council resolution, but it can serve as a test of world opinion. It had been the strategy of the United States that a strong vote in the Assembly would demonstrate there is momentum for its Security Council resolution, to be debated next week, to exempt Bosnia from the weapons ban imposed on all of the former Yugoslavia three years ago. **********The American resolution would not take effect for six months. The General Assembly did not set a date for action. **********Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate, spoke strongly today in defense of the Assembly's proposal. The United States was one of the resolution's 39 sponsors, along with mostly Muslim nations and Colombia and Antigua and Barbuda. **********""Bosnia has done nothing that would warrant the imposition of international sanctions,"" Ms. Albright said. **********She added that Washington was aware of the danger of provoking the Bosnian Serbs. **********""But we cannot allow the Bosnian Serbs to hold this world organization hostage, nor can we allow them to blackmail us into depriving the Bosnian Government of its rights,"" she said. ""Bosnia is a sovereign state, a member of these United Nations; it is independent; it respects international law; it respects its own people; it should not need anyone's permission to arm and defend itself."" **********European nations argued against the resolution, but abstained in the vote, as did Canada. Speaking for the European Union, Detlev Graf zu Rantzau, the German delegate, said Europe preferred to see more diplomatic initiatives tried before the ""last resort"" of lifting the embargo was considered. **********""The progress made thus far and the prospects of a negotiated settlement could be jeopardized by decisions with unpredictable consequences,"" he said. **********The vote last year for a similar though slightly weaker resolution was 109 in favor, none opposed and 57 abstentions. Backers of today's version were scrambling until the last minute for votes to equal or better that total. Ms. Albright worked the Assembly floor, lobbying delegates even as speeches were being made. **********There is concern among a number of European and other diplomats that efforts to lift the embargo on Bosnia, coming at a time when the Bosnian Army is gaining on the battlefield, will panic and provoke the Bosnian Serbs. **********Today, before the Assembly debate began, the Bosnian Army and its Croatian allies scored their most significant victory since the war began when the town of Kupres fell. **********On Wednesday Russia's delegate, Sergei V. Lavrov, criticized the Security Council for not taking a stand against the Bosnian offensive. ""We are risking very dangerous developments in Bosnia, which could lead to another catastrophe,"" he said. **********Discussion of the Security Council resolution introduced by the United States is expected to begin next week."

The dictators have recognized that it is in their best interest and in the best interest of the Haitian people to relinquish power peacefully, rather than to face imminent action by the forces of the multinational coalition we are leading. **********Our objective over the last three years has been to make sure that the military dictators leave power, and that the democratically elected Government is returned. **********This agreement guarantees both those objectives. It minimizes the risk for American forces, and the forces of the 24 nations of the international coalition. And the agreement maximizes the orderly transfer of power to Haiti's democratically-elected Government. **********This is a good agreement for the United States and for Haiti. The military leaders will leave, the United States and coalition forces will arrive beginning tomorrow and they'll do so in conditions that are less dangerous, although still not without risk. 'No Vengeance, No Violence' **********It will be much easier to preserve human rights, and there is a real chance of a more orderly and less violent transfer of power. And to the supporters of President Aristide, he will be returned. I ask that all Haitians remember what President Aristide said just a couple of days ago: no vengeance, no violence, no retribution. This is a time for peace. **********That is what the United States is going -- along with our coalition partners -- to work for. **********As all of you know, at my request President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure just yesterday. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days. They have worked tirelessly almost around the clock, and I want to thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans. **********Just as important, I want also to thank the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. It was their presence and their preparations that played a pivotal part in this agreement. **********Under the agreement, the dictators have agreed to leave power as soon as the Haitian Parliament passes an amnesty law, as called for by the Governors Island agreement, but in any event, no later than Oct. 15. They've agreed to immediate introduction of troops from the international coalition beginning, as I said, as early as tomorrow. They have also pledged to cooperate fully with the coalition troops during the peaceful transition of power, something we have wanted very much. Forces to Begin Deployment **********I have directed United States forces to begin deployment into Haiti as part of the U.N. coalition and General Shelton , our commander, will be there tomorrow. The presence of the 15,000-member multinational force will guarantee that the dictators carry out the terms of the agreement. It is clear from our discussions with the delegation that this agreement only came because of the credible and imminent threat of the multinational force. **********In fact it was signed after Haiti received evidence that paratroopers from our 82d Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg, N.C. had begun to load up to begin the invasion which I had ordered to start this evening. Indeed, at the time the agreement was reached 61 American planes were already in the air. **********Because of this agreement the United States and other coalition troops going to Haiti will now be able to go under much more favorable conditions than they would have faced had the generals not decided to leave power. **********But let me emphasize that this mission still has its risks and we must be prepared for them. Haiti is still a troubled country and there remain possibilities of violence directed at American troops. But this agreement minimizes those risks and maximizes our chance to protect the human rights of all Haitians -- both those who support President Aristide and those who oppose him -- and to create an environment in which President Aristide can return as he said, without violence, without vengeance, without retribution. **********Under the terms of United Nations Security Council Resolution 940 an international coalition from 25 nations will soon go into Haiti to begin the task of restoring democratic government. President Aristide will return to Haiti when the dictators depart. On Thursday night I told you that the United States must act here to protect our interests, to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians, to secure our borders and preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere, to uphold the reliability of commitments we make to others and the commitments others make to us. This agreement furthers all these goals. **********From the beginning, I have said that the Haitian dictators must go. Tonight I can tell you that they will go. **********And to our troops tonight who are headed to Haiti under less risky conditions, I am confident you will carry out your mission as you already have -- effectively and professionally. We depend upon you to do well tomorrow, as you have done so very well today, and in the weeks and days before when you planned this exercise, prepared for it and then began to carry it out. To all of you, I say, thank you, your nation is proud of you. **********Good night, and God bless America."

So herewith a wish list for investors in the new year. **********Lower tax rate on capital gains. The Republicans have been talking about this idea for years, Now that they have control of Congress, they can act. Cutting the maximum tax rate on capital gains from 28 percent would make it sweeter for investors to take profits, and might even prompt a round of selling in the stock market. But the Republicans argue it would promote growth and could even pay for itself by producing more capital gains for the Government to tax. **********Some capital gains on which to pay taxes. The bond market debacle of 1994 means there are precious few bondholders who can take capital gains, whatever the tax rate. And while a lot of stocks went up this year, the major stock market indexes are generally lower than a year ago. **********An end to all taxes on investing. This is a long-run idea, which will get a new hearing in Washington this year but probably will not happen. Replacing the income tax with a consumption tax makes all investments deductible -- whether the money is used to buy stocks or simply put in a bank account. On the other hand, because the idea is to tax consumption, you will be taxed if you sell an investment and spend the proceeds. **********Even though the big idea will not happen, a smaller break is possible if individual retirement accounts are expanded to allow more people to make bigger tax-deductible contributions. **********A more visible municipal bond market. Starting in January, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board will be distributing limited information on actual trading prices of a handful of muni bonds. At first, it will cover trades between brokers, but eventually it will be expanded to include information on trades with institutions and, sometime in 1996, with individuals. **********That will make it possible for investors to see how a price they pay for a bond compares with what other investors are getting. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which had been pushing to make bond dealers sometimes disclose their markups on bonds, has deferred action to see how the disclosures work. **********Better trading on Nasdaq. Under pressure from the S.E.C., the Nasdaq stock market is making its trading more like that of a stock exchange. Particularly for actively traded stocks, it should now be easier for savvy investors to get better prices when they trade, by buying at the lower bid price and selling at the higher asked price. To do that, investors will have to put in so-called limit orders, specifying the price at which they are willing to trade. **********A decent measure of riskiness. Investors in a number of fallen mutual funds that sounded safe, not to mention those who invested in the securities of Orange County, Calif., have learned that they can lose a lot of money while buying securities that are rated triple-A. But the financial wizards have done a much better job of inventing ways to take risks than they have of coming up with a simple system to measure them. The S.E.C. is looking for a way, but the problem with that effort is that any measure selected might itself turn out to be misleading. **********No more caving at the F.A.S.B. Under heavy political pressure, the Financial Accounting Standards Board caved in this month and said it would not require companies to deduct from their earnings the value of stock options given to employees. But it said it would make companies disclose the value in a footnote. Expect a campaign from corporate executives to water down that footnote to the point of meaninglessness. **********Preservation of investor protections. Some form of tort reform, limiting the ability of shareholders to sue corporations and their executives, is likely to be adopted by the new Congress. Advocates of such a move say it will help companies -- and their owners -- by discouraging harassing suits with little merit. Investors can only hope that analysis proves right and that abuse of investors will not grow once the legal threat is reduced. **********An invention to filter out cold calls. This undoubtedly will not happen. In fact, those annoying calls from brokers, and often from penny stock firms, seem to be increasing rather than declining. Perhaps fewer executives have secretaries who can figure out who really is a friend of the boss and who wants to peddle stocks. **********But there are ways to deal with cold callers. One is to say, ""I already have an account with your firm."" That can create confusion and lead to a rapid end to the call. Another is to claim to be a lawyer who specializes in suing brokers. Of course, if drastic changes are made in torts, that may no longer seem like much of a threat."

""We are all saying to new young acts that we want to sign: 'Look, it's not a stable environment over there. You won't get the attention you need.' "" **********The main question is whether the rest of the industry is in a position to exploit the rifts running through the Warner Music Group. For in reality, few music companies are pictures of stability these days. **********Just as Warner Music's troubles can be traced in part to the effects of corporate empire building, the entire music industry has been in upheaval for the last half-dozen years, as entertainment conglomerates have swallowed the last of the big independent labels. **********""With rare exception, there's not a single president at a record label that was there 10 years ago,"" said Eric Greenspan, an entertainment lawyer who represents recording artists like the Stone Temple Pilots and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. ""It happens in TV, movies and records. The big deal is, it's never happened at Warner."" **********As formerly entrepreneurial record executives have had to adjust to corporate life, or have been pushed out in the name of cost-cutting and efficiency, some artists have insisted on increasingly shorter contracts with labels -- in part to escape getting stuck under managers they do not like. And some musicians have turned to the new smaller independent labels, which are enjoying a small resurgence. **********For much of this period of turmoil in the industry, Warner Music had been a virtual fortress, with the heads of its big labels in place for more than a decade and each enjoying considerable autonomy. But that began to change this summer, when Robert J. Morgado, the 51-year-old chief executive of Warner Music, moved to impose more of a corporate structure on the labels. **********Mr. Morgado's goal was to harness the considerable ability of the music business to generate cash to help pay down the $16 billion debt of the parent, Time Warner, and shore up its flagging stock price. **********Mr. Morgado also sought to rein in the power of Mo Ostin, a revered industry figure who had headed the company's Warner Brothers Records for 25 years. In July, Mr. Morgado named Doug Morris second in command at Warner Music, and since then Mr. Morgado and Mr. Morris have changed the leadership at its three labels: Warner Brothers, Elektra and Atlantic. **********Sylvia Rhone, former head of Atlantic's East West label, was named chief of Elektra Entertainment this summer. And on Tuesday, Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Records, is expected to be named chairman of Warner Brothers. Val Azzoli, the top marketing executive at Atlantic, is expected to move into the top spot there. **********Last week, as a revolt seemed to sweep Warner Music, several people were dismissed at Elektra. Heads may soon roll at Warner Brothers, and executives and artists like the rock group R.E.M. have threatened to leave Warner Music. **********Industry analysts say all this reflects badly on Mr. Morgado and his boss, the chairman of Time Warner, Gerald M. Levin. And some of them say Mr. Morgado may leave in the wake of the announcement by Time Warner's board yesterday that it had named an outside director, Richard D. Parsons, to the new position of president of Time Warner -- a job Mr. Morgado was thought to covet. **********If all the problems at the Warner Music prompt defections from its stable of talent, the artists may have plenty of options: ***********David Geffen has said that music will be part of his new venture with the director Steven Spielberg and the former Disney studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg, though Mr. Geffen is still under contract with MCA Inc., which bought Geffen Records in 1990. ***********Robert Krasnow, who resigned as head of Warner Music's Elektra Records unit this summer, will announce within weeks the formation of a small label with MCA, according to people close to him. ***********The Sony Corporation's music group, record executives say, is about to form a new label on the West Coast, headed by Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, who built Virgin Records before it was sold to Thorn EMI P.L.C. ***********Mo Ostin, the departing head of Warner Brothers Records, and his deputy, Lenny Waronker, who last week declined to replace Mr. Ostin, are likely to leave the company next year. They may set up their own company or join forces with Mr. Geffen, an Ostin disciple. ***********Viacom Inc., 20th Century Fox, and the financier Ronald O. Perelman have discussed entering the business. **********Despite the chaos, much of the recording industry remains a money machine. Music generates more cash than either publishing or movies and requires less investment than cable television. **********""This is an important cash generator because you don't have to put that much capital back in,"" said John Reidy, an analyst for Smith Barney. **********Warner Music, for example, which had revenues of $3.3 billion last year, is on its way to a banner year in profits with a relatively minimal capital investment, Mr. Reidy said.  ""They may have put in $50 million to generate $700 million,"" he said. **********So, Warner Music is unlikely to see any near-term erosion in its position as the industry's leader, with a market share of nearly 22 percent -- well ahead of the second-biggest record distributor, Sony Music. Though the in-fighting has not been as public, other big recording companies have seen similar discord, as corporate executives, who see music as a cash cow, have riled the recording people, who say those who watch the bottom line stifle creativity. **********""Four of the six heads of major record companies have little or no background in the business,"" said one executive, citing Mr. Morgado at Warner Music, Michael Dornemann at BMG, James Fifield at EMI, and Michael Schulhof at Sony. ""If you didn't grow up in the business, you don't get the gestalt."" **********The problems within the Warner Music Group have been simmering for some time. Executives at the unit say uncertainty in the last year about Mr. Ostin's future had already impaired the signings of new recording contracts, despite what may be a record performance in the last quarter, because of new releases by R.E.M., Green Day, Eric Clapton, Madonna and Tom Petty. **********""We've lost lots of bands to Geffen,"" one executive of Warner Brothers said. ""We're going into 1995 without a strong new signing."" **********And Warner Brothers' two biggest artists, R.E.M. and Mr. Clapton, are close to fulfilling their contracts and are expected to leave. **********But it may not be Warner Music's biggest rivals that will benefit from any defections. Lately there have been signs of growing power at smaller independent labels. Sales of records distributed by these independent labels -- companies like Relativity, Tommy Boy and Epitaph Records -- are on the rise. **********The independents have accounted for about 16 percent of sales in the United States so far this year, compared with about 11 percent in the corresponding period in 1992, according to Soundscan Inc., of Hartsdale, N.Y., which tracks sales. **********The hottest news in the independent ranks is that the Epitaph release ""Smash,"" by The Offspring, a punk band, is No. 6 on the Billboard charts, having sold 100 million albums worldwide since April. **********""This may be the first time in decades that a record has cracked the top 10 without being distributed through one of the majors,"" said Tom Silverman, the founder of Tommy Boy, which is owned by Warner Music but handles its own distribution. ""The myth has always been that you needed to be associated with a major distributor to succeed. Epitaph sets a precedent for other independent rock labels to distribute on their own."""

The Coast Guard boarded and searched the ship, but the Pentagon said this evening that only food, which is exempt from the embargo, had been found on board and that the vessel had been allowed to proceed. **********Along with continued evidence that fuel and other goods are being smuggled into Haiti across the Dominican border, the success of the Bahamian vessel, a seagoing tug, represents an embarrassment to the Administration. **********Since a first round of sanctions was imposed in October, Navy vessels had only twice before fired shots to halt ships suspected of breaking the embargo. The volley of 10 .50-caliber machine-gun shots fired Monday evening by the frigate Atrium over the Haitian ship Leonese was apparently the heaviest show of force yet by an American ship involved in the operation. **********To try to tighten the noose, the Pentagon said today that it had added two Navy vessels off Haiti, bringing to eight the number of United States ships working with a Canadian frigate and an Argentine frigate to enforce the sanctions. **********At the same time, the White House announced that William H. Gray 3d, President Clinton's new special adviser on Haiti, would travel to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday to see President Joaquin Balaguer.  While Mr. Balaguer has made clear that he has little enthusiasm for the endeavor, Administration officials said Mr. Gray would seek to persuade him to be more vigilant in halting the flow of goods into Haiti. **********But the House voted today, 223-201, to oppose military intervention in Haiti unless there was a ""clear and present danger"" to American citizens or interests. The Administration has said that using force remains an option, but that sanctions would be given time to take effect. **********But with no signs that Haiti's military leaders have any intention of giving up power, officials at the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon are stepping up plans to allow Haitian refugees' immigration claims to be processed before any move is made to return them to Haiti. **********In a meeting today, the United States asked representatives of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony, to allow the refugees to be processed there, first aboard a chartered vessel offshore and perhaps later on one of the colony's uninhabited islands."

She was also watching over 13 children who had been separated from their parents in the panicked flight out of Rwanda. **********Her daily challenge, like that of most of the quarter-million refugees on this open plain near the Rwandan border, is finding water, adequate food and shelter from the battering rains. The children, mostly boys in ragged, dirty clothes, huddle together and talk in hushed tones about their families. **********""The first few days they cried,"" said Mrs. Mukankusi, 26; she and other refugee women have volunteered to help look after and feed several hundred abandoned or orphaned children. ""They have looked everywhere in the camps for their family. Many are now resigned that they will never find them. We just try to survive here. Look at the filth we live in."" **********A week after crossing into Tanzania, the 250,000 Rwandan refugees are still struggling to survive. The smell of urine and excrement mingles with that of campfires on the wide plain near Ngara, and relief agencies, hampered by the difficulty of bringing food and medicine to this remote area of northwestern Tanzania, worry about the possibility of epidemics. Sanitation Is Lacking **********Etienne Krug, medical coordinator for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said the most pressing problem was the lack of latrines and other sanitation. ""With the rain, it further contaminates the water supply,"" he said, adding, ""If there is an outbreak of cholera it will be a major, major problem."" **********The refugees, mostly members of Rwanda's Hutu ethnic majority, fled from their homes in the southeast of the country in the space of 25 hours last week as a rebel army made up of the Tutsi ethnic group closed in on the area. United Nations officials described their flight as one of the largest population shifts recorded in a single day in modern times. **********Rwanda has been devastated by violence since April 6, when a plane carrying its President, Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was downed by a rocket near the capital, Kigali. The Hutu-dominated presidential guard went on a rampage, killing Tutsi and moderate Hutu who might have tried to succeed the President. **********Tutsi rebels swept down from the north, encircling the capital and driving further south toward the Tanzanian border. They now control more than half the country. Over all, more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed, many of them Tutsi. **********Unlike many of the Tutsi who have fled into Burundi and northern Tanzania, the mostly Hutu refugees at Benaco Camp here did not arrive with limbs hacked off, machete wounds or tales of other horrific violence. They generally crossed the border well fed, even bringing their animals with them, having received warning as the rebels advanced. **********Only four bullet wounds have been registered at the clinic. A City Is Born **********Though none of the people interviewed said they saw the fighters or witnessed any killing, they all accuse the Tutsi rebels, grouped in the Rwandan Patriotic Front, of atrocities. Almost every family has a radio tuned in permanently to Rwanda radio, which is run by the Hutu-dominated provisional Government. **********""There's a lot of propaganda by the Government radio aimed at the Hutu,"" said Pannos Moumtzis, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""It makes them feel very anti-Tutsi."" **********If existence in this camp about 20 miles from the Rwanda border is grim, the refugees have shown strong resilience. Although there are no buildings or streets, this carpet of humanity is slowly becoming a city. Relief agencies have helped build a clinic, and there is now a pump supplying chlorinated water. **********Communities have regrouped and organized. There is an area for lost and orphaned children and a cemetery. There are many births but relatively few deaths compared with rates at other crowded camps, aid workers say. Lining the paths are improvised open-air restaurants centered on boiling pots of meat, rice or corn. Blankets on the grass demarcate radio repair shops and barber shops. **********Like an endless line of ants, women and children walk the trodden path to a nearby lake to fetch water. Laundry dries on the bushes, and goats and cows mill around. A police force armed with sticks is being formed to deal with the roving bands of thugs who try to steal food. **********When a lion wandered into the camp one night this week, men, women and children began beating pots and pans and screaming in a wild cacophony heard for miles. Thousands More Arrive **********Although the rebels have closed the border, 2,000 more refugees have crossed in recent days, making their way through swamps and swimming across the murky brown river between the two countries, still choked with bloated corpses with their hands tied behind their backs. **********Yet even though the camp's population is stabilizing, the supply logistics remain nightmarish for the relief agencies. Aside from a road stretching from central Tanzania, they rely only on a short dirt airstrip about 40 miles from the camp. **********Although planes could still land, the airstrip was unreachable by car for nearly two days because the road was a sea of mud. The agencies share one phone line, rely on a generator for electricity and have little food aside from bananas to eat themselves. **********Food was distributed to about 170,000 people on Tuesday with no security problems, United Nations officials said, but heavy rains delayed trucks bringing food for distribution today. **********As part of an effort to count and register the refugees, the agency plans to limit the distribution of food rations -- enough for three days -- to 75,000 people every day on a rotating basis. The United Nations refugee agency is planning to start an airlift from Kenya to Mwanza, on Lake Victoria in Tanzania, and bring in blankets, water and plastic sheeting. **********A measles vaccination campaign is planned by the medical relief group Doctors without Borders and the International Rescue Committee, but the vaccine must be packed on ice and transported quickly, still a challenge. Politics Hotly Debated **********Today 13 people died in the camp, most of them from malaria or respiratory diseases, Mr. Krug said. But relief workers said that in a refugee population of this size, they expect as many as 25 deaths a day. **********""Its chaos,"" said Nicolas De Torrente, administrator for the French chapter of Doctors Without Borders, ""but it can only improve."" The group is setting up medical installations for 130,000 people. **********Among the men, politics is a topic of intense discussion. Anastase Karimera, a farmer from the Kibungo district in Rwanda, joined a crowd that had gathered around three men sitting on the grass repairing radios. Nearby a man was having his head shaved to fight off lice. **********Unlike some of the refugees, Mr. Karimera said, he and his family fled without even a change of clothes to escape the advancing rebels. Even if the Tutsi rebels now control half of Rwanda, he argued, they could never govern Rwanda. **********""This is a political war,"" he said. ""The rebels are a minority. To have power you need the support of the population. The population is all here. So where is their support?"""

Mr. Sommaruga said he would ask officials to recommend ""a complete ban on the manufacture, sale or use"" of antipersonnel mines. **********The ban would not cover antitank mines, which are bigger and thus easier to locate, more expensive and not as widely scattered. **********The Red Cross also wants to outlaw or sharply restrict the industrial development of laser weapons, which inflict permanent blindness. ""Blinding as a method of warfare has to be outlawed now,"" Mr. Sommaruga said. **********He also said the Red Cross wanted to strengthen the 1980 convention by improving the verification of compliance and extending the provisions to include civil wars. ""Most wars today are civil wars, and it is illogical to ban the use of certain weapons against foreigners but allow them against your own people,"" he said. **********The Clinton Administration favors restricting land mines and stregthening the 1980 convention, but the United States and several other NATO members have opposed placing laser weapons on the disarmament agenda. In 1988, the Defense Department ruled that laser antipersonnel weapons were legal under international law. **********But while the United States and other countries are known to be experimenting with laser weapons, very few are thought to have been deployed. **********The campaign to curb mines has gathered strength for several years as it became clear that they presented an almost insurmountable problem in countries like Afghanistan, Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia.  A Terrible Toll **********Between 85 million and 100 million antipersonnel mines are thought to be scattered around 62 countries, taking a steady toll of civilians, preventing the resettlement of refugees and making arable land unusable. Mr. Sommaruga pointed out that almost one Cambodian in 200 has lost a limb from mines, while 23 percent of all mine victims in Afghanistan in 1991-92 were children. **********But clearing mines is expensive and dangerous. The United Nations has budgeted $30 million to remove 2 million mines in Mozambique. Neutralizing mines in Cambodia is expected to cost $10 million to $15 million a year for perhaps 10 years. Kuwait has signed $700 million in contracts with private mine-clearing companies. **********Last fall Congress extended for three more years a one-year moratorium on United States exports of mines. In December the Administration wrote to 40 countries that are significant producers of antipersonnel land mines, asking them to impose a three- to five-year ban on exports. The General Assembly has also called for a moratorium."

Col. Erik de Stabenrath, traces his military heritage to a general in Napoleon's army. His paternal grandfather was an officer in World War II. His own father was an officer killed in combat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, the battle that ended French colonial rule in Vietnam. **********But as he prepares to leave in the next few days, this 42-year-old career military man, hardened by duty in Beirut and Bosnia, will not carry with him scars from battles. What will remain with him, he says, is the knowledge of what happened to Rwanda's Tutsi in the weeks before the French arrived. **********""It was the greatest massacre in world history,"" he said. ""Not in terms of numbers, but in the manner in which it was carried out -- 500,000 people killed in a few weeks.""  They Want the French to Stay **********Although the number of dead has never been reliably computed, there is general agreement that it is hundreds of thousands. The French arrived in June, too late to prevent the worst of the massacres, Colonel de Stabenrath said, but he pointed out that they came when no one else would and probably prevented further slaughter. **********Nobody will ask the people of this corner of Rwanda whether or not the 2,200 French troops should leave. But if they were asked, the answer would almost certainly be a resounding no. ""If they leave, we shall die,"" said a 34-year-old peasant woman, Marie Nyirahabiyaremye. **********The Canadian commander of the United Nations military observers in the French zone, Maj. Luc-Andre Racine, said in an interview here that some French troops should remain, particularly around the city of Cyangugu, which is west of here along the border with Zaire. Former Rwandan Government soldiers and militiamen who fled into Zaire when the Government fell last month find it easy to cross back and have engaged in sporadic looting. **********The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has asked the French to postpone the withdrawal, which is supposed to be completed by Aug. 22. There are an estimated two million people in the French zone, most of them Hutu, and relief workers are deeply concerned that if the French pull out there will be a mass exodus. **********A few weeks ago, about 300,000 fled across the border into Bukavu at the same time that more than a million refugees swamped Goma, to the north. They fled in fear of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the victorious rebel army, made up largely of the rival Tutsi tribe whose members were annihilated by Hutu militias after the start of the most recent figiting in April. **********""The wish of the great majority is for the French to remain,"" said 34-year-old Samuel Harelimana, who has a university degree in rural development and has been working for the Rwandan Red Cross and international relief agencies for the last several months. ""We have no confidence in Unamir,"" he said, referring to the United Nations mission In Rwanda.  Views Widely Held **********His views about the United Nations troops appear to be widely held among the people here. They note that the United Nations troops who were in the country in April did little to stop the massacres and that the bulk of the United Nations forces pulled out after several Belgians were killed. **********White United Nations vehicles have begun appearing in this region, but relief workers say that the United Nations troops lack the professionalism of the French soldiers. **********Major Racine acknowledged that the population's attitude toward the United Nations forces was negative. ""But if they do something concrete, the attitudes will change,"" he said. **********It was most important, he said, for food to be brought into the area, where there are an estimated half a million refugees and there is a drought. ""If you feed the people, they will stay in place,"" he said. **********But security is of equal if not greater concern among the people here. **********The precise motives for the French intervention have never been clear. Paris has always said that it was to protect the population from further massacres. But there were suspicions that France hoped to save the Hutu Government from defeat. It had long supported the Government, with arms and training, and French troops had twice arrived to save the Government from defeat at the hands of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. **********And French officers, when speaking on condition of anonymity in the last month, have said that a close relationship between members of President Francois Mitterrand's family and members of the Hutu Government also contributed to the French decision to intervene.  A Measure of Stability **********Whatever the motivations, the French have protected Hutu and Tutsi and brought a level of peace and stability to the French zone. The Patriotic Front has been kept out, the former Government soldiers have been chased out, and above all the Hutu militias have been disarmed. **********""They were very courageous when they were killing people who could not defend themselves,"" Colonel de Stabenrath said of the militias. But they did not put up any fight against the French troops. **********""I have thrown a lot of munitions into Lake Kivu,"" he said. Then in an aside, he said, ""Don't tell Greenpeace.""  Much Service in Africa **********When he arrived, Colonel de Stabenrath said, he searched and found some intellectuals, Hutu refugees, ""who could help me to understand the population."" He has done more than just learn from this group. He arranged for them to meet with commanders of the rebel front. These meetings are critical if there is to be any functioning local government when the French leave. **********For the colonel, the major breakthrough in reaching officers of the local Tutsi-led forces came when he learned that he had attended the United States Army Command and Staff College in Leavenworth, Kan., with one of their commanders. **********The officer was Paul Kagame, who had indeed left the school at Leavenworth, in October 1990, to lead the Rwandan Patriotic Front. General Kagame is now Minister of Defense and Vice President. **********As for the future in the French safety zone, Colonel de Stabenrath said it depended on the mandate the United Nations forces have. The French troops have been authorized to use force to protect civilians. But the United Nations troops will be allowed to use their weapons only in self-defense."

He sprinkled tobacco on the carpet, because the ancestors must have their snuff, and marked the sacred spot with his deceased father's wooden walking stick. Outside he planted a tiny sapling, which he named Watch Us Grow. **********The next day a ""For Sale"" sign went up at the house next door. The people on the other side left a few months later. He never caught their names. Soon more and more middle-class Sowetans replaced the departing whites. Now, two years later, his suburban town of Naturena in the red rock hills two miles east of Soweto has begun to feel like Soweto without the poverty. **********In the three years since the iron restrictions on black housing were repealed, a stream of black professionals has packed up and fled the fourth-class citizenship of township life, with the clouds of dust from red dirt roads, break-ins, carjackings and Government-issue matchbox houses. Though housing in Soweto ranges from squatters' shacks to relatively spacious brick homes in the more prosperous sections, the basic dwelling remains the bleak four-room cinder-block house. **********Few statistics are available on the number of blacks moving from Soweto or other townships into formerly all-white areas; it is commonly said that the Government does not know exactly how many people live in the townships, much less how many are leaving. **********Though millions of people are still crammed into these South African ghettos -- it is estimated that as many as four million people live in the 40 square miles of Soweto alone -- even a tiny percentage of middle-class migrants is significant. **********As blacks venture into new territory in search of the South African dream of a many-bedroomed house with a swimming pool, gardener and round-the-clock armed security response, they are leaving behind extended families and testing the possibility of integration in a country where racism was the national policy until this year. **********In some places, like the modest suburbs closest to Soweto, the arrival of blacks has set off white flight to so-called gated communities farther out. **********""They seem to be disappearing,"" Mr. Makhubela said of the white neighbors he briefly had. ""I don't know where they are going. But there are more of us than of them. Wherever they disappear, we will be there, too."" **********In the wealthier suburbs, the few black pioneers often live in cold isolation, some turning to each other for comfort and an extra cup of cornmeal, some trying to carry out their cultural rituals without interruption and returning to the townships every weekend out of homesickness. **********Dr. Benjamin Mgulwa, a family practitioner who like all urban blacks had no choice but to live in a township, moved his family from Soweto to a white suburb of broad lawns and big houses four years ago. **********At the time, apartheid prohibited blacks from buying property in white areas. So he persuaded a white sponsor to sign for him so his family could live in their chic white house with a swimming pool in front. **********Dr. Mgulwa tried to keep a low profile. But the family's dog, nervous in new surroundings, barked throughout the first night. The next morning, a sign was posted on their gate from the next-door neighbors who had yet to greet them. It said, ""Please make sure your dogs do not disturb us."" **********The next day, Dr. Mgulwa went to a veterinarian to get his dog some sedatives. ""I didn't want to irritate anybody,"" Dr. Mgulwa said. ""It was not legal to stay in a white area, and I thought they would put us out. You don't want to cause trouble."" **********A few months later, the neighbors moved. **********Others say they, too, feel as if they are walking on pins and are constantly being monitored. **********""With some white people, your child mustn't cry, your dog mustn't bark,"" said Onica Mabiletsa, a Soweto school administrator who moved from Soweto to a white suburb with her two children. **********Mrs. Mabiletsa said that whenever her children got into the swimming pool in her housing complex, the white parents immediately pulled their children out of the pool. **********""So I told my children to go in and swim first,"" she said. ""When the whites went and found my children there, they complained to the management, which came and cleaned the swimming pool with chemicals. That is when I moved."" **********The reception in a mostly white apartment building in Johannesburg was not much better. If litter is found or excessive noise is reported, the management comes to her first with a pointed finger, she said. **********""One day, a piece of tissue paper was in the hall,"" she said. ""It was not even in front of my door, but the caretaker asked me about it. I said, 'Maybe it was thrown at my children's school and it somehow flew and placed itself where it was.' They look at black people as dirty. They forget that their houses are clean because of black hands."" **********The hostility has led her to meet coldness with coldness. ""You greet them, they frown,"" Mrs. Mabiletsa said. ""They frown, I frown back. Whatever they give, I give it back."" **********Many black suburbanites tell of the times their neighbors tried to hire them as gardeners or maids. Gladness Ncobo, a real estate agent, was out in her yard planting perennials with her grown son when a neighbor came and asked if her son was available on Saturdays. **********"" 'I live here,' "" Mrs. Ncobo said, thinking that would show the neighbor that neither she nor her son was a servant. **********Then the neighbor turned to her and asked if she was available on Saturdays, she said. **********"" 'I happen to own the place,' "" Mrs. Ncobo said she told the neighbor. "" 'If you ask if I come on Saturdays, I don't know what you mean.' "" **********One of the biggest sources of friction is an old tradition of animal killing, considered sacred by some African families but frightening to their white neighbors. **********On the day he and his family moved into their new white house, Dr. Mgulwa bought a sheep and slashed its throat in the driveway near the garage where his two Mercedes-Benzes were parked. As he did so, he called out to his dead father and grandparents and the ancestors of his wife, Pamela, telling them that the family had moved, to welcome them to the new home and to ask their blessings. **********""It's a tradition,"" Dr. Mgulwa said. ""I have to do it. I could not move without telling the ancestors."" **********The sheep was skinned, and its meat was boiled for the homecoming feast. There were few repercussions, though a white neighbor stared from her second-story window during the ritual. **********In some cases, particularly when loud or larger animals like goats or cows are slaughtered, the neighbors call the police and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to stop either the slaughter or the noise. **********S.P.C.A. officials said with some frustration that blacks were within their rights because of laws protecting religious freedom. **********""It's been going on for years,"" said Marcelle Meredith, director of the society's office here. ""Only now it's being brought out of the townships and into the white community. It never worried whites until it was in their sight. Now they worry that their children have to see this."" **********When the police arrived to stop a prominent black musician from killing a cow on his property, the musician told the police they should arrest his white neighbor, too. ""Look in her refrigerator and you will find a ham,"" the musician said, operating on the logic that there was a dead animal in each house. **********Though blacks say they move into white neighborhoods because they want the paved streets, the open spaces, and the quiet nights without gunfire that white people have, some say they miss waking up to the sound of their mother tongues and the camaraderie of the townships. **********""In Soweto, you share the good and bad,"" Mrs. Ncobo said. ""Here, you don't know if your neighbor is alive or dead. Then you see the car drive up, and you know that he's alive. That's not life."" **********The blacks they leave behind in the townships have mixed feelings about the loss of some of their most stable citizens. Some are resentful and say black suburbanites should have expected hostility. **********""These people want to stay in the suburbs next to the white man they defied,"" said Godfrey Moloi, a businessman known as the godfather of Soweto. ""They look for the white people. They want to follow them from here to the Sahara. They want to sleep in his kitchen. It makes me sick."" **********But Isaac Mogase, president of the Soweto Civic Association, points out that many people died or endured captivity during the apartheid era so that blacks could eventually live and work where they wanted. ""I think they're entitled,"" Mr. Mogase said, ""to enjoy the fruits of the struggle."""

The Walt Disney Company is said to be offering nearly $5 billion for all of NBC, while Time Warner Inc. is considering a deal for mainly the television network at about $2.5 billion. **********The most glamorous component of NBC is the network, which produces and distributes entertainment and news programming. But the network has little value without the seven television stations currently owned by NBC acting as anchors in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other major markets. It also needs the 214 affiliates that carry NBC's programs in smaller cities and suburbs. **********The network's lure for national advertisers is the guaranteed distribution to 9.7 million homes on an an average evening. Advertisers have been unable to find such enormous reach elsewhere. **********Any attempt to break the NBC network off from NBC's stations would seriously weaken the network's value. That's a particularly tough problem for Time Warner, which unlike Disney or the ITT Corporation, faces intense regulatory problems since it is already the nation's second-largest cable operator. **********Because the Government precludes cable companies from owning television stations in their own markets, Time Warner and the General Electric Company, which owns NBC, have discussed a deal that would give Time Warner the network, but leave the stations in G.E.'s hands or perhaps create a joint venture owned by the two companies. **********A buyer who gets just the network does not get much, either strategically or financially. Although the numbers are not public, some analysts estimate that the NBC network will generate operating income this year of about $150 million to $220 million on sales of about $2.9 billion. That means that the NBC network may earn a profit margin of 5 to 7 percent. **********""The network itself is a low-profit- margin business, compared to the stations,"" said Michael Wolf, a partner who specializes in media companies at Booz, Allen & Hamilton, a consulting firm. ""Most of the earnings come from NBC's owned and operated stations."" **********The television stations are likely to generate operating profit of $200 million to $250 million on revenues of only about $630 million, according to Bishop Cheen, who follows broadcasting for Paul Kagan Associates, giving them a 40 percent margin. **********It is slightly easier to value NBC's major cable entity, CNBC. The financial and business service is now available in 52 million homes. Mr. Cheen recalled that Viacom Inc. received $317 million when it sold its one-third interest in Lifetime, an advertiser-supported entertainment channel available in 59 million homes, to its partners, Hearst and ABC. Thus, Lifetime would have a value of $951 million. **********""CNBC is worth at least $500 million,"" Mr. Cheen said. NBC also owns a half interest in Rainbow Programming Services, together with the Cablevision Systems Corporation; Mr. Cheen valued NBC's Rainbow stake at $350 million. **********How much is all of NBC worth? Jessica Reif, who follows the media for Merrill Lynch & Company, puts the total value at $4 billion to $4.5 billion. **********""There is scarcity value, for sure,"" she said. ""But at the same time, it is a cyclical business. It is boom times now at the networks, but they don't last forever."""

The company's credit card and stock brokerage units both performed well. **********Philip J. Purcell, Dean Witter's chairman, said in an interview that the profits in the credit card business were surprisingly high. ""The lower credit write-offs and revenue increases proved more positive than we had expected, but the trends in the basic business were what we expected,"" he said. **********The biggest growth came from its Discover credit card operation, which increased profits 85 percent, to $124 million, mainly because card holders spent more and borrowed more. Loans related to the card increased 15 percent, to $20.5 billion; fees, both from merchants and card holders, rose 26 percent, to $241.9 million. Over all, the number of accounts increased 9 percent, to 29.6 million. **********Profits at its Dean Witter securities arm, which has the country's third-largest army of stockbrokers, advanced 24 percent, to $85.5 million.

The acquisition of First Eastern, which is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and has 51 offices and $2.1 billion in assets, will give PNC Bank the leading market share in northeastern Pennsylvania, the companies said. Under the agreement, PNC Bank will pay $27 for each share of First Eastern, which closed yesterday unchanged at $26. The merger is expected to close in June.

For Professional Photographers, a Digital-Age Debate"," **********PETER B. KAPLAN'S photographs, taken from a precarious perch atop the Statue of Liberty or by hanging off the antenna of the World Trade Center, are enough to induce vertigo. But his work doesn't make his head spin as much as the topic of whether computer technology is cutting into his business. **********Mr. Kaplan sells most of his photos to advertising agencies, magazines and others who need an image but do not want to go to the trouble or expense of assigning a photographer to take a fresh photo. That picture of the Statue of Liberty, called ""Liberte Mon Amour,"" is Mr. Kaplan's best seller, earning him more than $300,000 since 1984. **********Some photographers say digitization is threatening all that. Photos are now available on CD-ROM's, allowing many people with computers to have access to the images. While Mr. Kaplan would charge $200 and up for one-time use of a photograph, these clip-art CD-ROM's, averaging about 330 photos each, cost less than $300 and the buyer can use the images over and over again at no extra charge. **********The threat to photographers is clear. Why would customers pay $200 to use a photograph once, when for a bit more they could buy the unlimited use of a substitute, along with hundreds of other photos? **********""They're destroying the business,"" Mr. Kaplan complained. **********Stock agencies, which sell and distribute photos for photographers, are scrambling to keep up with new, computerized ways of storing and viewing images. Many have begun scanning their images from traditional paper catalogues onto CD-ROM's and are wondering whether to start soliciting business on line. **********Photographers are divided in their opinions on the swift technological onslaught. Many worry over what they see as the increased opportunities for copyright infringements if companies start lifting the photos from the computerized catalogues without paying for them. Some photographers, in an effort to stay competitive, are virtually throwing away their copyrights, selling their images on clip-art photo CD-ROM's. **********Photographers who are selling clip art ""don't know the business,"" said Mr. Kaplan, who teaches a course titled ""The Business of Photography"" at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. ""Having a camera is just one one-hundredth of what photography is about. I ask them: Do you have a studio? Do you have insurance? No wonder you can give your photos away."" **********Barbara Roberts, president of FPG International, an agency in New York, agreed that the reason some photographers are signing away their rights is a simple lack of foresight. ""They're doing it for fast, upfront money,"" she said, though neither photographers nor the agencies would say how much. **********Steve Meltzer, a corporate photographer who has submitted images for several photo CD-ROM's, said clip art was supplementing rather than eroding his regular income from stock photography. **********The clip-art photographs ""are not Cartier-Bresson,"" he said. ""Although perfectly exposed and composed, they are throwaways. I don't believe I've put anybody out of work with this."" **********When West Stock, an agency in Seattle, offered a clip-photo CD-ROM series in early 1992, six of its contracted photographers walked out. The owner of West Stock, Mark Karras, defended the move, saying the images were aimed at the lower end of the market, for customers who would otherwise be deterred by traditional stock prices. **********""We have a strong stock photography business in our own right,"" Mr. Karras said. ""Why would we want to drive prices down?"" Two and a half years later, he said, he still gets good prices for traditional stock photographs. **********COMSTOCK, an agency in New York that offers catalogues on CD-ROM's but not clip-art photographs, also said its stock photo business had remained strong. **********Stock photo agencies have been around since the mid-1970's, when the Image Bank, the industry's largest agency, began selling photographs through international franchises, aiming at the advertising market. Publishers also turned to stock to illustrate textbooks and corporate annual reports. **********Today, the industry has an estimated $200 million in annual sales, and some photographers shoot solely for stock. There are about 100 large stock agencies in the United States, with about half of them in New York City. The Image Bank, based in Dallas, represents more than 450 photographers; it was acquired by the Eastman Kodak Company in 1991. **********In 1989, Comstock became the first agency to put its catalogues on CD-ROM. These images are licensed only for so-called comping -- making mock-ups of layouts -- and for in-house uses like corporate presentations. Software is used to browse through and download images at 72 dots per inch with a single image size of 5 by 7 inches. The resolution is deliberately short of magazine publication quality. If a customer decides to purchase an image, Comstock delivers a high-quality transparency. **********Other stock agencies, the Image Bank, FPG International in New York, Uniphoto in Washington and Allstock in Seattle, which was acquired in March by Tony Stone Images of Chicago, have since introduced their own CD-ROM catalogues. **********Some photographers are not convinced that their interests will be protected. The United States Commerce Department will soon release recommendations for rewriting copyright law for the digital age, but for now, digital material often falls into a gray area. **********""The problem is that nobody knows how to control copyright abuses once an image is on disk,"" said Jerry Dantzic, professor of photography at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. **********Photographers' fears are heightened by advances in digital imaging, which allow low-resolution images to be spruced up. **********Another development is on-line research of photographic archives via modem, which some in the industry see as stock photography's logical destination. **********""CD-ROM catalogues are just transitional,"" said Alan Carey, president of the Picture Agency Council of America, a trade group. He also runs the Image Works, an agency in Woodstock, N.Y. ""Within the next three years,"" he predicted, ""we will probably see 30 percent of art buyers on line."" **********NEXT month, Picture Network International of Arlington, Va., is expected to introduce ""Seymour,"" an on-line picture researching service. Twenty-five stock agencies have signed on to supply the service with photographs, said Ralph Watson, vice president of marketing and sales for the company. **********The biggest player in this field is the Kodak Picture Exchange, a 24-hour, dial-up search-and-retrieval system that started in November. Nineteen stock agencies have placed a minimum of 5,000 images each with the service, said Michael P. Harrigan, the system's markets development director. **********Subscribers get access to the archive via modem, search for images, then contact the appropriate agency for reproduction rights. Mr. Harrigan said the system had more than 500 subscribers, including advertising agencies, graphic designers and book publishers. **********""In the long run, on-line services protect copyrights,"" Mr. Carey said. A stock agent who sends transparencies for a client to view has no guarantee that an image will not be surreptitiously scanned. But on-line searches provide a record of every image viewed and downloaded. **********As an additional precaution, Mr. Harrigan said, a watermark can be added to an on-line image. **********""People are always worried,"" he said. ""There is a fear of the unknown in the digital environment."""

No longer is a canceled check enough to support a deduction. **********What's deductible has not changed, however, even if it falls under the category of a donation to a university in return for seats for the football season. In this case the school is obliged to issue a statement breaking out the deductible donation and the cost of purchasing the seats. **********But what's a school, church or hospital to do when, say, a famous French chef donates for auction a dinner for eight prepared in the winner's own kitchen? The fund-raising auction poses more complicated problems than football tickets on which the price is clearly printed. **********""That would be tricky,"" acknowledged Marcus S. Owens, technical director for exempt organizations at the Internal Revenue Service, when asked how to assess a chef's value at the charity gavel. ""But there would have to be a reasonable attempt made to establish a value."" **********Some accountants, lawyers and charity personnel have been led to believe, evidently with the encouragement of the I.R.S., that someone buying at a charity auction cannot qualify for a deductible donation by bidding more than the fair market value of an object or service. If you bid $1,000 for an autographed baseball, the thinking goes, that sets the market value at $1,000 and leaves no room for a donation to deduct. **********But Mr. Owens and an I.R.S. spokeswoman, Johnell Hunter, said that was wrong. ""The bid doesn't play a big part in this,"" Ms. Hunter said. **********In the case of the chef-prepared dinner, Mr. Owens said, the charity would probably begin by finding out the restaurant price of the meal and asking a catering service what it would charge to put it on the table. ""We're not talking about something that's necessarily easy to do,"" he said. ""But a good faith effort would have to start there."" **********For guidance, the I.R.S. has issued Publication 1771 and put out temporary rules for public comment. **********Among other things, these regulations on substantiation cover gifts made by payroll deduction, though they don't apply unless contributions reach the $250 threshold in one paycheck. Charities that collect on behalf of others, like the United Way, are treated as a single recipient. **********One thing taxpayers don't have to worry about, the I.R.S. has determined, is losing any of their deduction for an item of ""insubstantial"" value, like a lapel pin or a box of greeting cards, received after a donation."

Detectives believe the white Renault van used in the attack was altered with parts of other vehicles, either to hinder an investigation or to build a better bomb. **********To direct the full force of the blast at a Jewish community center, an interior wall of the van was reinforced with steel and then packed with bags of  earth. **********Over the weekend before the Monday morning blast, it was parked at a public lot across the street from the Hospital de Clinicas, two blocks from the bombing site. This public hospital took in the largest number of the 236 wounded in the  blast. **********Judge's Report Awaited **********The police continued raids around this capital today, hoping to get closer to the masterminds of the bombing.  The federal investigating judge, Juan Jose Galeano, is expected to make public a preliminary report next week. **********Justice Minister Rodolfo Barra announced that the Government would submit two antiterrorism bills to Congress next week. One would set prison terms of 18 to 25 years for people convicted of ""illicit terrorist association or public incitation or apology."" Another would set up a fund to reward people who give the police information on terrorist groups in Argentina. **********The Argentine Government, which seemed on Wednesday to be on the verge of breaking relations with Iran, has now decided to await the investigating judge's report. **********Asked if any conclusions had been reached about the bombing, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Guido Di Tella, said Friday at the United Nations, ""The answer is no."" **********Behind the Caution **********""We are pressed to jump to conclusions, to interrupt the procedures of the judicial process, to condemn countries that might be involved,"" he told reporters. ""We will not do that."" **********Undoubtedly, economic interests also contribute to Argentina's caution about  breaking relations with Iran hastily. Over the last decade, sales to Iran have accounted for about two-thirds of Argentina's exports to the Middle East. **********Handicapped by rising deficits in its foreign trade, Argentina historically has enjoyed a rare trade surplus with Iran. Last year, it sold goods worth $248  million to Iran, but imported only $200,000 worth of goods from Iran."

Eastern time Thursday, Northrop, a weapons company based here, would pay a lesser price for Grumman, which agreed earlier this month in secret negotiations to merge with the Martin Marietta Corporation. **********Northrop's bold but simple proposition was an attempt to force Grumman, a military contractor based in Bethpage, L.I., to sell itself through an open, public auction. Grumman, which quickly rejected the open auction proposal, has been seeking a closed auction, having imposed a 5 P.M. Thursday deadline for the two companies to submit their best and final bids. Grumman is sticking to that plan. **********But Northrop's move also underscores Mr. Kresa's dogged determination to acquire Grumman, which he has said snubbed Northrop's early attempts at merging. **********Wall Street traders said today that the Grumman and Northrop deadlines had a certain empty ring because investors were likely to tender their shares to the highest bidder, even if the offer came after Grumman's 5 P.M. deadline. Angry About a Deal **********Friends and associates of the easy-going Mr. Kresa said that beneath his methodical, conservative demeanor lies an angry man who was deeply upset by what he considered an underhanded agreement between Grumman and Martin Marietta. **********""I believe the media and Wall Street got under Kresa's skin,"" said an associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Much has been said and written of late about Northrop's inaction, and Kresa was widely viewed as being naive. I think Kresa felt that Grumman went behind his back and what we see him doing now is partly ego and anger."" **********In a letter to Grumman's board dated today, Mr. Kresa said that Northrop was prepared to raise its current offer of $60 a share to $62 a share, or a total of $2.1 billion, if Grumman signed a merger agreement by 3 P.M. Thursday -- two hours before Grumman's deadline. **********Grumman agreed on March 7 to be acquired by Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., for $55 a share, but that bid was upset by Northrop's unfriendly offer of $60 a share on March 10. **********Mr. Kresa said in the letter today that he could not accept Grumman's auction proposal and that to be fair, ""both bidders should have a reasonable opportunity to respond to each bid by the other."" **********In a response today to Mr. Kresa, Renso L. Caporali, Grumman's chief executive, said that Grumman's board ""does not believe that it would be appropriate or consistent with the objectives of the rules and procedures to adopt the proposals set forth in your March 30 letter."" It could not be learned whether Grumman's board had turned down Northrop's $62-a-share offer. **********A spokesman for Northrop, Tony Cantafio, said: ""We are sorry the Grumman board elected not to have an open and public bidding offer for shareholders. We are continuing to review our options."" **********A spokesman for Martin Marietta, Buzz Bartlett, also declined comment. **********Asked if Martin Marietta planned to participate in Grumman's proposed auction, Mr. Bartlett said: ""Whatever we do, whenever we do it, if we choose to do anything, we will make an appropriate announcement."" **********Grumman investors turned up the pressure today on the company to seek a higher bid from Martin Marietta, which has not indicated whether it will increase its offer. **********""If the company is not going to accept the Northrop proposal, we feel the basis for doing so should be that they have an ironclad assurance from Martin Marietta that they will bid at least $62 a share in the bidding process,"" said Wilbur Ross, a financial adviser to representatives of Grumman employees, who own about 32 percent of the company's outstanding shares. **********""We are uncomfortable with the board playing that kind of poker with $70 million at risk. At some point you just can't protect the low bidder, you have to think about protecting the high bidder,"" said Mr. Ross, who is senior managing director at Rothschild Inc. **********Grumman's stock closed today at $63.875, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Martin Marietta closed at $45, down 12.5 cents, and shares of Northrop were unchanged at $40.875. **********For his part, Mr. Kresa maintains that he is seeking Grumman solely because it represents the best fit for Northrop as the weapons industry consolidates amid shrinking Pentagon budgets.  'Something We Had to Do' **********""I certainly felt this bid was something we had to do given the circumstances in the defense industry today,"" Mr. Kresa said in an interview at his office here. ""I like to take actions deliberately, and I do believe this is a planned, necessary action."" **********Rising from his desk to greet a visitor this morning, Mr. Kresa was the picture of aplomb. ""My friends recognize that this is a special time for this company, and they call to see if I'm all right, but I am all right,"" Mr. Kresa said. **********John N. Simon, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, said of Mr. Kresa: ""He's less flamboyant than the previous chief executive, but he strikes me as one of those quiet people you don't want to get upset."" **********Mr. Kresa, who succeeded Thomas V. Jones as chief executive, has been with Northrop since 1975. Before serving as Northrop's president and chief operating officer, Mr. Kresa was senior vice president for technology development and planning. **********He was in charge of many of Northrop's classified military projects as manager of the company's research and technology center and as vice president for its aircraft group."

For long moments, the only sound is that of chalk being used on a small blackboard to record the sales of the 17 listed issues. **********But for all of its quiet and simplicity, Ghana's tiny but booming stock market -- up nearly 300 percent in its four years of existence -- is the latest symbol of this country's economic rebirth. **********In 1957, Ghana became the first African nation to gain independence from European colonialism. It was also one of the first to suffer a military coup, and became a pioneer in an ultimately suffocating African brand of socialism. **********But now international mutual fund managers and other foreign investors are increasingly including Ghana on their lists of must-visit developing nations. Many say that on a continent crowded with disasters wrought by decades of statist policies, this country is showing the way to recovery based on free market economics. For the last decade, the economy has grown by an annual average of 5 percent. **********""After 10 years of reforms, Ghana faces many more years of difficult choices,"" said Ravi Kambur, who completed an assignment in September as the World Bank's economist here. ""But for once the problems are those of explosive growth, not of stagnation."" **********For visitors returning after a long absence to this nation of 16 million people, evidence of that growth can be seen and felt almost everywhere. After years of little or no new building or investment, construction projects are multiplying, lending odd clumps of density to this once-diffuse city. Suddenly, the novel challenge for city planners is building new roads and widening old ones to accommodate the choking traffic. **********With its long legacy of leftist nationalism, championed by the country's founding father, Kwame Nkrumah, and still often perceptible in the speeches of the current President, Jerry J. Rawlings, Ghana might seem an unlikely candidate for an African capitalist renewal. **********But these days, traditional industries like cocoa farming and mining for gold and diamonds, both victims of prolonged neglect, are again booming. Ghanaians returning from study abroad or long stints in exile are responding enthusiastically to Government efforts to cut the red tape that once weighed down everything from foreign currency exchange to customs procedures. One result has been the accelerating return of talented young managers and entrepreneurs from abroad who are creating new businesses ranging from film studios to tourism ventures and light industries. **********""For the past 13 years I have come home every year for three weeks, but I could never stay any longer,"" said Sydney Casely-Hayford, an executive with Price Waterhouse who recently returned to Ghana from England. ""There were always too many bureaucratic hassles, having to bow and beg for what you knew was rightfully yours. But to my pleasant surprise, that is all changing."" **********Diplomats and analysts here have credited the turnaround to Mr. Rawlings and Kwesi Botchwey, the Finance Minister he appointed in 1983. **********""They went to places like Moscow and Libya to look for money first, and came up empty-handed,"" one diplomat said of Mr. Botchwey's early attempts at bringing about a recovery. ""But they decided pretty quickly that they had better try something more conventional. And to their credit they have stuck to it longer than anyone else in the region."" **********As in many developing countries where reforms promoted by the World Bank have taken hold, people here have grumbled about the rising cost of living as the value of their currency, which is now freely traded on the local currency market, has plummeted. **********But where there were few goods available on store shelves a decade ago, now shopping districts throughout Ghana are well stocked and bustling. The Government has also tried to bring modern services like electricity, clean drinking water and better roads to rural areas. **********The most remarkable reform efforts have been in selling off state companies and opening the door to foreign investors who want to buy them or invest elsewhere in this once nearly closed economy. For a country that experimented early and often with nationalization, the change is striking. **********The privatization began this year, when the Government began selling off large blocks of shares in many of the nationalized companies that have traditionally dominated Ghana's economy. The largest sell-off was for the Ashanti Goldfields Company, the huge state-dominated mining company, which brought in over $350 million for the Government. **********As privatization gathers steam so has the interest of multinational corporations, whose relative absence from this region, economists say, helps explain why Africa accounts for only about 2 percent of global trade. **********Among the examples of growing involvement of major international corporations in the last year, Starkist has opened a tuna canning factory and a subcontractor for Arrow shirts has begun producing textiles. **********Diplomats and businessmen here say that other large companies like Coca-Cola and A.T.&T. are now in discussions that are expected to lead to new investments here soon. **********""We were once in the business of regulating businesses, telling them how to use their money and what they can and cannot do,"" said Kwesi Awhoi, director of the Ghana Investment Promotion Center, which only recently added the word ""promotion"" to its name. ""For years we ran this office with highhandedness, enjoying our power and discretion even if that usually meant holding things up. Our biggest challenge now is the human factor, surrendering power and seeing things from the investor's perspective."" **********But while many Ghanaian investors applaud this kind of language, most are still impatient. **********""A lot of people come here and speak well of our 5 percent annual growth,"" said Keli Gadzekpo, executive director of Databank Financial Services, a new Ghanaian investment bank. ""The Government has to move out of the way even faster, and our growth will have to be even stronger, if we want to make up for all of the lost years and boost the standard of living for our people across the board."""

He has been widely blamed for ignoring the widespread poverty and inequality toward the indigenous people there, which are considered the primary causes of the uprising. **********Mr. Salinas said the Government ""is disposed to take actions that keep the grave events in Chiapas from leading to more confrontations.""  More Troops Move In **********Senior officials say that where force is needed it will be applied, but that true resolution of the problems in Chiapas will only come through negotiation. **********As if to emphasize the possibility of force, the army sent more than a thousand troops today into a rebel stronghold in Guadalupe Tepeaca, backed by tank-like vehicles and heavy artillery. The deployment came after rebels had removed more than 80 Government workers who had been stranded at their hospital. **********It was unclear how the army would proceed in the area. **********Some question whether the Government can score a military victory, even if that is the goal. The Mexican Army's primary role until now has been to fight drug trafficking; the troops have rarely seen combat. **********The moves in the capital toward negotiation were welcomed by Mexicans, who have been stunned by the violence and the Government's initial military response, in which innocent civilians were killed. **********""Perhaps this is a signal that the ruling group is finally recognizing that they have to be serious about democratization in Mexico."" said Sergio Aguayo, a member of the Mexican Academy of Human Rights. The Wrong Signal? **********But some analysts worry that Mr. Salinas offer of negotiations may be playing into the rebels' hands. **********""What signal goes to the rebels if they see that the Government is this willing to bargain without having yet proved that they are capable of a military response to get them to the table?"" said Federico Estevez, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technical Institute of Mexico. ""It's very risky."" Mr. Estevez spoke before the troops moved into Guadalupe Tepeaca. **********Mr. Salinas selected the former Mayor of Mexico City, Manuel Camacho Solis, to lead the talks. Mr. Camacho had been considered a leading contender to be the governing party's candidate to succeed Mr. Salinas as President, and when he was not picked in November, his anger was obvious. Mr. Salinas later named him Foreign Minister, a post that he is to surrender to lead the Chiapas negotiatons. **********Mr. Salinas also named the Attorney General, Jorge Carpizo McGregor, to replace Mr. Gonzalez Garrido as Interior Minister. The Mexican representative at the United Nations, Manuel Tello Macias, is to replace Mr. Camacho as Foreign Minister."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/26/business/hollywood-dreams-lure-3-baby-bells-to-ovitz.html,Bernard Weinraub,1994-10-26,,1048,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Hollywood Dreams Lure 3 Baby Bells to Ovitz,Hollywood Dreams Lure 3 Baby Bells to Ovitz," **********The Creative Artists Agency is expected to join with three regional Bell companies as early as next week in forming a potentially controversial venture to offer video entertainment programming for telephone customers on the East and West Coasts, movie-industry executives said today. **********The venture would involve Bell Atlantic, Nynex and Pacific Telesis, who have hired Michael Ovitz, the most powerful talent agent in Hollywood, to organize an enterprise that could provide movies and programming for as many as 46 million businesses and homes. Representatives of the agency and the three telephone companies are planning to work through the weekend to complete the deal. **********The planned collaboration would be the latest and biggest effort by the Baby Bells, which have ample cash reserves, to make competitive inroads against cable systems by using phone lines running into homes and allowing millions of subscribers to call up interactive and entertainment services. **********People involved in the negotiations said today that the entertainment programming service, which will operate by phone and be viewed on television screens, is to start on a small scale on the East Coast late next year and rapidly accelerate on both coasts in 1996. **********The three phone companies would put up at least $500 million to start the venture, in which the Creative Artists Agency will serve as strategic consultants. **********Federal Communications Commission rules will require any Bell company to set up a programming company separate from its telephone services organization in providing video this way. **********Under the Ovitz plan, negotiators said, the phone companies and the agency are setting up two new companies. One would develop and distribute programs and services -- including movies, video on demand, home shopping, games, conventional television shows and interactive programs. The other company would provide the technological skills crucial in expanding the venture on both coasts. Creative Artists Agency will advise both companies. **********What makes the deal unusual is that Mr. Ovitz and his agency are playing a defining role in the effort. Rival agents as well as top studio executives said today that the role of the Creative Artists Agency raises the potential of conflict of interest for a talent agency that would provide actors, writers and directors to a venture it helped create. Privately, the agency categorically denies any conflict. **********The arrangement, rumored for weeks, was disclosed today by Variety, the trade newspaper. Mr. Ovitz and the representatives of the phone companies declined to comment publicly, except to say that talks were taking place. But representatives of the phone companies have already assured two Creative Artists Agency rivals, International Creative Management and the William Morris Agency that there was no conflict of interest and that all talent agencies would serve essentially on a more or less equal basis in providing talent to the new enterprise. **********Reaction to Mr. Ovitz's link with the three phone companies varied sharply. A top cable executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""I think Michael's on a grand publicity tour. They make these announcements, but there's so little flesh on the bone. What are these guys talking about?"" **********The head of a major talent agency and an Ovitz rival said that the arrangement essentially puts Creative Artists Agency on the same level as a film studio or cable television outlet, all but reversing the usual role of an agent. **********But Thomas Pollack, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group, said: ""We are makers of product, and we welcome new channels of distribution for our product. If this comes to pass, it's a good thing for the studios."" **********Executives and agents say that Mr. Ovitz, by sharing ownership in the enterprise, risked compromising his position as an agent. **********""The Baby Bells are entitled to get and pay for advice from whomever they want, including Mike Ovitz,"" a top studio executive said. ""But once it starts looking like an ownership position in this company, then that would be a concern not only to the studios but also to the talent guilds that have prohibitions against that."" **********However, informants involved in the negotiations said Mr. Ovitz's agency would not serve as an owner of the new service. Instead, the Creative Artists Agency -- whose client roster includes the likes of Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Kevin Costner and Sylvester Stallone -- is to be a strategic adviser and will receive continuing fees, people at the agency said. **********An official involved in negotiations said Mr. Ovitz's agency would provide guidance on ""strategic consulting services in the areas of personnel, deal architecture and alliances."" At the same time, the official said, it would help create the new system's ""navigator,"" or guide, to provide easy access to programming. **********""We want customers to access the system with the same ease that helps them access the telephone,"" the official said. ""That's the goal -- to make it as easy as using the telephone."" **********The new programming service is tentatively scheduled to start late in 1995 in the Washington, D.C., area. The three phone companies are to pool at least $500 million over the next three years to assemble the initial programming package. **********Over all, the seven regional Bell companies are planning to spend as much as $30 billion in the next 10 years to change telephone wiring across the nation to ultimately provide access, over the phone, for customers seeking movies on their television screens -- or TV shows, or video games or interactive programming. **********Mr. Ovitz and his team have been working on the current deal for nearly two years, people at Creative Artists Agency said. In recent months, a new executive there, Robert Kavner, formerly chief of multimedia at the AT&T Corporation, has shaped the effort among Bell Atlantic, Nynex and Pacific Telesis, which cover such cities as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco. **********Reports of the discussions among the three phone companies began circulating in August, about the same time that the Walt Disney Company announced a deal with Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell -- since renamed SBC Communications -- to develop, market and deliver programming."

Neither the Treasury nor the Fed normally comments on such interventions. **********Traders said the Government bought dollars for a second day to underline its commitment to keeping the dollar strong. Many expect the Fed to add muscle to the purchases by raising interest rates, perhaps today. **********""People are starting to believe that the U.S. is serious about defending the dollar,"" said David Durst, a currency options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company. ""If the Fed follows this with a rate increase, the dollar will turn around."" **********Higher rates would ease traders' concern that the Fed has acted too slowly so far this year to control the inflation that often accompanies economic growth. Those concerns have dragged down the prices of Treasury bonds for much of this year. Currency dealers have been following the bond market to gauge foreign demand for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them. **********The Fed started buying dollars just after 11 A.M. in New York and made its last purchase around 1:20 P.M., traders said. Other central banks did not assist the Fed yesterday or on Wednesday, they said. **********""The Fed just kept buying, wave after wave,"" said Karl Halligan, vice president for strategic trading at CF-CIC Bank New York. He said the Fed wisely waited until London, the world's largest foreign exchange market, was closing; trading volume was then dwindling, giving the purchases more punch. ""It was a smart move by the Fed,"" Mr. Halligan said. **********In New York, the dollar jumped as high as 98.26 yen as the Fed bought, its highest level since Oct. 17, and up from a post-World War II low of 96.12 yen set in intraday trading early yesterday. The dollar settled at 97.72 yen, up from 97.63 yen on Wednesday. The dollar rose as high as 1.5247 marks before finishing at 1.5187 marks, up from 1.5138. The British pound fell to $1.6165 from $1.6225. **********But the dollar failed to rise further on the Fed's efforts, in part because Treasury bonds remained weak."

In his novel ""1984,"" Orwell predicted that communications and technology would become tools of a new form of totalitarian government. But Mr. Huber say these advances have worked against central governments, placing information and processing power in the hands of millions **********Among policy mavens, Mr. Huber is an unusual figure. Trained as an engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and as a lawyer at Harvard, he is now a consultant and part-time journalist whose work ranges from detailed industry analyses to novels. **********In 1987, he prepared a huge and much-quoted study for the Justice Department, arguing that the regional Bell companies should be freed from restrictions that barred them from providing information services, entering the long-distance business and manufacturing equipment. **********Today, a prolific freelance writer, he works from his home in Bethesda, Md., serving as a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a public policy research center, and a partner in a small law firm. **********His latest project, to be published this year, is the novel ""1994 and After,"" which flips Orwell's nightmarish vision of 1984 into a utopia. **********Question: You think Orwell was wrong in ""1984,"" and you're not worried about the wave of recent mergers in cable and telecommunications? **********Answer: I would be worried if I thought we were going to be dependent on one company, but the trends seem to be in the other direction. What I see is this fractious crowd of Hatfields and McCoys, with all of them competing with each other.  That's usually a good sign. If you compare where we were 10 years ago when the breakup of A.T.& T. was just consummated, there's far more competition now. There are more providers of many more kinds of services. People mix up the sheer size of this industry and the enormous sums being invested with the idea that one company is taking over. **********Q: What do you think are the prospects for achieving ""open access"" to advanced networks, as Vice President Al Gore has called for? **********A: It is happening. All the market and technological imperatives are toward more open systems. Once upon a time, I.B.M. was sued for having a proprietary system, so that if you bought its computer you would have to buy its drive, its peripherals, its software. Today, I.B.M. is running ads showing a big glass sliding door and saying it will connect with anybody. **********Today, none of the Bell companies are anywhere near big enough to dictate standards. If they did, everybody would ignore them. **********The problem with this notion of ""access"" is that it is used so loosely.  People toss it out without any clear conception of what it means. Do we mean free access? Surely not. Someone has to pay the freight somewhere. **********Calling for open access is like being in favor of motherhood. It sounds good, but all the important questions are in the details. Open access at what level of the network, at what price and by whom? **********If you look at cable, the video end of things, one of the biggest challenges is to make sure that people don't have access that is too open. The key challenge is to make sure people don't steal your product. **********Q: Would all of the frenzy be taking place even if the White House was not highlighting the industry? If so, what is the role of the Government? **********A: Certainly, if you look at the White House and Congress, it's been a catch-up role. The Federal Communications Commission has been more on the ball. A lot of the role of the Government now is clearing away the regulatory and legal underbrush that's been inherited from the past and has simply been overtaken by the market. **********But the second thing is to make sure that investment gets spread around, and that we don't have ""doughnut"" networks that circle a city and leave the inner cities unwired.

Debate Over Soldiers' Duty **********Their denunciations added to an already intense public debate over whether soldiers should defy orders to evacuate settlers on religious grounds. A call for such defiance came this week from some leading rabbis, and was denounced by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a step toward destroying the Israeli Army he once commanded. **********But for many who journeyed here by car and bus, the goal was not only to condemn Mr. Rabin but also to worship on the ground that covers Dr. Goldstein, who massacred at least 29 Muslims at prayer in Hebron on Feb. 25 and then was beaten to death. **********Whether young or old, wearing the knitted yarmulkes of modern Orthodox Zionists or the black suits of the Hasidim, they approached the burial mound, surrounded by stones placed in mourning, as though it were a shrine. **********Dozens hugged and kissed the tombstone. Some kneeled to kiss the grave itself, including one young man who cried out: ""Hero of Israel! Hero of Israel! There should be more like him."" 'Like Touching the Saint' **********A bearded man covered his head with a white prayer shawl that he said had belonged to Dr. Goldstein. Then he urged other men also to put it on because ""it is like touching the saint."" Many men there briefly wrapped themselves in the shawl. **********""If he stopped these so-called peace talks, then he is truly holy because this is not real peace,"" said Yosef Israel Schneerson, who lives in Qiryat Malachi, near Israel's Mediterranean coast, and says he is a distant relative of the leader of the Lubavitcher Hasidim, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. **********A middle-aged woman from Lod stood by the grave and called out, ""He is a saint! He has saved us!"" **********""We came here to salute this righteous man,"" she said later. ""As Jews, we're not allowed to kill. But it says in the Torah that with those who want to kill you, you must kill them first."" **********After prayers, half a dozen Hasidim sang and danced in a small circle by the grave. One man in a knitted yarmulke stood behind the tombstone, children at his side, and handed a camera to his wife. **********""Did you make sure to get this in it?"" he asked her, pointing down to the tombstone as she snapped the picture. A Substantial Turnout **********While the Israelis who worship the Brooklyn-born Dr. Goldstein are a small minority, the numbers turning out today -- the first time since the massacre that they could reach this settlement en masse and therefore in relative safety -- suggested that they may be more than the minuscule fraction the Government claims. Unquestionably, many among the thousands at the rally shared the passions that drove Dr. Goldstein even if they were not prepared to pray at his grave. **********Organizers had wanted to march on Hebron to mark the 26th anniversary of the return of Jews to that predominantly Arab town after nearly four decades of absence that began with a 1929 massacre of 67 Jews there. But the Government said no, fearing disturbances that could spin out of control, and so the protesters had to settle for Qiryat Arba. **********They described Israel as being endangered by a Government that talks about territorial compromise with the Palestine Liberation Organization and drops broad hints that it may move the Israelis in Hebron, a town venerated by both Jews and Muslims. **********Casting themselves as the victims, particularly of Arab terrorism, some pinned yellow Stars of David to their clothes, similar to the badges the Nazis made Jews wear. And there were two new Israeli victims of violence today: an elderly man who died of wounds inflicted by ax-wielding Palestinians two days ago, and a young man stabbed to death in what the police said may have been a political act although they did not rule out criminal motives. 'Most Perfidious Government' **********""This is the most perfidious government that ever existed,"" said Karen Sinai, who immigrated three years ago from Providence, R.I. She turned out wearing a yellow star with the inscription ""Prisoner of Zion,"" a term once used for Jewish dissidents in the former Soviet Union. **********Moshe Dann, a writer and tour guide from Jerusalem, wore no such badge but he agreed with the sentiments it symbolized. ""The Middle East is based on precedents,"" he said. ""If you move the Jews out of Hebron, it opens up the whole thing and you don't know where it will end."" **********But Rehavam Zeevi, a former general who leads the far-right Moledet party and who urges transferring Palestinians out of the territories, told the crowd, ""Our return to Hebron is not open for discussion. If Hebron falls, Jerusalem falls."" **********A subtext to the protest was a religious ruling by a group of 200 rabbis -- including a former Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Avraham Shapira -- who gathered in Qiryat Arba earlier this week. Soldiers, they asserted, must refuse to obey any order to remove Jews from Hebron or other parts of the territories. A Duty to Disobey **********""The Torah forbids evacuation from parts of the Land of Israel,"" Rabbi Shapira said, comparing it to biblical injunctions against Jews' eating pork. ""Maimonides says that even if a king orders us to break the laws of the Torah, we must not listen to him."" **********While hardly a religious figure, former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir issued a similar call today in a radio interview.

B shares entitle foreigners to equal dividends and voting rights as Chinese investors who have A shares in the same companies. **********China's currency, the yuan, is not yet freely convertible. This, according to Mr. Bei, remains a greater obstacle to change in the eyes of the central People's Bank of China than worries about increased foreign ownership of the country's leading industrial concerns. **********""We could just allow these joint ventures to convert their money as other joint ventures do,"" said Mr. Bei, referring to the nationwide system of foreign-exchange markets that are restricted to government- approved export and joint- venture companies. ""But there is concern that this could be wrongly interpreted as a signal of the pace of the overall convertibility policy."" **********Allowing foreign institutional money into China's domestic markets would help tame their endemic volatility, supporters of such a move have argued, as professional money managers are likely to take a more sober view of day- to-day trading than millions of individual Chinese investors for whom investment is little more than gambling. **********But the recent weak performance of most Asian markets, particularly Hong Kong's, which have suffered as U.S. interest rates rise and fears grow that American investors will withdraw, has given some officials pause, Mr. Bei said. **********""We have seen that institutional investors can have short-term views and the impact of large-scale capital flows on local currencies, too,"" he said. **********Despite the debate, which is part of broader deliberations about the stock market's continuing role in changing China's financial system, Mr. Bei predicted that a ""few"" joint- venture funds would obtain permission to buy A shares in 1995. **********""Merging the A- and B- share markets has always been our target,"" said Mr. Bei. ""The real issue is the question of timing."" **********At a time when B shares and other Chinese companies listed on exchanges in Hong Kong, New York and elsewhere are slumping, the choice of hundreds more traded only in China under less- stringent corporate governance hardly appears necessary. **********But when first vaguely suggested in August in a package of measures designed to boost local-investor confidence in fledgling markets, which had slid to perilous lows, the move helped drive up markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. **********While local investors assumed more new cash would soon lift their shares out of the doldrums, foreign securities firms quickly lined up potential local partners and sent proposals to Beijing, where signs of action are scant. **********In the interim, the A-share market has lost about 40 percent of its value since reaching highs in September. The B- share market has fallen by about 25 percent over the same period. **********""So far, China has done a lot to develop the market, but we need more industries and more companies to chose from,"" said Paul Vibert, head of research at Baring Securities in Shanghai. **********""Even if there are only 20 or 30 jewels among hundreds of A-share companies, which I think there may be, the exercise is worth it,"" he added. **********Many analysts said they believed that in the short-term A-share companies would be forced to improve their overall performance and corporate- reporting standards as Chinese investors begin to value companies on a more sophisticated, foreign investor-influenced basis. **********But the price of such change may be less direct control over such enterprises by Beijing or by provincial governments and state agencies, which dominate their share registries. **********Local securities houses, keen to develop their fund- management experience, also believe that the first joint-venture funds approved will be approved in 1995, although few claim to know the status of the deliberations in Beijing. **********""We are talking with many foreign groups now to pursue this business,"" said Cory Hong, deputy general manager of Shanghai International Securities Co., one of China's largest, of the joint-venture A- share fund plan under consideration. **********Shanghai Securities is aiming to set up a $100 million fund in tandem with a major foreign-fund management group, but has not yet settled on a partner. **********""The fund industry in China is at an early stage, there are not a lot of regulations,"" said Mr. Hong. ""I think after we get new regulations from the PBOC for the domestic market, then next year, we will see approval granted for the joint venture funds."""

""To the extent that we can influence China, we want to do so. But we must balance economic interest, which is not an easy task. You have to be careful how you do that to avoid just giving competitors an advantage."" **********Each year in June the Administration decides whether to renew China's most favorite nation benefits, which allow it to export products to the United States at the lowest possible tariff rate. That decision depends on China's ability to meet certain minimum human rights standards, like accounting for political prisoners or ceasing the use of prison labor for exports. **********""If the decision was made today, I assume China would lose its M.F.N. privileges,"" Mr. Bentsen said. ""But we have until June and hopefully we can work it out."" **********Mr. Christopher's recent visit to China has been widely criticized within the Clinton Administration and White House, because it transformed an issue that was best dealt with in a quiet low-key fashion into a high profile spat between the two countries."

Does their unique economic system give them an unfair advantage over Western competitors? Do they need cruel and unusual trade treatment to whip them into line? **********President Bill Clinton's aggressive trade policy toward Japan assumes that the answer to these questions is ""yes."" The idea is that Japan's economic philosophy is so far removed from that of other countries, so impervious to Western open-market concepts, that the only answer is to rig the rules against Japan through import quotas and managed trade. **********Japan, in other words, must be forced to become a normal country. **********Ahead of Mr. Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington next month, U.S. officials are trying to browbeat a bitterly reluctant Japan into agreeing to such an approach. But the premises on which the approach is based are eroding. **********Of course Japan is different, but it is rapidly becoming less so. Indeed, according to two new assessments by American specialists, Japan is getting more and more like America - perhaps more so than it wants. With luck, that should in turn make Americans less paranoid about Japan. **********Frederik L. Schodt has acquired a deep knowledge of Japan, working, as he puts it, ""on the front lines of communications between Japan and America,"" as a writer and interpreter. **********In his book ""America and the Four Japans,"" he said the Japanese, particularly the younger generation, are starting to think and even look like Americans. ""The Japanese mind is being Americanized,"" he said. **********What is more, he observed, Japan is beginning to be touched by some of the worst aspects of American society, including drugs, juvenile delinquency, a waning work ethic, an overemphasis on consumption and falling literacy among the young. Even Japan's cherished racial homogeneity is fraying. **********The economy, too, is fast losing its uniqueness, according to Gary R. Saxonhouse, a professor at the University of Michigan, who maintains that Japan's days as an unrivaled economic superstar are over. **********Japan's annual economic growth rate, he said, after peaking at 12 percent in the early 1970s, is in a slide that could soon end with it settling at the much lower levels of the other advanced industrial countries. If and when that happens, Japan's share of global output will also stop rising and probably start to fall. **********""While the emergence of Japan as a new economic power seems very recent, Japan may never be much more important relatively speaking than it is today,"" Mr. Saxonhouse wrote in International Economic Insights magazine. ""Most assuredly, Japan is in long- term structural decline."" **********Mr. Saxonhouse said Japan was so close to the technological frontier that it was losing the ""latecomer benefits"" it enjoyed for much of the postwar period. It is much easier to grow fast when you are racing to catch up with your rivals, the argument runs; after you have caught them, the way ahead suddenly becomes much harder. **********Japan's financial system is already looking more like that of the United States, with Japanese companies increasingly issuing securities to raise money, rather than going to the bank. As a result, Mr. Saxonhouse said, profits will displace market share as the watchword for Japanese business. **********To get out of its economic difficulties, Japan will have to move further in the Western direction, deregulating its economy and giving consumers greater power, not least through cuts in income tax, as the United States has long urged. In that sense, Japan's new leaders increasingly accept that the country must become more normal. **********The aging of the population will hasten the process. By early next century, both the country's labor supply and its vaunted savings rate will start to slide. **********That means that in the coming years Japan is going to spend more, import more and export relatively less than it does now. The problem of the seemingly intractable Japanese trade surplus will, in Mr. Saxonhouse's words, ""diminish if not evaporate."" **********So it makes even less sense for Washington to try to press Japan into the American mold by brute force. Of course, there is plenty of room for improvement in Japan's trade practices. But Japan is not quite so different, or quite such a threat, as many Americans still seem to think."

Many Israelis Unhappy, Too **********""They don't have any weapons except writing reports,"" Sheik Mohammed Kafrawi told Muslim worshipers at midday prayers today at Al Aksa mosque in Jerusalem. In a reference to international forces sent to Bosnia, he said: ""Did they prevent crimes against Muslims? No, they didn't."" **********Similarly unhappy were many Israelis, especially on the political right. They denounced the agreement announced on Thursday by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization as a capitulation on a matter that had been almost an article of faith here since the West Bank and Gaza Strip were captured in the 1967 Middle East war. **********Until now, Israel had never permitted an armed international presence in the territories. The new accord, rightist leaders warned, sets a precedent that will undermine Israeli sovereignty and pave the way for more foreign forces elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza, and ultimately Jerusalem. **********Some Israeli critics also cautioned that unpredictable events -- the shooting or kidnapping of one of the foreigners, for example -- could create hard feelings that damage Israel's relations with the countries forming the force. **********""You start processes that can spin out of control, especially on the ground,"" said Dore Gold, a defense specialist with the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. 'Hysterical,' Peres Says **********But Foreign Minister Shimon Peres rejected the right-wing criticism as ""hysterical"" and said that nothing decided for Hebron would be a precedent for other parts of the occupied territories. Echoing Mr. Rabin's remark on Thursday, he said Israel was paying a ""very heavy price"" for a massacre that had been carried out by a settler using an Israeli Army-issue assault rifle and wearing an army uniform. **********For the most part, Israeli officials viewed the acceptance of pistol-carrying foreigners -- after the Prime Minister initially had flatly rejected such a force -- as unavoidable. It is necessary, they said, to try to put the massacre behind them and to focus on a larger goal: resuming talks with the P.L.O. on bringing about Palestinian self-rule and a companion Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. **********The aim is to speed the Gaza-Jericho negotiations so that they can be concluded in a few weeks. An obvious target date is April 13, when the Israeli withdrawal was originally supposed to have been completed under the ""Declaration of Principles"" signed at the White House last September. **********But disputes over security and economic arrangements have made a hash of deadlines, and officials here say that it is unlikely that all remaining loose ends can be tied up in less than two weeks. Mr. Rabin, aides say, opposes moving forces from Gaza and Jericho until the details are settled. **********Still, some measures are possible before April 13 to show Israelis and, perhaps even more so, Palestinians, that change is at hand. One planned action is to have a contingent of Palestinian police officers arrive next week in Gaza and Jericho, probably several hundred people who will work out the logistics of a future force of 8,500 to 10,000. **********Precisely when this advance corps will arrive is not clear, and the same holds for the foreign force -- 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes and 35 Italians whose mandate is for three months, with an option for renewal. It is also not clear what exactly this force would do if faced with disturbances by Arabs or Jews in Hebron. **********Under the agreement, the foreigners are to be known as observers because they ""have no military or police functions."" Instead, they are to monitor events and report to a joint Israeli-Palestinian authority. **********""There was mutual interest to calm the situation, to create a feeling of safety,"" said Uri Savir, an Israeli negotiator and the Foreign Ministry's Director General. ""If an international presence can help, it's not just a Palestinian interest. It could be an Israeli interest. The security responsibility remains Israeli."" **********Mr. Savir said it was also important that the P.L.O. not look so weak politically that ""it cannot carry out the agreement."" **********But many Palestinians were unimpressed, especially since the P.L.O. had at first demanded that all settlers be disarmed and that the ones in Hebron be removed. ""Why is it that after every disaster that hits our people, we come forward with demands the size of a pyramid and end up with a sprinkling of sand?"" An-Nahar, an East Jerusalem newspaper, said in a commentary today."

What are the economics of retiring to a foreign country as far as Medicare and Social Security are concerned? GEORGE VAKKUR, Northampton, Mass.  A.

For example, Medicare will pay for emergency care in a qualified Canadian or Mexican hospital for United States residents if it is more accessible than an American hospital. **********As for Social Security, United States citizens can receive benefits outside the country as long as they are eligible. If your eligible dependents and survivors live in another country, they can also collect benefits based on your Social Security record. **********""If you are not a citizen of the U.S.,"" said Peter DiSturco, New York regional commissioner of the Social Security Administration, ""in certain countries, checks may not be sent to your dependents or your survivors unless they had first met specific residency requirements in the U.S. In other countries, your checks will stop after you have been out of the country six months."" **********Social Security has a pamphlet called ""Your Social Security Checks While You Are Outside the United States.""

Will his failure to report forged checks within 14 days bar him from recovery from the bank? ALJ SANFORD LEVINE, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.  A. Generally not. The bank is liable when it pays on a bad check. But the account holder has a responsibility, too, to report discrepancies in a timely manner. This notice allows the bank to stop payment on any missing checks or to close the account if necessary. **********""The 14-day rule only applies to repeated forgeries by the same wrongdoer,"" said Tom Greco, associate general counsel of the American Bankers Association. If a forged check shows up on your statement and you don't report it within 14 days, the bank will cover the loss. But if the same person forges more checks, the bank does not have to cover those losses, although it might agree to do so.  Co-Signing a Mortgage  Q. What are the consequences to the estate of someone who co-signs for a long-term mortgage with a child and predeceases the mortgage period? Does the liability travel to the spouse of the deceased co-signer, who is joint tenant on all assets? VIRGILIO VIRIANO, Northport, L.I.  A. When you co-sign an obligation, you are just as liable for repayment as the borrower. And if your joint accounts pass to your spouse after you die, your spouse will be encumbered with any remaining liability. State laws dictate what portion of jointly held assets are deemed to be yours, as far as creditors are concerned."

Risks That Often Become Personal"," **********AFTER spending eight years at I.B.M. fresh out of college, Hugh Aiken embarked on a career starting businesses, turning them around, getting them out of debt and building them up. **********""Ever since 1973, I have always been at least part owner of the companies where I've worked,"" said Mr. Aiken, who at 50 is president of the Atchinson Casting Corporation, a foundry in Atchinson, Kan. **********Underlining his commitment to the business, he has tied up most of his assets in it. ""I put what was left of my life savings in this company when I came in 1991,"" said Mr. Aiken. At the beginning, Mr. Aiken owned about 8 percent of Atchinson Casting. He took the company public last year to raise money to pay down debt, and now owns about 4 percent. **********Financial planners say Mr. Aiken is a typical entrepreneur in that he is willing to plow all his energies -- and his assets -- into his work. ""I guess it's risky to put everything in the business,"" Mr. Aiken said. ""But I think it's necessary if you want to be part owner and reach your business goals."" Of course, his own financial future is at great risk. Even if the company is right on course, he cannot count on financial security. **********Turnaround artists and entrepreneurs often find themselves in dicey situations with less control of their fate than they expected. Although Mr. Aiken is usually the boss, he is often not the largest shareholder of the companies where he works. ""I've been at companies where I've had 20 percent of the stock and the major investor wanted to sell and I didn't want to sell,"" he said. Tough luck. **********On a couple of occasions, he was brought in to salvage a struggling company. ""As soon as it turned around, the majority shareholders would be so happy, they would jump at the first buyout offer,"" he said. ""And I would be so disappointed."" **********Mr. Aiken said he was more comfortable in his current situation because the company is public and has many shareholders. Of course, public companies can be sold, too. It happened to a computer company when he was at the helm. When shares in the troubled company rose from a nickel apiece to 25 cents, another company offered $2 a share. ""The shareholders said, 'Wow, we better not miss this train,' "" Mr. Aiken recalled. **********Entrepreneurs can be divided into two groups, with different financial planning problems. Mr. Aiken falls into the cateogory of established entrepreneurs. They think less about their financial security than about their business goals. ""They forget where they end and the business begins,"" said Larry Elkin, a financial planner in Hastings, N.Y. **********Entrepreneurs just getting started have other financial concerns. Mr. Elkin describes a kinship with these people because he left Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, in late 1992 to set up his own practice. ""A lot of people who are just starting out have parachuted out of corporate environments and lack the skills to be entrepreneurs,"" he said. ""They need to focus on the basics like cash flow, setting up an office, building the business, thinking about career goals."" **********Once these business people have tackled the basic problems, it's time for them to step back and chart a long-term financial plan. William P. Costarides, a Prudential Securities broker in Mobile, Ala., who has worked with entrepreneurs the last decade, identified three common mistakes: *********** Owning too much company stock. Most entrepreneurs, like Mr. Aiken, have their entire net worth tied up in the company. **********Sometimes, business owners cannot sell their shares without serious consequences for the company. And sometimes they are not allowed to sell, as in the first few months after a public offering. When they do dump stock, they may drive down prices. **********""If a company goes public, it might issue five million shares, and the C.E.O. holds two million,"" Mr. Costarides said. ""If he starts to sell, the message the market gets is that he doesn't have confidence in the future of his company. In addition, he generates a huge tax liability."" **********Sometimes, company owners view their stock emotionally rather than as an investment. ""They typically think they have control over the destiny of their own company,"" Mr. Costarides said. ""There's a lot of emotional attachment. They feel comfortable with it."" **********Trying to help executives understand why they cannot bring themselves to sell their stock is part of Mr. Costarides' work. Is it an emotional issue? Is it the fear of making a statement to the marketplace? By working through the reasons, the entrepreneur may find a solution. *********** Ignoring retirement planning. ""Many business owners believe that if they just work really hard, their company will take care of their retirement,"" Mr. Costarides said. **********They often fail to set up a retirement plan. Other owners set up plans -- like 401(k) plans -- that are good for employees but inadequate for them because of rules limiting the amount of compensation that can be used to calculate contributions. Mr. Costarides frequently recommends a deferred compensation plan to help business owners save for retirement. *********** Misinterpreting risk tolerance. Many entrepreneurs believe that because they took the risk of starting a company, they have a high risk tolerance. Then they make other investments that are too risky, particularly considering their circumstances. **********Other entrepreneurs take the opposite approach, reasoning that because their company ownership is so risky they must make highly conservative investments. In reality, entrepreneurs need a well-balanced portfolio of investments.THERE'S LIFE AFTER THE BUSINESS **********PERHAPS the biggest mistake among entrepreneurs is failing to make a succession plan. ""They don't mind writing wills and talking about what will happen after they die,"" said Larry Elkin, a financial planner in Hastings, N.Y. ""But talk to them about leaving the business on their own two feet, and they break out in a cold sweat."" **********Because business owners fail to plan for who will succeed them, only 3 in 10 family businesses survive into the second generation, according to Wendy C. Handler, an assistant professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. Only 1 in 10 survive into the third generation. ""The average life span of a family business is 24 years,"" she said. **********The experts who help with succession planning fall into two camps. One is an estate planner, typically a lawyer, who sets up a financial plan. **********The other is a management and psychological counselor who helps the family overcome emotional barriers to passing on the business. ""Family business is really about family issues being acted out on the stage of the business,"" said Richard Narva, a partner at Genus Resources in Needham, Mass. ""These issues usually need to be addressed before you can come up with a financial plan."""

When Listener and Artist Can Make Music Together"," **********TWO years ago, the rock musician Todd Rundgren, who had his greatest commercial success in the 1970's with such Top 40 singles as ""Hello, It's Me,"" had a 90's idea. Instead of the standard album, which begins at the beginning and ends at the end, he wanted to present 1,500 interlocking musical segments to be arranged and rearranged by the listener at will. **********""I visited every major record label and explained what I wanted to do,"" the 45-year-old musician recalled recently. ""They reacted with horror. They had no mechanism to deal with it themselves, and the idea threw them into complete confusion."" **********He finally found a home for the interactive ""No World Order"" album on the Phillips CD-I format -- a cross between a regular music compact disk and the type of computer disk known as a CD-ROM, which can store text, video and audio. Although Phillips Interactive Media agreed to publish the album, which came out last September, Mr. Rundgren's own production company in Sausalito, Calif., assumed the normal record company duties of marketing and promotion. Buyers, whom Mr. Rundgren estimates at 10,000, are able to use a CD-I television set-top player to change the tempo, pitch and sequence of the 1,500 brief musical segments. **********The reception would presumably be more favorable if Mr. Rundgren were to take his idea to record executives today. There are now more than a dozen interactive recorded music titles on the market, and major record companies are looking for ways to integrate the sights and sounds of music videos with the user interaction of personal computers -- MTV meets the PC, in other words. **********Thus far, even some of the best sellers, like Peter Gabriel's $59.95 ""Xplora 1"" and the $39.95 interactive version of the Beatles' movie ""A Hard Day's Night,"" have probably sold no more than 70,000 copies each. But such titles, produced and distributed not by record companies but by specialized multimedia houses, have attracted sufficient attention that several record labels have created a new job category -- director of interactive media -- in hopes of finding the music industry's next big market. **********""We don't expect to make money at this time, but we want to get in as deeply as we can,"" said Cynthia Bryce, who oversees interactive music development as part of her duties as vice president of creative projects for Virgin Records America in Beverly Hills, Calif. **********As further evidence of the industry's interest in interactive products, yesterday in San Francisco the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences -- the Grammy people -- held a seminar previewing several works on the music of John Lennon, the rock group Yes and the musician-technologist Thomas Dolby. **********There is no single definition for the interactive music genre. It can be used to tell a story, provide history and background, or play a game. Nor is there a common technical standard for producing interactive music; although all the titles are currently produced on the same size CD-ROM disk, not all of them can be used on the same machines. **********Mr. Rundgren's ""No World Order,"" for example, is intended for playback on the television set-top players that work with the Phillips CD-I format. Users manipulate the sights and sounds with a device resembling a TV remote control unit. **********IN contrast, ""20 Years of Rock & Roll"" -- a $49.95 CD-ROM compilation of photos, video clips and music samples from the lives and careers of the sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson and their band, Heart -- is being distributed by Compton's New Media only in a format that works with I.B.M.-compatible PC's running Microsoft's Windows software. **********Other ""platforms"" for interactive music titles include Apple Macintosh computers, Sega CD video-game players and hybrid computer-television multimedia machines based on technology from 3DO Inc. Although some titles can be played on various platforms, or have been produced in multiple formats, in many cases there is no guarantee that the interactive music CD-ROM a consumer may want will be playable on the machine that consumer has at home. **********Because multimedia technology isfinding its market, record labels run the risk that a dominant platform at the beginning of a music product's development cycle may be out of favor -- or even obsolete -- by the time the title goes into distribution. ""The technology is changing so rapidly we know that anything we put out today won't stay current for very long,"" said Ms. Bryce at Virgin Records. **********As a result, the first interactive music CD-ROM's sponsored by the record companies will probably hedge their technical bets. When Island Records releases its first interactive product this fall, ""Cranberries Interactive"" by the Irish band The Cranberries, the disk will be playable on a Windows or Macintosh computer, a CD-I player or -- without the interactive capabilities -- a standard music CD player. **********""Right now, CD-ROM's uses are geared toward educational and informational,"" said Len Fico, vice president for artist and repertoire for Island Records in New York. ""It will only become a major entertainment force when the technology is easier to grasp and it becomes less of a mystery. It's difficult for the average consumer, bombarded by multiple formats, to understand its benefits."" **********Alex Melnyk, vice president of interactive media for the MCA Music Entertainment Group in Universal City, Calif., said her company plans to develop titles that combine a conventional music CD with a single multimedia track. **********""TRACK One,"" MCA calls this approach, and Ms. Melnyk said the idea was to produce a product that can be enjoyed by listeners without CD-ROM drives, but who can then take advantage of its interactive capabilities as they acquire new hardware. Of course, as long as interactive titles remain two or three times as expensive as conventional music CD's, few consumers may be willing to buy them unless they already have the equipment for mining the interactive treasures. **********One reason the prices are so lofty is that interactive titles require obtaining -- and, often, paying for -- sound, video and still photography from a variety of sources. **********""With the standard $500 per picture royalty charge, someone who wants to put 300 pictures on a single disk will find the cost prohibitive,"" said Ted Cohen, an independent multimedia music developer based in Los Angeles who is working on the Cranberries title, among others. **********But the major record labels may have an advantage as they enter the interactive field. Now that music videos have been around for more than a decade, many labels already have moving images to go with their artists' recordings -- although bringing out an interactive title may require negotiating new terms with the musicians. The record companies are also practiced in negotiating licensing and royalty fees with EMI Music Publishing, one of the world's largest music publishers with more than a million songs in its library. **********Joanne Boris, vice president of EMI Publishing in New York, said EMI bases its interactive CD-ROM fees on the type of product, how much it will depend on music for its success, and the suggested retail price. (All else being equal, licensing a 30-second sound bite will cost much less than licensing a complete song.) **********Another business complication is distribution, because the new interactive titles are not a natural fit with existing music sales channels. Shelf space is valuable in record stores, and music retailers may resist the idea of stocking yet another format, at least until it's clear that there's a mass market for the products. Thus, the early interactive titles are more likely to be found in software stores. **********""We'll have to jump-start these products,"" said David Blaine, senior vice president of business development and new technologies for Polygram Group Distribution Inc. in New York. The company will not discuss its specific interactive plans. **********""We may use an aggressive mail order campaign and push high-volume sales through standard software retail outlets,"" Mr. Blaine said. ""After we show some success, we will be able to get our products into the record stores."" **********As with other innovations, the presence of large companies in a new market is not always welcomed by the current occupants. Ken Rose, an independent multimedia software developer in Canoga Park, Calif., said of the big record labels: ""We're the pioneers, they are the settlers. Pioneers take the arrows, while the settlers get the land."" **********But these pioneers probably won't be run off the range. Analysts expect the development process to follow the pattern set by today's record business: Labels will provide financial backing for interactive projects at their inception, then take over promotion and distribution when the products are finished. In between, independent developers -- much like independent recording studios -- will assemble and perfect the product. **********In fact, Mr. Rundgren, the Natty Bumppo of interactive music, expects the pioneering independent studios to thrive. ""So few people can handle this technology that it seems ridiculous that any one of them would work for a record company,"" he said. ""It's not good news if the record companies bring the same provincial, conservative attitudes to software marketing as they do to music."""

Ask Eric Hippeau, chairman and chief executive of Ziff Communications Inc., who, like the rest of the publishing world, was surprised to learn that the company he had headed since November was up for sale. **********Mr. Hippeau, who is French, joined Ziff in 1989 to head up the company's flagship publication, PC Magazine, having been lured from the firm's chief rival in computer publishing, International Data Group, where he was publisher of Infoworld Magazine. But Mr. Hippeau's career in computer publishing actually began in Brazil, where he launched a small Portuguese-language computer newspaper that he eventually sold to Pat McGovern, chairman of IDG. **********Today Ziff publishes eight computer magazines, several industry newsletters and also produces trade shows. PC Magazine is the country's ninth-largest publication in ad revenue, and a negative review in its pages can be the death knell for a small company. This summer, Ziff plans to launch a computer program on the CNBC cable television network. Later this year, it will jump into electronic publishing with a large-scale on-line service. **********Question: What was your reaction when the Ziff family told you they'd decided to sell the company? **********Answer: I was surprised. I assumed it would always be a family business. But I think it's the right thing to do. Bill Ziff's sons have their whole lives ahead of them. If they hadn't been happy, the company would not have been happy. **********Q: What is the possibility the company will be sold to either International Data Group or CMP, Ziff's nearest competitors? **********A: We've ruled out selling to I.D.G. and CMP. We don't want our confidential information given to them, and we don't feel they have the financial wherewithal anyway. **********Q: This year you plan to launch the company's first major commercial online service, the Interchange Online Network. Do you see electronic publishing as a threat to traditional print publishing in any way? **********A: We see it as complementary. We didn't think print is going away anytime soon. Print continues to grow at a time when electronic communications grows. Print is a very convenient format -- it's portable and easy to open and close. It's a format you can pack a lot of information into, like a newspaper. It's hard to imagine you can do the same in electronic form for 75 cents. **********Q: What about television? I understand Ziff plans to begin a cable television show this summer. **********A: There's been a lot of research that shows a lot of people want to get their computer information -- or some of it -- from a TV. There are things you can do with TV. Of course, we're looking forward to the days TV becomes interactive. Imagine I want to demo to people how they can create everything they'll need to throw a birthday party for their kid. Using Kidpix (drawing software) I do this. Then at home, you'll be able to download the files. **********Q: You became a U.S. Citizen in 1992. Why did you decide to take that step when you did? **********A: I would have done it sooner but I hadn't consulted anyone. I thought you had to wait five years. I learned if you're married to an American, you don't. Even though I'm French, I haven't lived there for any length of time. Of course, my family spoke French in the home. But I identify with Americans. Eric Hippeau   Born: Aug. 16, 1951; Paris.  Education: Studied linguistics for two years at the Sorbonne.

The new service, which will be free but will require users to sign up as members, will combine relatively short articles on society and technology with a range of interactive features. For instance, the text of a report on a musical group might be accompanied by sound and video clips. **********If it is successful, the service will not be a competitive threat to conventional print publishing, its creators say, but rather a challenge to traditional broadcast and cable television. **********""This is not a zero-sum game for the publishing world,"" Louis Rossetto, Wired's publisher and co-founder, said. ""Television is going to be the loser in all of this."" **********By seeking to provide compelling multimedia entertainment and information that arrives in the home via personal computer, Mr. Rossetto envisions a world in which television is increasingly irrelevant. **********Hotwired, which was formally introduced last week on the global network of several million computers known as the Internet, is broken down into ""channels"" and ""sections"" devoted to reader participation and on-line galleries of digital art. Users are able to view digital animation and music videos and publishers of software games are able to showcase ""clips"" from their latest products. **********The service does not have an easy vocabulary of terms yet to explain its features. ""We've struggled with the language a lot,"" said Barbara Kuhr, Hotwired's creative director and a partner in the design firm of Plunkett & Kuhr. ""This is leading to a redefinition of the arts. This is a place where we can experiment."" **********One expression that appears to be emerging at Hotwired's editorial offices is ""loop it,"" which refers to a technique for continually repeating a sound or video image. Recently, after staff members discovered a new White House computer link to the Internet, which includes an audio snippet of a recording of the First Family's cat, Socks, shouts of ""loop it"" could be heard around the office, followed by a chorus of meows. **********Some computer executives say the service has not yet been designed for wide-scale use and therefore may have been introduced too early. **********Unlike national on-line services like Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online, which offer users indirect access to the Internet, Hotwired will require that users' computers be directly connected to the Internet. Such a connection will permit users to browse through a vast library of documents, images, sound and software available on the portion of the Internet known as the World Wide Web. **********""The Internet is still reachable directly mostly by people at large companies and on college campuses,"" said Bruce Katz, chief executive at the Well, an on-line service in Sausalito, Calif. But Mr. Katz acknowledges that interest in the World Wide Web is growing rapidly. **********""Existing on-line services are like eight-track tape players,"" said John Gage, director of the science office at Sun Microsystems. ""Hotwired is taking advantage of new technology that will entirely change journalism."" **********Mr. Rossetto believes there are already several hundred thousand computer users who have powerful work stations or PC's in their offices that are connected to fast networks that can take full advantage of Hotwired's text, images and sound. **********Unlike the print version of Wired, which was started on a shoestring by Mr. Rossetto and Jane Metcalfe, two new-media entrepreneurs, Hotwired is being introduced with considerably more impressive resources. With a staff of 25, the service will originate from computers supplied by Silicon Graphics Inc., a Silicon Valley computer maker that has achieved some visibility because its machines are widely used in Hollywood for digital special effects. **********While Wired took almost a year to begin attracting national advertisers, Hotwired is starting with a full complement of big-name companies among its 14 initial advertisers, including AT&T, MCI Communications, Sprint, I.B.M., Volvo and Club Med. **********""The reason we've chosen them as a site is because they have a track record of attracting people to their magazine,"" said Larry Dexheimer, a partner at Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RCSG, which has placed ads with Hotwired for several clients."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/19/business/skoda-gives-its-suppliers-a-place-in-the-auto-plant.html,Jane Perlez,1994-11-19,,1225,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Skoda Gives Its Suppliers a Place in the Auto Plant,Skoda Gives Its Suppliers a Place in the Auto Plant," **********Petr Prusa, the foreman in a brightly lit auto parts workshop, appears to be one of thousands of production workers inside an assembly plant for Skoda, the big Czech auto maker. **********But Mr. Prusa is part of a bold experiment by Skoda to improve quality and cut costs. His group finishes bumpers, dashboards and door panels, but his employer is not Skoda but an independent parts maker that set up shop inside the plant at Skoda's invitation. It is paying former Skoda workers less money to make parts for Skoda cars. **********Ever since Volkswagen A.G. bought a stake in Skoda three years ago, the German management has been aggressively searching for ways to cut costs and build efficiencies into the grossly inefficient plant. VW currently owns 31 percent of Skoda, a holding that is to rise to 50.5 percent by the end of the year. **********For auto makers, lower Eastern European pay is one benefit of making cars here, but managers say that as wages rise in coming years, Skoda, which has been a mass producer of inexpensive cars, must seek other ways to keep costs down. For this it must look beyond the lean production methods that have spread from Japan to the West. **********Volkhard Kohler, Skoda's chief financial officer and the top VW executive at the Czech company, argues that the widely used system in Japan and the West of suppliers' delivering parts every few hours from outside plants is not efficient enough. Suppliers should be inside the assembly plant, he says, for improved quality, lower transportation costs and quicker reaction time. By having a supplier just off the assembly line, defects can be fixed in minutes instead of in hours or days, he suggested. **********""We have to organize better than in the Western world and use supplier integration,"" Mr. Kohler said. ""Wages will increase, so we have to find other ways of being cost-effective. Supplier integration is part of the new thinking and what we do here can be a model for the West."" **********At Fiat's new plant at Malfi in southern Italy, for example, the factory was planned so that 60 percent of the suppliers will actually be inside the factory gates, a spokesman said. **********What is happening between Skoda and its suppliers reflects the changing relationship between suppliers and manufacturers around the world. In different ways, auto makers are asking suppliers to work more efficiently and even take responsibility for engineering and design. **********In other parts of Europe, however, the wage differences between the auto workers and parts makers are too wide to allow suppliers to be brought inside the plant. Higher-paid auto workers would fear that parts workers who made less would slow down pay increases in the auto plants. **********""The most popular solution is to have satellite supply plants close by, but not in, the auto plants,"" said Michael Smith, an auto analyst with DRI Europe, an economic forecasting company in London. ""This does not upset the auto manufacturing work force."" **********The investment by Volkswagen ran into trouble last year after it scaled back its plan to invest in Skoda and expand the Czech company's car and engine production. Yesterday, the Czech Government and Skoda agreed that production would rise to 340,000 cars by 1997 -- some 50,000 fewer than Volkswagen had planned -- and VW committed itself to adding new models. **********It has also committed itself to improving productivity. For that, Skoda has recruited six independent suppliers to make complicated items like instrument panels and rear axles, as well as carpets and seats. There are plans for a total of 10 suppliers to move into the plant to help make the new four-door Felicia, introduced last month, and further plans for four more suppliers to arrive in 1996, when Skoda plans to bring out a bigger model. **********Prof. Daniel Jones of the Cardiff University Business School in Britain, and an expert on auto production, said one of the biggest advantages of bringing the suppliers practically adjacent to the assembly line was superior quality control. Within the heart of the plant, the supplier focuses on parts and the car maker concentrates on design and research and running the assembly line. **********""It's physically integrated, but in terms of management and performance each runs his own show,"" Professor Jones said. ""It makes a lot of sense because you have the direct integration of people making the parts and the people putting them in the car."" **********At Skoda, for the first time in its worldwide operations, Johnson Controls, a Milwaukee-based maker of car seats, has moved inside a car plant, said Jos Connaerts, Johnson's project manager. **********To win the seat contract for the new Skoda Felicia, Johnson Controls agreed to renovate the old hall where Skoda made seats, Mr. Connaerts said. **********""Wherever we go, we are always very close to the car plant, the maximum being two hours away,"" Mr. Connaerts said. ""But here you can react a little bit faster. If something happens you only have to cross the street. You have very short lead times from complaint and reaction. Here we can do it in five minutes,"" while it can take an hour at a plant in Brussels. **********The seats travel from the manufacturing hall to the assembly line by monorail, a 25-minute journey. Mr. Connaerts said the delivery system was about to be fine-tuned so that a computer message from the assembly line would arrive at the seat-making area 160 minutes before a car passes the seat installation point on the assembly line. The message would stipulate what model seat was needed, allowing Johnson Controls to prepare the proper sequence of seats on the monorail. **********""The advantage for the customer is that he carries no inventory, and we don't carry inventory because we are trying to persuade our suppliers to supply us as required,"" Mr. Connaerts said. **********Another supplier inside the Skoda plant is Pelzer, a German carpet maker that has taken over Skoda's carpet needs from a plant far away in Slovakia. ""We were going to build a factory for carpets 10 miles away, but it made more sense to be inside,"" said Jurgen Lohde, the Pelzer manager, who has a team of 98 workers. **********For Steffen Potrafke, the director of logistical planning at Skoda, who has been brought in from Volkswagen's Audi division in Germany to organize the suppliers, the integration of key suppliers into the plant is the future for all auto makers. **********""Just-in-time in Germany is actually a very small trick: the supplier delivers first to the industrial park nearby and then to the factory,"" he said. ""Supplier integration is the next evolution of just-in-time."" **********Mr. Prusa, the foreman of the group finishing bumpers and door panels, said he knew that Skoda auto workers resented his proximity to the assembly line. His employer, Plastimat, pays him 7,000 crowns a month (about $270), somewhat less than Skoda workers earn, he said. **********""When Skoda workers come here to Plastimat they get lower wages than they were getting at Skoda,"" Mr. Prusa said. ""They don't like us very much."""

The manager of Bonnie Raitt, the Beastie Boys and Nirvana for Gold Mountain Management, Mr. Silva has become hooked on an unconventional mode of exercise: snowboarding. **********But while he may not have many business companions ""surfing"" on the slopes in July, the 34-year-old Mr. Silva is not alone among entertainment executives in the creative fanaticism with which he pursues his exercise regimen. In keeping with the breakneck pace of Hollywood, it has become perfectly acceptable to return business calls while breathlessly walking a treadmill, or to squeeze extra seconds out of the day for power yoga or Chinese kickboxing. The workout passion arises, most Hollywood executives say, more to relieve stress and to burn off restaurant calories than to maintain a glamorous silhouette. **********Bill Gerber, 37, an executive vice president of production at Warner Brothers, said he probably exercised to the extreme. ""I'm a very aggressive staying-in-shape person; I'm compulsive,"" said the executive, who runs triathlons and boasts a brown belt in kempo, a form of Chinese kickboxing. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Mr. Gerber does an hour of aerobic exercise, swimming, bicycling, running or working out at the gym. On weekends, he plays rigorous tennis at the home of Mark Canton, chairman of Columbia and TriStar Pictures (who is renowned -- along with Jeff Berg, racquetball player and chairman of International Creative Management -- for his fierce competitive spirit). **********""There's a hefty stress factor in these jobs,"" Mr. Gerber explained, ""and exercise is clinically proven to reduce stress."" **********Mr. Gerber's female counterpart in fitness activity is Jeanne Williams, 33, an I.C.M. television literary agent who is working out daily by 7 A.M. and at work by 9. Four days a week she runs five miles. The other three mornings she drives to a gym to practice Pilates, a perennially popular Hollywood exercise regimen built around the ""universal reformer,"" a wooden bed rigged with a system of weights and pulleys developed in the 1930's by German-born Joseph Pilates. **********""It's yoga-inspired resistance work for the legs, arms, stomach,"" Ms. Williams explained. ""It's very breathing-centered, calm, focused on the interior and the muscles. You're never bored."" **********Many in Hollywood who lack the discipline to make themselves work out hire a trainer. ""It's shameful that one needs outside motivation,"" sighed Laurence Mark, a producer based at the Disney Studios who admits to being ""just over 40."" Mr. Mark's trainer, Mark Priola, makes his client run three to four miles up and down the Hollywood Hills three mornings a week at 7:30 and at a more civilized hour on the weekends. Then the two men do a half-hour workout in Mr. Mark's home mini-gym. **********Sidney Ganis, 52, the executive vice president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, had trouble getting enough exercise until he stumbled on a novel idea. ""I didn't have a place to put exercise equipment until I walked into a closet that was always too big. Putting a bike in my closet became a surprise solution."" At least three mornings a week, from 6:30 to 7:15 -- other times he works out at a gym -- Mr. Ganis reads newspapers and scripts and watches morning TV shows while on his bike in the closet. **********Another executive who works during his workout is Tom Sherak, 49, a 20th Century Fox executive vice president who walks a treadmill for an hour at the end of the day in the all-male-executive domain of the Fox gym. ""I watch the VCR"" -- programs and ads prepared for his review, he explained. ""I talk on the telephone. I call reporters. People are always much more understanding when they think you're at the beginning of a heart attack."" **********On the weekends, many executives turn to golf and tennis. John Ptak, an agent at Creative Artists Agency who refused to give his age, plays tennis at the home of his friend Marvin Meyers, a lawyer. ""If I don't play four to five hours of tennis at least, I'm destroyed the following week,"" he said.

Ms. Pfeffer, who just turned 40, finally bought a treadmill two weeks ago, which she's only used on weekends so far. Even so, she said, ""I'm very proud of myself."""

At stake is an $80 million advertising campaign, begun this fall and culminating this month, that was supposed to make Intel and its Pentium computer chip the gold standard of the computer industry. **********Whether a Pentium-based computer stumbles once every 27,000 years, as Intel says, or as often as once every 24 days, as I.B.M. says, goes to the heart of the company's reputation as a quality manufacturer. **********And yet the problem has few parallels in marketing. After all, no one will die or become ill from a division error made by a Pentium-based computer. On the other hand, people have a right to expect that a very expensive machine, for which specific claims of quality are made, performs properly. **********On Monday, the International Business Machines Corporation said it was suspending sales of all its personal computers using the Pentium chip because of its risk of error in calculations. **********The image problem Intel faces has been magnified by its bold advertising campaign, developed by Dahlin Smith White of Salt Lake City, to make Intel a household name not only for scientists and business executives but also for parents looking for the latest multimedia applications for their children. **********Intel bought millions of dollars worth of television time on mainstream programs including ""Frasier"" and ""Late Show With David Letterman."" The commercials show a computer user peering into the high-tech innards of the machine as the slogan ""Intel Inside"" flashes across the screen. **********Already, computer trade magazines are ridiculing the campaign. Robert Faletra, editor in chief of Computer Reseller News, headlined his editorial critical of Intel, ""Oh No, Intel Is Inside!"" **********So what case histories should Intel's executives study? Perrier, where consumers worried about adulterated water? Tylenol, where painkillers were sabotaged by an unknown perpetrator? Or Three Mile Island, where an accident at a nuclear power plant could have threatened millions of people? **********""Intel has a lot riding on Pentium, but this is not a life-threatening situation,"" said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant with Trout & Partners in Greenwich, Conn. ""It is, however, a profoundly image-threatening situation."" **********Dennis Carter, Intel's vice president for marketing, said in an interview yesterday that ""in the Tylenol case, people were dying."" **********""With Pentium,"" he said, ""you have a one-half of 1 percent error that might occur -- might occur -- once every 27,000 years. This is a nonissue. Comparing this to Tylenol is totally inappropriate."" **********For the moment, Intel does not plan to mount a recall, modify its advertising campaign or broadcast or publish a mea culpa from Andrew S. Grove, the chief executive officer. **********Mr. Grove and other Intel executives will continue to answer questions from securities analysts and reporters, Mr. Carter said. ""But a recall would be incredibly disruptive,"" he said. ""It would not be a rational thing to do."" **********Whatever the company does, it has to be seen as acting decisively, said Richard C. Hyde, executive vice president at Hill & Knowlton Inc. in New York, who helped advise managers during the 1979 crisis at Three Mile Island. **********""When somebody takes ownership of a problem, that person has taken a giant step toward preserving the reputation of the product and the company that made the product,"" Mr. Hyde said. ""What people detest is not dealing with a problem forthrightly."" **********Alex Stanton, president of Dorf & Stanton Communications, a public relations and crisis management firm in New York, said, ""It was a stroke of genius to make a branded product out of a microprocessor, but when you say what's important is not the automobile but the engine, you are taking on some heavy responsibilities."" **********What changed the parameters of the debate was I.B.M.'s claim, disputed by Intel, that Pentium was a far more defective product than Intel had let on. Even though Intel had kept silent since June about what it considered an ""idiosyncrasy,"" as Mr. Carter put it, and then was forced to acknowledge the error last month after scientists discovered it, the Pentium flaw had been a relatively minor controversy. **********I.B.M.'s claim prompted a public relations crisis because average consumers could imagine situations where they could be affected, such as performing common spreadsheet applications. **********""I.B.M., however self-interested it might be, is a credible critic,"" Mr. Trout said. I.B.M., along with Motorola and Apple Computer, has developed a rival to the Pentium chip known as the Power PC. **********For John J. Burke, a crisis-management specialist who advised Union Carbide executives in the 1984 Bhopal chemical disaster, the Pentium problem was of more than business interest. He bought a Pentium-based computer eight months ago. **********Mr. Burke, head of a small consulting firm called Strategic Communications in West Caldwell, N.J., uses his Pentium-based computer as often as six hours a day and has had no problems. ""But how would I know? That's the problem,"" he said. ""It's like a NASA computer glitch that's embedded deep within the system and only emerges in flight."""

Shares **********Q. When I start withdrawing from my I.R.A., if I want to accept shares, by what procedure are they transferred to my name? HENRY B. HUNT JR., Baltimore. **********A. You are allowed to receive shares, instead of cash, from an individual retirement account through a process known as an ""in-kind"" distribution. But you must specify which shares are to be distributed and either a dollar amount or the number of shares. **********""The distribution of securities or mutual funds is generally made by re-registering the shares into the individual name or personal account of the I.R.A. participant,"" said Joseph J. Seymour, senior vice president of the Quest For Value mutual funds. ""The participant rarely receives the shares physically. The shares are generally transferred to a regular account in the individual's name."" **********If shares are worth holding inside an I.R.A., they are often worth holding outside an I.R.A. An in-kind distribution makes more sense than selling the I.R.A. shares, taking a cash distribution and repurchasing the identical shares, a process that could involve fees for both selling and buying. Once the shares are transferred to an individual account, taxes are owed on the dividends. Funds in Market Corrections **********Q. If there is a major market correction this year, is there any consensus about which mutual fund types will suffer the most and which the least? **********SAMUEL D. HASKELL, Douglasville, Ga. **********A. In any correction, the most aggressive funds would probably show the largest percentage losses among the stock mutual funds. Among the bond mutual funds, those that invest in longer-term or lower-quality bonds would be likely to show the biggest decline. Money market funds would suffer the least harm because they are managed in such a way that they normally maintain a stable price of $1 a share. **********Although stock and bond markets fell in the first half of this year, they usually do not move in tandem. ""In general, the major markets tend to move independently and when one market zigs, the other zags,"" said Neal Litvack, executive vice president of Fidelity Investments. Investment volatility then can often be minimized by diversifying.  Spousal Rights to an I.R.A. **********Q. If the owner of an I.R.A. using the recalculation method dies after distribution starts, can the spouse change the method of distribution to term certain? BENJAMIN VOLASKI, Sunrise, Fla. **********A. No, any money held in an I.R.A. is subject to complex minimum distribution requirements. When the distribution is paid over the lives of an I.R.A. owner and spouse, the owner can choose whether to recalculate life expectancies, and the spouse has to accept the owner's choice. **********But the spouse could transfer the I.R.A. to her name, so she could choose the payout mechanism.  ""If recalculation is not elected, the period over which amounts must be paid is reduced by one for each year that benefits begin,"" said Dennis Coleman, a partner of Kwasha Lipton, a benefits consulting firm. ""If recalculation is elected, the life expectancies are refigured each year."""

Bryson, chairman of the Southern California Edison Company, looked at the power-industry requirements of this country and was staggered by the scale of building that must occur in order to sustain China's extraordinary economic expansion. **********""This is the largest power market in the world,"" says Mr. Bryson, one of 24 American chief executives who accompanied Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to China over the last week. Mr. Bryson visited China for the first time, though his company's Mission Energy unit is negotiating power-plant deals in three southern Chinese provinces. **********The American executives who traveled here on an aged Air Force Boeing 707 with Secretary Brown lent their names and corporate prestige to his barnstorming tour for ""commercial diplomacy."" With the visit ending, Mr. Brown spoke in Hong Kong today of building a new commercial relationship between China and the United States. **********The businessmen arrived in China on Saturday with a variety of questions about how to fit their business strategies to the fastest-growing emerging market in the world. They left understanding that the answers to almost any question about succeeding in China are time and money. **********During a whirlwind of meetings in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the American executives found China's leadership enigmatic, and the notion of political risk never far from their thoughts now that Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, has passed his 90th birthday. **********The businessmen said they were comfortable with President Clinton's new human rights policy, which is based on the idea that sustained development of China's economy will lead to greater political freedom. **********""Commerce breeds industry, and as you increase the quality of life of a people, freedom follows,"" said Edwin Lupberger, a close friend of Mr. Clinton from Arkansas and chairman of the Entergy Corporation, a large electrical utility in the Southern United States. **********Herded together as a United States delegation, some of the visiting corporate chiefs seemed lost without their limousines, executive jets and coattails of staff. When their plane broke down on Tuesday, many of them sat in the bar at the China World Hotel and actually wasted time. **********In hot and dusty Beijing, there wasn't a power lunch to be had. But these executives know a market when they see one. **********Robert S. O'Neil, chief executive of the engineering firm De Leuw, Cather & Company, which helped build the Washington, D.C., subway system, has looked out across China's backward urban landscape and counted 19 subway systems and 82 airports that are moving into design, construction or reconstruction phases in the next few years. **********""We know there is a market here for us,"" Mr. O'Neil said. His firm has been working on Shanghai's subway project since 1987. Highly Competitive Market **********Little of this has been easy. Last winter, his negotiators were close to winning a huge contract to provide engineering services for the subway system in Guangzhou, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany ""came over here with his concessionary loans and took the contract away from us,"" Mr. O'Neil said. **********His firm, a subsidiary of the Parsons Corporation, has now formed a consortium with other American companies like Motorola and General Railway Signal to compete better by tailoring their integrated products and systems to what China's rail projects are not able to develop domestically, like modern train control systems, communications and operating systems. **********Mr. Bryson of Southern California Edison was awe-struck by the statistic that China plans to add 12,000 megawatts of installed power plant capacity each year to keep up with the country's fast-growing demand for electrical power. **********""You know in our whole system,"" Mr. Bryson said of the Southern California region, ""we operate 18,000 megawatts of generating capacity."" It has taken his company several decades to develop its grid, which is only half again as large as China's annual growth in power. **********Other figures bear out Mr. Bryson's enthusiasm. Just to turn the lights on in the thousands of factories rising out of the ground each year in this country, the Ministry of Power must build the equivalent of 15 to 20 large American power stations every 12 months. **********Richard J. Swift, chairman of the Foster Wheeler Corporation, has been selling boilers and related equipment to the Chinese since 1984. He figures that the state-owned power industry will be able to manufacture the equipment for about three-quarters of the plants that need to be built each year. **********""So you're looking at 2,000 to 3,000 megawatts of outside source power plants per year,"" Mr. Swift said. Though his company has been just an equipment seller in the past, he said he is now considering teaming up with Mr. Lupberger's Entergy Corporation and Mr. Bryson's Mission Energy to take equity positions in some of China's power-plant projects. Deals Concluded on Trip **********Mr. Lupberger signed one of the many memorandums of understanding here to go forward on a big power deal, though he may be facing a year or more of negotiations over rates of return. **********Entergy has agreed to buy into the aging Datong No. 2 power station in Shanxi province west of Beijing and double its capacity from 1,200 megawatts to 2,400 megawatts. **********With a Hong Kong partner sharing the risk, Entergy would have a 22 percent stake in the project, putting up $70 million in equity and bringing along nearly $400 million of United States Export-Import Bank financing. **********""Our business is not just capital, but technology and expertise,"" Mr. Lupberger said, ""so we bring something to the party other than money."" **********But the businessmen acknowledged the long road ahead. There is a continuing dispute within the Chinese Government on what kind of profit foreign companies should be allowed to make selling electricity in a country that still considers itself socialist. **********""If there is one thing we have learned,"" Mr. Lupberger said, ""it's that the Chinese don't move fast on anything."""

The United States remains the only net purchaser this year. **********""I believe that those who thought Canada was too hot too handle have already sold,"" said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Burns Fry. ""The markets are now behaving a lot better than expected."" **********Yields for the benchmark 30-year Canada bond jumped from a 1994 low of 7.08 percent in January to 9.56 percent on June 21 and were quoted at 9.20 percent last week. The spread for 30-year bonds between Canada and the United States narrowed to 170 basis points last week from a maximum of 207 in late June. **********While some of the improvement has been due to a new poll showing that Quebec's governing Liberal Party is catching up to the opposition Parti Québécois in the run-up to the Sept. 12 election, spreads had narrowed even before the survey's release. **********The poll, conducted by the CROP research group in late July and early August, showed the Parti Québécois with a two percentage point lead over the federalist Liberals compared with 10 points in mid-July. The findings caused the Canadian dollar to jump about half a cent. **********Until the new poll, most political and economic analysts were predicting a surefire separatist victory, but current polls indicate it will be defeated. ""My guess is that voters in Quebec will be confronted with economic reality and there will be a 'no' vote,"" Ms. Cooper said. **********That doesn't mean that international investors have no grounds to worry about their Canadian bonds, said Brian Neysmith, president of the Canadian Bond Rating Service. He said the September elections and the possible referendum were minor issues compared with the ""absolute borrowing binge Canada has gone on over the past decade."" **********Even with economic recovery well under way, the federal government's net debt continues to increase at a rate greater than economic growth in 1994 and 1995 and is budgeted to grow at 7.8 percent, up from 3.3 percent. **********- **********Carl Gewirtz is on vacation."

Solzhenitsyn used his first news conference back on Russian soil today to fire bolts at Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Westernizing reformers, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and, above all, unrepentant Communist ""oppressors and executioners."" **********Like a prophet of old emerging from long seclusion to castigate a fallen world, the 75-year-old writer held forth with passion and eloquence for almost two hours on Russia's need for repentance and reconciliation, on the errors of its post-Communist course, on the sufferings of the Russian nation. **********No, he declared, he had not returned too late. Had he come back any earlier, he would have only become embroiled in power struggles and confusion. **********""I not only believe I am not late, but that I have come just at the right time,"" he declared, ""because the scum of triviality has cleared, and the people have ripened enough to become conscious of their fate in its essence and depth. I think it is precisely now that I am useful, not three years ago when two powers clashed like two goats on a bridge until one fell off."" **********The reference was evidently to the losing struggle of Mr. Gorbachev, the former President, against Boris N. Yeltsin, the current President.  Looking to Tradition **********But the central point threading through the news conference was that both Mr. Gorbachev's ""perestroika"" and the attempts at reforms after the collapse of the Soviet Union had brought Russia to a hideous quandary, and that the nation was now ready to search for an order built on Russia's history, tradition and spirit -- and that this was the mission for which Mr. Solzhenitsyn had prepared himself in his long exile. **********The writer, whose exile and international fame arose from his searing accounts of the Stalinist terror, arrived in Vladivostok on Friday after 20 years of exile, 18 of them in seclusion in Vermont. From this Pacific port, he intends to travel slowly across Russia by rail in two special cars, reacquainting himself with a nation that has dramatically changed from the totalitarian state from which he was ejected in February 1974. He said that he had no firm itinerary for the trip and that it would develop as he went. **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn spent his first morning in Russia today wandering through the weekly farmers' market on Vladivostok's main square and visiting a hospital, where he held three hours of talks with doctors. But it was evident in his first declaration, on the main square Friday, and far more so today, that he did not intend to wait to speak out. Indeed, he had long tried to warn Russia against Communism and the dangers that emerging from it would hold. **********""But I couldn't shout from there -- my books were banned, my warnings were not heeded,"" he said. ""I would be happy to be proved a false prophet, but what I anticipated has come to pass: We are climbing out in the clumsiest, most awkward, most destructive fashion for life and for the national spirit. I understand this. I am not surprised. It is to this I came.""  Anger and Moral Reproach **********Then the thunderbolts fell. His tone had the same anger and moral reproach that made his most celebrated work, ""The Gulag Archipelago,"" so potent an indictment of the Soviet terror system -- and that have made his impassioned commentaries on the West and on Russia so controversial. ***********On Mr. Gorbachev: ""There were many paths out"" of Communism, ""but Gorbachev had no such goal. Gorbachev flung out slogans of perestroika, but he was really thinking of how to transfer the nomenklatura to comfortable commercial seats. His perestroika was hypocrisy. He lost seven years; he did nothing in seven years; he destroyed all the structure of industry without replacing them with anything."" ***********On Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of Mr. Yeltsin's economic program: ""The 'reform' Gaidar gave out was brainless. I refuse to recognize that this is reform. Reform is a constructive, thought-through system of actions linked one to another."" Mr. Gaidar, he said, did only two things. He freed prices while monopolies were still intact, enabling them to charge whatever they wanted while reducing production. And, Mr. Solzhenitsyn said, he began ""a deceptive privatization,"" in which ""for some ridiculous sum people took over national properties, and all the so-called 'vouchers' -- a ridiculous word -- don't amount to a 300th of one percent of the national wealth."" ***********On Mr. Zhirinovsky, the ardent nationalist who fared unexpectedly well in the Dec. 12 parliamentary elections: ""Zhirinovsky is a caricature of a Russian patriot. It's as if someone wanted to create a purported Russian patriot so that he would be hateful to the whole world.""  Eluding Questions on Yeltsin **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn eluded several questions about Mr. Yeltsin, for whom he has expressed guarded support in the past, saying there were many things he could say, but not yet. **********But he was critical of virtually all aspects of Russia's current attempts at democracy and reform, which he branded ""false democracy."" Russians, he said, have to stop waiting for some ""monarch, boyar, politburo or general secretary"" to issue good decrees, and to take their fate into their own hands, above all in local elections. And they have to ""rip up"" party lists and programs, and to vote instead ""for people in whom you believe, whose main quality must be honesty, selflessness, not thinking of one's own pocket."" **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn was equally critical of turning Russia into a federation of ethnic republics, in most of which, he said, Russians were a minority. Such republics, he said, were a Soviet invention ""to crush the Russian nation."" **********""Why must the Russian nation be subjugated to minorities?"" he asked. ""I always said that nations were the embellishment of mankind, that they must be protected, even the smallest nation, its language and culture, but that doesn't mean that that nation must rule the Russian majority. There must be only equal provinces.""  To Gather the Russian Nation **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn voiced some of his strongest opposition to the fact that roughly 25 million Russians were suddenly left in foreign states with the breakup of the Soviet Union into 15 independent countries. Gathering the Russian nation, he said, was a priority. **********""Twenty-five million Russians do not live in Russia,"" he declared. ""There was never such a diaspora. I was totally amazed to learn that they gave away 12 million Russians to Ukraine, five or six Russian provinces. Nobody said a word. I appealed to the Ukrainian President, to Russians living in Ukraine, vote with us. Nobody paid heed. Seven million Russians were given to Kazakhstan. Nobody said a word."" **********Mr. Solzhenitsyn acknowledged that he had no ready recipe for Russia's renewal. But he said the answer was not in trying forcibly to graft the experience of the West on to Russia. ""Our life, spiritual and otherwise, must be formed from our own tradition, our understanding, our atmosphere,"" he said. **********""What unifying idea will come, I don't know,"" he said, ""but the thought that comes naturally to mind is love for one's nation without servility, without false claims, with acknowledgment of sins and failings. Such patriotism could unite the Russian people."" Facing the Gulag Legacy **********Above all, to move forward Russia must face up to the legacy of the Gulag, he said, much as the Germans faced up to their responsibility in the Holocaust. **********""National reconciliation is a great thing and much needed, but there cannot be national reconciliation without spiritual cleansing,"" he said. ""I wholeheartedly support national reconciliation, but first the oppressors and the executioners must repent."" **********As for himself, Mr. Solzhenitsyn said with the hint of a smile: ""I don't intend to forgive anyone because personally, I have absolutely no anger. When I was arrested in 1945 it was for good cause -- I was indeed opposed to this regime."" **********Then he turned hard: ""But those I sat with, Russian prisoners betrayed by the Soviet Union who went first to camps, then to their death -- to German camps, then to Soviet camps -- for them I will never forgive."""

The commission, the Union's executive agency, was expected to approve the report at its weekly meeting Wednesday. **********The stakes are huge, the report says. Europe has lost 80 percent of its movie box office to foreign producers, mainly Hollywood. But with demand for entertainment soaring, Europe should be able to generate 2 million to 4 million new jobs in the sector by the year 2000 if it revives its industry, which employs at least 1.8 million today. **********The report says the Union's broadcast directive was too vague and gave national governments too much leeway to decide whether and how to enforce a requirement that television stations show 51 percent European programming. France and Belgium, for example, are pressing the commission to take Britain to court over its licensing of Ted Turner's TNT, a cable channel showing almost exclusively old American films and cartoons. **********The report did not propose raising the quota for European programming, but it did suggest extending quotas to nascent technologies that are not covered today, such as video-on-demand. These services are expected to show strong growth in coming years and competition will be distorted if they are not regulated, the report contends. **********The U.S. government's report on unfair trading practices last week cited Europe's broadcast directive as a key barrier, and Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has argued against any extension of quotas to new video services. **********The report did acknowledge that any new protective measures or subsidies would have to be of a ""limited duration,"" given that the Union agreed to include film and television programming in the world trade accord. **********Elsewhere, the report calls on the Union to break down barriers between its national film and television markets so the European industry ""can take advantage of the scale of the European market."""

Health Systems, based in Pueblo, Colo., said that ""the company is not for sale,"" but that it had formed a special board committee to consider the proposals. **********Combined with Health Systems, either bidder would have at least 1.8 million enrollees in California, second only to Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit H.M.O., which has about five million members in the state. The combined H.M.O. would gain leverage in bargaining for lower fees from hospitals and physicians, said Edward B. Keaney, a health care analyst with Volpe, Welty & Company in San Francisco. **********Analysts said the offers -- $34 a share in stock, or about $1.69 billion, from FHP and $31.15 a share in stock, or $1.55 billion, from Foundation Health -- would now become opening bids, inviting higher offers from other parties. **********""It's a first shot over the bow,"" said Thomas Hodapp of Robertson, Stephens in San Francisco. **********Mr. Keaney said the bidding might reach $40 or $45 a share, based on recent H.M.O. deals. **********Shares of Foundation Health fell $1 yesterday, to $31, on the Big Board. FHP's stock was unchanged at $25.75 in Nasdaq trading. **********The analysts speculated that Pacificare Health Systems, based in Cypress, Calif., and the United Health Corporation, based in Minnetonka, Minn., might jump into the bidding. **********A spokesman for Pacificare said the company did not comment on rumors. Executives at United Health Care could not be reached for comment. **********Foundation Health, based in Rancho Cordovo, Calif., said it had ""preliminary discussions"" with Health Systems and had sent the company a letter that it described as ""a nonbinding expression of interest."" The FHP offices in Fountain Valley, Calif., were closed for the holidays. **********Dr. Malik M. Hasan, co-chairman of Health Systems, is the largest individual shareholder in the company with nearly 10 percent of the stock. He would receive $168 million if the FHP offer were accepted. But it was not clear whether Dr. Hasan would be willing to relinquish control. He could not be reached for comment. **********Health Systems was created last January, after Dr. Hasan merged Qual Med, his Colorado-based H.M.O., with Health Net, a California H.M.O., in a deal valued at $500 million in stock plus $225 million in assumed debt. **********Randall S. Huyser, an analyst with Furman Selz in San Francisco, said the latest bidding coincided with a dispute between Health Systems and a foundation run by former Health Net executives. The state required Health Net to endow the California Wellness Foundation with cash and nonvoting stock when the H.M.O. switched from nonprofit to for-profit status several years ago. **********In a lawsuit filed recently in state court in Los Angeles, the Wellness Foundation contended that Health Systems was delaying the process under which some of the foundation's 27.5 million nonvoting shares could be sold. **********Analysts said Health Systems was in no hurry to see a big sale of shares that could further depress its stock, which had been trading in the mid-$30's last spring. **********Analysts said, however, that if the company changed ownership the foundation would be free to sell shares. Foundation executives could not be reached for comment yesterday. **********In other recent consolidations of H.M.O.'s, FHP beat out United Health Care and Foundation Health to acquire Takecare, based in Concord, Calif., and Foundation Health acquired Intergroup, based in Tuscon, Ariz."

Kravchuk, that the United States would double its aid to Ukraine to $700 million this year. **********Mr. Clinton made clear that the key to the improved relations was Ukraine's making good on its promise to eliminate its 176 long-range missiles and 1,800 nuclear warheads, most of which are aimed at the United States. **********At a joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Clinton also said he wanted vastly improved economic ties with Ukraine, which American officials say could someday become an economic powerhouse, with its 52 million people and a wealth of natural resources. **********""The United States believes that the potential of Ukraine is enormous, and that we have to have a long-term view of our partnership,"" he said. Concern Over Inflation **********American officials are eager to help stabilize Ukraine's desperate economic situation, concerned that it could create political chaos and fuel ethnic tensions. Ukraine's inflation rate is running at 90 percent a month, and its industrial output has fallen by more than 40 percent over the last two years. **********One of Mr. Clinton's messages to Mr. Kravchuk was that Ukraine should move vigorously in slashing its inflation rate and privatizing industry. **********In return, Mr. Clinton said, Washington would increase its economic aid to Kiev to $350 million next year, from the $155 million announced in January. In addition, the United States signed an investment treaty with Ukraine, announced plans to lower tariffs on some Ukrainian goods, and set up a joint trade and investment commission. The United States will also double to $350 million its aid to help Ukraine dismantle its missiles and warheads. **********""The United States recognizes that it is very important to be supportive as Ukraine tries to reform and get through this period of economic transition,"" Mr. Clinton said. **********Mr. Kravchuk told American officials that a strong and stable Ukraine could an be an important buffer against any expansionist tendencies in Russia. ""Ukraine can play a great stabilizing role in the future,"" he said. **********At times today, Mr. Kravchuk was outshone by a 16-year-old girl whom he asked to accompany him to Washington: Oksana Baiul, the ebullient Ukrainian orphan who bested Nancy Kerrigan to win the Olympic gold medal in women's figure skating. **********""I think it's kind of neat that he asked her to come,"" Mr. Clinton said. **********White House officials acknowledged that it was a bit awkward for the President to meet with the skater before he meets with the American Olympic team. **********According to American officials, Mr. Clinton urged Mr. Kravchuk to redouble his efforts to persuade the Ukrainian Parliament to approve accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. **********Under that treaty, as well as other agreements, Ukraine has committed itself to becoming a non-nuclear state. Its Parliament may not vote on the treaty until after elections scheduled for March 27, and some American officials fear that the new Parliament may be less inclined to approve it, especially since Mr. Kravchuk appears to be a lame duck. He has indicated that he does not plan to run for re-election in June. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton voiced confidence that Mr. Kravchuk would win approval for the treaty. Agreement With Russia **********To pave the way for Ukraine's denuclearization, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kravchuk signed a three-way agreement in January with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia in which Washington and Moscow provided some security assurances to Ukraine and pledged to reimburse it for the highly enriched uranium in its warheads. **********Mr. Clinton showed his gratitude for Mr. Kravchuk's denuclearization pledge in several ways, including the aid increase for dismantling the weapons. In addition, in a demonstration of the way he often personalizes diplomacy, Mr. Clinton hailed the Ukrainian leader for his ""statesmanship and leadership."" **********American officials also said they would work with Ukraine to deal with Russia's decision to cut off natural gas shipments as a result of Ukraine's failure to pay more than $1 billion it owes Russia."

Last week offered a mirror image of last year. Through most of 1993, Mexico's stock exchange and money market were whipsawed by the changing fortunes of the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********The Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had so much riding on passage of the pact that when any obstacles arose, the Mexican stock exchange plummeted. The more likely approval seemed, the more spirited was trading on the floor of the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. **********Mexico's economy now has another case of the jitters, caused this time by a  nightmarish collection of political problems leading up to the Aug. 21 Presidential election and the possibility that for the first time in 65 years the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (known as PRI) could lose power. **********The Bolsa's week began with the kind of upswing that set analysts to presenting rosy scenarios and buy recommendations. A dip Thursday was cause for  a reassessment. By week's end, the realists here were saying that not much had really changed, despite the fact that the market closed at 2,462 on Friday, up 1.4 percent on the day and 7 percent for the week. **********Overall, since Jan. 1 the battered Bolsa has lost more than 18 percent of its value in dollar terms, and the Mexican peso has dropped almost 10 percent of its value. Interest rates for Government securities have hovered around 17 percent,  stemming the outflow of foreign investment but strangling a nascent economic recovery. Second-quarter company reports filed last week indicated sluggishness, and many analysts believe it unlikely that the economy grew much more in the second quarter than the 0.5 percent first-quarter increase. **********""No financial market anywhere in the world likes uncertainty,"" said Jonathan  Heath, director of MACRO Asesoria Economica, a Mexico City financial consulting  firm. ""If you want to understand the Mexican financial market at this time you have to understand Mexican politics."" **********Many investors already have taken money out of the Bolsa and the American Depositary Receipts for Mexican companies that are traded in New York. Some have tried to hedge by shifting to fixed equity instruments. **********But even such drastic moves have proved inadequate because of pressure on the peso and doubts about whether Mexico can avoid a devaluation. So the Central Bank recently started issuing notes called Tesobonos, backed by a pledge that they will be redeemable upon maturity for United States dollars at a fixed exchange rate. **********The new guarantees have proved attractive, especially to foreigners. At the end of last year, the amount of Government securities held in tesobonos was 4 billion new pesos, about $1.3 billion, while the regular 28-day treasury notes called cetes equaled 47.7 billion new pesos, around $16 billion. **********By June 19, cetes holdings had dropped to 32.3 billion new pesos, about $10.5 billion, while tesobonos had surged to 34.7 billion pesos, around $11.3 billion. **********Foreigners holding Mexican notes basically just shifted from cetes to tesobonos. But many Mexicans involved in the market were much more skittish. Many of them simply took their money out, went to exchange houses, and cashed in pesos for dollars. Exchange levels indicate that most of them were small- and medium-sized investors. **********According to Deborah Riner, chief economist of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City, through the first six months of the year, there has been an outflow of about $1 billion from the Mexican equity market, while during essentially the same period there was an inflow of $1.5 billion into Government  obligations. **********""That means that in spite of everything that's happened, foreign investment in Mexico is pretty much sitting tight,"" she said. **********Other such mixed signals abound. Despite the peso's problems, exports are up, but so are imports. Foreign reserves are believed to have dropped below $18 billion dollars, the lowest point since 1982, but the Central Bank remains committed to defending the peso. In recent days, the interest rate for 28-day cetes dropped .66 percentage points, to 17 percent. Meanwhile, second-quarter earnings, while disappointing, were not as bad as had been expected, fueling the Bolsa's slight rebound. **********As the election nears, opposition candidates are showing surprising strength, although the ruling party's replacement candidate, Yale-trained economist Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, is considered to be in the lead. Concern has focused on the possibility of chaos or violence after the election. **********Opposition parties have vowed to take to the streets if the governing party wins in a way that seems fraudulent. A new President will not be confirmed until a new Congress is installed in November, and then he doesn't officially take office until Dec. 1. The pact between the Government, business and labor that controls wages and prices, and sets the band of peso exchange rates is due for renewal in October. Analysts expect that could be the time for an adjustment of  the exchange-rate band, thus avoiding the harmful political effects that followed previous devaluations. **********""All the uncertainty caused by the Nafta was cleared in one day and then the  next day the sun came out,"" said Abel Beltran del Rio, president of Ciemex-Wefa, an economic study organization in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., that focuses on Mexico. ""This time, after the election, it won't be resolved so quickly."""

Zucker, director of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union's office of corporate and financial affairs. The union owns a small number of Kmart shares. **********The dissident shareholders, led by James Severance, executive vice president of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, have argued that Kmart should spin its specialty stores off completely so that management can focus its attention on reviving the chain of discount stores. **********The proposal, which would have offered the public the opportunity to buy stock that reflected the performance of Kmart's specialty store units, received the support of 61 percent of the shares voted. But under Michigan law, it needed the approval of more than half of the 416 million shares outstanding. The meeting was held in Troy, Mich., where Kmart is based. **********In a statement issued yesterday evening, Joseph E. Antonini, chairman, president and chief executive of Kmart who had personally lobbied hard on behalf of the proposal, said the company was disappointed in the outcome. He noted that the proposal was defeated in large part because 27.8 percent of the shares outstanding were not voted despite a last-minute scramble to win additional votes by Kmart's proxy solicitor, Georgeson & Company. **********Mr. Antonini said management and the board would begin assessing alternatives to unlock the value of its specialty store units -- its office and building supply chains, as well as its book and sporting goods chains -- whose performance and growth prospects are overshadowed by Kmart's flagging discount store business. **********The stock market, sensing the defeat, bid Kmart's shares up yesterday to $16, up 50 cents, perhaps in part because the vote sounded a clear warning to the company's directors and management. **********""I think it may be a blessing in disguise because it tells management that its strategies are being questioned in a strong enough voice to smack them in the face,"" said Thomas H. Tashjian, a retail analyst at the First Manhattan Company. **********""Antonini's future will also become more of an issue here over the course of the next period,"" he added. ""Is he going to be willing to concede to administering a program different from the one he envisioned?"" **********At a news conference after the annual meeting yesterday, Mr. Antonini insisted that the groundswell of shareholder discontent was in no way a vote of no-confidence in his leadership. ""It's like being a basketball coach: When you have a good year, they cheer, and when you have a bad year, they don't,"" he said. **********The defeated stock proposal envisioned selling the public 20 to 30 percent of shares reflecting the performance of the Kmart Builders Square home improvement chain, Borders-Waldenbooks bookstores, the Sports Authority sporting goods chain and Office Max, an office supply retailer. The company had estimated the offering would raise $600 million to $900 million, which Kmart intended to use to pursue its strategy of refurbishing and modernizing its aging discount stores. **********Kmart will now have to find another way to raise that money. Mr. Tashjian said Kmart might consider selling its 21 percent stake in Coles Meyer Ltd., an Australian retailer. Before shareholder opposition squelched its plans to offer shares in its specialty units, Kmart insisted that its Cole Meyers stake was not up for sale. **********He said the company could also come back with a plan to spin off the specialty store units, perhaps retaining a stake for itself. Last year, Sears, Roebuck & Company spun off its brokerage subsidiary, Dean Witter, selling 80 percent to the public and keeping 20 percent for itself. **********There would be drawbacks to spinning off some of the chains, however. ""Some of these companies are too young to maximize shareholder value through a spinoff at this time,"" Mr. Tashjian said. ""But unfortunately, the mama company's need for capital may force a premature monetization."" **********The defeat of the proposal was especially embarrassing for Kmart considering the unusual measures the company took to try to win the support it needed. When its annual meeting convened at 9 A.M. yesterday, the company told the shareholders jammed into two auditoriums at its headquarters that only 68 percent of its roughly 416 million shares outstanding had been tabulated **********Anthony Palizzi, Kmart's general counsel, said that since typically 80 percent of Kmart's shares were voted by the time the annual meeting convened, the company had decided to call a recess until 5 P.M. New York time, to give its proxy solicitor time to tabulate votes that arrived late Thursday night -- and to make frantic calls to shareholders who had not yet voted. **********""The solicitor is continuing to call people who have not voted,"" Orren Knauer, director of investor relations, said yesterday before the final vote was reported. ""Most of the institutions have voted already, so it was dealing mostly with individual investors today."" **********An obviously shaken Mr. Antonini told reporters that last year, when the company lost $974 million and sales stagnated, had been a ""nightmare"" for the company. Normally the picture of self-confidence, Mr. Antonini's voice wavered as angry shareholders repeatedly laid responsibility for Kmart's poor performance at his doorstep."

But it refused to hold a third round, at which a package of political and economic incentives was to be discussed, until the North Koreans agreed to Washington's initial inspection demands. **********Explaining today's decision, an Administration official said that the International Atomic Energy Agency told Washington that North Korea has not diverted any of the fuel it recently removed from its reactor for nuclear weapons purposes. **********North Korea, Administration officials said, also allowed agency monitors to complete a long-sought inspection of its plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon and to replace the film and batteries in cameras in the nuclear reactor there. **********Administration officials acknowledged that there were still important differences between North Korea and the atomic energy agency. They said Washington was prepared to break off the talks if North Korea took steps that made it impossible for the atomic energy agency to conduct measurements of how much plutonium North Korea might have diverted in the past or otherwise impeded the agency's inspections. **********The agency's assurance that the recently removed fuel was not being diverted was publicly disclosed today in a series of unusually explicit statements by top Administration officials. The statements appeared designed to counter the impression that North Korea was refusing to accept any constraints on its nuclear program. **********Administration officials said that North Korea has not been informed of the new stance and that no date for the high-level talks has been set. The American delegation will be led by Robert Gallucci, an Assistant Secretary of State and the Clinton Administration's point man on North Korea. **********Before that assurance was given, the Administration had been confronted by a quandry. On the one hand, Washington is eager to explore every diplomatic opportunity before trying to muster support for economic sanctions. On the other hand, the Administration does not want to be portrayed as weak, particularly in light of criticism that it has vacillated on foreign policy. **********The problem was compounded last week when North Korea announced it was beginning to withdraw fuel rods from its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. That development worried Washington because the fuel, if reprocessed at North Korea's plutonium separation plant, could provided enough material for four or five nuclear bombs. **********The pressure also intensified when Hans Blix, the director general of the atomic energy agency, sent a message describing the removal of the fuel as a serious violation of its agreement with North Korea. **********But today, Administration officials took pains to describe the developments in less alarming terms. **********One Administration official, who asked not be named, said that North Korea has removed about 5 percent of the 8,000 rods in its reactor and that they have been placed in special ponds that the atomic energy agency is allowed to monitor. **********Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who has underscored the danger of allowing North Korea to proceed with its nuclear program, also played down the military significance of the move, describing the removal of the rods as a technical violation. **********""The I.A.E.A., in fact, has told us that it is confident that there has been no diversion of the fuel that has just been discharged,"" Mr. Perry told reporters today. No Irrevocable Steps **********Administration officials also said the North Koreans have not taken irrevocable steps that would prevent the atomic energy agency from conducting measurements of some of the rods. **********The agency wants to analyze the spent fuel from the reactors to determine how long they have been in the reactor. That, in turn, would enable the agency to determine if North Korea has previously unloaded enough fuel from the reactor for one or two nuclear bombs, as the Central Intelligence Agency believes, or has simply withdrawn a small number of damaged fuel rods, as North Korea maintains. **********To conduct the measurements, the agency wants to examine 300 of the rods from specific parts of the reactor. The agency has asked North Korea to either set aside the rods for inspections or leave them in the reactor so that the measurements might be carried out in the future. **********So far, however, the North Koreans have rebuffed the agency's demands. But they have also not brought the dispute with the agency to a crisis by removing the rods that the agency wants to measure. **********An Administration official said that if the North Koreans continue to remove the fuel at their current pace and according to their current procedures, it could take weeks before they remove the rods in question. **********At the same time, Mr. Gallucci, the Administration's point man on the dispute, said the North Koreans have allowed international monitors to complete the inspections of the reprocessing plant that they had sought to carry out in March. **********Administration officials described the North Korean moves as part of a perplexing pattern that has left Administration experts divided over whether Pyongyang is simply trying to drive a hard bargain in its negotiations with the Washington or is determined to build a nuclear arsenal. **********""They are skirting right to the edge of the red line, but without crossing it,"" an Administration official said. **********While Administration officials sought to portray their decision to proceed with the talks as a sober exploration of a diplomatic opening, it was likely to stir debate about whether Washington was being prudent or timid about North Korea. **********Throughout its diplomatic dealings with Washington, North Korea has continued to work intensively on building a new larger reactor and on expanding its plutonium reprocessing capability. **********There are other unanswered questions as well, including exactly what position the Administration will take in the talks. **********Washington has offered to expand diplomatic and economic ties with Pyongyang if it agrees to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But the Administration has not made clear exactly what incentives it plans to propose."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, by a coup in 1991. **********After visiting processing centers for Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba and in the Turks and Caicos Islands, Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat from New Mexico and the deputy majority House whip, arrived in Haiti on Monday and met with Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his chief of staff before leaving for the Dominican Republic this morning. **********American officials said Mr. Richardson had sought to convince General Cedras that Congressional support for the Clinton Administration's policy on Haiti remained strong and, in Mr. Schrager's words, also discussed possible ""modalities of the general's departure."" **********General Cedras was said by American and Haitian officials to have reiterated his longstanding position, which is that he will step down only when his three-year term as commander in chief of the Haitian military expires early next year. **********Mr. Richardson said in a telephone interview today that he came away from the meeting with General Cedras only ""mildly optimistic that perhaps there's a chance to resolve this issue without using military force."" **********""One of my objectives was to disabuse them of divisions in American policy, and that the Congress would ultimately support the President if he took military action,"" said Mr. Richardson, who said he opposed an invasion. **********He said tighter sanctions were having only mixed success. For example, while crossing into Haiti from the Dominican Republic, he saw rowboats carrying containers of gasoline across Lake Jimani to Haiti. **********Mr. Richardson said he was not carrying any messages from the Administration and had not delivered any ultimatums to the junta.  Meets Dominican President **********Before arriving here, Mr. Richardson met in the Dominican Republic with President Joaquin Balaguer, to discuss the Haitian crisis and efforts to improve enforcement of economic sanctions along the Dominican border. **********Though the flow of refugees from Haiti has begun to fall, government repression of political activities continues unabated. On Monday night and again today, the police raided separate meetings called by two nascent political parties, including one sponsored by Mayor Evans Paul of Port-au-Prince, who remains loyal to Father Aristide. Local radio reports said several people had been arrested, and others in attendance beaten. This afternoon, Mr. Paul took refuge in the French Embassy here. **********The initial decline in departures of boat people was apparently partly because of choppy seas. In addition, relief workers and diplomats said, some Haitians may have decided to delay their departure until they had a chance to watch the World Cup final on July 17, which brought most activities here to a virtual halt. **********More fundamentally, word has now filtered into the hinterlands that Washington will no longer allow refugees intercepted at sea to settle in the United States. **********Members of the clergy and relief workers in areas that have produced large numbers of boat people also report that the military government's efforts to prevent an outflow of refugees have increased. The military is said to regard a large and uncontrollable exodus of boat people as the only phenomenon certain to provoke eventual military intervention by the United States. **********As a consequence, ""the repression has become ferocious"" in some of the coastal towns that are popular staging areas, said a Roman Catholic volunteer who works in one such place in Haiti's southern peninsula."

They walked through empty dormitories, through empty mess halls, through empty classrooms, through an auditorium, where an inmate dance troupe was performing to the song ""Bad"" by Michael Jackson, and through a noisy truck factory. Model prisoners talked about being reformed through their labor while some guards listened and other guards recorded their remarks on videotape. **********In the prison visiting room, where families get one hour a month to see imprisoned relatives, Dong Zheyun was there to see her husband, who was serving time for theft. When reporters entered the doorway, she said, ""Every time I come, the first thing he says to me is that the cadres are so good to him they are like parents."" 'You Got That Backwards' **********When her husband tried to express a few lines of praise for the prison authorities, a guard interrupted him to say, ""You got that backwards."" **********Then his wife interjected on her husband's behalf: ""Oh he's so stupid. He doesn't have any education at all."" **********By then the reporters were being asked to hurry to the next stop on the tour. **********Mr. Liu is among several political prisoners in China whose medical condition has drawn international expressions of concern, including most recently a letter to President Jiang Zemin from 54 United States senators. **********As a physics student and democracy advocate, Mr. Liu was drawn into the orbit of Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, two physicists who took refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing in 1989 and now live in exile. Through their speeches and writing, the couple helped energize a new intellectual movement in the 1980's, promoting democratic reform to coincide with the economic opening begun by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader. Sentenced to Six Years **********After the military crackdown in June 1989, Mr. Liu, who had helped organize student demonstrations, was No. 3 on the list of 21 student leaders most wanted by the authorities. After his arrest, he was sentenced on Feb. 12, 1991, to six years in prison for ""conspiracy to subvert the Government."" **********The warden, Xin Tingquan, refused to allow the visiting journalists to interview Mr. Liu, saying it was a violation of regulations. He acknowledged that the Ministry of Justice made one exception to this rule last year so a Communist Party magazine reporter could interview Mr. Liu and pronounce him a ""malcontent convict"" in the state-controlled press. **********""We're not afraid of letting you see him,"" Mr. Xin said, ""but Liu Gang distorts the truth. That's why we don't let him meet with anyone."" **********Prison officials offered to take reporters to where Mr. Liu was being held and make ""exclusive"" photographs that would ""prove"" Mr. Liu was in good health and had not been tortured. A Glimpse of Liu **********For the prison authorities, the high point of the day came when the warden suddenly interrupted his briefing on how prisoners are reformed through ""love and nurturing care."" If the reporters would care to step to the window of the conference room, he said, they might catch a glimpse of Mr. Liu walking by. **********There, through the smoked glass window overlooking the prison yard, the reporters saw a self-conscious Mr. Liu wearing a padded prison uniform and being escorted along a sidewalk by a prison officer. In a few seconds, he was gone. The warden returned to a video presentation showing Mr. Liu in various animated activities. **********""Among so many criminals, we chose to let you see clips from Liu Gang's life in order that you could see his healthy condition,"" the warden said ""If he had been abused, would he be this healthy today?"" **********Before President Clinton decides this year whether China is making ""overall significant progress"" on human rights to permit extension of favored trade status, this prison excursion seemed an empty propaganda show. **********If the prison authorities are hiding a record of torture, which they insist they are not, they are not likely to open their doors any further. But reforms building in other parts of the Government may soon bring a greater level of accountability, including inspections by independent authorities. Reform Attempts Seen **********Some American officials believe that China is taking steps to reform its judicial and penal system with more supervision and the rule of law. And it has invited the International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss how China could open its prisons to Red Cross inspection as a way to prevent abuse and torture of prisoners. **********But progress is slow. **********Mr. Liu's jailers said no one in the prison administration or from the Ministry of Justice or any other judicial or prosecutorial body in China had ever investigated Mr. Liu's accusations of torture -- because, they said, he has never filed a complaint. **********They also acknowledged that all the videotapes they have released of Mr. Liu playing pool, volley ball and cutting his birthday cake were made months after the reported torture and beatings. **********In his only interview in prison with a state-run magazine, Mr. Liu asserted he had been ""inhumanely treated"" and ""cruelly tortured."" The magazine said the medical records of the prison showed that Mr. Liu had seen doctors 15 times for headaches, palpitation and diarrhea. **********Asked what he would do at the end of his term, Mr. Liu was blunt in the presence of his jailers. ""Liu said the first thing he is going to do after his discharge is to sue the officials and prisoners who attacked him physically."" Letters Produced **********Trying to discredit Mr. Liu, one of his jailers, Qi Guoxing, read two signed statements from him. The first letter, written in July 1991, praises the prison administration as ""strict"" but ""civilized."" It is signed, ""The counter-revolutionary criminal, Liu Gang."" **********The date of this letter indicates that it was signed immediately after a period of what Mr. Liu described as torture in a letter smuggled out of the prison two years later. **********The prison guard produced a second letter, dated August 1991, that is a political attack on Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader. But perhaps with a flourish that Mr. Liu knew his friends would recognize, he ended the letter with this postscript: **********""Long live undefeatable Marxism-Leninism; long live Mao Zedong thought and the October revolution; long live the Communist Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Socialist cause will ultimately be victorious in the world."" **********For democracy campaigners in China, this parody of dogmatic allegiance to Chinese Communism was the giveaway that Mr. Liu was still resisting."

Agreement Provides Shared Duties at Border Crossings,Israel-P.L.O. Agreement Provides Shared Duties at Border Crossings," **********The new security agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization calls for shared responsibility at border crossings into the occupied territories, with each side having its own station, police force, flag and right to stop and search suspicious travelers. **********But a text of the accord made public by Israel today makes it clear that the Israelis will be the senior partner. They will have the final say on who may enter the territories when self-rule gets going there, starting in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. **********Similarly, the agreement initialed in Cairo on Wednesday night calls for joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols on three major roads in Gaza that connect Jewish settlements there to Israel. But Israel will lead the patrols, and if it feels that it must carry out security operations on its own, it retains ""all necessary responsibilities and powers"" to do so.  [ Excerpts, page A12. ] More Talks Needed **********These are some of the more important points in the Cairo understandings, praised by both sides today as a breakthrough but actually only a partial settlement that will apparently require several more weeks of negotiations. **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said that at least another month was needed to clear away remaining obstacles, on lingering security matters and also on economic relations and on the transfer of civil authority in the territories. **********Until they are all resolved, Israeli officials said, they will not order the troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho that was supposed to have begun on Dec. 13 but has been held up by persistent negotiation impasses. Promised releases of Palestinian prisoners also seem likely to be put on hold until a full agreement is reached. No Celebrating in Territories **********Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, who initialed the understandings with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, said he hoped everything could be settled in two weeks. **********Whether it takes four weeks or two, there was no celebrating today in placid Jericho and turbulent Gaza, where Palestinians said they were disenchanted because nothing has changed in their daily lives five months after the momentous signing ceremony on the White House lawn. Many said they would not believe that Israel meant business about its promised withdrawal of forces until they saw it. **********Also unhappy were Jewish settlers in the territories and right-wing opposition parties, which said the Cairo accord had put Palestinians closer to their hoped-for state and Israelis deeper into danger. **********But Government officials, while far from ebullient, breathed sighs of relief that they had left Cairo with a deal that largely took care of crucial issues like the border crossings and patrols on Gaza roads connecting settlements to Israel. Also largely settled was the size of the autonomous Jericho district -- 21 square miles -- although that is a detail that may still change, officials said. **********For both sides, the important point was that they could claim a breakthrough after weeks of grueling negotiations and frustrating deadlocks that were threatening to lead nowhere. Neither wanted to see yet another Peres-Arafat meeting -- the third in three weeks -- produce nothing tangible for an increasingly restless public. Worst Disputes Resolved **********While Israeli officials acknowledged that many issues remain, they said they had overcome the most troublesome security disputes, showing that they and the Palestinians were able to move forward despite continuing mistrust. **********""I believe certain walls of suspicion are starting to crumble,"" said Uri Savir, the Foreign Ministry director general and a senior negotiator. **********Mr. Rabin called the agreement ""an important step forward,"" praise echoed in Washington by President Clinton, who said it represented ""another big milestone."" **********Palestinian leaders were more reserved, in part because Mr. Arafat had backed down on key matters like Israel's demand for veto power over travelers trying to cross from Jordan and Egypt into the territories. Besides being able to stop Palestinians it considers suspicious, the Israelis may turn away all travelers who are not West Bank or Gaza Strip residents. That includes Palestinian refugees, Mr. Savir said. **********But Mr. Arafat, who wants symbols of authority in the territories, could claim victory with the right to post armed Palestinian police officers and fly the Palestinian flag at border terminals. Neither Gets Everything **********""These were tough negotiations, and we didn't get everything we wanted,"" Nabil Shaath, a senior P.L.O. negotiator, said in Cairo. ""But then neither did the Israelis."" **********As Israeli officials describe the talks, they involved weighing Israel's need for security assurances against the Palestinians' desire to demonstrate that they are in charge of their own lives. The officials insisted that they held firm on security, but made concessions to the Palestinians when that was not at issue. **********""We want them to demonstrate their ability to control what's going on, which is the basis of this whole agreement,"" said Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, a negotiator in Cairo. ""If it turns out that this agreement relies on a weak reed, we haven't achieved anything."" **********In few places does the security-dignity balance come into sharper focus than at the border passages: the Allenby Bridge near Jericho, connecting the West Bank and Jordan, and the crossing from Egypt to Rafah at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. Security vs. Sensitivity **********Since capturing the territories in the 1967 war, Israel has asserted its need for strict border searches, especially of the thousands of travelers crossing the Allenby Bridge each year. But what the Israelis consider a security necessity, Palestinians regard as insensitive procedures that often leave them feeling humiliated. **********Under the Cairo agreement, travelers crossing the border with Jordan or Egypt will enter a terminal made up of two wings -- one serving Israelis and others journeying to Israel, the other for Palestinians and travelers heading to Gaza or the West Bank. **********Overall responsibility for the terminal rests with an Israeli director general. The ""Israeli wing"" will be solely in Israeli hands, with the Palestinians having no authority there. The ""Palestinian wing"" will be jointly manned. A Palestinian will be in charge there, but he would have to answer to the Israeli terminal director. **********Once passengers have gone through the terminal, they will have ""safe passage"" to Gaza and Jericho. In other words, travelers crossing the Allenby Bridge will face no interference from the Israeli authorities for the few miles to Jericho. Inspection Procedures **********But before that, they will have been checked at the Palestinian wing by both Israeli and Palestinian police officers. With Jericho and Gaza residents, the Israelis are supposed to be ""invisible,"" monitoring movements electronically behind partitions. But they will be able to conduct hands-on inspections of other travelers, opening luggage and taking suspects into a side room for more detailed searches. **********Thus, Israel remains in charge of ""external security"" during the planned five years of self-rule. But the accord says that both sides ""are determined to do their utmost to maintain the dignity of persons passing through the border crossings."" **********On the size and shape of the Jericho district, the Israelis declined to make a map public, and they said the agreed-upon area of 21 square miles may be still changed by Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat, who are to meet at some point to sign a final accord. **********But from official descriptions and sketches in local newspapers, the district forms a rough circle around Jericho, jutting northward in a narrow shaft to encompass the Palestinian village of Al Auja while avoiding adjacent Israeli settlements. In addition, Palestinians are to have ""safe passage"" to two nearby religious sites and to a planned Israeli-Palestinian joint-venture hotel on the northern shore of the Dead Sea -- areas just outside the Jericho district. **********The agreement calls for a review of security arrangements after a year. Questions on Police Force **********Still to be settled are important details about the Palestinian police force and its relationship with the Israeli army. Among the unanswered questions: Can the army, in hot pursuit of a Palestinian suspected of killing a settler, chase him into a Gaza refugee camp? Or must it turn the job over to the Palestinian police, even though many Israelis assume that the hunt would then stop? **********On the economic front, customs procedures and Palestinian access to overseas markets have yet to be defined. Similarly, important areas of civil authority remain unclear, including Palestinian broadcast rights, city planning and water distribution. **********""In my assessment, another month will be needed to finish the details of the agreement to a full accord,"" Mr. Rabin said. ""I hope a month will be enough. It could take a little more. Remember, in our eyes there are no sacred dates."" **********Remarks like those left many in Jericho unconvinced that Israel intends to leave by the April 13 target for the completion of a troop withdrawal.  ""When will this thing be felt on the ground?"" said Izak Shawa, a grocery store owner. ""When Rabin says one month, it means the Israelis don't want peace. Why delay and delay?"""

It also said it would try to sell rights to its technologies, while maintaining a small organization to provide service and support for its 112 supercomputers in use around the world. **********Thinking Machines, which lost $20 million in 1993 on revenue of $82 million, has held discussions with about 20 companies in search of a solution to its financial problems. In the last few weeks, the talks had narrowed to AT& T and Sun Microsystems. But executives of Thinking Machines said yesterday that the company's financial liabilities had proved too daunting to its suitors. **********""Sadly, the parts seem to be worth more than the whole at this point,"" Richard P. Fishman, the chief executive, said yesterday. **********The privately held company was last profitable in 1990, when it earned $1 millon on revenue of $65 million. Spawned at M.I.T. **********Thinking Machines, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded 10 years ago by a group of M.I.T. students. It was a pioneer in developing a technique known as massively parallel computing, which involves linking hundreds or thousands of inexpensive microprocessor chips to reach supercomputing speeds. **********Recently the company has sought to develop a less powerful parallel computer aimed at mainstream commercial users. But it has struggled over the last four years as larger companies like I.B.M., Cray Research and Intel have entered the market and Government funds for supercomputing have eroded with the end of the cold war. Triumph of the Careerists **********""It's sad but the industry is moving toward bigger players,"" said Terry Bennett, director of technical-systems research at Infocorp, a market-research company in Santa Clara, Calif. ""It was a gun-slinger, high-performance, bright-idea market for a long time. Now, it's a deep-pocket, longevity and security market."" **********Sun Microsystems had been seen as Thinking Machines' last, best hope because it is the developer of the Sparc microprocessor chip used in Thinking Machines' CM-5 supercomputer. People familiar with the Sun negotiations said technology experts at Sun had recommended acquisition. **********In the end, Sun decided not to acquire the company largely because of the difficulties in managing a large division 3,000 miles from its Silicon Valley headquarters, several people familiar with the negotiations said. **********Executives of Thinking Machines would not discuss its financial situation in detail yesterday. But they said that among other liabilities, it was locked into a long-term lease for its headquarters, obligating it to spend more than $40 million in the next five years. Thinking Machines has not paid its rent for the last six months, company officials said. **********As concern about its viability has grown, its financial trouble has multiplied this year. It has found it increasingly hard to sell systems generally priced from $10 million to $20 million. **********For a company of Thinking Machines' size, the difference between success and failure might ultimately have come down to a missed sale or two. Mr. Fishman noted, for one thing, that Thinking Machines had not been able to sell a large CM-5 computer to the Japanese recently. **********Several industry executives said that in 1990 and 1991, the company had missed opportunities to issue stock to the public, and also to be acquired by Cray Research. **********Private and institutional investors have put more than $125 million into Thinking Machines, and the company will try to sell pieces of its technology to help recoup money. Items for Auction **********It is looking for buyers for a future parallel computer under development, for its software-development tools and for a ""data-mining"" software application called Darwin that enables a supercomputer to plow through reams of data to identify underlying relationships. American Express, for example, uses Darwin and a Thinking Machines computer to mine its credit-card data for new information about its customers. **********The company is also considering trying to license its basic technologies widely in the industry. **********Danny Hillis, a co-founder of Thinking Machines, who has been its chief scientist, said that no matter what happened with the company, he had not given up on his original goal -- building a machine that could think. **********""I still want to make a thinking machine,"" Mr. Hillis said. ""This is a setback, but building a fast computer was just a step toward that goal."""

They had endured divorces, loneliness, alienated children, thwarted ambition. Several had committed suicide. But nowhere in the 592 pages of ""The Class"" is anyone out of work, or pressed for cash. A Harvard degree seemed an immunization against unemployment. **********Mr. Segal saw the 25th reunion of the class of 1958 as a gathering of the privileged. ""It was not merely that you were going to make your way, but as a Harvard man the way was prepared for you,"" Mr. Segal said last week. ""This is not arrogance. Unemployment was not part of our emotional baggage, not part of the range of things that we thought we would ever have to face."" **********How times have changed. In the nearly 11 years since that reunion in June 1983, at least 10 percent of the 1,040 surviving members of the all-male class, and perhaps as many as 20 percent, have lost jobs, according to those in the class who organize the reunions and track their mates. **********Some, like Richard V. Wing, a manager at Honeywell, were laid off and, after looking unsuccessfully for new jobs, took premature retirement. Others, like A. Donald Slotkin and Thomas O. Bernheim, lost their jobs and became consultants while they looked for new work, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. Others forced from their careers, like Edward Gray, have retrained themselves and are now self-employed, often at a far lower income than before. And a few, like Thomas A. Stalker, who lost the family business, are surviving with welfare payments and food stamps. **********Food stamps are a dizzying turn of events for people who came out of Harvard expecting an inside track to the most interesting and lucrative careers, and to a comfortable retirement. The class of 1958, whose members are 56 or 57 years old today, was far more homogeneous than the class of 1994. Almost all the 1,174 men who earned bachelor's degrees in 1958 were white and upper-middle or upper class. Many had prepared at top-notch secondary schools or private academies. **********The class of 1958 included John D. Rockefeller 4th, now a Democratic Senator from West Virginia, along with other sons of wealthy families. Some in the class were talented scholars, like William French Anderson, who went on to pioneer in gene transfers. And there were those who were not so studious, earning, with minimum grades, their privileged lives as Harvard graduates. **********Some from the class of 1958 became prominent business leaders, like James R. Houghton, now chairman of Corning Inc. Academia, medicine, finance and law drew many class members, and most have had successful careers. Their incomes reflect it; the average annual income of the 402 class members who responded to a questionnaire last year was $170,000. An Unexpected Intruder **********But job troubles are increasingly intruding on this cheerful picture. ""The members of the class of 1958 are either reaching the senior level of their career paths or they have been tumbled out into doing their own thing,"" said William F. Manley, who compiled the autobiographical sketches published for the 25th reunion in 1983 and the 35th reunion last June. ""I would say that about 25 percent have been tumbled out."" **********The Harvard class of 1958 is not alone in this experience. Alumni groups at other Ivy League schools and at colleges and universities outside the Ivy League report that their members, in growing numbers, are suffering from the upheavals in Corporate America. That is particularly the case for men who received their bachelor's degrees in the 1950's and 1960's and are now over 45. **********If there is a lesson in all this, it is that a degree from a college like Harvard is no longer the lifetime guarantee of success in careers that it once seemed to be. ""The layoffs of managers and skilled technical people at I.B.M. or Xerox or A.T.& T. do not discriminate between graduates of Harvard"" and of some lesser school, Senator Rockefeller said. ""And when they come we are not prepared for this nonsuccess. We don't know how to deal with it, economically or psychologically."" **********In fact, fewer than 10 members of the class of 1958 owned up to their troubles in the autobiographical updates submitted for the 35th reunion report. One was Michael J. Stone, of Orinda, Calif. He left his job in 1991 as a vice president of Dolby Laboratories. He joined a new company formed to recycle waste wood, but it failed, and he was out of the work world. ""I am now in a position of calling myself either unemployed, retired or a job-seeker,"" Mr. Stone wrote. ""I haven't yet decided which."" Last month, he finally got a job, doing the accounting for a real estate investment operation, at a salary of $100,000, which is less than his Dolby income. **********Lynn D. Sprankle, angry and eloquent, has not found work. He lost his job as a corporate vice president, then hunted incessantly for another job, sending out 13,000 resumes, some to his classmates. ""The response from these people was also zero -- no phone calls, no leads, no interviews and of course no offers,"" he wrote for the 35th reunion report. ""So much for the 'camaraderie of the 10,000 men of Harvard.' "" **********Inevitably, Mr. Sprankle, who is 57, questions the value of a Harvard education. ""I no longer look upon it with the pride I once did, and I have come to view my graduate degree"" -- an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania -- ""the same way,"" he wrote. ""In fact, they may even have been detrimental -- in that they caused me to set higher personal expectation levels than I was ever able to attain."" **********Mr. Segal, who is most famous for his first novel, ""Love Story,"" and is teaching this year at Oxford, was struck by how much things have changed for many classmates. In contrast with the autobiographical sketches compiled for the 25th anniversary, those written for the 35th ""did not radiate with expressions of success and optimism,"" he said. ""Quite the contrary, they seemed like a litany of loss and disillusion."" **********Responding to such frustrations, the class of 1958 has emerged as the first among Harvard's alumni groups to publicly recognize the jobs problem. Just before the 35th reunion, Thomas Stalker, who was out of work, mailed a letter to his classmates announcing the formation of a network to help the unemployed find jobs. The letter invited people to a breakfast during the reunion at which people without work could meet classmates who might help. **********One hundred people showed up, among them Robert Waggoner, owner of Burrelle's Information Services, a successful press-clipping and data-processing service, that has his classmates on the payroll. ""There was a feeling at that breakfast that some of these cases were very sad, and it was the tip of the iceberg and there must be more out there,"" Mr. Waggoner said. ""And these people had courage and came forward."" **********The Harvard administration is only now acknowledging publicly that unemployment is an issue among the alumni. ""There are a lot of capable people out there, who are Harvard graduates, who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own,"" Jack Reardon, an associate vice president at Harvard who heads the alumni association, said last week. **********The solution? Mr. Reardon said that several regional alumni clubs would compile lists of members who had agreed to offer advice to other members seeking jobs. Harvard, he said, might try to measure statistically the extent of the unemployment among alumni holding Harvard bachelor's degrees, but has not considered setting up an employment office. ""I am not so sure that Harvard would be particularly good at getting people jobs,"" Mr. Reardon said.  Thomas Stalker From Corner Suite To Food Stamps **********Perhaps no one in the class of 1958 has fallen farther in the job world than Thomas Stalker, a 57-year-old Bostonian who once owned his own business. He is reduced today to selling powdered diet formula to friends and acquaintances. Yet he spends as much time on the phone helping classmates, as the self-appointed chief of the job network, as he does selling diet formula. **********The hardwood-flooring business that Mr. Stalker owned went under in 1989. Five years later, he has still not adjusted to the shock and to the loss of the stature that he enjoyed as a well-to-do businessman. But the job network he has set up to help classmates, and himself, has lifted his spirits. At the 35th reunion, he says, ""I was sought out by classmates, many of whom I did not know, all giving encouragement, advice and thanks."" **********He came to the reunion with food stamps in his pocket. His church has given him money. He gets a $339 welfare check each month. He is behind on the rent for the room he lives in. And when he needs medical treatment, he goes to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he is treated under a state law that provides free health care for people with incomes below the poverty level. **********Like many in the class of 1958, Mr. Stalker had entered a prosperous family business right out of college -- in his case a lumber supply company. Through his own ingenuity, he concentrated the company's marketing effort on selling hardwood flooring, while eliminating other, low-margin products. A newly developed adhesive had made hardwood flooring easier to lay, popular and profitable. **********""Dad paid me the highest business compliment he could when he came into my office one day, closed the door and said, 'Son, I never thought I would see the day when we would be making so much money,' "" Mr. Stalker said. ""Fortunately for him, he died several years later and was not around for the Gotterdammerung."" **********The Gotterdammerung came in the form of a much bigger, out-of-state competitor that pushed into the Boston area with low prices, winning away Mr. Stalker's customers, who were wholesale distributors of hardwood flooring. That blow, along with a weak New England economy and the distractions of a costly divorce, forced Mr. Stalker into bankruptcy. **********In the search for work that followed, Mr. Stalker found that a Harvard B.A. sometimes worked against him. He was viewed as overqualified. So once, when he sought a job selling magazine subscriptions by phone for $6.20 an hour, he suppressed Harvard. ""I put down on the application the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,"" he said. ""I got the job."" Thomas Bernheim Once on the Inside, Now an Outsider **********Thomas O. Bernheim also returned from Harvard to the family business, in his case a leather business in Hoboken, N.J. His father had sent him to Exeter, and Exeter regularly sent half its graduating classes to Harvard, Yale or Princeton. At Harvard, Mr. Bernheim majored in history and became interested in teaching, a goal that made him restless in his business. So in 1971, at 35, he left and prepared for a form of teaching -- training people to be managers. **********By 1979, Mr. Bernheim had joined Wang Laboratories, the big computer company near Boston, and he rose to senior member of a 20-person training department. ""It was a beautiful time,"" Mr. Bernheim said. ""Wang was booming, and we hired a lot of people. They were engineers, and they had to learn management quickly, and we taught them."" **********By 1989, however, Wang was on the skids and Mr. Bernheim's department was abolished. He switched to teaching marketing people. ""I put in a new course on how to use power and influence, and how to be assertive,"" Mr. Bernheim said. ""I taught people how to get things through the company and how to build a common ground with others, and a common vision. It was an exciting time, and I enjoyed this work all the way up to 1991, when I got laid off."" **********He had been making $55,000 a year, and he got half that as severance. ""We knew we were living under the ax,"" he said, ""and we had already started sending out resumes."" **********Mr. Bernheim is still sending out resumes, and answering ads. He is working out of a basement office now, getting by on consulting fees. (His wife does not work, and his three children are on their own.) Mostly, he says, he is concentrating ""on finding that wonderful, full-time job and wondering, 'Why can't I get one.' "" **********Mr. Bernheim, who is 57, has concluded that his main obstacle is age. His Harvard degree also sometimes works against him. ""I am asked, how come I wasn't making more money, and how come I wasn't a vice president,"" Mr. Bernheim said. ""How come? Because I chose to be a coach and contributor, to help others. I chose to do what I enjoyed doing."" Edward Gray A Company Man Left on His Own **********Edward Gray, who is 56, sat in on the job network breakfast at the 35th reunion. ""There was talk that a lot of people would have traveled to Cambridge for the reunion if they could have afforded to do so,"" he said. **********Mr. Gray, who lives near Los Angeles, could afford the trip, but from savings, not from his current income as a self-employed patent expert without enough clients. He is not in this business by choice. After Harvard, Mr. Gray went on to earn a doctorate in physics, and for 23 years, until 1990, he worked in the military industry, on rockets and aircraft, for big contractors like TRW. **********The cuts in military spending, and the job shedding they generated, finally forced him out of the industry in 1989. He has never regained the $75,000 salary he earned at the end, not to mention the generous expense accounts. To survive, Mr. Gray took an 18-week course in patent law, passed a Federal exam and went to work in 1991 for a law firm as a patent agent. His task was to prepare detailed patent applications for inventors. **********But the law firm abolished Mr. Gray's job, in late 1992. So he set up his own one-man shop. ""It has been extremely hard,"" Mr. Gray said. ""Basically, I am constantly marketing. And if I am working on a case"" -- each one takes up to 50 hours and pays $4,000 to $5,000 -- ""then I am aware that this job will finish and I have to find clients."" **********If he could get a job, ""something useful and productive, that would make a contribution to the national security, I would think about it,"" Mr. Gray says. He has submitted his resume to the job network, circling the category ""underemployed."" (His annual income is $40,000, but his wife has an income as a freelance writer, and his children are on their own.) At least, he says, ""what I am doing is intellectually honest and rewarding."" Richard Wing Going to School Instead of Work **********In many ways, Richard Wing of Newton, Mass., finds his early retirement more rewarding than the job he lost. Even before Honeywell Inc. laid him off more than three years ago, he had begun to study for a master's degree in classical civilization at the Harvard Extension School. And now that he is retired, he spends his days at a Harvard museum, cataloging ancient Greek coins -- the subject of his master's thesis. **********Mr. Wing's entry in the 35th reunion book reflects this satisfaction in retirement. But it stands in contrast to what he wrote for the 25th book. **********Then, he had presented himself as a successful engineer and manager for Honeywell, the computer company whose Boston office he had joined right out of Harvard. ""I've had the satisfaction of having some of my designs manufactured,"" he wrote in 1983, ""and I was the first person to transmit computer data by use of a space satellite."" **********The layoffs came after Honeywell was acquired by a French company. The new organization cut back on computer design operations that involved Mr. Wing, and the department of two dozen people that he once headed. ""I saw this coming because I had responsibility for laying off people myself,"" he said. ""I laid off two or three, and I found that very difficult. And when my boss called me in, I realized what was happening and tried to make it easy for him. I walked out with $10,000, and they paid my salary for almost a year. And I have health insurance from them."" **********Mr. Wing, who is 57 now, searched for more than a year for another computer industry job, finally concluding that he would have to leave Massachusetts to get one that matched the Honeywell job, which paid $63,000. ""My wife works as a teacher here, and I would have had to give up school, and I did not want to do that. So when I turned 55 and became eligible for a Honeywell pension, I gave up looking for a job,"" Mr. Wing said. ""We live now on my pension ($25,000) and my wife's salary ($44,000)."" Donald Slotkin Between Jobs? Try Consulting **********Each time he has lost a job, Donald Slotkin has fallen back on self-employment, mainly consulting, as his avenue to the next job. ""Harvard always opens doors,"" he says. ""It does not mean that you will get a job, but having a Harvard degree opens doors, particularly when I am doing consulting work."" **********Mr. Slotkin, who lives in Detroit, is in meatpacking. Coming out of Harvard, he joined the family firm, Hygrade Food Products, remaining there until it was sold in the late 1960's. That was when he first tried consulting. ""It was a good vehicle to stay in touch with the meat business,"" he said. **********Consulting put Mr. Slotkin in touch with the Crown Packing Company in Yonkers, which hired him as president, a job he held for six years. In 1977, after another stint in consulting, he became president of John Morell & Company, a meatpacker based in Detroit, where he lasted 10 years. Morell fell into the hands of Carl Lindner, a corporate raider, and Mr. Lindner put his son in charge. ""I basically had to work for a man half my age, who did not know the business,"" Mr. Slotkin said. **********There was a parting, without a golden parachute but with ""fair severance,"" and Mr. Slotkin spent a year writing a musical, drawing on a skill he had cultivated earlier in life. It wasn't produced, and Mr. Slotkin returned to consulting in 1988, for his longest stint. Consulting finally led last May to his third presidency, at Monfort Pork in Greeley, Colo. **********Mr. Slotkin, who is 57, says that his income is in six figures and that consulting has never paid as well as the presidencies. He commutes from Detroit to the Colorado job. ""I won't go to 65 doing this,"" he said, anticipating the early retirement that has overtaken so many of his classmates. THE NORM IS STILL SUCCESS **********FOR every member of the class of 1958 who lost a job or retired unwillingly, there are two or three or more who are still enjoying successful careers or have gone happily into retirement. One is Edward L. Peirson, who retired as senior vice president of Corning Lab Services, a subsidiary of Corning Inc. **********""I am having fun, smelling roses,"" he says. He has homes on Marco Island in Florida and on Cape Cod, and a ""fairly large boat"" he sails in the Caribbean. And he has enough money. **********Mr. Peirson's career resembled those of executives in his father's generation. After a stint as an officer in the Marines, he joined Corning in 1961, where his father had also worked. He moved up through a series of jobs, reaching senior vice president of the Corning Lab division, with a salary and bonuses above $300,000 a year. **********Corning gives full retirement pensions at 55, with 30 years of service, but Mr. Peirson, who is 57 now, was held over a year to complete some unfinished business. ""There is a lot of emphasis at Corning on succession planning, and if you are successful at this, you are not needed,"" he said. ""I will bet that in the last few years, there were not any officers who worked to 65. On the other hand, very few were told they had to leave."" **********Mr. Peirson had gone to Harvard because his father, who had also gone to Harvard, said he would not pay to send his son anywhere else. And like his father, Mr. Peirson retired from Corning as soon as he was eligible. For the father, who was director of public relations, that was age 62, since lowered to 55. **********Mr. Peirson said that most of the people he dealt with at the 35th reunion did not have a job problem. ""But I suspect,"" he said, ""that there was more concern about jobs at the 35th reunion than the 25th."""

But the advertising blitz that started weeks ago has already proved pretty dreadful, almost as boring as watching a soccer field's grass grow. **********Even those consumers who might actually be interested in following the World Cup matches probably feel by now like goalkeepers under siege from a million Strikers, the World Cup's cartoon canine mascot (think Huckleberry Hound in shorts). **********What is most disheartening, even depressing, is the lack of imagination or creativity in the content of almost every campaign, whether from an official sponsor, a licensee or a so-called ambush marketer seeking to ride the coattails of those who paid to affiliate themselves with the World Cup. **********The result is a dreary similarity as commercial after commercial and print advertisement after print advertisement dully echoes its predecessor. **********All the ads seem to be following a template that features a muscular young man who looks as if he comes from another country -- a country Americans adore, of course, like Ireland, Italy or Norway, certainly not one where the people look, well, you know, different. **********This muscular young man must streak up or down a field, kicking or heading a soccer ball, sometimes two. He must wear a uniform smeared with mud in at least three places, even if the field is dry. After pausing to awkwardly hold up the product he is pitching, he must charmingly mispronounce the English-language version of the campaign slogan, even if he is a Rhodes scholar or was born in the United States. **********And that slogan must include one or more of the following words and phrases: goal, kick, hunger for victory, field, use your head, team, from our team to yours, world, world class, ball, on the ball, dream, cup and ""soccermania!"" -- always with an exclamation mark, sometimes with two. **********Among the most prominent advertiser and agency culprits: M&M/ Mars and D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles; Mastercard International and Ammirati & Puris; McDonald's and Leo Burnett; Pizza Hut and BBDO New York; the Pontiac division of General Motors, also D.M.B.& B., and Reebok International, also Burnett. **********The overwhelming shame of their formulaic approach, apart from the sheer numbness produced by repeated exposures, is that it differs not at all from the conventional, stereotyped images presented for decades in advertising centering on any sport, whether baseball, bowling, basketball or badminton. **********So the marketers and agencies involved in the World Cup are forsaking an opportunity to achieve exactly what they said they wanted to do when they signed up for soccer: to educate, explain and enlighten Americans about the game. **********In a handful of instances, compelling, entertaining ads demonstrate what might have been. The best by far is a television commercial for Nike Inc. by Wieden & Kennedy, in which the images of soccer players on giant signs, painted on the sides of buildings around the world, come to life. **********These proto-players proceed to kick a ball from one city to another, every time knocking out a corner of a wall or, in the final shot, knocking askew a neon sign bearing the Nike logo. The spot conveys the excitement that soccer fans say is inherent in their sport while simultaneously reinforcing the longtime Nike exhortation to ""Just do it."" **********Compare that with, for instance, the ridiculous banners festooning lampposts in midtown Manhattan, on which soccer logos are accompanied by the logos of World Cup official sponsors like Canon, Coca-Cola and Mastercard. **********All the banners accomplish is to suggest that a municipal service like street lights is being sponsored by marketers. Can the police making arrests ""brought to you by Master Lock"" be far behind?"
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/03/business/no-rest-on-trade-the-view-in-tokyo-japanese-skepticism-on-trade.html,Andrew Pollack,1994-10-03,,1235,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Japanese Skepticism On Trade,NO REST ON TRADE: THE VIEW IN TOKYO; Japanese Skepticism On Trade," **********The trade agreements reached on Saturday by American and Japanese negotiators were heralded in Washington as a significant breakthrough in opening Japan's markets for insurance, telecommunications, medical equipment and glass. But the view here was that the end results scarcely justified the 15 months of bitterness, name-calling and mistrust required to achieve them. **********Japan's financial markets also reacted to the trade settlements calmly. The dollar rose to 99.25 yen in morning trading in Tokyo, up from its Friday close of 98.59 yen. One currency trader said the market was expecting an agreement and had already discounted the weekend's news. **********Japanese stock prices also moved higher. The Nikkei index of 225 leading issues gained 105 points in the first 15 minutes of trading but then fell back. At midday, the index was up 50.21 points, or 0.26 percent, at 19,614.02. **********Newspaper editorials here this morning generally welcomed the agreements but suggested that it was time for Washington and Tokyo to focus on broader aspects of their relationship rather than on specific trade disputes. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business newspaper, called the talks a failure of government, negotiated by ""American lawyers who do not know economics"" and ""Japan's stone-headed bureaucrats."" **********Newspapers here also described the agreement as ""tama-mushi-iro,"" a reference to an insect whose color changes, depending on the angle from which it is viewed. That means there are vague terms that could be interpreted in different ways by each side, leading to disputes in the future. **********""Already the understanding on both sides is different,"" the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. **********Japanese officials said Sunday that they had successfully resisted what at one time had been a key demand of American negotiators: the setting of numerical targets for sales in Japan of foreign goods and services. Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, at a news conference Sunday, said, ""I think we stuck to our principles."" **********To be sure, Washington never clearly stated in the early days of the talks what it was aiming at. It said it did not seek single market-share targets, like the 20 percent goal established in a semiconductor agreement signed in 1991. **********American negotiators did, however, talk at times about targets that were more vague -- like having the market share of foreign products in Japan match the level in other industrial nations. At one point, American negotiators called for Japanese purchases of American auto parts for use in new cars to continue rising 20 percent a year, as in the past. **********Those positions have largely been eliminated, and indeed no deal at all was reached in the sector of autos and auto parts, which alone accounts for two-thirds of Japan's $60 billion surplus in trade with the United States. **********""We have not just been talking, we've been listening,"" Walter F. Mondale, the United States Ambassador to Japan, said last week. ""In the process, some of the earlier positions that we tabled have come off the table."" **********To understand the concept of tama-mushi-iro, consider the agreement's provisions that try to set yardsticks for measuring the sales of imported goods. **********The agreement covering Japanese Government purchases of medical and telecommunications equipment, for example, calls for an ""annual evaluation of progress in the value and share"" of procurement of foreign products ""to achieve, over the medium term, a significant increase in access and sales."" **********Japan did not mind measuring the sales and market share of foreign products but did not want to make any supposition about how the numbers should move. And up until the last minute, Japanese bureaucrats were resisting the use of the term ""significant increase,"" viewing it as tantamount to a numerical target. Japanese officials even consulted several American trade lawyers, who advised that the term could be interpreted as an increase of 15 to 20 percent a year. **********But Sunday, one Japanese official said the significant increase was a goal -- not a commitment Japan could be held accountable for. **********Still, the incorporation of this language represented a victory for the United States and contributed to the relatively positive assessments the agreements received from American business leaders. **********""Over all, the industry is happier this week than they were last week,"" said William R. Farrell, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. A week ago, many people, particularly in the electronics industry, were worried that the negotiations would produce nothing of value to them. **********Still, a ""significant increase"" is a fuzzier goal than the United States had originally sought, and an agreement on that language makes clear that during the negotiations the Administration softened what it was willing to settle for in specifying results achieved in a negotiated deal. **********And the agreement on the insurance market places more emphasis on deregulation than on insuring increases in foreign sales. **********In their comments today, Japanese Government and industry leaders generally welcomed the trade agreements. **********""We needed a compromise at any cost,"" said Takeshi Kondo, general manager of the office of political and economic research at the Itochu Corporation, a large trading company. ""The bilateral relationship cannot afford prolonged disputes like this on tiny issues."" **********Another breakdown in talks would surely have led to a renewed rise of the yen against the dollar, further tightening the vise that has been squeezing the competitiveness and profits of Japan's leading manufacturers. **********Officials in Tokyo, however, called it ""regrettable"" that the United States had chosen to initiate sanction proceedings because of the auto sector disagreement. **********But Japan stopped short of carrying through on its threat to file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international body that oversees world trade. **********Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, said at a news conference today that since the United States had not yet actually imposed sanctions, Japan would not take any action. **********Mr. Hashimoto called for a cooling-off period of unspecified length before resuming negotiations on automobiles and auto parts. He also said Washington's demand to ease the rules on replacement parts for automobiles would compromise safety, asserting that in Japan far fewer auto accidents were caused by breakdowns than in the United States. **********The agreements announced Saturday in Washington were the end result of an agreement signed 15 months ago, known as the economic framework agreement, which was supposed to provide a more reasoned and effective way for the United States and Japan to resolve trade disputes. **********""The nature of the way in which we've carried out negotiations for the last 12 years, which is that we whine and they won't move, has been one of the more unproductive bilateral relationships,"" W. Bowman Cutter, an economic adviser to President Clinton, said the day the framework accord was signed in July 1993. **********Yet the recent negotiations had as much whining and resistance as talks in the past, if not more. And it was the threat of sanctions that induced Japan to make last-minute concessions, just as the dangling sword brought about agreements in the past on cellular telephones, public works bidding and numerous other areas."

He figured he would soon be kicking around story ideas with Jann Wenner, interviewing Tom Petty and lunching with Springsteen. Reality intruded. His duties were just a shade more prosaic than expected. ""I was not the hole puncher, but the person who puts the brass tacks in the previously punched holes,"" he remembers. ""And Xeroxing. I learned a whole lot about the Xerox machine."" **********In every generation idealism must bite the dust. But it rarely does so with as much good humor as in Mr. Zevin's new book, ""Entry- Level Life: A Complete Guide to Masquerading as a Member of the Real World."" The book, released by Bantam Books in time for graduation season, is a compendium of cheerfully cynical advice on making the transition from the amniotic sac that is college to the Real World, wherein people who once spent their junior year tracking down all the surviving members of the Brady Bunch suddenly acquire morning routines and new colanders. **********The book includes topics like interviewing prospective roommates (Critical questions: Do you own a VCR?

Do you now or have you ever owned a Wilson Phillips recording?); understanding nutrition (the four Real-World food groups: Take-out, Delivery, Vending Machine, Restaurant); signing the office birthday card (eschew the happy face), and coping with a mid-midlife crisis (move to Seattle). **********Mr. Zevin said in an interview last week that he wrote the book in reaction to all the ostensibly useful, ostensibly serious books his parents gave him when he graduated from college. ""I wanted to write an intentionally funny book,"" he said. Parents could do worse than give ""Entry-Level Life"" to their graduates -- it is after all cheaper than a new car, a Fender Stratocaster or subsidizing another summer on the Lollapalooza tour -- but it might not be in their interest: one of the ways to adapt to adulthood, Mr. Zevin suggests, is to move back home into, as he calls it, a ""rent-free life style."" **********The heart of ""Entry-Level Life"" is Mr. Zevin's advice on finding, hanging onto and leaving jobs, a section that combines in one place all the best sentiments from ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"" ""My Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades"" and ""Take This Job and Shove It."" He notes that most new graduates suffer from reality shock. Many, for example, think college grade point averages mean something in the Real World. Some even think they can get a job through the want ads. Mr. Zevin admits he once fell for a newspaper ad: "" 'Recent grad wanted to travel the world and make a million dollars, call at 3 today,' "" he recited. It was an employment agency. Surprise -- the job was filled. ""They told me to get a haircut,"" he said. **********Mr. Zevin urges job seekers to be resourceful. ""Apply the same approach you would to getting an apartment: look at the obituaries. Send your resume to their surviving employer,"" he said. He devotes a section to resume construction, which means putting what may be meager work experience in the best possible light without actually lying (you weren't a ""filer,"" you were an ""alphabetization technician""). And lessons from school are not entirely irrelevant, he contends: select a job the same way you selected your college courses, by which starts latest in the day. **********HE is not impervious to the rewards of dedication. There is a section on managing supervisors and on the semiotics of contemporary office design. New employees and those slow to rise work from cubes hard by other cubes, all filled with a variety of semi-sufferable office types. ""What you're working for is a door-based environment,"" Mr. Zevin said. **********This may all sound like advice relevant only to the 29-year-old Mr. Zevin's fellow Generation X-ers, but his complaint that iambic pentameter has little Real World utility transcends the decades. ""Entry-Level Life"" should resonate with all those Peter Pan baby boomers who decline to think of themselves as grown-ups, even though they've been around long enough to see the return of the lava lamp and have children old enough to say things like, ""Hey, these guys are really good,"" upon discovering the Beatles. **********The book reveals the real world's dirtiest little secret: you don't actually have to be a grown-up to play one. Well into midlife and as long as the ambition police don't find out, you can do almost any form of work and still prefer to be finding the perfect play order of Dylan's ""Blonde on Blonde"" album. If you pretend you know what you're doing, people will be tricked into taking you seriously. **********This discovery may be a relief, but it leads to what Mr. Zevin calls ""the fear of being found out,"" and this is truly the sensation that links generations, for research shows that only a handful of people who graduated from Harvard, Yale or Columbia during the 1950's are not afflicted by this fear. Mr. Zevin said his father laughed in recognition when he read that section of the book and made a contribution. It is a feeling that never goes away completely and to anyone who says it does, well, in the words of Stuart Smalley, denial is not just a river in Egypt. **********The other thing that never goes away is this question, from Mr. Zevin's model interview: Where do you want to be in five years? **********His answer should work in perpetuity as well. **********""WHAT YOU THINK: Barbados. **********""WHAT YOU SAY: In management."" THE 'UN-ADULTERATED' DAN ZEVIN **********ON two pieces of evidence, Dan Zevin could be accused of having escaped the real world of work and adulthood he skewers in ""Entry-Level Life."" He lives in Somerville, Mass., which, along with Berkeley and Santa Monica in California and Chapel Hill, N.C., is a favorite residence of the adult-challenged. Additionally, his official biography outlines a freelance writing career, a tenuous existence perhaps, but hardly the ""corporate Stairmaster."" **********Mr. Zevin acknowledges Somerville's ""entry-level ghetto"" status. But no, he says, much of the grist for his book comes from his own experience. He has worked in offices and is -- or was -- in fact Xeroxing adept. His weirdest job was as a packager of Mexican jumping beans, or as Mr. Zevin might translate it for his resume, an international peripatetic legume specialist. **********The book has brought Mr. Zevin, who grew up in New Jersey, new opportunities, including the true nongrownup's favorite escape fantasy, the possibility of a movie deal. But even that may not stave off the inevitable process of adultification. ""It's starting,"" he said. He has been invited to several weddings lately and a friend recently broke the real estate barrier -- by buying some. So far, Mr. Zevin's purchases have been limited to a couch and a mountain bike. ""The couch takes up our entire living room. It's not used,"" Mr. Zevin said, sounding slightly disoriented at the memory of purchasing new furniture."

Close to retirement, he had already paid out more than $150,000 in tuition fees, room and board, and expenses, starting when she was 3 years old for nursery school, followed by a private girls' school, a top New England prep school, and an Ivy League college. **********To acquire her master's degree, Ms. Robertson had outlays of about $28,000 annually, $16,500 of that in tuition, for her two-year program, plus such charges as $900 for mandatory medical insurance. To cover these fees, she first took out a package of U.S. government loans for university students, consisting of a Stafford loan, the most widely used vehicle; a Perkins loan, a below-market interest rate loan; and a third loan specifically for graduate students. She also obtained $6,500 in financial aid from the graduate school. **********But the biggest chunk of her borrowings, $17,000, came from Nellie Mae, a private lender to college students, which charges higher rates than the government (recently 9.5 percent compared with 6.22 percent for a Stafford loan). **********It also imposes tougher standards. Only three weeks before classes started Ms. Robertson returned from Taiwan, where she had been studying Mandarin, to discover that her loan was stuck somewhere in the pipeline. The reason: Nellie Mae, whose loans are not guaranteed by the government, runs a credit check, not only on the student, but the parent who cosigns the loan. Unknown to Ms. Robertson's father, whose financial reliability was solid, a $65 department store bill, paid six weeks late because he had been out of the country, had damaged his credit rating. After a rush of frantic phone calls and letters, the credit glitch was straightened out, and the loan was approved. **********Once the cash was in hand and her studies got under way, things went well for her. She received top marks in her field, Asian studies. But throughout her two years of graduate school, her mailbox was filled with computer-printed ""reminders"" that the interest meter was ticking on her loans. **********""Think of the money they're wasting on postage,"" she groused. **********Most of the lenders did give her a six-month grace period between graduation day and the start of repayments. Nevertheless, even before she had collected her diploma, booklets of payment coupons arrived, accompanied by letters that pointedly greeted her as ""Dear Graduate."" **********The specter of monthly payments loomed larger as Ms. Robertson's job hunt yielded only rejection letters or one-shot interviews. Then, just as time was about to run out, a part-time job she had held with a telecommunications lawyer while in school opened a door. She connected with a consulting firm looking for someone who knew telecommunications and was fluent in Mandarin. The result: A job with a starting salary of $35,000. **********The pressure is off, for now. **********""It was definitely worth the investment,"" she said, ""but I'll be paying off my loans until I'm 41."""

Or will it join the others on the ""Euro myth list,"" like the one about fishermen having to wear hairnets as they pull in the catch? Or the regulation that gin bottles must henceforth be round, not square? Or the banning of Britain's red double-decker buses? **********All of these were rumors that bubbled up here as the latest regulation to be imposed by the European Union, mindlessly applied to Britain and the other 11 member countries. **********None of them are true, or entirely true. But they show that anxieties about joining the European Union still run strong and find an outlet in get-a-load-of-this tales that are widely believed and mock the bureaucrats based in Brussels. **********The banana story began with a page-one article last week in The Sun, which reported that ""Brussels bureaucrats proved yesterday what a barmy bunch they are -- by outlawing curved bananas."" The European Union had set minimum requirements for size -- 5.5 inches long and 1.1 inch wide -- and was going to ban ""abnormally bent"" bananas, The Sun reported. ""The crazy laws were drawn up by thumb-twiddling E.U. chiefs who spend thousands on a yearlong study,"" it said. **********Somewhat taken aback, European Union officials acknowledged that a regulation had just been promulgated setting standards for bananas, including the size requirements reported in The Sun. But the standards were set as a result of ""pressure from the trade,"" applied to growers and packers and not retailers, and would change nothing since virtually all bananas sold in Britain already conformed, a spokesman said. **********""It doesn't affect Mrs. Jones going into a greengrocer,"" insisted the spokesman, Peter Dixon. Asked about the issue of the banana's shape, he said: ""The regulation says a banana should not have an abnormal shape. In no sense does it ban curved bananas because a curve is a normal shape for a banana."" **********""Clearly, some people like making fun of the E.C.,"" he said. ""It's always a good story: silly foreigners interfering with the British way of life by doing silly things."" **********European Union officials here have compiled a packet of news releases called the ""myth list."" They range from the grand (""Will investigative journalism be curbed under the new paper on data protection?"" Answer: a directive in this area leaves much to the member states) to the petty (""Will the sale of homemade jams be banned?"" Answer: no). **********Other out-and-out myths concern such things as requirements that fishing boats stock 200 condoms, and that charity shops cannot sell secondhand toys, The one about the round gin bottles apparently came from a newspaper's joke. **********But many of the stories turn out to have a nugget of truth, which is then often exaggerated. For example, fishermen will not be required to wear hairnets, unless they happen to work as fish processors aboard factory vessels. Double-decker buses will not be banned, though new draft directives have been written ""with the more European-style city bus in mind"" and will require an annex to cover double-deckers. **********And there is a directive that is hauntingly similar to the bananas story. It's about cucumbers. It does not ban curved cucumbers, but it does set up a classification system that reserves a special category for cucumbers that are perfectly straight, since they can be packed in a standard size box."

But in a move designed to keep his Fianna Fail party in power, Mr. Reynolds did not ask President Mary Robinson to dissolve Parliament, and this left Irish politics in turmoil. **********Mr. Reynolds ended the 22-month coalition with Labor after Labor's leader, Dick Spring, refused to support him in a vote of confidence. Mr. Spring had attacked Mr. Reynolds over his handling of a much-publicized case involving extradition of a Roman Catholic priest accused, and later convicted in Northern Ireland, of child molesting. Together, the two parties, with 99 seats, had controlled the 166-member Parliament with the largest majority, 37 votes, in the 74-year history of the state. **********In Parliament this morning, Mr. Reynolds announced his resignation and ticked off his achievements, particularly his role in advancing peace in Northern Ireland. Deputies who had attacked him on Wednesday as unfit to govern made it clear that now that he was down, they were not going to kick him again, and praised him for dignity and hard work. **********Dissolution of Parliament would have permitted Mrs. Robinson to authorize a national election before Christmas. But Mr. Reynolds's decision not to ask for it meant that his and other parties were free to try to form a new coalition without an election. His action was widely considered a deft, if desperate, move that could lead to another Fianna Fail-Labor coalition. **********It put Mr. Spring, who was Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, again in the position of kingmaker. He may decide to have his party approve as Prime Minister whomever is chosen by Fianna Fail to replace Mr. Reynolds as party leader. **********The possibility of a reconciliation between Labor and Fianna Fail might have been enhanced this afternoon by the resignation as President of the High Court of Harry Whelehan, who was the Attorney General at the center of the extradition dispute and a principal target of the Labor attacks. Mr. Whelehan resigned after only two days in the post, a day after Mr. Reynolds reversed himself and said the Attorney General was to blame for the failure to extradite the priest. **********The resignation gave rise to speculation that Mr. Reynolds might now feel vindicated and try again to be prime minister in a coalition. **********Mr. Spring could also choose to enter a coalition with the largest opposition party, Fine Gael and other smaller parties, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left. **********One factor that Mr. Spring and the leaders of the other parties will consider is the presumed public opposition to a new election in the weeks before Christmas. Also, recent polls show that Labor would be likely to lose as many as 10 of its 32 seats in a new election. The polls, taken before Mr. Reynolds's resignation, have indicated that Fianna Fail, which has 67 seats, is getting stronger. **********Mr. Reynolds is expected to resign on Saturday as party leader. The party is then expected to choose a new leader who would try to become the head of another coalition with Labor. **********""What started as a tragedy is now disintegrating into a farce,"" said John Bruton, the leader of the opposition Fine Gael, who has declared his willingness to be the next Prime Minister. **********Independent political analysts differed on what would now be best for the country. Some said a new Fianna Fail-Labor coalition would keep the continuity of the Northern Ireland peace effort, in which Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Spring had played significant roles. Others said the delay in forming a new coalition would slow the process and make it difficult for Ireland to meet a pre-Christmas deadline with Britain for working out new guidelines for peace."

SEEKS POWER FOR BOSNIA STRIKES,TERROR IN SARAJEVO; U.N. SEEKS POWER FOR BOSNIA STRIKES," **********Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked NATO today for authorization to order punitive air strikes against Serbian gun positions around Sarajevo. **********He already has the authority to unilaterally request NATO air power to defend peacekeeping troops in Bosnia, but he cannot order punitive attacks. In a letter today he sought NATO approval to order punitive air strikes if he deems them necessary. So far he has not requested punitive strikes. **********In the letter to NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, Mr. Boutros-Ghali asked him to seek authorization as quickly as possible from the NATO Council in Brussels to empower its Southern Command to attack Serbian guns encircling the Bosnian capital.  The NATO Council is to meet on Monday to discuss a response to the mortar attack that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo market on Saturday. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali sent a note today to the Security Council President, Roble Olhaye of Djibouti, informing him of his request. Boutros-Ghali's Frustration **********A senior United Nations official said tonight that the Secretary General has become increasingly frustrated in recent weeks by a tendency to blame the United Nations for the continuing war in Bosnia and the unwillingness of world powers to take action to stop it. **********""We have the political will to use force against attacks on Sarajevo now, but we have to be sure that NATO does not refuse us,"" the official said. **********Any attacks would be planned and ordered by a senior American officer, Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the head of NATO's Southern Command, from his headquarters in Naples, Italy. **********In his letter, the Secretary General wrote that mortar attacks last week on Sarajevo, at least one of which came from Bosnian Serbs, ""make it necessary to prepare urgently for the use of air strikes to deter further such attacks."" Source of Attacks Unclear **********It was not clear which of the recent mortar attacks was launched by Serbian forces, or whether air strikes on Serbian gun positions would come only in response to future attacks on Sarajevo. **********The Secretary General's request for authority to call air strikes appears likely to involve him in a struggle with Russia, which in the past has taken the view that the Security Council must first approve any request for the use of NATO warplanes in Bosnia. **********Tonight, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative to the United Nations, said she was ""pleased"" by the Secretary General's letter to NATO, saying that it showed ""the United Nations and the alliance can cooperate together."" **********American diplomats say President Clinton also asked Ms. Albright today to press the Secretary General to intensify the investigation into the mortar attack on Saturday. An End to Peacekeeping? **********But many officials believe that punitive air strikes against the Serbs could spell the end of the United Nations peacekeeping and relief role in Bosnia. **********They fear that the use of force against the Serbs would turn them against the lightly armed peacekeepers and the civilian aid workers they escort, forcing Governments to cancel both operations rather than put their soldiers and relief workers at risk. **********The United Nations has been moving steadily closer to using force since the NATO summit meeting last month reaffirmed the alliance's readiness to use air power if necessary to reopen Tuzla airport to relief flights and to end Serbian efforts at blocking the rotation of the guard at Srebrenica, a Muslim pocket that was declared a United Nations safe area. **********Late last month the Secretary General issued a plan for achieving both these goals. He warned that if the plan failed, he would be ready to order air attacks against any Serbian forces that interrupted them. **********However, he warned that if the Serbs really press home an attack against United Nations forces opening the airport or rotating the Srebenica guard, he would be unable to achieve these goals by force unless countries provide him with additional troops equipped to fight a modern land war. **********There have been other allied threats of air strikes. Last August, the United States and its NATO allies warned the Bosnian Serbs that NATO was prepared to use air strikes unless they ended the ""strangulation"" of Sarajevo. **********--------------------       CEASE-FIRE EFFORT FAILS **********SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Feb. 6 (Reuters) -- In Bosnia, a hasty round of shuttle-diplomacy talks led by a United Nations representative failed to produce a cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Government. The talks collapsed today, Reuters quoted the the United Nations envoy, Yasushi Akashi, as saying. **********Earlier, Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency, reported that Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, said in Belgrade today that a draft cease-fire between Serbs and Muslims in the Sarajevo area had been drawn up. Mr. Akashi said the biggest obstacle to an accord was the Muslims' insistence that Serbs withdraw the artillery ringing Sarajevo."

Albert D. Friedberg sympathizes with bond investors over it, and over their many other woes. But he is easily cheered. He just thinks about his three-month bonds that earned a 31 percent annualized return. Or his July 1998 government bonds, yielding 10 percent. **********The catch: the bonds are foreign, from Turkey and New Zealand, respectively. To get such enviable returns, Mr. Friedberg, head of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, had to court political, currency-exchange and other perils that some advisers say should be red flags for all but well-heeled bond buyers. **********""An investor should have about $1 million"" over all to buy foreign debt, said John Charlesworth, debt strategist at Merrill Lynch. ""Others, use a mutual fund."" Funds can diversify, and they often hedge against currency swings. **********Not everyone is so strict. ""Yes, you can get banged with foreign bonds,"" said James Buck of Oppenheimer. ""But they occasionally have advantages over domestic debt."" **********The case for foreign bonds starts with alternative investments. For the year through Oct. 31, domestic bonds have dropped 3.37 percent in value, domestic bond funds are down 3.48 percent and the average global bond fund has lost 3.78 percent. **********The lesson: individual foreign bonds may be risky, but they are not alone. And in some ways they can lower risk. By holding foreign bonds until maturity, investors can shield their principal from erosion. Funds, which buy and sell bonds to raise returns and pay redemptions, cannot. **********Then comes the ""spread,"" or the gap between domestic and foreign yields. At 10.04 percent, for instance, the July 1998 New Zealand bond yields 2.35 percentage points more than a similar United States bond. **********And spreads can cushion currency losses, said Elizabeth R. Morrissey of Kleiman International Consultants. New Zealand's dollar, now worth 62.3 American cents, can drop to 58 cents before investors in its July 1998 bond will earn less than with a Treasury. **********Individual bonds can also benefit from the potential currency gains. For while hedges soften adverse currency swings, they also dilute profits from good ones. **********""We do not hedge,"" Mr. Friedberg said. ""We look for a double whammy when possible -- profits from interest rates and from currency."" And opportunities abound, he believes. ""We look at about 50 countries,"" he said. ""You can find good ones."" Among his picks: a Spanish bond in German marks and a General Electric bond in Swiss francs. **********At Oppenheimer, favorites include two dollar-based Argentine bonds, one issued by Baesa, the Pepsi bottler, and one by YPF, the large oil company. At Merrill Lynch, investors can buy Canadian bonds for a minimum $10,000 and secure yields one percentage point higher than here, Mr. Charlesworth said. **********Generally, though, Merrill Lynch restricts foreign bond purchases to $100,000 or more. Oppenheimer has a $25,000 minimum -- ""and that isn't ironclad,"" Mr. Buck said. At Friedberg, which is based in Toronto and recently opened a New York office, the floor is just $5,000. **********Wherever they go, investors may find a buyers' market. The global competition for cash means higher coupon rates and lower taxes. ""In some emerging countries, taxes were 40 or 50 percent,"" Ms. Morrissey said. ""Now, very few are in double digits."" Many nations offer floating-rate bonds, too. **********And investors can reduce risk themselves. Stay with public debt and short maturities. Friedberg's foreign bonds are mostly under five years, and emerging nations' bonds often mature in 28 or 91 days. **********Track currency movements, too. While erratic currency moves grab headlines, ""you can often see a uniform path in currencies -- say, down 1 percent a month,"" Ms. Morrissey said. Then, compare the yield with the expected currency trend. **********Mr. Friedberg did just this when he bought Turkish bonds in August. On the one hand, the three-month bond had a sky-high 22 percent return. On the other, the Turkish lira was unstable. Over all, ""I felt the currency would depreciate less than the interest,"" he said. It did. During the bonds' term, the lira fell 14.25 percent, leaving a 7.75 percent gain. **********Averse to any currency risk? Try dollar-based debt. ""Peru's corporate bonds are in dollars, yielding 9 to 14 percent,"" Ms. Morrissey said. ""Can you get that here?"" **********But before calling Lima, hold on. Even fans of foreign bonds issue strong cautions. Foreign bonds ""are clearly not risk-free,"" warned Neil Rackoff, head of Friedberg U.S. Although the firm has a low sales minimum, Mr. Friedberg said, ""to get diversification you need at least $80,000"" in foreign debt. **********Ms. Morrissey agrees. Hungary had a steady currency, she said. Then came August. ""They devalued. In one day, there went 8 percent."""

""Almost regardless of what happens, the genie is out of the bottle."" **********Some Internet purists will never be comfortable with any commercial activity in cyberspace. But, Mr. Nisenholtz argued, others will accept or even welcome advertising if it is done properly. **********Mr. Nisenholtz's proposed guidelines were published last month in the newsletter Technology & Media, and subsequently in Advertising Age. Adherence to the rules would be a clear break with the anarchic conditions that allowed a two-member law firm to irritate millions of net users with unsolicited ads. These are some of the proposals of the six guidelines: ***********Don't send intrusive messages. No one should receive a commercial message he or she hasn't either asked to receive, or doesn't want to receive. For example, if a user requests information from companies selling ski equipment, companies within this category should be able to send information. But it should be forbidden to add the user's name to a mailing list to which she or he has not subscribed. ***********Don't sell consumer data without the express permission of the user. Unlike some commercial services, like mail-order catalogues, where users generally understand that their names will be sold to other businesses, Internet data should remain the user's private property. ***********Advertising should appear only in designated news groups and list servers. The most objectionable advertising on the Internet is unrelated commercial postings to news groups and conferences, which are usually cross-posted to hundreds of groups. Those who post off-topic commercial solicitations should be warned once by the news group or conference administrator, then filtered at the source from further postings. ***********Conduct promotions and direct selling only under full disclosure. Marketers should be free to offer promotions on the network. But users should be given an opportunity to review the rules, guidelines and parameters of an offer before they commit to responding. ***********Conduct research only with the consumer's informed consent. Marketers should be able to conduct consumer research so long as respondents are made fully aware of the consequences of answering the research questionnaire. ***********Never use Internet communications software to conceal functions. Marketers should never use communications software to surreptitiously gather data from unsuspecting users, such as scanning their hard disks for data without permission. **********""These really were meant as a kind of first step, a kind of stake in the ground for the marketing community to start to understand what the issues are,"" Mr. Nisenholtz said. The guidelines seek ""a middle ground between being completely noncommercial and a complete free-for-all,"" he added. **********So far, Mr. Nisenholtz said he had received little feedback on his proposed guidelines, though Ogilvy & Mather has several clients that want to advertise on the Internet. Perhaps not surprisingly, the guidelines are viewed favorably by entrepreneurs seeking to create commercial venues on the Internet. **********""These are the most fascinating, in-tune set of principles, both with the culture of the Internet and with the whole notion of on-line business,"" said Chris Locke, president of the Mecklerweb Corporation in Westport, Conn. It is a subsidiary of the Mecklermedia Corporation, a publishing and trade-show company that has a commercial domain on the Internet. **********""There's this concern among the existing Internet community that business involvement means here comes the Philistines,"" he added. ""But if we don't have business involvement, I don't think we'll have an Internet."" **********Not everyone is so impressed with Mr. Nisenholtz's efforts. ""These guidelines don't really prevent you from doing anything,"" said Michael Godwin, general counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a lobbying group in Washington. ""But in a sense, no set of rules is going to be enforceable because the Net is not hierarchically organized. There's no one to police it. What you do know is if you cross the line, you'll generate far more bad publicity."" **********Mr. Nisenholtz said the guidelines were intended to respect the difference between the Internet and commercial on-line services like Compuserve, Prodigy and America Online. These have operated primarily on a pay-per-use basis, like telephone services, with the exception of Prodigy, on which advertising shares each screen with other information. There is limited advertising on the other services, but it is typically segregated to on-line ""malls,"" where it can be easily avoided. **********""In a commercial service like Prodigy or America Online, the user should understand that he's involved in a primarily commercial activity, and make a decision to accept or reject that service,"" Mr. Nisenholtz said. ""You can't do that with the Internet because there's only one Internet. So you've got to set up some boundaries."""

But over the long  term, they are expected to make it more difficult for corporations to remain passive investors. **********""This adds a regulatory seal of approval to what had been a maverick activity,"" said John C. Wilcox, managing director at Georgeson & Company, a proxy solicitation firm. ""Public pension plans have profoundly changed Corporate America and this is another part of that change. It will keep the trend moving."" **********Shareholder advocates have long argued that as the owners of corporations they are entitled to a say in management issues like the composition of boards,  executive pay and corporate policy, contending that that corporate executives' first duty is to increase shareholder value. To this end, they have been effective in bringing about changes in strategy and executives at major companies including American Express, I.B.M.and Eastman Kodak. **********Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said yesterday that the new regulations ""send a clear signal that we want corporations to become more active monitors of long-term corporate performance."" **********""This puts them on notice that this is to be expected,"" he said. **********Mr. Reich added that he would not hesitate to enforce the new regulations at  corporations that do not take their proxy responsibilities seriously. **********Adding Value to Shares **********The new regulations state that corporate pension managers may engage in activities to influence the management of companies in their portfolios when that action would increase the value of shares in their pension plans. Corporations are to give clear directions to the independent money managers they hire on how to vote proxies on issues like the independence of corporate boards, merger and acquisition policies and workplace practices. **********""We are trying to encourage corporations to be activist owners,"" said Olena Berg, Assistant Labor Secretary. ""We're saying such activism is consistent with  your fiduciary duty and we expect it will improve your corporate performance. This is a helpful nudge."" **********And in a section that was unexpected by many shareholder activists, the Labor Department also encouraged the spread of American-style shareholder advocacy overseas by stating that the same principles are to be applied to foreign companies whose shares are held by the pension portfolios of United States companies. **********So far, only two large American corporations, General Motors and Campbell Soup, have adopted policies based on these principles. But other corporations are not expected to follow their example soon, even with yesterday's regulations. **********Encouragement, Not Commands **********Corporate executives point out that the regulations do not order companies to take action, but rather use words like ""may engage in activities."" The executives also note that these activities are encouraged only when they are ""likely to enhance"" a portfolio's value -- something that is often hard to prove in advance. **********Myra R. Drucker, assistant treasurer of the Xerox Corporation, which has $5.3 billion in its pension plan, said she ""doesn't see the likelihood of a massive shift in how corporations approach this issue."" **********Ms. Drucker said that most corporations lacked the staff to analyze many of the proxy proposals before them and that they were more inclined to sell shares  of underperforming companies than to agitate for changes. **********""Shareholder activism is one of many investment approaches and we don't feel  it gives us the biggest bang for our buck,"" said Ms. Drucker, who is also vice chairman of the Committee on Investment of Employee Assets, a trade group that represents more than $700 million in corporate pension assets. **********New 'Burden of Proof' **********Nell Minnow, a partner in Lens Inc., a mutual fund whose investments are based on shareholder advocacy principles, said the regulations were likely to make it more difficult for corporations to remain passive. **********""It shifts the burden of proof,"" she said. ""Before, the attitude was 'why are you doing this activism,' and now it will by 'why aren't you doing it.' Shareholder activism will have to be reviewed like any other investment decisions."" **********At the Campbell Soup Company, the only corporation to send out instructions to its money mangers on how to vote proxies, Dorothy Foley, a company spokeswoman, said ""this will be nothing new for us."" **********""Our intentions are not to be corporate activists but to be catalysts for change,"" she said."

Eric Chaperon, a United Nations military spokesman.  U.N. Troops Under Fire **********United Nations troops came under fire from Serbian positions in several areas of Bosnia today. A French peacekeeping soldier was wounded by a sniper in Sarajevo today, and near the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla, Serbian shells struck a United Nations observation post and the United Nations-controlled airport, United Nations spokesmen here said. **********Today's Serbian moves were the most serious acts of retaliation yet for two NATO air strikes carried out at United Nations request on Sunday and Monday against Serbian forces attacking the United Nations-declared ""safe area"" of Gorazde. **********The Serbs surrounded the Krivoglavci site on Monday, deploying troops and laying mines that trapped 20 to 30 United Nations troops on guard there, a United Nations official said. **********""The Serbs gave two deadlines, but they passed and nothing happened,"" a United Nations military official said. ""We will sit tight."" **********""If they resort to force, we will respond in similar fashion,"" the official said, but added, ""We are trying not to provoke the Serbs and keep things as calm as possible.""  A Respite for Sarajevo **********The artillery pieces were impounded in February after NATO warned that any heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area would be subject to attack after Feb. 20 unless they were handed over to the United Nations or withdrawn beyond 12.4 miles from the capital. Nearly 300 weapons were reported handed over to the peacekeeping troops, and the heavy weapons retained by the Serbs have generally been kept outside the ""exclusion zone,"" giving the city its first real respite from almost two years of Serbian shelling. **********The surrendered weapons are now under United Nations guard in seven collection points within the exclusion zone. Three of the collection areas are now surrounded by Serbian troops and minefields, United Nations officials here said. **********After the air strikes the Serbs severed contacts with United Nations diplomats and military leaders, but agreed on Wednesday to meet with Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the co-chairmen of the international peace conference on Bosnia. The two left Sarajevo this morning asserting that they had obtained the agreement of the Serbian nationalist leader, Radovan Karadzic, to meet on Friday with the top-ranking United Nations official in the region, Yasushi Akashi. **********United Nations officials said that a Russian special envoy, Vitaly Churkin, was conducting talks with the Serb nationalist leadership to resolve the Krivoglavci standoff. Until the visit by Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg to the Bosnian Serb stronghold at Pale on Wednesday night, Mr. Churkin was the United Nations' only conduit for passing messages to Serbian leaders.  U.N. Soldiers Abducted **********The nationalist Serbs have detained or restricted the movement of well over 200 United Nations troops since the first air strike on Sunday. United Nations officials here have been loath to use the word ""hostage"" to describe the detained United Nations personnel, but hostage-taking and vengeance killings have been part of the Bosnian war since it began. **********At 5 this morning, Serbian troops abducted 17 United Nations soldiers who had been monitoring seven mortars and two antiaircraft guns in the village of Cifluk, on the edge of the exclusion zone, said the United Nations military spokesman, Maj. Rob Annink. He said that the United Nations commanders planned to monitor the weapons using helicopters. **********The Serbs detained another contingent of six United Nations soldiers in a barracks in the village of Mokro, Commander Chaperon said. **********In Serbia's capital, Belgrade, two firebombs were thrown at the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and an aid worker was threatened at gunpoint as she was about to be interviewed by a Western television team, United Nations officials said.  Serbs Expel Journalists **********The Serbs today expelled all American journalists from the 70 percent of Bosnia they now control. **********Only low-level fighting was reported in the Gorazde area, but United Nations officials reported this morning that refugees continued to stream out of villages near the front line. **********United Nations officials estimated today that the two-week Gorazde offensive by the Serbs, which has given them control of almost all of the east bank of the Drina River, has uprooted 18,333 people, about a third of the population of the ""safe area"" and three times more than previously estimated."

Representatives of Deutsche Bank and of Dresdner Bank AG went to Paris for talks with French bank executives. **********Despite the talks' initial failure, analysts said they expected the French banks, headed by Société Générale and Crédit Lyonnais SA, eventually to reach an accord with their German counterparts that would save the industrial and commodities-trading company. **********""Most French banks are interested in developing their activities in the German market,"" Stephane Arrouays, analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said. ""I can't imagine that they would risk putting Metallgesellschaft into bankruptcy."" **********In the proposed rescue plan, the French banks objected to a measure calling for them to transform a substantial part of their loans into shares of unknown value. They also expressed opposition to a plan to reschedule loans, saying they did not have adequate information on the financial condition of the German conglomerate. **********""Deutsche Bank and the others are not just lenders but shareholders of reference in Metallgesellschaft,"" said Michel Thibout, spokesman for Société Générale. ""It's their responsibility to step in if new capital needs to be raised, instead of shifting that responsibility onto those of us who are just lenders."" **********That, in essence, was also the view taken by Norddeutsche Landesbank, a big German creditor that had withheld its support for a restructuring on grounds that large shareholders who are were creditors - especially Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank - would have got off too easily. The regional bank reversed itself Wednesday, pledging its support to a modified bailout plan that it said put all creditors ""on the same footing."" **********Metallgesellschaft, which disclosed major, unexpected losses last month including some on trades in the oil market in the United States, owes an estimated 235 million DM to Société Générale, 246 million DM to Crédit Lyonnais and 133 million DM to Banque Paribas. Other banks involved, with loans outstanding estimated at between 65 million DM and 75 million DM, include Crédit Commercial de France, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Agricole. **********Crédit Lyonnais and BNP declined to comment on the negotiations. **********Metallgesellschaft, meanwhile, said it remained ""optimistic"" that an accord would be reached in time to prevent insolvency. It tentatively scheduled an extraordinary shareholders' meeting for Feb. 24 to approve the restructuring package. The company said it did not expect a resolution to be announced before Saturday. **********Trading in the company's shares was suspended Thursday but was expected to resume Friday. The stock closed Wednesday in Frankfurt at 226 DM, down 10. **********Keith Brown, banking analyst for Morgan Stanley & Co. in London, said the French banks were in a position of strength in the face-off, as they had relatively little to lose, compared with their German counterparts. **********Altogether, Metallgesellschaft owed 120 institutions worldwide almost 10 billion DM on Sept. 30, 1993, when its financial year ended. **********Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank extended the company 1.5 billion DM in emergency credits in December after it disclosed a pretax loss of 1.8 billion DM. **********Peter Dupont, an analyst at UBS Ltd. in London, said the odds were in Metallgesellschaft's favor. ""If you look at all the precedents for a company this size in Germany or elsewhere, at the end of the day they almost always manage to cobble something together,"" he said. **********A conglomerate of 250 companies in mining, trading, environmental engineering and financial services, Metallgesellschaft is Germany's 14th-largest industrial company."

But with the North continuing to defy international monitors and the Clinton Administration under fire from Congressional critics for its handling of North Korean issues, top Administration officials agreed at a White House meeting today to propose the arms trade ban. **********The arms embargo is to be included in a proposed sanctions resolution that Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate to the United Nations, plans to circulate to members of the United Nations Security Council in the next day or two. **********While the arms measure would strengthen the initial package of sanctions Washington is proposing, officials acknowledged that the Clinton Administration was keeping to its basic plan of delaying any move to impose strict economic sanctions, like a cutoff in the millions of dollars that Koreans living in Japan send to North Korea and an oil embargo. **********Those tough measures would be held in reserve in an effort to deter the North Koreans from abandoning all constraints on its nuclear program, withdrawing entirely from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and beginning to process the spent fuel from the reactor to make plutonium for nuclear weapons. **********Or as a State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, put it today, the Clinton Administration intends to proceed with its ""phased-in approach"" on economic sanctions. ""It would address not only the past actions and behavior of the D.P.R.K. but it would also be designed to provide leverage for future possible actions by the North,"" Mr. McCurry added. **********The White House meeting today on North Korea included Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry, Gen. John M. Shalikasvili and Ms. Albright. **********It took place against the backdrop of rising concern over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and its continued defiance of the International Atomic Energy Agency. **********North Korea alarmed American officials on Monday when it said it would withdraw from the agency and said the agency's inspectors would no longer be allowed inside the country. The agency had decided to cut off $250,000 in technical assistance after North Korea destroyed evidence of its past plutonium production. **********The North Korean announcement, which it reaffirmed today in an official notice to the Clinton Administration, increased fears that the North Koreans would be able to begin producing additional plutonium without international monitoring. **********But North Korea also has yet to follow through on its threat to expel the inspectors and allowed the monitors to do their routine checks at the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon today. **********But the White House has also warned that Washington would consider pushing for quicker implementation of tough economic sanctions if North Korea evicted the inspectors. **********Arms sales have become an important source of income for North Korea. The ballistic missiles North Korea has sold to Syria and Iran have also contributed to Mideast tensions. **********Pentagon officials, who have favored a go-slow approach on sanctions, support the voluntary arms embargo to deter nations from buying and selling arms to North Korea. **********But some Administration officials have been concerned that the voluntary arms embargo might become an empty gesture and undercut the credibility of American sanctions policy. **********The embargo would not be enforced by a blockade. Instead, the Security Council would urge countries to obey it. And Administration officials say it is unlikely that Iran and some other countries would comply."

Yeltsin. **********Still little known in the West, the official, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was chosen in December 1992 by Mr. Yeltsin to serve as Prime Minister, when a hard-line revolt in Parliament forced him to drop Yegor T. Gaidar, who had been the architect of his economic reforms. Mr. Chernomyrdin, a stocky 55-year-old, was a compromise candidate -- the classic ""centrist"" to substitute for the highly provocative Mr. Gaidar. **********It was widely assumed that Mr. Chernomyrdin, who had run the Soviet natural gas monopoly, known as Gazprom, and who was Natural Gas Minister in the first Cabinet of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the mid-1980's, was thought to be someone whom Mr. Yeltsin could easily control. **********A year later, however, it is Mr. Chernomyrdin who is calling most of the shots. Mr. Yeltsin is said by associates to have sunk into one of his post-crisis periods of lassitude and even depression, doing little and saying even less.  He is thought to be showing the strain of the shelling of the old Parliament in October, the parliamentary elections in December and a summit meeting with President Clinton that accomplished little for him.  Battle Over Fyodorov **********But not everything has gone smoothly for Mr. Chernomyrdin (pronounced chair-no-MEER-din). He has yet to complete his new Government, which has been caught up in an extraordinary battle over the fate of a single, 35-year-old banker, Boris G. Fyodorov, the Finance Minister, who has come to symbolize the fate of Western-endorsed economic reform itself. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin, aware of the need to meet Western insistence on economic change, promises that his new Government, no matter its final composition, will fight inflation and be wary of issuing too many cheap credits. **********But Mr. Chernomyrdin's background argues against such promises. The first decision he made when he became Prime Minister in December 1992 was to provide large new subsidies to the energy sector. The second was to institute price and profit controls on many basic items like bread, salt, tea, milk, meat and vodka. He was eventually prevailed upon to change his mind by Mr. Fyodorov, who announced last week that he was quitting as Finance Minister because he was not being given enough authority to do his job. **********Mr. Fyodorov is now scheduled to meet Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday to decide the matter, with signs that Mr. Yeltsin may offer him a job as a special economic adviser, Tass said today. Mr. Fyodorov demands a higher rank, full authority for Government finances and the dismissal of the Central Bank chairman, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, with whom he disagrees on most fiscal matters. Those demands may prove too high a price for Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin to pay. **********During his year as Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin has tried to balance the advocates of anti-inflation market economists -- the so-called reformers -- and industrialists, who have fought for easy credits and high employment even at the cost of dangerously rapid inflation. **********But he was clearly not very neutral. He indicated that he was not in sympathy with the ""reformers."" He regarded them as academics with little practical experience in the kind of big industry in which he and others made their party and administrative careers.  Beijing Meeting Cut Short **********Tellingly, within days of Mr. Chernomyrdin's appointment, Mr. Yeltsin surprised everyone by cutting short a summit meeting in Beijing, saying he had to return to keep ""the core of the Gaidar Government"" from losing their portfolios. **********""The master has to return to impose order,"" Mr. Yeltsin said then, in a dawn news conference. But these days, as Mr. Yeltsin's authority wanes, rubbed away by the severe political battles of the last three years, Mr. Chernomyrdin's hour seems to have come around at last. **********A burly, jowly man with a penchant for unflattering double-breasted suits and a strong dislike for publicity, Mr. Chernomyrdin likes to see himself as a practitioner, a hard worker who rolls up his sleeves and values loyalty above any other virtue. **********He has never made a secret of his dislike for Mr. Gaidar's policies, if not Mr. Gaidar himself. In one speech to managers of defense plants in St. Petersburg, during the period before the April 1993 referendum about Mr. Yeltsin's performance as President, Mr. Chernomyrdin compared the process of privatization -- the highlight of the reformist agenda -- to the forcible collectivization of private peasants in the Stalin era. No 'Pale Shadow' of Yeltsin **********He said the law on privatization needed to be changed, advocated further state support for factories and the energy industry, and stricter state control over energy, food and science. More revealingly, he said Russia still needed Gosplan -- the old State Planning Committee that controlled the formerly centralized economy -- ""but in a slightly different form."" He also said, ""The Government is not going to be a pale shadow of the President."" **********If Mr. Chernomyrdin was preparing himself for Mr. Yeltsin to do badly in the April referendum, he was overly hasty, and quickly reasserted his loyalty to the President. Part of Mr. Yeltsin's loyalty to him now stems from Mr. Chernomyrdin's active support for him in his conflict with the holdover, Soviet-era Parliament last summer and fall. Mr. Chernomyrdin attacked efforts to impeach Mr. Yeltsin, and he swung regional leaders into line in a forceful televised address. **********But another indication of his real convictions was his ready agreement this summer with the Central Bank chairman, Mr. Gerashchenko, to confiscate all Soviet-era bank notes, causing popular panic and driving up inflation, as older notes came pouring into Russia from former Soviet republics. **********Despite the intense efforts of the reformers to get Mr. Gerashchenko dismissed, Mr. Chernomyrdin has supported him, at least up until now, and even took him along on his current trip to Oryol, in central Russia, to talk to collective farmers. On this trip, he promised today to spend billions of dollars to subsidize the agricultural sector, something that cannot help but push inflation higher and slow privatization of the farms. **********During the elections last month, Mr. Chernomyrdin refused to take part, apparently regarding the political fray as demeaning. But he did publicly support a centrist rival to Mr. Gaidar, Sergei M. Shakrai, who nurtured ties to industrialists and regional leaders. Reformers Are Blamed **********As soon as the elections were over, in an interview with the trade-union newspaper Trud, Mr. Chernomyrdin delivered a slashing attack on the economic reformers and on Mr. Gaidar and the Privatization Minister, Anatoly B. Chubais, in particular, blaming them for the strong showing of the caustic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin accused the reformers of ""serious miscalculations,"" ""poorly thought out experiments"" and a failure ""to think about the people, for the sake of whom the reforms were started."" He called the elections ""personal defeats"" for Mr. Gaidar and Mr. Chubais, hinting strongly that they should resign. **********Now, after the success of Communists and ultranationalists in the parliamentary vote, Mr. Chernomyrdin represents a reliable figure for the country's real power structure -- the directors of large state or newly privatized enterprises, collective farms and the bureaucratic bosses who continue to run the country, and who regard Moscow as one big trough of credits and favors. **********Ironically, though Mr. Chernomyrdin represents this ""centrist,"" big business view, its representatives did poorly in the elections, garnering almost no support for a policy direction that is now dominating the Government. Centrists Did Worse **********The centrists -- including Mr. Shakrai's party -- did far worse than Mr. Gaidar and his rival reform economist, Grigory A. Yavlinsky. Civic Union, the party of Arkady I. Volsky, who claims to represent the centrist interests of business and bureaucracy, won fewer votes than ""none of the above."" **********This lack of an electoral mandate for what is now Government policy seems to bother no one in Russia these days. As an article this week in Novoye Vremya put it: ""For now, Chernomyrdin is an exceptionally convenient figure for Yeltsin. He personifies the rejection of both left-wing and right-wing radicalism. There is a powerful oil and gas lobby behind him. Above all, he is a strong figure to stay with his President in a critical moment. For these reasons, Yeltsin has done all he can not to foul his own nest."" **********The price is a Government led by industrial and collective farm lobbyists of the ""reform Communism"" era. First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg N. Soskovets made his career in metals, and Mr. Chernomyrdin made his in gas. Mr. Soskovets has worked steadily to try to win industry -- and its workers -- a longer transition to the market cushioned by cheap credits and subsidies. 'King of State Credits' **********The Deputy Prime Minister for Agriculture, Aleksandr K. Zaveryukha, a former collective farm boss, is known by Western bankers as ""the king of state credits,"" and has made no secret of his strong opposition to private farming and his desire for much more subsidy to collective farms. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin, who says he understands the dangers of runaway inflation but thinks there are ""non-monetarist methods"" of taming it, like wage-and-price controls, will nonetheless have a hard time saying ""no"" to his hand-picked Cabinet. Some Western diplomats suggest that Mr. Chernomyrdin has learned lessons about the need to restrain spending and budget deficits from his forced marriage with the reformers. But Anders Aslund, who just quit as a Government economics adviser, thinks that Mr. Chernomyrdin has learned ""almost nothing at all."" Decision on Belarus Cited **********Mr. Aslund points to the issues that caused Mr. Gaidar to quit: the decision of Mr. Chernomyrdin and Mr. Gerashchenko, without any Cabinet discussion, to unite the economic systems and currencies of Belarus and Russia at a potentially huge cost to the Russian economy, and a similar decision to build a new parliamentary building for $500 million, one-fifth of 1993 spending on social issues and more than was spent on conversion. **********And then there are the ready examples of cronyism and corruption pointed out by Rossiskye Vesti this week. For instance, the paper charges, Mr. Chernomyrdin recently liquidated the 2.6 billion ruble ($1.7 million) debt of the Promstoibank (Industrial and Construction Development Bank), run by an old Oil and Gas Ministry colleague, and granted the bank a loan of 15 billion rubles ($9.7 million) for 10 years at 20 percent annual interest, while inflation putters along at 20 percent a month and rising. **********Without someone like Mr. Fyodorov in the Cabinet with enough power to say no, Western economists and diplomats fear, Mr. Chernomyrdin's fundamental habits of mind, despite his own sincerely stated pledges to the contrary, may send Russia into hyperinflation by August. **********But there is another reason that Mr. Chernomyrdin matters. There are persistent rumors, unable to be confirmed, that Mr. Yeltsin is sick with more than just persistent back pain. Should he be forced to leave office, under the new Constitution Mr. Chernomyrdin takes over and must call new presidential elections within three months. The stolid, cautious Mr. Chernomyrdin is considered, just now, the only plausible candidate able to insure that Mr. Zhirinovsky will not be elected President."

The arrested man was reportedly offering potential buyers between 34 and 50 capsules of similar samples of plutonium as well as 237.6 pounds of uranium 238, which is not used in bombs. **********The Russian authorities have denied that they are missing any plutonium 239, the fissionable material most often used in nuclear warheads. A State of Alarm **********The Bremen prosecutor said the authorities there had no indication that the arrested German man had any connection with two Spanish men and a Colombian arrested in Munich last Wednesday after smuggling in 10 ounces of what was described as weapons-quality plutonium 239 on a flight from Moscow. **********The Munich seizure, by far the largest of highly radioactive material smuggled out of the former Soviet Union since it collapsed at the end of 1991, has sent the German Government into a state of alarm. Officials believe the Spanish-Colombian operation had good enough connections with Russians to make good on the rest of what was offered as an 8.8-pound, $250 million deal. That amount of plutonium 239 might be enough to build a bomb. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl is sending a top aide, Bernd Schmidbauer, to Moscow later this week to discuss with President Boris N. Yeltsin the implications of the discovery that so much extremely toxic and dangerous radioactive material is in the hands of criminals. **********The German authorities simply do not believe the Russians any longer have a functioning control system for these substances and dismiss their denials out of hand, though they also concede that some material could be coming from other former Soviet lands like Ukraine or Belarus, or from eastern Europe. A 'Nuclear Mafia' **********But the Germans also say they know next to nothing about the ""nuclear mafia"" that is trading in the material. **********All they know about the 38-year-old Colombian who smuggled the plutonium in a suitcase to Munich, Justiniano Torres, is that he grew up in Bogota and had lived for years in Moscow as a student. The law enforcement authorities in Munich identified a second man arrested with him last week as Javier B. and said that he was a mechanic. **********The police did not reveal his last name for security reasons, but the Spanish newspaper El Pais identified him as Javier B. Arratibel, 60, a Basque industrialist from San Sebastian. Mr. Arratibel's friends said that he ""was always known for wanting to make money quickly"" and that he had lived in the United States and Morocco, the newspaper reported. **********The third arrested man was identified as Julio O., 49, a builder or contractor said to be from the province of Navarre, also in the Basque region, and believed to have extensive Russian contacts. Number and Variety of Groups **********A fourth suspect, a Spaniard whom the authorities did not identify, is being sought in France, according to the Munich investigators who said Monday that the three arrested suspects had yet to be thoroughly questioned about their Russian contacts and their other possible customers. **********What is particularly alarming is the number and variety of the criminal organizations operating in Germany, apparently because of its proximity to the source of supply and the ready market. **********An undercover police agent interviewed but identified only as ""Peter"" by German television news today said: ""There is a nuclear mafia which is now largely situated in the German-speaking area. This circle of people is ideally suited because it has maintained excellent contacts with the former Soviet Union."" **********The agent said some of the materials were smuggled by boat from the Baltic Sea. **********Russians have not been the middlemen in any of the deals disrupted by the German authorities so far. **********In June, Bavarian police seized eight-tenths of a gram, or .028 ounces, of highly enriched uranium 235 in Landshut and later arrested a Czech and four Slovak men and a 48-year-old German woman as suspects in an apparent scheme to arrange a larger sale of uranium to someone who wanted to build a bomb. **********The German police also found two-tenths of an ounce of plutonium 239 from Russia last May in the garage of a German businessman in Tengen, near the Swiss border in southern Germany. The businessman, Adolf Jankle, is under arrest and has told investigators so far only that he had discussed a possible sale of the material with an Iraqi contact."

Instead, she decided to turn her skills, contacts and reputation for finding good deals into a personal shopping venture in Manhattan.

It is, after all, the prince's own Institute of Architecture that finances the magazine and that hopes to turn its profits on it into institute scholarships. **********In case you missed the point, there is the prince's crest - a crown and three plumes - on the cover next to the title. Also on the cover of the maiden issue: a picture of the prince himself transposed against the facade of St. Paul's Cathedral. **********Then there is the prince's article, ""Power to the People,"" which promises his ""personal perspective"" on achitecture. For the man who once insisted that modern architecture had done more damage to London than the Luftwaffe, and who branded a proposal for an ultramodern addition to the National Gallery as a ""monstrous carbuncle,"" the thrust of his article and indeed of his magazine holds few surprises. ""I think it is a rather wooly and vague piece myself,"" sniffed Chris Palmer, spokesman for the Royal Institute of British Architects. **********In that article the prince lambasts planners and architects who have done much to ""disfigure our towns and countryside"" but denies that he is a nostalgia-crazed crackpot. ""Nothing could be further from the truth,"" he writes. **********Others retain their doubts. ""We would not want to be affiliated with someone of those sorts of views,"" said Janine Furness, editor of ""FX,"" an architecture and design magazine. **********The editors of ""Perspective"" were quick on Tuesday to put some light between their publication and its benefactor. ""It might sound strange sitting in St. James's Palace hearing me say it, but this is an independent publication,"" admitted Colin Amery, chairman of Perfect Harmony Ltd., the company set up to publish ""Perspectives."" **********Befitting a magazine that scorns architects for their insensitivity to the opinions of the people, ""Perspectives"" carries not one but two polls. There, however, it runs into trouble. While British adults dutifully turned thumbs down on modern architecture, children emphatically did not. **********In what it bills as the largest-ever sampling of children's views on architecture the magazine got a bit of a shock. Asked if modern architecture should be ""adventurous and different, even if it does shock and offend,"" 48 percent of the children polled actually said ""yes,"" while only only 28 percent said ""no."" ""Children are more excited about novelty,"" Mr. Cruickshank said. **********Architecture is not the only thing getting a major boost in the first issue of the prince's new magazine. It also excels in raising the profile of the man's own increasingly myriad activities. Winning mention in ""Perspectives"" are everything from the Prince's Institute of Architecture, to the work of his Business Leaders Forum in St. Petersburg, to an exhibition in Belfast of his own watercolors. **********Aimed at lay readers as opposed to architects, ""Perspectives"" first issue has a press run of 75,000 copies and will be sold on news stands across Europe."

(9:15 P.M. Thursday Eastern time) and was clasped around the shoulders by Gen. Gary E. Luck, the commander of the United States forces in South Korea. **********The 28-year-old Army pilot, whose helicopter strayed over North Korea on Dec. 17, was wearing a green flight uniform and carrying a Christmas shopping bag. He did not smile or wave or say a word to reporters. **********After being greeted by his brigade and battalion commanders and General Luck, he was ushered into an ambulance and taken to Yongsan, a United States military base in Seoul, for a medical examination. Mr. Hall could be reunited with his family in Brooksville, Fla., before the New Year. His next destination is MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla.   A few minutes before Mr. Hall arrived, Thomas Hubbard, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, also walked into South Korea, after two days in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, negotiating Mr. Hall's release. **********""I just had two rather difficult days in Pyongyang,"" Mr. Hubbard said, after speaking to President Clinton. ""I'm pleased to see that in the final analysis the North Korean Government took our humanitarian concerns into account and agreed to return Chief Warrant Officer Hall to us."" **********To secure the airman's release, the United States agreed to express its ""sincere regret"" and to discuss with North Korea how to prevent a recurrence, the State Department's chief spokesman said in Washington on Thursday evening. It does not appear that the United States made any unwanted concessions to the Communist Government. **********With Mr. Hall's release, some mysteries about the incident might be cleared up. North Korea said it shot down Mr. Hall's aircraft after it crossed into North Korean airspace, but it is possible the helicopter crashed or made an emergency landing. **********Mr. Hall's co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, 29, was killed in the downing. His body was returned last week. **********North Korea claimed that Mr. Hall had been spying but the United States has maintained all along that the intrusion was the result of a navigation error. **********The arrival of Mr. Hall was a ritualized process in this village in the demilitarized zone, where the tense truce that ended the Korean War in 1953 is administered. His crossing took place in a narrow dirt alley between two buildings where conferences between the two sides are held. North Korean soldiers lined the alley on the north side of the border line, standing at attention and filming Mr. Hall as he came through. **********The pilot's capture set off a furious series of diplomatic moves aimed at winning his freedom. Many analysts in South Korea said the North wanted to use this crisis to establish a precedent for dealing directly with the United States, cutting out the United Nations and South Korea, which supervise the armistice. **********The freeing of the pilot should pave the way for the implementation of the nuclear agreement signed by Washington and Pyongyang in October. In that accord, North Korea agreed to curb any nuclear weapons development in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of new power plants and oil and better relations with the United States. **********The Clinton Administration had warned that a failure to release the pilot would make it difficult for the United States to proceed with the agreement. And some members of Congress were even more vociferous in calling for the agreement to be scuttled. **********President Clinton, who spoke by telephone with Mr. Hall minutes after he was released, said in a televised address late tonight: **********""Chief Warrant Officer Hall was held for too long after his helicopter strayed off course on a routine training mission. But we are very glad that he has been released and is now in freedom. So, as we welcome the release of Chief Warrant Officer Hall, we must also remember the supreme sacrifice and the service made by his comrade in arms."""

Brazil is the leading supplier of coffee, accounting for about a quarter of world production. **********The impact was felt on commodity exchanges around the world, where coffee-futures prices continued to rise today after soaring more than 25 percent on Monday. Coffee for July delivery jumped 10.55 cents, to $1.703 a pound in New York, the highest in seven and a half years. **********With some producers defaulting today on delivery contracts, hoping to ride the wave of rising prices, Brazil and Colombia, the largest growers, temporarily suspended exports for July and waited for notoriously volatile commodity prices to stabilize. **********Many Brazilian growers walked through their fields today, trying to assess the losses. ""The cold wind hit 100 percent of our area,"" said Carlos Melles, a grower in Minas Gerais state. ""We believe that 50 percent of the bushes have been damaged and that there will be a 30 percent drop in next year's harvest."" **********But specialists said the sharply rising prices were being spurred by more than the prospect of losing 7 percent of the world's 1995 crop. Prices started to tumble in 1989, and by the early 1990's reached the lowest real levels of the century. The crash, provoked by overproduction, has resulted in losses by producer nations since 1989 estimated at $10 billion. **********While world prices dropped in half, consumer prices declined one-third, allowing coffee roasters to increase profits. The roasters argue that coffee beans account for only one-quarter of coffee prices, with processing, packaging, transportation and marketing making up the rest. **********""The roasters enjoyed incredible profit margins,"" said Judith Ganes, a coffee analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. **********As coffee became barely profitable, Brazilians tore out bushes or cut back on pruning and fertilizing. In five years, Brazil reduced the number of bushes by almost 25 percent, to about 3.2 billion today. **********Coffee's dominance of exports has decreased much more. From 74 percent of Brazilian export revenue in 1952, coffee accounted for only 3 percent last year. In one traditionally coffee-producing state, Espirito Santo, coffee has dropped from 33 percent to 8 percent of economic activity. **********The neglect was felt when the frigid weather hit. ""Without maintenance, many trees were weak and vulnerable to last weekend's frost,"" said Francisco Ourique, a partner in Flavor Coffee, a trading company here. **********Still, with most Brazilian beans ready for harvest, analysts expect only a 5 percent loss in this year's crop. But the southern part of the country is blighted by dead and damaged bushes, and the 1995 crop is expected to be 18 to 20 million sacks, down about one-third from forecasts. **********The frost's effect was quickly felt at supermarket counters in the United States. Roasters, raising prices as much as 20 percent, followed a lead set Monday night by Procter & Gamble, which increased the price of its Folgers coffee 17 percent. **********With international coffee supplies relatively low, consumer prices could continue to rise through the summer. ""I was expecting $2 a pound, without a freeze,"" Ms. Ganes of Merrill Lynch said. ""If the extent of Brazil's freeze is severe, the price could hit $2.70. **********The freeze last weekend struck as the Brazilian Government favors low coffee prices. This is because it is changing the cruzeiro to a dollar-backed currency called the real on Friday and embarking on a plan to radically reduce inflation, now 45 percent a month. Coffee makes up a key part of the basket of consumer prices the Government wants to stabilize. Even before last weekend's freeze forced up world coffee prices, officials announced a plan to auction 1.5 million sacks to local roasters in an effort to push down domestic prices by 15 percent. **********In addition, the Government would like to lower world prices to prevent recurrence of the boom-and-bust cycle that has plagued coffee growers for generations. ""Frosts always provoke production increases,"" said Ruy Barreto, president of one of Rio de Janeiro's largest trading companies. ""This one will only work as an incentive for new planting in Africa, Central America and Indonesia -- and Brazil will lose market share."" **********Lawrence Eagles of GNI Ltd. in London agreed, saying: ""If prices rise too high, they are going to cause a flood of investment in coffee production. There will be an impact on consumption, and the producers will be back in boom-and-bust cycle."" **********On paper, Brazil has a stock of 17 million sacks -- almost equal to a year's consumption in the United States, the biggest consumer. But Brazil has dragged its feet in recent years in conducting an internationally accepted audit. Many brokers fear that the country's supply is no more than 10 million sacks. Of those, only 2 million would be of export grade. **********In Colombia, where each rise of one cent in the price of coffee generates $15 million in foreign-exchange earnings, growers have also been caught with low production and cannot make up for Brazilian crop losses. **********The Colombian harvest this year is expected to be 11 million sacks -- the lowest in five years. By comparison, Colombia produced 18 million sacks in 1992. With Colombian growers currently receiving 64 cents a pound for their coffee, officials there announced today that the Government would raise producer prices in July. **********Colombia, Brazil and other producers from Central America are to meet next week to try to reach an agreement on a uniform price policy. **********In Africa, the world's second-largest growing region, production has gradually fallen in recent years. **********In the meantime, consumption has increased in the United States. After dropping nearly in half from 1962 to 1988, American consumption has risen 12 percent since 1988. Last year, Americans each drank an average of 1.87 cups of coffee a day."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the failure of its mission was the first step down a path that eventually brought the Administration to the brink of invading Haiti. **********It was not clear why the payments to Mr. Constant continued after his group had played the leading role in temporarily derailing the Clinton Administration's policy toward Haiti. **********Mr. Constant, who earlier this week called on Haitians to lay down their arms, was finally dropped as an informer in the spring of 1994, after questions arose about his reliability as a source. ""He was beginning to get involved in things that could blow back quite badly,"" said one senior official. **********The disclosure of Mr. Constant's ties to the C.I.A. was first reported by The Nation magazine and detailed further in today's Washington Post. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the published reports, if true, would raise serious questions about the Administration's control over its intelligence operations. **********""Getting good information from bad people is one thing,"" Mr. Torricelli said. ""Contracting with bad people committing reprehensible deeds that are contrary to our national policy is quite another."" **********Burt Wides, a legal adviser to Father Aristide, said: ""At a minimum, the C.I.A. should have had foreknowledge of what Fraph was up to. Did they know they were going to try to turn back the Harlan County? If not, what are they paying this guy for?"" **********A senior official said policymakers did not have advance warning of the size and violence of the Fraph demonstration against the Navy ship. **********The Clinton Administration has vehemently denied providing aid or support to Fraph, which has been implicated in human rights abuses since the September 1991 coup against Father Aristide. Several Government officials said the payments to Mr. Constant were small and were part of a continuing effort to gather information from all ends of the Haitian political spectrum. **********The New York Times reported last year that leading figures in the Haitian military and police were on the C.I.A. payroll, and Government officials acknowledged then that the Haitian intelligence service, which had been trained by the agency, had turned to drug running and political violence. **********The C.I.A. routinely relies on informers inside the leadership of unsavory groups, and, over the years, it has had on its payroll drug dealers, corrupt politicians and military officers who abuse their countrymen. **********Veteran intelligence officers defend this practice as the only reliable means of gathering information, and draw a distinction between paying for information from individuals and financing particular groups or parties. Direct financial support to a group like Fraph requires a Presidential order, or finding, and American officials said no such instruction has ever been issued. **********While refusing to confirm that Mr. Constant was on the C.I.A. payroll, Walter Slocombe, Undersecretary of Defense for policy, reminded Congress today that the United States frequently buys information from shadowy figures. ""We don't do it because they are nice people, but because they are good intelligence sources,"" Mr. Slocombe told the House Armed Services Committee. **********In the Nation article, Mr. Constant was quoted as saying he was encouraged to form Fraph by Col. Patrick Collins, an American military officer who served as defense attache at the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince. Mr. Constant also charged that Colonel Collins and the C.I.A. station chief were inside the headquarters of the Haitian military when the anti-Aristide coup unfolded in 1991. **********An Administration official said that Colonel Collins has denied both charges. Colonel Collins could not be reached for comment. **********New questions about Mr. Constant's ties to American intelligence arose this week when, at a news conference in Port-au-Prince guarded by American soldiers, he called on Haitians to ""put down their tires, their stones, their guns."" **********An official in Washington said, however, that his more conciliatory line emerged after he met with Lieut. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, the American commander in Haiti, and was told, ""Here's your chance. Either you do it or we'll hunt you down like a dog."" **********Over the past year, details of American intelligence and law enforcement efforts have been seized on by all sides in the debate over Haiti policy. An unflattering C.I.A. psychological profile of Father Aristide, later discredited, became public shortly after it was provided to a group of Senators. **********And in recent weeks, several Republican Senators have made a public issue of allegations by a Drug Enforcement Agency informer that Father Aristide had accepted payoffs from Colombian drug dealers. **********The D.E.A. briefly considered questioning Father Aristide, but rejected the idea after an internal review committee unanimously decided that the informer, the sole source of the assertion, was probably wrong. The informer failed a polygraph exam, and the details of his information did not check out when investigators tried to verify them. **********Nevertheless, the presence of Justice Department officials at the D.E.A. meeting has fueled speculation that the some Clinton Administration officials may have tried to steer investigators away from a Haitian leader that President Clinton is counting on to restore democracy to the deeply troubled Caribbean state. **********An Administration official said law enforcement officials are still investigating past and present members of the Haitian military on drug smuggling charges and would not rule out the possibility of future indictments."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/business/outsider-smooths-chrysler-s-ride.html,James Bennet,1994-05-16,,1733,,The New York Times,Business Day,Biography,article,Outsider Smooths Chrysler's Ride,Outsider Smooths Chrysler's Ride," **********Things were supposed to get a little ugly when Robert J. Eaton came here two years ago to run the Chrysler Corporation. **********Mr. Eaton, an engineer and executive from General Motors, had never set foot inside Chrysler's headquarters here, or inside a Chrysler plant anywhere. He barely knew Chrysler's leading executives, including the man who had wanted his job, Robert A. Lutz. Mr. Lutz, the president, was the favorite candidate for chairman among many of Chrysler's executives, dealers and institutional investors. **********After Mr. Eaton's appointment was announced, the rumor mill began spinning: Mr. Lutz -- a former fighter pilot with a passion for fast cars, a reputation for outspokenness and a history of bolting from auto companies in anger -- was quitting and headed to Porsche, to Volkswagen, to Toyota. A Rash of Departures **********The management of Chrysler already seemed shaky. Nine executives had retired or left the company in the previous 30 months, in part because Lee A. Iacocca seemed intent on staying forever as chairman and chief executive. Chrysler's directors finally put pressure on Mr. Iacocca to leave, and he nominated Mr. Eaton to succeed him, a move some insiders interpreted as an attempt by Mr. Iacocca to sow discord and prolong his own reign. **********As it turned out, only Mr. Iacocca left. **********Arriving without his own secretary, let alone a cadre of deputies, Mr. Eaton, who is 54, has studiously promoted from within Chrysler's ranks, shared the limelight with Mr. Lutz and others, and avoided trying to fix what he discovered was not broken after all. Since Mr. Eaton showed up in Highland Park, Chrysler's sales, earnings and stock price have risen steadily. **********""I don't take credit for any of it,"" Mr. Eaton said in a recent interview. ""I don't make hardly any decisions."" The Rise of Outsiders **********Bringing in an outsider as chairman and chief executive to reshape an ossified corporate culture has become a popular practice. Louis V. Gerstner Jr. at I.B.M., Charles M. Harper at RJR Nabisco, Michael H. Jordan at Westinghouse and George M. C. Fisher at Eastman Kodak all stepped in from the outside during troubled times. **********At Chrysler, the last four chairmen have been outsiders. Still, Mr. Eaton has more in common with the new generation of corporate leaders than with some of his predecessors, said Noel M. Tichy, a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan's business school who has studied outsider chief executives and been a consultant to Chrysler. **********""The Lee style was autocratic and very centralized,"" Professor Tichy said, referring to Mr. Iacocca. ""Bob Eaton is much more participative. He's a strong leader -- he doesn't abdicate, but he involves people. He brought teamwork and a level of openness that the organization was ready for."" **********Mr. Eaton is also representative of the new, less colorful but also less domineering breed of executive at the Big Three auto makers. Like his counterparts at the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation, Mr. Eaton cut his teeth as a top manager abroad, running G.M.'s more nimble and virtually autonomous European operations from 1988 to 1992. A Strong Team **********On arriving at Chrysler, Mr. Eaton said, he discovered the fundamentals of a turnaround were already in place. ""I expected my No. 1 and No. 2 challenges to be rebuilding a strong management team and getting unbelievably busy with new product,"" Mr. Eaton said. He had read press reports about managers leaving the company, and all he knew about Chrysler's product line was that it included a good mini-van and ""a lot of K-cars done 14 different ways."" **********Instead, he found a strong team, led by Mr. Lutz, waiting for him. Since he arrived, sales of some new products that were already in the pipeline, like the Dodge Intrepid sedan, the Ram pickup truck and the Neon subcompact car, have boomed. Their strength has more than made up for some of Chrysler's laggards, like its New Yorker luxury sedan. **********The progress on the product side freed Mr. Eaton to focus on what Mr. Tichy called ""the soft stuff,"" for instance, creating a shared vision for the company: to be the ""premier North American car and truck company"" by 1996, and the premier one worldwide by 2000. Mr. Eaton is also campaigning vigorously inside the company to ward off the complacency that seems inevitably to overcome domestic auto makers during booms. **********More prosaically, Mr. Eaton has bolstered Chrysler's balance sheet. He completed the second-largest stock offering in United States history last year and has steadily built up a cash reserve, toward a goal of $7.5 billion, as a cushion against the next downturn in sales. **********On the product side, Mr. Eaton is credited within the company with pushing to improve quality, which still trails the industry average in independent surveys. ""I'm very, very pleased with the progress that we're making,"" he said. ""However, I'm absolutely not proud of where we're at."" **********In an interview, Mr. Eaton, whose management philosophy appears to be that individuals are not important, repeatedly played down his own role. ""I'm a very strong believer that individuals can't and don't accomplish very much,"" he said. ""Sure, there have to be symbols for success, and there are people that facilitate success, etc., etc. But as an individual, there's very little anybody can accomplish -- don't ever kid yourself."" **********On the surface, that belief seems to be out of keeping with the way things appear to work at Chrysler, where Mr. Eaton's deputies stress intangibles like ""chemistry"" and individual qualities -- beginning with Mr. Eaton's and running down into the platform teams that develop products. **********But auto industry analysts say that by playing down the importance of the chairman, Chrysler has paved the way for more stable management down the road. ""Eaton could get run over by a beer truck and be replaced,"" Professor Tichy said. ""In the crisis, when Iacocca was at his best, if Iacocca got run over by a beer truck, that was it. They were down the tubes."" **********Still, individual qualities are clearly an important part of Chrysler's success so far. Mr. Lutz, who is 62, said that if the board had not selected a man like Mr. Eaton, he would have left. **********""If it had been someone I felt to be distinctly inferior to me in intelligence, ability to lead, automotive experience, etc., I could very well have said, 'This is an affront that I just can't tolerate,' "" Mr. Lutz said. But, he said, ""The very first time we talked about the situation, I knew it was O.K."" **********He added: ""People always mention this chemistry thing, but it's real."" **********Mr. Lutz, who has added the title of chief operating officer, rocketed up the ladder and then quit G.M., BMW, and Ford before joining Chrysler in 1986. He now handles the day-to-day auto operations at Chrysler and is praised inside and outside the company for captaining the development of its popular new cars and trucks, a reputation that appears not to ruffle Mr. Eaton in the slightest. Ambitions Contained **********""Eaton is sufficiently self-effacing to make space for Lutz to puff up in,"" said an executive with another auto maker who knows both men and spoke on condition of anonymity. But, he added, Mr. Lutz is much more comfortable as a member of a team than he has been given credit for. ""Bob is more colorful than he is disruptive,"" the executive said. ""He's contained his ambitions."" **********It is also true that Chrysler has won mostly praise recently, and triumph can be easier to share than failure. Further, for all the talk about limited individual contributions, the financial rewards for Chrysler's top executives have not been shabby. **********For 1993, Mr. Eaton's bonus more than tripled from the previous year, to $1.9 million; he received a total of $6.79 million in salary, bonus, stock and stock options. Mr. Lutz received compensation of $4.86 million. **********The compensation package astonished and infuriated the leaders of the United Automobile Workers union, whose relations with Chrysler appear to be stable -- worse than those with Ford, but far better than those with G.M., where strikes were threatened at several plants this spring. Stan Marshall, the vice president of the U.A.W. who handles relations at Chrysler, assailed the compensation as ""too much for too little.""  A Mild Approach **********Mr. Eaton had more than eight months at Chrysler to learn the job before Mr. Iacocca left, and his subordinates say he used the time to master Chrysler's system of relying on platform teams composed of hundreds of people drawn from different disciplines -- engineering, design, finance -- to develop each vehicle. **********Chrysler executives said that rather than insisting on sweeping changes, Mr. Eaton mildly made suggestions to improve operations and listened when managers disagreed. One early question was to Dennis K. Pawley, Chrysler's manufacturing chief: Was Mr. Pawley familiar with Toyota's system for breaking down every task in a plant to determine how much value each step added? ""I was only vaguely familiar with what that was, and he told me that was probably something I should take a look at,"" Mr. Pawley said. **********Studies based on Toyota's system revealed that while up to 75 percent of the activity in a Toyota plant added value, the average in an American plant was only 25 percent. The Toyota system has been applied in all Chrysler plants. **********In cases where he has disagreed with Mr. Eaton, Mr. Pawley said he had never had a problem voicing dissent. ""If it's something I don't think is worthwhile, we'll sit down and talk about it,"" he said. ""He has never ever said: 'I want you to go do this. I know it works.' "" **********But, Mr. Pawley contended, Mr. Eaton would not have been able to change Chrysler fundamentally. **********""It's not that we won't take input,"" Mr. Pawley said. ""But to have any one person come into this company and say, 'Tomorrow I want that, that, that, that, that and that changed,' dictatorially, it wouldn't happen. The strength of the officers and general managers would come up in full revolt against that individual, even if it was the chairman."""

But in his first policy address today, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama sought to reassure a wary public by abandoning the Socialists' opposition to the country's military and vowing to open the economy to a freer flow of goods. **********Mr. Murayama, 70, who came into office with about the lowest public approval rating of any postwar Prime Minister, focused on persuading the public that his Government was interested in more than seizing power and that the Socialists' far-left policies were a thing of the past. **********His odd coalition, he insisted during the address in Parliament, is committed to lowering the trade surplus, improving strained relations with the United States, cutting taxes, reducing astronomical consumer prices, giving the public freer access to information and cleaning up a political system that often looks, he said, like ""some kind of underhanded scam."" **********""I intend to travel the road to reform no matter how difficult the path ahead may be,"" he said, trying to counter an impression that his Government, dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, may just defend the status quo. **********The normally frumpy Mr. Murayama, once known for his loose-fitting pale blue suits and pale blue ties, delivered his spirited address in a smart dark blue suit accented by a wine-colored tie. He sought to deliver a reassuring message, promising continuity in Japan's foreign policies. But he did underscore a subtle but important shift. **********Mr. Murayama abandoned the Socialist Party's traditionally anti-American stance and characterized the United States-Japan security treaty as the centerpiece of Japan's foreign policy. **********He also apparently dropped his party's longstanding claim that the mere existence of Japan's military forces violates the Constitution, which prohibits the use of force for resolving international disputes. **********He said he supported a military with ""the necessary minimum defense capability."" **********Mr. Murayama also indicated that he had little interest in pursuing a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, at least in the short run, saying further discussions were necessary before Japan could make such a leap. **********""We should strive not to be a powerful country, but to be a caring country,"" he remarked. **********That policy is reminiscent of the cold war, when Japan kept a low profile in foreign affairs while focusing on building its economy. It also defies growing demands that Japan contribute more. The United States Senate recently adopted a resolution calling on Japan to make troops available for United Nations peacekeeping operations. **********On one other issue, Mr. Murayama described a slight shift from the previous Government, which had urged big income tax cuts to stimulate consumption and lift the economy from a long recession. The previous Government also favored a large increase in a national sales tax to make up for the lost revenues. **********Some economists, and the United States, oppose the sales tax increase, saying it would counter whatever benefits the income tax cuts would bring. Mr. Murayama hinted that the Government would enact the income tax cuts and get the economy out of its rut before pushing any increases in the sales tax. **********Opposition politicians sought to paint the Murayama speech as a cynical effort to woo public support. **********""Apparently he was attempting to change his policies almost overnight,"" said Motoo Shiina, a former Liberal Democrat and now an independent. ""A man or a group that changes overnight like that can change again, anytime. People have to decide if that is the group they want representing Japan."""

Both men were social scientists, writers and political organizers known for their focus on the need to rebuild China's political system, a divergence from the approach of the older generation of dissident intellectuals, most of whom focused on reforming the party from within. **********Mr. Wang, also released on medical parole, left for New York.

Then after a slight pause he added, ""Until it became irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."" **********That one exchange has landed the 45-year-old Prince in hot water. Estranged and separated from his wife since December 1991, he has been laboring for the last year to rebuild his popularity with state visits abroad and good works at home. **********The film, in which Mr. Dimbleby was given unparalleled access to the future sovereign and followed him around for a year and a half, was to mark the 25th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales. **********But it was really meant to be the capstone of his rehabilitation. **********Now, some of that effort seems to have come to naught. Many of the details of the deteriorating marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales have long since been in the public domain, especially since June 1992 when Andrew Morton's book ""Diana: Her True Story"" appeared. **********At one point in the film, the Prince said that he was not, at the moment, considering a divorce from the Princess; but, he added, he did not view divorce as a barrier to becoming King. He insisted there was ""no truth"" in much of the speculation about his private life and refered to Camilla Parker Bowles, with whom he has been romantically linked, as ""a great friend"" whose support he valued. **********The nationwide broadcast tonight reopened all the old wounds at a time when the monarchy has tried to overcome the scandals and a negative public image. Last year the Queen began paying some taxes on her income and opened Buckingham Palace to visitors to raise money for rebuilding Windsor Castle. Last week the palace announced that it was giving up the Britannia, the royal yacht. **********The Prince's admission of infidelity was leaked two days ago and ever since it has dominated the newspapers, with front-page headlines in the tabloids like: ""Charles: I Cheated on Diana"" and ""Di told you so."" **********""In one stroke he's wiped out all the good will he's built up over 12 months,"" said Brian Hoey, a royal biographer attending a preview of the film for The Sun. **********A reporter for The Evening Standard, one of 150 who crowded into the Institute of Civil Engineers for the screening, leaned over and confided: ""Too bad it's a quiet time for the tabloids. Everyone's seizing on this."" **********The Sun set up a special ""You the Jury"" telephone poll and reported today that two-thirds of the callers felt the Prince's behavior made him unfit to be King. Purchased by NBC **********The objection seemed to be not so much to the Prince's adultery as to his trusting naivete in acknowledging it. A front-page commentary in The Daily Mirror put the case bluntly: ""He is not the first royal to be unfaithful. Far from it. But he is the first to appear before 25 million of his subjects to confess."" **********But all of this hoopla was before ""Charles: the Private Man, the Public Role,"" made by Central Broadcasting of Birmingham, was actually broadcast on Independent Television. Rights to broadcast it in the United States have been purchased by NBC. Excerpts are to be shown on the NBC News program ""Dateline NBC"" on Thursday at 10 P.M. **********The man on the street may find the Prince attractive. He has a nice smile and is fetching even when he appears uncomfortable in his role, as he banters with sidewalk gawkers with his left hand perched in his double-breasted jacket or winces while contemplating all the ceremonies on the royal calendar. **********The film is largely flattering to the Prince. It does not once show him relaxing, playing polo or lounging in the lap of luxury -- all activities that undercut his popularity in years past. Instead, he is depicted as earnest, hard-working and thoughtful, a sort of royal wonk. **********He is seen roaming the hills of Scotland to find stags, playing with his sons, William and Harry, shaking hands and working the crowds in Birmingham, and heading meetings of his charity, the Prince's Trust, which is aimed at impoving the lives of young people in the slums. **********Abroad, he strikes a chord with crowds in Mexico, wines and dines oil sheiks in the Persian Gulf and stands up bravely when a gunman rushes at him with a starter pistol in Australia, where, the narrator says, he deftly defused the ""ferocity"" of the movement to abandon the British crown and become a republic. Represent All Worshipers **********At another point, the Prince said that as King he would rather be ""Defender of Faith,"" and not ""Defender of the Faith."" This was a reference to the coronation oath and the sovereign's position as titular head of the Anglican Church. The remark pointed gently toward the notion that the King should represent all worshipers, not just Protestants, and was seen as a possible first step toward disestablishmentarianism. **********In the continuing public relations battle, the Prince may have scored a last-minute victory. He stole away the thunder of at least one tabloid tonight when he piloted a plane and landed it with its nose off the runway. ""Charles Crashes the Royal Plane,"" read the headline."

The executive, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said Ms. Salhany had expected the move for some time. **********Under the management restructuring, Fox is promoting Chase Carey, who had been the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Fox Inc., to a new role of chairman of the newly formed Fox Television division. **********Also, Peter Chernin, the chairman of 20th Century Fox, the film division, has been assigned additional duties overseeing television production. **********As recently as last week, however, Mr. Murdoch was seeking an outside executive to take over for Ms. Salhany. Senior network executives confirmed yesterday that Mr. Murdoch had offered the top executive job at Fox Broadcasting to Peter Lund, the president of the CBS television network. But Mr. Lund is under a contract and will stay at CBS. **********Earlier this year, industry executives said Mr. Murdoch had offered the job of running Fox to Roone Arledge, the president of ABC News. **********Ms. Salhany becomes the latest Fox executive to resign from the company since Mr. Murdoch became more of a hands-on presence two years ago. The first to leave was Barry Diller, who unexpectedly resigned as head of Fox Inc. in 1992 and is now chairman of QVC Inc. He was followed within months by Joe Roth, who headed the film studio, and Jamie Kellner, who headed the network. **********In Fox's official announcement of the management shake-up yesterday, Mr. Murdoch said he was ""extremely grateful"" to Ms. Salhany for her leadership. The changes were explained as a realignment of the various Fox divisions. **********Under the new structure, Mr. Carey will assume most of Ms. Salhany's responsibilities for running the Fox network, with Mr. Chernin assuming control of the television production unit because its operations most closely resemble the production being done by the film studio. **********""This is a result of evaluating how you can make the company run more efficiently,"" Mr. Carey said. He added that the other heads of Fox divisions -- including Sandy Grushow, who is president of the entertainment division -- would remain in place. **********Mr. Chernin, who previously ran the entertainment division of Fox Broadcasting, said the move would again give him some creative control in television, an area ""I have always been interested in."" **********He added, ""Rupert has been thinking about how to structure the company for future growth for a while now."" **********Ms. Salhany's tenure was marked by some extreme highs and lows for the network. She took most of the responsibility for the decision to install Chevy Chase as Fox's hope in late-night television; his program proved to be one of the signature flops of recent television history. **********Fox also saw its overall ratings performance decline last season, though one program, ""Melrose Place,"" emerged as one of the hottest shows on television. Murdoch's Big Deals **********But Fox did win one of the biggest prizes in television last December when it outbid CBS for rights to the most-watched package of Sunday afternoon National Football League games. And in May, Fox lured a cache of valuable affiliated stations away from the other three networks, mostly from CBS. **********Mr. Murdoch, however, handled the important decision-making -- and signed the big checks -- on both those deals. **********Mr. Salhany announced no future plans, but several industry executives speculated that she might already be in talks about a job at CBS. **********Ms. Salhany has a close relationship with Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, and she was originally brought to Fox by Mr. Diller, who last week announced a plan to merge his QVC cable channel with CBS. Under the plan, Mr. Diller will become the chief executive of the new company. **********The shake-up at Fox appeared to have virtually no impact on the News Corporation's stock. The company's American depository receipts ended trading yesterday at $47.875, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange."

It seems that they used my trip as a P.R. exercise. I think they're playing for time."" **********Mr. Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, said in a telephone interview from Washington that he planned to return to Myanmar in August and that he still held out ""the faint hope"" that he might be able to convince the junta to open negotiations with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi. He said he had received no assurances he would be permitted to meet with her, although the Government ""hasn't said no to my request."" **********He said that he had planned to return to Myanmar this month but that the Government had asked him to delay the trip until after July 20, the fifth anniversary of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest. **********In February Mr. Richardson led a group of four Americans who were the first foreign visitors to see Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi who were not relatives. **********The Oxford-educated daughter of Aung San, the army general who is considered the father of the nation, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was detained in 1989 as part of a violent military crackdown on the democracy movement she led. Her political party, the National League for Democracy, went on to a landslide victory in a 1990 election -- a victory that Myanmar's military commanders refused to recognize. **********Diplomats in Yangon, the capital, formerly known as Rangoon, said in recent interviews that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who turned 49 last month, was in good health as she remained confined to a lakeside compound here that belonged to her late mother. Her husband, an Oxford University scholar, and their two sons are allowed to visit her. **********Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has refused to accept help from the Government and lives off the royalties from her book ""Freedom From Fear."" The royalties are transferred to a bank account in Yangon and used to buy food and other necessities. **********The junta has said that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi could go free if she agreed to leave the country immediately. In her meeting with Mr. Richardson, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said she would never accept the military's conditions for her departure. **********Despite the junta's assurances to Mr. Richardson last winter that it would consider talks with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, diplomats say military commanders in Myanmar have only recently begun to debate the issue seriously. And they say the military has not yet sent any sort of senior envoy to speak with her."

Earley Jr., who helped guide the Long Island Lighting Company through a rocky period after it shut down its Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, has resigned as president to take the same position with the Detroit Edison Company. **********Some Wall Street analysts said his departure left open the question of who would eventually succeed the chairman of the utility, William J. Catacosinos, who is 63. The analysts said Mr. Earley, 44, had been considered next in line to run Lilco. **********""This causes some concern because there is so much change occurring in a management that seemed to be a good solid team,"" Barry Abramson, a utility analyst for Prudential Securities, said. ""Earley seemed to be a sharp and capable individual. Now we have the uncertainty of who the new chairman might be."" **********Mr. Catacosinos does not have to retire when he turns 65 and he has not indicated whether he will step down. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Earley said the question of the chairman's retirement was not a factor in his move to Detroit Edison, where he will be president and chief operating officer, the same jobs he held at Lilco. **********Mr. Earley said he was leaving because Detroit Edison, with about 10,000 employees, was much larger than Lilco, which has 6,200. He said he felt more comfortable leaving now because a big Lilco project, a rate-freeze plan, had just been completed. **********Detroit Edison also has a nuclear plant, Fermi 2, which was shut down after an accident recently damaged the turbine generator. 'A Challenging Area' **********""Operating nuclear plants, that's part of my background,"" he said. ""It's a challenging area. I want to use some of that training."" **********He became an expert on nuclear-propulsion systems while serving as a Navy submarine officer. **********Mr. Catacosinos said that ""while we recognize for Tony that this represents a great opportunity to lead a larger company with all the advantages a large company can offer, for us it represents the loss of a talented member of our organization."" **********Mr. Earley led Lilco during a difficult period after a settlement was reached to close the nuclear plant. Lilco had agreed with New York State to give up attempts to operate it after opponents blocked a regional evacuation plan in case of an emergency. Long Island residents have had some of the highest electric rates in the country as Lilco worked to repay the $5.6 billion debt to build the plant. **********Mr. Earley became president in April 1989 at 39."

He called the continuing slaughter there ""genocide"" and said it was a ""scandal"" that the world has not acted speedily to end the blood-letting. **********At a news conference in New York, the Secretary General described the United Nations efforts in Rwanda in harsh terms, saying: ""It is a failure not only for the United Nations; it is a failure for the international community. And all of us are responsible for this failure. Not only the great powers but the African powers, the nongovernmental organizations, all the international community. **********""It is a genocide which has been committed. More than 200,000 people have been killed and the international community is still discussing what ought to be done."" **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he had done all he could to persuade African governments to supply the 5,500 troops he wants to send to Rwanda to protect refugees and help aid workers. **********""I have tried,"" he said, by writing to more than 30 heads of state after the United States and other Western countries made it clear they would not get involved. ""I begged them to send troops. I was in contact with different organizations and tried my best to be able to help them find a solution to the problem. **********""Unfortunately, let us say with great humility, I failed. It is a scandal. I am the first one to say it."" **********The Secretary General placed the blame on ""donor fatigue"" among countries that frequently assign troops to the United Nations but now find themselves being asked to support 17 such operations with personnel and money. **********In Annapolis, Md., today, President Clinton listed Rwanda among the world's many bloody conflicts where the interests at stake did not justify the use of American military power. **********""We cannot solve every such outburst of civil strife or militant nationalism simply by sending in our forces,"" Mr. Clinton said in a commencement address at the United States Naval Academy. **********At an emergency meeting today in Geneva, the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted unanimously to send an investigator to Rwanda, who is to report back within four weeks. It also called for ""human rights field officers"" to be stationed in Rwanda to deter abuses. **********In Kigali, the capital, the army and the forces of the Rwanda Patriotic Front battled today for control, trading artillery and mortar fire that killed two people at a Red Cross hospital and ended Tuesday's brief truce. A United Nations envoy, Iqbal Riza, drove through the fighting in an armored car to confer with Government ministers, who have fled to Gitarama, 35 miles from Kigali. **********The renewed fighting has stopped deliveries of food and water to all but 3,000 of the 12,500 refugees under United Nations protection at 11 sites in Kigali. Nearly half the refugees are children. **********Roger Carter, of the United Nations Children Fund, said in Nairobi, Kenya: ""As the siege of Kigali goes on, the situation is going to get worse. In the next few days you are going to see malnutrition in Kigali."" 3 Nations Pledge Troops **********So far the United Nations has received firm pledges from Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal for about 2,000 of the 5,500 troops it wants for Rwanda. The United Nations is asking Western nations for equipment for the African troops and has asked Australia for soldiers specialized in logistics. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali indicated today that he still hopes Egypt, Nigeria and Zimbabwe will provide soldiers. Although Italy has said it is ready to send troops to Rwanda, no firm offer has been received, he said. **********His display of near despair over Rwanda was not the first time Mr. Boutros-Ghali had appealed emotionally for troops to rescue a country degenerating into chaos. Two years ago, he helped push the Bush Administration into sending troops to Somalia after contrasting the world's indifference toward the catastrophe there with its extensive effort to halt the fighting in Yugoslavia, which he described then as ""a rich man's war."" **********African diplomats say most countries are shying away from offering soldiers because of the obvious dangers. But they are other inhibitions.  Problems of Their Own **********Nigeria and several West African countries have already sent peacekeeping forces to Liberia. And East and Central African countries generally have small, poorly equipped armies or are consumed by civil war themselves. Newly democratic South Africa has a large, modern army but apparently has not been approached. **********Furthermore, few African countries can afford the cost, especially when the United Nations' own financial difficulties are delaying reimbursements to nations contributing troops. **********The Secretary General emphasized that the troops he wants to send to Rwanda cannot impose a solution, but he said a large United Nations force could ""contain"" the deteriorating situation and ""reinforce"" the position of his mediator there. **********""They may help protect both Tutsi and Hutu,"" he explained. ""But the mandate is limited so it is not our intention to impose on the protagonists of the dispute a certain formula."" **********When last year's peace agreement collapsed on April 7 and fierce fighting broke out between Hutu and Tutsi, the United Nations cut its 2,500-member force in Rwanda back to a few hundred at the urging of the Clinton Administration. **********As the killing got worse, the Secretary General backed African calls for a new, larger force to be sent in. But the Administration, which had just set tight guidelines for supporting new peacekeeping operations, successfully opposed doing more than restoring earlier cuts until certain conditions are met. **********These conditions include progress toward a cease-fire, a firm schedule for ending the operation and agreement that the emphasis should be on protecting refugees along the borders rather than sending troops into Kigali, as the Secretary General favors."

Some analysts interpreted that as a sign that merger talks were heating up. **********A Lotus spokesman, Richard Eckel, said that rather than canceling an appearance, it had never planned to attend. Asked about the rumors of a merger or acquisition, Mr. Eckel said the company did not comment on speculation. **********Officials at Oracle, of Redwood Springs, Calif., did not return calls seeking comment. Oracle shares yesterday fell $1.375, to $41.25. **********Speculation began when Oracle and Lotus signed a strategic agreement in September to join Lotus's Notes software and Oracle's Media Server data base product in a technology alliance. **********Recent deals in the software industry, like the Microsoft Corporation's planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Intuit and Sybase Inc.'s proposed $940 million purchase of Powersoft, have cast a consolidation glow on the entire marketplace. Analysts regard Lotus, with subpar earnings for two years, as among the most eligible of takeover candidates. **********Paul Johnson, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens, said people at both companies had told him that Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, and Jim Manzi, Lotus's chairman, had met to discuss a merger. Such a deal, Mr. Johnson said, would be ""a brilliant move on Ellison's part, creating an extremely powerful combination of products."" **********But Mr. Johnson said the share price had become the sticking point in the deal. Oracle was apparently comfortable offering $50 to $55 a share for Lotus, he said, but Mr. Manzi believes that Lotus should command more than $80 a share. **********""Manzi believes the stock was not overpriced when it hit $86 a share earlier this year,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""I'm told that the people at Oracle have trouble swallowing that price."" **********Not everyone believes a deal will be consummated. David C. Peterschmidt, chief operating officer at Sybase, an Oracle rival, said he would be surprised to see Oracle make such a move, saying it would be ""a significant distraction for management."" **********Mr. Peterschmidt noted that a buyer would have to pay cash for Lotus. A pooling of stock would require Oracle to wait two years to divest any unwanted pieces of Lotus. ""If you are going to swallow Lotus, you have to swallow whole and have a strategy laid out for what you will do with all the spare parts,"" he said."

Prices Keep Coffee King in Colombia"," **********UNWILLING to see coffee lose its place as the country's prized crop, the National Federation of Coffee Growers in Colombia is finally witnessing what it has worked hard to accomplish in the last year. With jumps and starts, coffee prices are approaching profitable levels and analysts predict that prices will continue to rise. **********In January, Colombia set a minimum price of 92 cents a pound for its coffee. A day later, Central American producers followed suit by setting minimum prices at 80 cents a pound. This followed an analogous measure last July, when Colombia led Brazilian and Central American producers in vowing to force an end to depressed prices by holding back 20 percent of the coffee crop. **********It all began to unravel when Brazil, the world's largest coffee producing country, announced on April 15 that it would start selling off its stock to combat local inflation. On Thursday, other Latin American coffee producers said they would end the retention policy because, said Ruben Pineda, the president of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, ""we have reached a good level of prices in the world market."" **********The price for Colombian coffee, which has been rising rapidly the last two weeks, hit the $1-a-pound mark on Thursday, the day after the announcement was made, while Central American coffee also rose, to 93.92 cents a pound. **********""Colombian coffee sells at a premium because it is considered of higher quality,"" said James Steel, a senior commodities analyst for Resco Commodities in New York. He thought the prices would keep rising, but at a contained rate. **********Coffee prices took an upward slant from April to August and September 1993, when they leveled off. They began climbing again this January, about the time that the new policies took effect. Colombian producers say that price fixing and retention were finally forcing demand to respond to reduced supply. They say that since talks aimed at setting world coffee quotas broke down a year ago amid prices as low as 52 cents a pound, this has been the only alternative. **********Yet other analysts say that higher prices are simply a reflection of lower coffee production in response to what had been lower demand. ""This is a function of low output, not of the retention plan or the price hike,"" said Judy Gaines, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. ""Low production pushed up prices,"" Mr. Steele agreed. **********Shrinking inventories in coffee consuming countries, now estimated at about 3.5 million 132-pound bags, also led buyers to pay more. **********""Consuming countries have used high inventories as a bargaining chip to buy coffee cheaply,"" Colombia's Agriculture Minister, Jose Antonio Ocampo, said in a recent interview. ""The game is, will prices reach an unsustainably low level or will inventories decline before that? We will win. Inventories will go down first."" **********In the last coffee year, which began in October 1992 and ended in September 1993, production in Colombia fell to about 13.6 million bags, compared with 17 million bags the year before. This year, production is expected to slide to about 12 million bags. **********Coffee output is also decreasing in Brazil. From a level of about 22 million bags in the 1992-93 coffee year, production for the current year is expected to plunge to about 17 million bags. **********Low prices have taken a heavy toll on producers in Colombia who say that growing their high-quality coffee, historically a source of national pride, is no longer profitable. Since 1992, nearly 150,000 acres of coffee fields have been eradicated in favor of other more profitable legitimate crops like fruit. Much of the Colombian Government's initiative in pushing for price hikes and retention plans has been spurred by rising social discontent. **********Colombians think of coffee in much the same way as the Japanese have thought of rice. Growers and their patches are looked upon as symbols of the country and have been featured in Colombian coffee advertisements around the world. Consequently, the growers' plight has struck a chord in many Colombians. **********""There has to be a change in mentality,"" said Roberto Steiner, economic manager of the Foundation for Higher Education and Development, a research institute here. ""Economically speaking, Colombia should not be a coffee country, even if, from the cultural standpoint, it is one."" **********Mr. Steiner said that by continuing to subsidize growers and relying on price-setting, the National Federation of Coffee Growers, which is Colombia's coffee regulator and the world's largest individual exporter, acts as if a quota system were in place. ""Coffee will now be ruled by free market laws, and the Government has to get used to that,"" he said. **********The National Coffee Fund, which subsidized growers, has run into serious financial difficulties because of the plunge in world prices since 1989. Last year, the fund had a deficit of about $180 million. Similar funds in Brazil and Cameroon have failed as a result of bulging deficits. **********Yet policies have begun to adjust to new reality. Since the international coffee pact broke down in 1989, the National Federation of Coffee Growers has implemented some programs that subsidize alternative crop growing and include coffee crop eradication. **********Consequently, private Colombian exporters and other analysts see crop retention and minimum prices as temporary. ""These measures will not be the norm once demand fully reacts to supply,"" Ms. Gaines said."

Now that Russia is struggling to become a Western-style market economy, with the aid of its former adversaries, the question might seem of only academic interest. **********But there are still plenty of countries that can learn from the Soviet Union's downfall. Most obviously they include developing nations still firmly wedded to state intervention and former Communist countries that have not completely forsaken their old ways - including Russia itself. **********More surprisingly, according to the authors of a new analysis published by the World Bank, they also include France, Austria and East Asian high performers like Singapore, South Korea and Japan. **********The main thing these countries are all doing wrong is relying for growth on centrally planned capital accumulation - building more and more factories - rather than increasing the productivity of their workers. **********The study is by William Easterly of the World Bank and Stanley Fischer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, soon to become an IMF deputy managing director. It looks at how the Soviet economy turned from being ""the hope of the future"" in the 1950s to the basket case of today. **********Given the Soviet Union's size, its high levels of investment and education and low population growth, its economy should have grown strongly from the 1960s through the 1980s. Instead, it was the ""most underachieving economy"" in the world, developing countries included. **********Sadly for admirers of Ronald Reagan, the study concludes that the increased Soviet defense spending provoked by Mr. Reagan's policies was not the straw that broke the back of the Evil Empire. **********The Afghan war and the Soviet response to Mr. Reagan's Star Wars program caused only a relatively small rise in defense costs. And the defense effort throughout the period from 1960 to 1987 contributed only marginally to economic decline. **********Other causes may have included demoralization and a breakdown of discipline in the work force. The Soviet Union also had too many resources devoted to low-productivity agriculture and too few to services and trade. **********But the key factor was the inefficiency of capital investment. For all the resources the Soviets put into factories and machinery, they got relatively little out. In economic jargon, the Soviet Union had an unusually high ratio of capital to output. **********As countries industrialize, they use more machines to perform tasks previously done by manual labor, enabling workers to become more productive. In the West, machines have generally replaced labor fairly efficiently, thanks to rapid and flexible technological advances. A forklift truck would be one example, a robot an even more effective one. **********But machines were an extraordinarily poor substitute for labor in the Soviet Union. The Soviet economy seemed to be constrained by technology that required almost constant proportions: one machine, one worker. **********During the 1950s, when not all workers had machines, return on capital was high. Giving a machine to a worker without one has a high payoff, and the payoff stays high as long as there are workers without machines. **********Eventually, however, all the workers will have machines, and the return on additional machines falls to virtually nothing. What's needed is not just another machine but a machine plus a computerized inventory and distribution system. **********But rather than responding to market demands, Soviet investment came from above. Capital goods, like consumer goods, were limited to the narrow range of items that planners could direct and control - usually heavy machinery. **********So why didn't the planners see what was going on in the West and order robots and computers? The planners, says Mr. Easterly, had limited information. Factory bosses knew more but had no incentive to correct their methods. **********But surely that's not what's happening in countries like France and Austria and Japan and the Asian tigers? **********Not exactly, says Mr. Easterly. But they all share the Soviet weakness of administratively directed investment programs and rising capital-to-output ratios. **********The bad news for these countries is that diminishing returns from capital will eventually lead to a slowdown in growth. The good news is that, assuming their workers are more productive and their technology more varied than in the Soviet Union, they should be able to avoid the Soviet Union's drastic fate."

""There is ample liquidity in the financial system and the potential for significant interest rate hikes looks very limited."" **********In a recent assessment that took account of the correction, Merrill Lynch & Co. said the Malaysian market was ""not unduly expensive considering Malaysia's economic growth and the ongoing infrastructure and privatization programs."" **********Cuts in corporate tax rates will also stimulate profits. The government cut the rate by 2 percent, to 32 percent for 1993. There will be a further 2 percent reduction this year. **********Brokers said they expected the Malaysian composite index to have moved up to between 1,250 and 1,400 by midyear. **********However, some analysts cautioned that if, as widely anticipated, the government calls an general election between June and September - more than a year early - it could halt the advance of the market in the second half of the year. **********""If the government is reelected with a massive majority, as expected, it may want to apply some nasty economic medicine to slow demand and inflation,"" said one analyst. ""That could have a sobering effect on the market."""

Together with the charter business, they provide work for about 170 people. In addition, a state police academy might soon occupy schools and housing once used by American soldiers. **********But change has not come easily, or cheaply. The air base used to employ 900 German civilians and pump 250 million Deutsche marks ($152 million) a year into the area's economy. Many of its former employees have either gone into early retirement or had to look elsewhere for work. **********For all its promise, Hahn is still a lesson to state and community leaders across Germany that it could be years, maybe decades, before they see anything of a peace dividend for their 40 years of patience. **********""Hahn is lucky,"" said Walter Strutz, an official with the Economics Ministry of Rhineland-Palatinate, the West German state with the highest concentration of military installations. ""There won't be a peace dividend everywhere. Sometimes it will be a loss. What's most important is restoring a local source of livelihood."" **********Because it was the home of eight air bases, Rhineland-Palatinate used to be called the aircraft carrier of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Today, with five of those bases in various stages of closing, the state is at the forefront of Germany's experience in converting to a nonmilitary or less military economy. **********""The other states are learning from our mistakes,"" the most common of which has been expecting quick results, Mr. Strutz said. **********For many of the former military sites, which tend to be fairly far from major cities, the only immediate hope lies in attracting light manufacturing and other sorts of businesses as an industrial park. **********Zweibrücken, an air base whose desertion by the U.S. military two-and-a-half years ago initiated a wave of closures across Germany, has gone this route. Birkenfeld, a training ground, is destined to become a regional recycling center. **********But the military sites are being vacated much more quickly than they can be occupied by industry, leaving many empty or put to purely provisional uses such as storage or housing immigrants. **********Rhineland-Palatinate has set aside about 500 million DM for conversion assistance in the next two years. **********At Hahn, for example, the government is investing 28.5 million DM in an advanced instrument- landing system to try to attract year-round charter business and eventually freight service as well. **********The state's conversion committee dreams of turning Hahn into a round-the-clock European hub for express mail and freight, capable of winning business away from Frankfurt, which is considerably more expensive and increasingly overcrowded. **********It will be a ""long, arduous way to profitability,"" Mr. Strutz said. ""The real profit comes of not having to pay people unemployment."" **********The state's investments are already starting to pay off, however, sometimes in unexpected ways. Klaus Hartmann, an airport official, said a computer-driven noise surveillance system being installed to counter locals' fears of increased noise pollution would eventually be marketed to other airports; and a group of local businessmen has bought a couple of small planes and established a fledgling regional airline. **********The head of the Frankfurt airport, Continental Europe's busiest, has offered Hahn some needed moral support. **********""The airport is worth fighting for,"" he said recently. ""It won't be a flop, but success also won't come in a day."" **********In the meantime, local residents rejoice in the proximity of an airport that offers free parking, pet kennels and a quick, comfortable check-in in a former officer's club. **********""No one says anything if you come 20 minutes late,"" said Rudolf Heidenblut from nearby Emmelshausen, who was on his way to Crete. **********Brigitte Rabe, who was a community-relations liason person for the U.S. military for 27 years before their departure from Hahn last August and is now the airport spokeswoman, said the Boeing 737s that land here were routinely full. ""Flights to Mallorca are booked for the whole summer,"" she said. **********Hahn is lucky not only in its proximity to Frankfurt, but also in the relative quality of its infrastructure. Though the departing troops took with them the last pieces of cheap U.S. coal that they had imported to heat Hahn's buildings, they left behind well-maintained buildings, tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course and the airstrip. **********In Eastern Germany, where the last of 380,000 troops of the former Soviet Union stationed there during the Cold War are making their exit, buildings are routinely stripped of windows, doors and sinks. At Neuruppin, an air base near Berlin, the departing soldiers even tore up the concrete-slab runway and shipped it back home. **********In addition, sites used for military training and aircraft maintenance in both Western and Eastern Germany are frequently contaminated and have to be cleaned up, at considerable cost. **********Mrs. Rabe, who cried when the last U.S. plane took off from Hahn, was optimistic that the airport's revival will draw back Germans who left when it closed. ""We just had some people come into our office and ask about flights to Berlin,"" she said. ""That's a start."""

But medical experts said there was a high risk that the 300,000 people who are said to have fled Surat might have already spread the disease to other parts of India. **********The death toll from the plague outbreak, believed to be the first confirmed incidence of pneumonic plague anywhere in the world for decades, continued to be disputed. **********Officials in Surat put the number of dead at 36, but doctors and others in the city said the official count appeared to include only those who had died in the city's Civil Hospital, the main treatment center. **********According to the unofficial estimates, at least 100 people have died, perhaps as many as 300, with many either succumbing in the shantytowns where large numbers of the city's 1.6 million residents live or at private clinics. **********Reports from Surat, a western port city 160 miles north of Bombay, said many families had cremated or buried victims who had shown symptoms of the disease without reporting the deaths, a common practice among India's poor. **********According to the official count, about 300 patients suffering from the disease were in the isolation wards at the Surat hospital today, some in critical condition. But a Reuters report from Surat quoted doctors and city officials as saying the crisis appeared to be easing, with fewer patients arriving at the hospital in the terminal stages of the disease and many of the new arrivals showing signs of responding quickly to antibiotics. **********On Friday, doctors at the Surat hospital reported that one patient was dying every hour. Today, one of those quoted by Reuters, A. K. Mukherjee, a senior Health Ministry official, said, ""The numbers of deaths are decreasing."" **********A senior Surat city official, Balwant Singh, concurred, saying, ""The situation has not improved in terms of admissions, but it has improved in terms of deaths."" **********A worker at the hospital, Daksha Daswant, added: ""Today, the situation is much better. The deaths are much less."" **********But as officials gained confidence that the Surat epidemic was beginning to yield to the free distribution of tetracycline antibiotic tablets, pesticide spraying and other steps ordered by officials, including the closing of all schools, businesses and other public gathering places, concern mounted that the plague bacteria were being carried to other parts of India by the thousands of people fleeing Surat. **********Senior health officials in New Delhi said it was almost certain that the disease would show up elsewhere. **********Reports from across the country said many state governments, including those in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, bordering Gujarat, the state where Surat is, had appealed to New Delhi for steps to seal Surat and prevent migration by its residents. **********The appeals were said to have been refused, but several state governments, as well as the regional authorities in the capital district around New Delhi, were reported to be preparing to set up checkpoints at borders, airports and railway stations anyway. **********Many of those fleeing Surat have headed for Bombay, the country's largest industrial center, where many of the 12.5 million residents live in densely crowded slums with little or no sanitation. **********Officials denied one newspaper report that said two people had died of plague in the city on Friday, but they said a broad range of emergency measures were being taken. Many pharmacies in the city reported having sold out of antibiotics, which are widely available in India without doctors' prescriptions. **********The uncertainty over the number of casualties is part of the broader confusion that has developed since the first deaths in Surat were reported on Thursday. **********The Government has said laboratory tests confirmed that the disease afflicting Surat is pneumonic plague. But senior officials in Gujarat, as well as some Indian experts in communicable diseases, have suggested that the deaths may have been caused by an acute form of pneumonia. **********The Government in New Delhi held to its position today, saying that experts of its National Institute of Communicable Diseases who had reached Surat had confirmed the earlier diagnosis made by medical experts in the city. **********But the top state official in Gujarat, Chhabildas Mehta, the state's Chief Minister, was quoted by Indian newspapers as having said in Ahmadabad, the state capital, that the disease ""cannot be the plague,"" and was more likely to be pneumonia. **********Mr. Mehta said the diagnosis of pneumonic plague was improbable because there had been no reports of rats' dying suddenly from respiratory failure in the city. Medical experts have traditionally considered rat deaths to be an early warning sign of plague, both in in its less fatal form, bubonic plague, and in the more deadly pneumonic plague. **********""Not a single rat has so far died in Surat,"" Mr. Mehta said. **********Mr. Mehta received support from several communicable disease experts. One, Dr. N. P. Gupta, a former director of a virus research institute in Pune, south of Bombay, said the deaths in Surat could have resulted from ""a virulent form of influenza."" **********The Press Trust of India, the county's main news agency, quoted Dr. Gupta as saying that any early diagnosis from Surat had to be taken guardedly because expertise on all forms of plague in India had declined since the 1960's, the last time India reported confirmed cases. **********Apart from the apparent absence of sudden rat deaths in Surat, Dr. Gupta said all of the cases reported so far in Surat had been of the pneumonic variety of the disease, and none of the bubonic variety, raising doubts that the outbreak was plague. **********In the era before antibiotics and pesticides, when millions died of plague outbreaks in India, the bubonic plague was far more common than pneumonic plague, which generally develops among populations already suffering from bubonic plague. **********Indian officials said the results of further laboratory tests, to be available within two days, would remove doubts about the outbreak."

They renewed that threat tonight, intensifying already considerable security concerns for what is to be Mr. Arafat's triumphal return to the territories after a 27-year absence. **********Nabil Shaath, the P.L.O.'s chief negotiator with the Israelis, announced in Cairo that Mr. Arafat would arrive in Gaza on Friday and would stay in the newly autonomous areas for three to five days. But several hours later Mr. Shaath said the trip might not begin until Saturday. **********Israeli officials said they expected a visit of no more than three days, and they fixed Saturday as the arrival date, adding that Mr. Arafat might stay in Gaza the whole time and not go at all to Jericho, in the West Bank. The visit has Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's approval, they said. **********Palestinians and Israelis alike were caught off-guard by the announcement in Cairo. **********Not that Mr. Arafat's arrival was unexpected. Quite the opposite: People here have been waiting for him with growing impatience since Israeli forces withdrew in mid-May from tiny Jericho and from troubled Gaza's towns and refugee camps. **********But May stretched into June and then took a bead on July, still with no sign of the 64-year-old P.L.O. leader, whose last known appearance in the territories was in 1967, when they were captured by Israel in war. **********Reasons for the delay varied, with Palestinians citing money shortages, snags in security arrangements at the borders and continuing disputes over the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. More than 350 prisoners were freed today, bringing the total thus far to about 4,000 under Israel's agreement with the P.L.O. A Scramble to Get Ready **********Some here began questioning whether Mr. Arafat, after spending his entire adult life as a globe-hopping revolutionary, was genuinely prepared to settle down to deal with the nuts and bolts of governance. **********As recently as Tuesday, Mr. Shaath suggested in Gaza that mid-July was the earliest that the chairman could come. So his sudden announcement today of an imminent visit came as a jolt, forcing Palestinians and Israelis to scramble to get ready. **********The Israelis' approval was required because, despite their pullback of forces, they remain in charge of the borders in both Gaza and the West Bank. They had asked the P.L.O. for two weeks' notice of Mr. Arafat's travel plans. Instead, they got a two-day warning. **********Another surprise was the decision to go first not to Jericho but to the Gaza Strip. Almost everyone had taken for granted that Jericho would be first, certainly international television networks that had spent considerable sums setting up their cameras in the heart of that sleepy oasis near the border with Jordan. **********Now it is not clear if Mr. Arafat will even pass through Jericho this time. Israel Television reported tonight that the P.L.O. had made no specific request to go there. **********In Cairo, Mr. Shaath explained to reporters that Gaza was the more important place. **********""Jericho is a town of 15,000 people, and we took it as a symbol for the West Bank,"" he said. ""Gaza has almost one million people. It is the country, the place and the people -- it is everything. Jericho is a symbol, and Gaza is a reality."" **********As for the suddenness of the announcement, Mr. Shaath said it was simply a case of Mr. Arafat's feeling that ""the time was ripe."" Some political commentators here said, however, that the P.L.O. leader was feeling increased pressure -- from Palestinians in the territories and from important foreign donors like the United States -- to make an appearance and reinforce his commitment to make the nascent self-rule work. **********While the Palestinian police force of several thousand officers has shown its competence over the last six weeks, there is still no functioning civil government in Gaza or Jericho. And presumably there will not be one until Mr. Arafat shows up to finish selecting and then swear in the Palestinian National Authority that is to run day-to-day affairs in the autonomous zones. Hotels Taken Over **********In Gaza City, the nerve center of the coastal strip, the Palestinian police took over all the seafront hotels for the P.L.O. chairman and an entourage that Mr. Shaath put at about 100 people. Bulldozers started cleaning beaches along the Mediterranean. **********Just outside Jericho, the Israeli Army was at work today building a parking lot for as many as 3,000 cars, for Palestinians expected to flock to the town for a glimpse of their long-awaited leader. The construction continued even though Mr. Arafat's arrival in Jericho this time was in question. **********Also busy were Jewish settlers and others on the Israeli right, who pledged to fill Jerusalem's streets this weekend to protest what Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the opposition Likud Party, called the ""national humiliation"" that the Arafat visit represents. **********Always central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Jerusalem has become even more of a battleground of late. **********Last week Mr. Rabin enraged his right-wing critics by saying Mr. Arafat, as a Muslim, had a right to visit Jerusalem to pray at Al Aksa Mosque. **********His aides said later that the Prime Minister had merely restated Israel's promise to guarantee access to all holy places, but that the Government nonetheless preferred that the P.L.O. leader stay away for now. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Rabin of capitulating to the Palestinians, and the Mayor, Ehud Olmert of Likud, vowed to turn out hundreds of thousands of demonstrators should Mr. Arafat try to come."

""We have no bargaining power."" **********Facing a long-term decline in their traditional roles as middlemen for Japanese companies, Itochu, Mitsubishi Corp., Sumitomo Corp. and other trading companies have been spearheading development of multimedia services in Japan. **********Japan's top companies, each of which has annual sales in excess of $100 billion and which rank among the biggest companies in the world, have set ambitious plans to supply programming and develop an interactive telecommunications infrastructure that will merge voice, data and visual information. **********In the foreseeable future, these new businesses will comprise only a small portion of their overall operations, which run the gamut from textile trading to real estate to natural resource development. **********But over the long term, the companies see multimedia becoming a major segment of their operations, an area that will allow the companies to prosper as traditional activities die out. **********The realization of their plans, however, will hinge to a great extent on deregulating laws that have stunted development of multimedia in Japan. In particular, they want Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., a former government monopoly that continues to dominate the market, to open up its network to outsiders. **********The companies have thus become key agents of deregulation in Japan and natural allies of foreign media companies. ""Their future growth potential is really up to the bureaucracy,"" said Leon Rapp, an analyst at Baring Securities. **********Pioneering a new field such as multimedia comes naturally to the companies, but it also comes by default. **********Japan's electronics manufacturers, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony Corp., have bought Hollywood studios that will provide content for multimedia networks. But development of domestic networks per se is made difficult by their need to focus resources in technological developments. **********Likewise, Japan's big telecommunications equipment makers NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., are consumed by the need to stay competitive in semiconductors and other cash-devouring businesses. Nor can they afford to be seen as a competitors to NTT, their biggest customer. **********NTT, for its part, has no interest in providing programming. The government is also loathe to give the behemoth free rein in setting up multimedia networks. **********Itochu , which had sales of 16.135 trillion yen ($165 billion) in the year through March, has taken the lead in the race to develop multimedia markets in Japan. **********Including its 1992 investment for a 5.6 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, the company has plowed nearly $1 billion into a broad-based strategy that includes satellite television, cable TV, program production and an 18 percent share of the international telephone company, International Digital Communications Inc. **********Although it is redundant to invest in cable and satellite system delivery systems, analysts say Itochu's strategy makes sense because cable has an extremely low penetration rate in Japan, so cable and satellite will have roles in play in Japan well into the next century. **********In contrast, among Itochu's primary multimedia competitors, Sumitomo Corp. has focused more on cable television, while Mitsubishi Corp. has concentrated on satellites. **********""Itochu has created a very diversified and coherent strategy in multimedia,"" Mr. Rapp said. ""It puts them in a very strong position."" **********Itochu plans to nearly double its investment in multimedia through the end of the decade, with most of the money going to cable television in Japan. **********The company, however, expects its multimedia business to continue making losses through the end of the decade. **********By the end of the year, Itochu is planning to invest an initial 10 billion yen in a project that will create a dozen interactive cable TV operations that reach 2 million households and pass 10 percent of Japanese homes by the year 2000. But Itochu will be providing only one- quarter of the initial investment, with equal amounts coming from Time Warner, US West and Toshiba Corp. **********The foreign partners will play key roles in providing technology and programming. But, according to Mr. Matsumoto, these will be insufficient to guarantee the venture's profitability. Simple cable TV services will never return enough income to pay back the huge costs of laying cables in high-cost Japan. **********The venture can only be viable if Itochu can use the network to provide telephone, data and other interactive services which, he estimates, will provide about 30 percent of revenues. But these services will be of only limited value unless they can be hooked up for a reasonable price to NTT's network, giving nationwide reach. **********""The goal of the interactive network is the local telephone business,"" Mr. Matsumoto said. ""We know that the monopolists in the telephone business have a lot of juice, and we want to suck some of it out."" **********The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is in favor of forcing NTT to open its network to upstart carriers. Last February, in a move to spur competition, it raised the ratio of foreign investment allowed in domestic cable TV businesses to 30 percent from 20 percent.

Morgan & Co. in New York. ""The longer the market didn't move, the heavier became the burden of the negative carry."" He explained that investors paid 5.75 percent to borrow Deutsche marks that they sold for dollars earning interest of only 3.125 percent. **********In theory, the dollar's advance on the currency market should have more than covered this cost and for a brief period it did. The dollar topped out at a 28-month high of 1.7650 DM in early February, just after the Federal Reserve Board pushed up short-term U.S. rates a quarter point and just before the government renewed its trade dispute with Japan, which weakened the dollar against most major currencies. **********The subsequent sell-off in U.S. and European markets has meant there has been no substantial change in relative interest rates. Three-month interest rates are now 2 percentage points, or 200 basis points, higher in Germany than in the United States, compared with the 2.25-point German advantage at the start of February. **********""There's no doubt that dollar holders have bailed out of the market,"" said Andres Drobny, at CS First Boston in London. ""But that's a healthy event. When everyone was long dollars, the currency had no room to move up. Now that we've got a two-way market, there's more potential for a rally."" **********Rainer Marian, at Crédit Suisse in Zurich, said the market was ""preparing a base for a rally that should take the dollar to 1.8000 DM by autumn."" Mr. Klath said he expected the U.S. currency to be even higher by year-end, trading at more than 1.9000 DM. **********""There's lots of talk in the market that the dollar could trade down to 1.5500 DM, and that's good,"" Mr. Marian said. ""If everyone expects the dollar to go higher then it's reflected in the price. With sentiment more ambiguous it makes it easier for the dollar to up."" **********His only proviso is that the dollar must hold above 1.6750 DM. A break below that would damage the outlook. **********The dollar pessimists agree that at present, the dollar is only trading at the bottom of a long enduring trading range, but they see its inability to perform as expected on the back of higher U.S. interest rates as a harbinger for more disappointment. **********""The dollar is in a lose-lose situation,"" said John. R. Taylor Jr., of International Foreign Exchange Concepts Inc., a New York-based consulting firm. ""As the U.S. economy expands the Fed will tighten, and rising interest rates will unsettle the bond market, which will cause a sell-off in the equities market and weaken the dollar as investment capital flows out of the United States. **********""The market is schizoid about higher U.S. interest rates. Most people think it will drive the dollar higher, but the major impact will be an increase of long-term capital outflows and a weakening dollar."" **********Mr. Taylor said he expected the dollar to fall ""quite low,"" in a downtrend that will last through summer. **********While it is apparent that the dollar has lost its sizzle, European bond and equity prices are still falling."

At the same time, the company is trying to cut costs. **********New York-based Met Life grew to be the nation's leading issuer of life insurance policies by selling coverage to low- and middle-income consumers often shunned by other companies. **********The company's cautious, conservative ways helped it avoid the investment mistakes that in recent years pushed some insurers to the brink and beyond. But that tendency to avoid rocking the boat also allowed some bad sales and management habits to fester. **********Late last year, Florida insurance regulators threatened to revoke Met Life's license because of shady selling practices from its Tampa, Fla., office. Consequently, the company's recently installed chairman, Harry P. Kamen, a lawyer, and his second-in-command, Ted Athanassiades, an actuary, were confronted with a crisis outside their areas of expertise. **********At first, it seemed to be a distraction from their primary mission of overcoming Met Life's daintiness about lifting profits -- ""a word,"" Mr. Kamen said, ""that was quite literally not used in this company."" **********But as personal insurance sales plunged amid the publicity over sales scandals, the need to cut costs became even more acute. **********""The lower sales this year made people realize the extent to which we had been relying on ever-increasing levels of production,"" Mr. Athanassiades said. **********Rising sales were habitual at Met Life, as the failure of weaker companies helped it expand its share of the personal life insurance market to 9 percent in 1993 from 4 percent in 1987. But no more. **********So, over the next three years, Mr. Athanassiades says, he plans to cut $120 million to $150 million from the $500 million in fixed costs of the individual insurance business. **********Fortunately for Met Life, despite the sales scandal, its other businesses are thriving, and its finances remain strong. **********What Met Life calls its group business -- the array of employee life, disability and health insurance products it sells to 82 of the nation's 100 largest corporations -- is the industry leader. **********And its pension business, which sells both individual annuities and investment products to tax-advantaged company savings plans, earned a record $350 million before taxes last year. **********Still, restoring luster to Met Life's traditional heart and soul -- its vast sales force of nearly 11,000 agents operating out of more than 900 offices -- requires more than cutting costs. **********""We thought of ourselves as an ethical company, and made all the usual sorts of speeches,"" Mr. Kamen said. But, he now admits, ""In the decentralization of the early 1970's we may not have worried enough about controls."" **********The most public of the bad habits was uncovered by state regulators, who found some life insurance agents were overzealously pursuing commissions. The Tampa, Fla., office, for example, made nurses across the country targets of a special campaign selling what were described as ""retirement plans"" but were actually life insurance policies. Agents even went so far as to label insurance premiums as ""deposits."" **********It was a far cry from Met Life's role in creating one of the nation's first visiting nurse services early this century. **********The Tampa episode was all the more embarrassing because the head of that office, Daniel R. Urso, was one of the company's top sales managers. His techniques, which earned him over $946,000 in 1992, were widely praised and imitated. **********Of the more than 100,000 customers involved, about 31,000 were found to have been wronged and are to get refunds or other corrections. That is a small part of the 14 million households with insurance sold by a Met Life agent. But it was enough to cost the company more than $100 million, including fines and legal fees. **********Beyond paying customers for its mistakes, Met Life started a house-cleaning that led to the dismissal of more than four dozen executives, sales managers and agents. And last month it shifted Robert Crimmins, the executive in charge of the insurance sales force to a strategic planning job. It also stripped the five territorial offices of all power except the management of sales agents. **********Authority over the personal insurance business now rests with John H. Tweedie, a senior vice president brought to New York from Met Life's Canadian subsidiary. He says customers will soon see differences, with ""a better-trained sales force that is more oriented to building a relationship than selling the product most beneficial to the agent."" **********The company is also streamlining its application forms, and earlier this month it introduced a new training curriculum to replace a variety of training programs previously used by local offices and announced plans for ""Met Life University"" in Bridgewater, N.J. **********Looking ahead, Mr. Tweedie wants to change the way agents are compensated. The basic idea, he said, is to devise a pay system in which agents would be rewarded for maintaining close customer relationships rather than relying primarily on big upfront commissions for selling cash-value life insurance. **********It is too soon to measure the success of these efforts, but analysts are watching closely. **********""Over the long run,"" Larry Mayewski, a life insurance analyst at the rating firm A. M. Best & Company, said, ""the cost and quality of the distribution system is the company's most important issue."" **********To help its shrinking core of agents do more selling, Met Life is working on ways to introduce agents to the employees of companies that buy Met Life's group insurance. **********The idea was rejected in previous years because group insurance executives were worried that problems would arise from the individual sales agents. But recent experiments with selling homeowners and auto insurance have been successful, so the company is looking to expand the approach. **********While changes in the sales force have been time consuming, Mr. Kamen is reshaping the company in other ways. The most drastic step was to merge the health insurance and health care businesses of Met Life and Travelers into a new company, Metra Health, with 12 million customers. **********Mr. Kamen expects that its 50 percent share of Metra Health's profit will soon exceed the profits of its old group health insurance business as, following an industry trend, it shifts customers into managed-care networks where doctors and others agree to offer a package of health services in exchange for a flat fee negotiated ahead of time. **********Outside of health care, Mr. Kamen declined to talk about changes. But the subject of acquistions and divestitures is important enough that he recently reached outside the company to hire Gary A. Beller, a former executive vice president and deal-maker at American Express. **********Met Life's subsidiaries include Century 21, with its far-flung network of franchised real estate brokers; State Street Research and Management, an investment adviser for mutual funds and institutions; and a small mortgage banking company. Met Life also owns a property and casualty insurer that has grown to be one of the country's 20 largest, but is not highly profitable. **********While profit has long been a four-letter word at most mutual insurance companies, Met Life executives see no conflict between their desire for more profits and the company's commitment to serving its customers, who are also its owners. **********""A big element of what people buy from us is our financial strength,"" Mr. Athanassiades said. ""We want to get back our triple-A ratings."" **********Analysts, while praising Met Life's efforts so far, say the company faces profound questions about the competitiveness of its products and its costly distribution network. **********""The market for traditional life insurance has been shrinking for many years,"" noted Jayan Dhru, insurance analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ""Met Life, like the other big insurance companies, must eventually reposition itself to meet the intense competition of mutual funds."" **********But unlike many other insurers, Met Life does not plan to concentrate all its new firepower on selling investments, mostly to high-income people looking forward to comfortable retirements. ""We still see that insurance is a good and necessary product for income protection,"" Mr. Tweedie said, ""and there is still a tremendous need for it among middle-income families."""

Yeltsin has lifted restrictions on some foreign banks licensed to do business in this country, but has excluded two leading American banks. **********The two, Chase Manhattan and Citibank, received licenses to operate in Russia last year, but remain barred from serving Russian residents and companies, while six European banks and the Bank of China have just been freed from such limitations, Russian central bank officials said. ""For these two banks, the restrictions remain in place,"" said Larisa Zolotuchina, a central bank spokeswoman, referring to the American institutions. **********The restrictions on serving Russian clients were imposed by Mr. Yeltsin in November at the behest of the influential Russian banking lobby. Less than a month earlier, the central bank had granted many of the licenses to foreigners. **********Many overseas banks have opened offices in Moscow to help their Western clients do business in this country, such as assembling financing for projects. While the restrictions do not affect a significant part of Citibank's and Chase Manhattan's operations, they do prevent the banks from tapping into the Russian market as fully as they had hoped. **********Central bank officials acknowledge that the presence of foreign banks will help Russia's nascent financial industry develop services and technology more quickly. But Russian bankers fear that the foreign institutions will grab the best customers, including some Western companies that now work through them.Insularity Rules **********This country desperately needs foreign cash to rejuvenate its economy. Still, many Russians remain wary of outsiders and are unwilling to cede control of their markets or natural resources to Westerners. **********Some Western bankers who complained about the decree said the ability to serve Russian residents and companies was vital for the profitability of their Russian operations. **********After months of criticism from Europe and the United States, Mr. Yeltsin signed the decree last Friday lifting limitations on foreign banks from countries that have investment-protection treaties with Russia. The details became available Tuesday. **********Russian officials said Citibank and Chase Manhattan would remain subject to the limitations because Parliament had yet to approve the investment treaty with the United States. The treaty was signed by Mr. Yeltsin and former President George Bush in 1992 and has been ratified by the United States Senate. **********Russia has an investment treaty with the European Union, and Mr. Yeltsin's new decree was welcomed by European officials, who said the way was clear for Russia to sign a broad new trade agreement with the European Union. Mr. Yeltsin is to sign the accord later this month on the Greek island of Corfu. Some members had refused to sign the pact while the banking restrictions remained in place. **********Russian central bank officials said that in addition to the Bank of China, the restrictions were lifted for ABN-Amro and ING Bank of the Netherlands, a French-German joint venture formed by Banque Nationale de Paris and Dresdner Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Banque Societe Generale Vostok of France and Credit Suisse. **********Other foreign institutions remain subject to the restrictions, central bank officials said -- Bank Austria, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi of Turkey and the Russian Turkish Bank. This is presumably because their countries also lack treaties with Russia.Muted Responses **********Moscow representatives of Chase Manhattan and Citibank declined to comment today. A United States Embassy spokesman said only that Mr. Yeltsin's decree was being studied. **********John M. Anderson, a Chase corporate spokesman in New York, said: ""Chase is still hopeful and optimistic that we will eventually get a full license. In the meantime, we will continue to serve our multinational clients from Moscow."" **********Secretary of the Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had complained about the restrictions when he visited Moscow earlier this year. The United States Ambassador here, Thomas R. Pickering, has also raised the matter with Russian officials, as have Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, and other visiting members of Congress. **********Yevgeny N. Makarov, senior counselor in the North American department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said the treaty had not been adopted because the Russian Parliament that took office in January had been dealing with more pressing matters. ""For them it is not a priority,"" Mr. Makarov said. **********Vladimir N. Trofimov, chief of staff of Parliament's international affairs committee, said the treaty would take at least two months to ratify and would not be on the agenda before the legislators take summer vacations, which extend from July 20 to Oct. 1. **********The continuing restrictions on Chase Manhattan and Citibank could be linked to efforts by Russian banks to gain access to the United States. **********""Russian bankers should have the same rights in the United States as American bankers have here,"" Mr. Trofimov said. ""I believe the American Government is not ready to allow foreign banks to enter their market."""

Officially, this sealing-off of the territories is to last through this week -- Islamic radicals have threatened new raids to mar Israel's Independence Day celebrations on Thursday -- and it will then be reevaluated. **********It is not the first time that such a prohibition has been ordered, and in the past they invariably have been eased after a while. But leaving their weekly meeting today, Cabinet members said that this ban may be more than a quick fix. 'Prolonged' Ban Expected **********""The closing is to be prolonged,"" Agriculture Minister Yaacov Tzur said. **********Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said he thought it would be retained even after Palestinian self-rule began in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. It seems extremely unlikely, though, that the negotiators will meet their original target date of this Wednesday, April 13, for completing arrangements for an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. **********For Palestinians, the loss of jobs in Israel is an instant hardship, and some denounced what they called collective punishment against them. They received support from a few Israeli Cabinet members, including Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni. **********""They are human beings,"" she said. ""They have families. They have to work. They have to feed their children. And we know that the terrorists are people who can come in even if we will have a closure."" What About the Doctors? **********There are questions about what exceptions to the ban will have to be made -- for example, Arab doctors and nurses from the West Bank are now cut off from major hospitals in East Jerusalem. The closing also keeps thousands of other Palestinians from East Jerusalem, which they regard as their religious, cultural and economic center. **********For Israel, it is no easy task to free itself from cheap Palestinian labor that it has come to take almost for granted since capturing the territories in the 1967 Middle East War. But since the Persian Gulf war of 1991 it has gradually reduced the number of Palestinian workers allowed in. Arab Workers Already Halved **********A little more than a year ago, just before a wave of assaults on Israelis led to another closing, as many as 120,000 workers were permitted into Israel from the territories each day. That number had shrunk to 60,000 or less by early this year. **********With no one now allowed in, the Cabinet agreed today to give six-month visas to about 15,000 foreign construction workers, many expected to come from Romania and Bulgaria, and to 3,200 farmhands, most likely from Thailand and Turkey. That will increase the number of foreign laborers to more than 35,000 -- an important change for Israel, which has traditionally rejected the ""guest workers"" common in Western Europe. **********But separating the Israeli and Palestinian populations for long periods may not be easy, Government and military officials caution."

Hubbell to call a special hearing to determine whether Crédit Lyonnais's lawyers ""had any involvement"" in a memorandum advising the bank to clear its archives of documents relating to the Sasea case before an official search. **********In his Feb. 11 order charging top officials of the bank with complicity in the bankruptcy of Sasea, Jean-Louis Crochet, the Geneva magistrate investigating the case, mentioned coming across such a memo but did not identify its author. **********Mr. Spar said that ""any suggestion"" that the bank's attorneys had advised it to withhold evidence was ""absolutely false."" **********Mr. Kerkorian also seized on evidence presented to the Swiss court to refute Crédit Lyonnais's claim that MGM had no value when he sold it to Giancarlo Parretti in 1990 in a deal financed by the bank. Soon after, when MGM's cash flow turned negative and Mr. Parretti defaulted on his payments, the bank took control of the Hollywood studio.

Perry ordered the unusual payments ""in recognition of the unique circumstances related to the aircraft accident,"" which killed six military officers from Britain, France and Turkey, and five Kurdish workers employed by the United States, the Pentagon said in a statement issued Friday. **********Fifteen Americans also died in what was one of the United States military's worst self-inflicted losses. Fourteen of the Americans were military personnel whose families received an immediate $6,000 death benefit and up to $3,100 in burial costs. Of those families, all but one also had a service member's life insurance plan that pays a lump sum of $200,000, said a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Tom LaRock. A Foreign Service officer, Barbara Schell, was also killed in the accident. **********It is rare for the United States to pay the families of foreigners killed as a result of American military mistakes. But after the cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iranian passenger plane in 1988, killing all 290 people aboard, Washington paid $2.9 million to the families. The United States also paid $1.9 million to the families of three Turkish sailors who were killed and one who was injured when the aircraft carrier Saratoga accidentally fired on their ship in 1992. **********The Pentagon statement noted that the United States was not obligated by United States or international law to make any payments, and said that they were a ""humanitarian gesture"" made at Mr. Perry's discretion.

Most of the information could not be independently verified, but the document, issued Friday night, strongly suggests that officials have considerable intelligence information on the rebel army that stunned the nation by seizing San Cristobal and three other large towns in Chiapas state in the first hours of 1994. **********While the rebels today continued to fight troops who have been backed by planes, helicopter gunships and artillery, the conflict appeared to be spreading beyond Chiapas, as the insurgents had vowed it would. Bomb Explodes in Capital **********Shortly after 1 o'clock this morning, officials said, a bomb exploded in a car parked in the center of an underground lot in a shopping center on the southern edge of Mexico City, causing heavy damage but no serious injuries. **********Neither the rebels nor any other group immediately took responsibility. But in a country that has had only two car bombings in recent memory, both tied to feuds among drug traffickers in the western city of Culiacan in early 1992, the explosion seemed to shake many. It came only hours after a bomb threat on Friday afternoon led officials to evacuate the capital's stock exchange as police officers with bomb-sniffing dogs rushed in. **********Airports throughout Mexico were placed on maximum alert out of concern over possible attacks, as were installations of the Federal Electricity Commission and the state oil monopoly. In a message delivered to the Electricity Commission on Friday, the rebels took responsibility for toppling 90-foot electrical towers in the central state of Puebla and the western state of Michoacan late Thursday. ""Mission accomplished,"" the message said of the towers, which were apparently pulled down by vehicles. ""The next step is to advance to Mexico City."" **********The Mayor of Mexico City, Manuel Aguilera Gomez, said special security measures had been in place throughout the capital for several days.  Denial by Archdiocese **********The rebels, calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army, have declared war on the state in the name of Mexico's Indians. **********The Government report brought angry denials from San Cristobal's Catholic Archdiocese, which has often clashed with Government officials in defending the rights of the impoverished Indians who make up about half of Chiapas's 3.2 million people. **********The report did not name any Catholic or evangelical church members or peasant leaders whom it accused of links to the rebels, nor did it provide evidence to support the assertions. It also raised questions about why the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari failed to act earlier against the insurgents if it knew so much about them. **********""I think they tried to keep all of this under wraps in order to get the Free Trade Agreement through,"" said Federico Reyes Heroles, a political analyst. ""But the concrete result is that they let this go on for at least two years without taking action and they allowed the guerrillas to grow and grow."" **********In a communique purportedly sent today by the Zapatista army to the news magazine Proceso, the rebels agreed to talks with the Government but not its condition that they first surrender their arms. It was impossible to determine the authenticity of the message, however. Leftists in March **********On Friday, thousands of members of leftists groups marched through Mexico City, calling on the Salinas administration to recognize the rebels officially, cease military operations against them and begin negotiations. **********As the military blocked roads out of San Cristobal, preventing reporters from entering battle zones, it continued to send troops against the guerrillas, but was apparently hampered in the use of its air force by bad weather. **********Government officials say that many more than 100 people are believed to have been killed in the fighting, although the Secretariat of Defense has reported only 95. **********The Government's report on the rebels has a bitterly worded introduction that says, ""This is not an indigenous or peasant movement but actions by a radical group directed by professionals who are tricking and even forcing the participation of Indians by press-ganging them."" **********The report, to which military officials and federal prosecutors also contributed, said the Zapatista force, named for Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary peasant hero, had been active over the last year, fomenting land seizures by peasants and ambushing units of the army and security forces. **********A rebel who calls himself Comandante Marcos said the guerrilla army had been preparing for a decade, and many rebels interviewed in recent days said they had belonged to it for two to five years. **********Among the leaders and trainers of the force, the Government said, were former members of Mexican guerrilla groups that operated in the 1970's and were linked to two tiny radical political groups, the Revolutionary Clandestine Union Party of the People, and the Forces of National Liberation. Foreign Involvement 'Possible' **********The report backed away somewhat from earlier Government assertions of foreign involvement in the Zapatista leadership, saying, ""It is possible that they have had some guerrilla experience in countries south of Mexico."" But it said one Nicaraguan and a man thought to be a Guatemalan had been detained on suspicion of belonging to the group. **********Today, the Federal Attorney General's office said it had arrested a Guatemalan man, Jesus Sanchez Galicia, as ""one of the principal commanders"" of the rebel army. **********The report identified 15 Zapatista training camps in Chiapas, and detailed elaborate training methods and schedules. It described a system of ranks and organization that loosely resembles that of a regular army, and an arsenal ranging from toy wooden guns and ancient M-1 carbines to more modern machine guns and assault rifles. **********The Government asserted that radical groups making up the Zapatista force had ""superimposed"" themselves on legitimate community and peasant organizations, and that among the leaders were people ""who called themselves 'catechists' but who in fact carry out subversive activities."" **********The Government did not accuse the San Cristobal Archdiocese or any of its 65 priests, but suggested that church members close to them had encouraged or aided the rebels as individuals. **********The report said, ""The Government has been very careful not to confuse the different types of organizations and their leaders,"" but it also said it had identified community leaders in 24 towns as guerrillas. It named the towns but not the suspects. 'Calumnies, Lies and Slander' **********The vicar of the Roman Catholic archdiocese here, the Rev. Gonzalo Ituarte, dismissed the Government's claims of involvement in the rebel army by church members as ""calumnies, lies and slander."" **********""The sin of the church has been to tell the truth, not only to the world but so that the victims of these injustices, this poverty, might know their situation and their rights,"" he said in an interview today. **********In answer to what has been a chorus of questions about why the Government did not more quickly detect and control a force that officials estimate at as many as 2,000 fighters, the report said that federal and local officials had reacted ""since the detection of the first illicit activities"" by the insurgents last year, including an ambush in which two military officers were shot. **********But neither the report nor the officials who presented it in Mexico City offered much of an explanation for how the Government could have followed the movement so closely without learning of the huge operation it launched on New Year's Eve. **********People in Ocosingo and Las Margaritas, two of the towns taken by the rebels, have said that reports of a possible attack had reached the local authorities several days before the New Year and that they had taken some precautions. The report said that local and federal authorities had detected ""suspicious movement in the jungle"" on Dec. 30, but that this was the third such report in the year. **********The Government said military units in the area had been reinforced. But a relative of the local military officer, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said many troops in the barracks outside San Cristobal were given a three-day holiday leave and were not to have reported back until Jan. 1."

Anthony Rolfe, a partner in 654 Madison Avenue Associates, a group that recently bought the building. **********The store, scheduled to open in the spring, will feature the Calvin Klein Collections for men and women plus the Calvin Klein Home Collection, according to people familiar with the transaction. The retail area will use three levels, including 5,000 square feet of street-level space. **********The Calvin Klein store will be on the same block as Barneys, which specializes in designer fashions, including Calvin Klein. Calvin Klein has stores elsewhere in the United States. **********Mr. Rolfe said 654 Madison Avenue Associates, which had held the operating lease on the building since 1958, bought the building on Monday from the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, based in Buffalo. The bank bought the building eight years ago with plans to use the street-level space for retail banking, Mr. Rolfe said. **********Instead, the space Calvin Klein is taking was used by the bank for executive offices and trading operations. The bank moved over the weekend to 350 Park Avenue.Tenants for 660 Madison **********A few doors up the street from the new Calvin Klein store, the luxury office building at 660 Madison Avenue and 61st Street, atop the new uptown Barneys, has signed its first two office tenants. **********Gleacher & Company, an investment banking company, is taking 17,340 square feet, the entire 19th floor, for 15 years, said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark & Company Real Estate, the leasing agent for the 23-story building. **********Gleacher is scheduled to move in August from its offices at 667 Madison Avenue. The company is moving because the sublease for its offices, occupied since 1990, is expiring, a company spokesman said. Also, he said, ""We needed a small amount of additional space and we wanted to stay in the neighborhood."" **********The other new tenant is Argentina's recently privatized oil company, YPF Sociedad, which has rented 6,300 square feet, part of the 20th floor, to establish a New York office. The lease term is 10 years, and YPF plans to occupy the space in August. **********Annual rents at 660 Madison Avenue range from about $45 to $55 a square foot, Mr. Gosin said. The building's 190,000 square feet of office space starts on the 12th floor, with Barneys occupying the first 11 floors. **********Mr. Gosin said the aim was to create a ""unique, European-hotel atmosphere"" in the building, which has a French limestone facade. Some offices have terraces overlooking Central Park, and the building will have a concierge to arrange hotel and restaurant reservations for tenants and their clients.Playtex Products Moving **********Playtex Products Inc. is moving its corporate headquarters to the Nyala Farms corporate office complex in Westport, Conn., from Stamford. **********Playtex Products has signed a 10-year lease for 42,000 square feet, said John E. Sheehan, principal at Delmhorst & Sheehan, a real estate advisory company that represented the landlord, the Stauffer Management Company, in the transaction. Mr. Sheehan declined to disclose the value of the lease, but local real estate agents said prime office space in Westport and elsewhere in Fairfield County fetches about $20 to $23 a square foot in annual rent, less than half what it would in 1988. **********Hercules P. Sotos, vice chairman of Playtex Products, said the company was moving because it did not have the option of renewing its expiring lease for 42,000 square feet at 700 Fairfield Avenue in Stamford. Playtex Apparel, a division of Sara Lee, will remain at 700 Fairfield Avenue. **********The space Playtex Products is vacating will be occupied by the new landlord, Daymon Associates Inc., which designs packaging and provides other services for generic supermarket products. Daymon is moving its 165 employees to Stamford from its offices at 500 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. **********Playtex Products chose Nyala Farms because it was close by and offered a spacious campus setting, Mr. Sotos said. The move, scheduled for September, will involve 100 employees. **********Nyala Farms, former headquarters of the Stauffer Chemical Company, has 380,000 square feet of office space in five, two-story buildings."

Critic Of Korea Pact Eases Stance," **********A leading Senate critic of the nuclear agreement between the United States and North Korea softened his tone today and predicted that the new Republican-controlled Congress would not follow through on recent threats to overturn the accord. **********""As far as any efforts to scuttle that agreement, I don't anticipate any,"" Senator Frank Murkowski said at a news conference here, after he and Senator Paul Simon made a rare visit by high-level American officials to North Korea. **********The comments by Mr. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, seem to remove one of the first challenges to his foreign policy that President Clinton was expected to face next year from the Republicans who swept to control of both houses of Congress in last month's elections. Mr. Murkowski is in line to become chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on East Asia in the new Congress, so his opinion on the nuclear accord will carry great weight. **********The Republican legislator said he was still critical of the Geneva accord and expected it to be ""examined thoroughly"" but not overturned by the new Congress. He said his criticism was ""quite specific,"" directed at a clause that allows North Korea to put off inspections of two suspected nuclear waste sites until construction of modern nuclear reactors is well under way. That will be years from now and after the expenditure of about $2 billion, he said. **********Mr. Murkowski had vociferously criticized the nuclear agreement last month, saying that he would seek to overturn it by blocking the United States from buying the oil it is committed to supplying to North Korea under the pact. A few days later, at a Senate hearing, Mr. Murkowski pulled back from that threat, but some other Republican lawmakers still said they would try to block the funding needed to carry out the accord. **********The agreement, signed in October, requires North Korea to give up activities that are suspected of being aimed at bomb development. In exchange it will receive two modern light-water nuclear reactors, at an estimated cost of $4 billion that will be borne mainly by South Korea and Japan. In addition, the United States will provide North Korea with fuel oil until the new nuclear plants are ready and will relax its restrictions on economic and diplomatic relations with the Communist nation. **********Mr. Murkowski said his trip the last two days had ""changed to some extent"" his opinion of North Korea. **********""I think they are desperately in need of foreign exchange, desperately in need of energy and in a transition of leadership, and as a consequence, they need assistance,"" he said. ""And I think if that assistance can properly be communicated and transmitted we can ease tensions in this part of the world."" **********Despite his misgivings about the accord, Senator Murkowski apparently expressed his support for the agreement to North Korean officials. **********""Both Senator Murkowski and I indicated while we would have preferred some different provisions in terms of earlier inspections, that the United States will comply with the agreement that we have signed,"" Mr. Simon, an Illinois Democrat, said at the news conference. **********The two Senators flew to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, from Beijing on Sunday aboard the first American military plane to fly into North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953. This afternoon, they traveled to Seoul, the South Korean capital. **********During their 28 hours in North Korea, they met with many officials including Kim Yong Nam, the Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. However, they were not granted an audience with the reclusive Kim Jong Il, who is believed to be the leader of North Korea although he has not officially been appointed head of state. Mr. Murkowski said they were told Mr. Kim is still observing mourning for his father, Kim Il Sung, who ruled North Korea before his death in July. **********The Senators said North Korean officials stressed to them that they wanted better relations with the United States. They said they pressed North Korea to begin a dialogue with South Korea. The North Koreans expressed a general willingness to do so, but no specifics were mentioned, they said. **********The Senators met today with the South Korean President, Kim Young Sam, and Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo to report on their visit to the North. The South Korean leaders were said to be skeptical about the North's supposed interest in North-South talks. **********Mr. Simon and Mr. Murkowski also asked for North Korea's help in clearing the cases and returning the remains of American soldiers missing in action from the Korean War."

The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, who led an effort to ease the pressure on Iraq last week, agreed on Monday with the United States Secretary of State, Warren M. Christopher, that the United States-Russian partnership in international matters was more important than Russia's concern for Iraq. **********And within the Arab world, where Iraq found some support in the summer of 1990 when it annexed Kuwait, there has been, this time, only silence or condemnation. **********Jordan, virtually the only link Iraq has had with the outside world, did not just distance itself from Baghdad. King Hussein warned last week that he would side against Iraq if it tried a military move against another Arab country. This week the King said he would sign a peace treaty with Israel, Iraq's archenemy. **********This morning it looked indeed as though Iraq had been isolated, and it was far from clear what the Government of President Saddam Hussein could do to alter the situation. **********Even recognition by Iraq of Kuwait's integrity and international borders -- a last card that Baghdad has been witholding as a bargaining chip -- no longer seems enough to get the United States and some of its allies, including Britain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to relent in their pressure to maintain the crippling four-year-old trade sanctions. **********Iraqi officials and diplomats from European countries here are persuaded that the aim of the United States and its allies is to bring down the Government of President Hussein, not to obtain a fulfillment of United Nations resolutions. **********""The thing is that every time we comply with an item of the United Nations resolution, they come up with another argument to keep the sanctions,"" a senior Iraqi official said in a conversation this weekend. ""I am persuaded we cannot do enough to get these sanctions lifted by the Security Council because the goal of the sanctions in the mind of the United States is to starve the Iraqis into rebellion against their Government."" Foreign diplomats here say this assessment is on the mark. **********Asked what Iraq would do, the official seemed at a loss. After a while, he said: ""America should change this vengeful attitude because it will result in a chaotic breakdown from which no one will benefit. Future generations of Iraqis will remember this."" **********The problem for Iraq, however, is what to do to save this generation of Iraqis from the suffering they are subjected to because of the sanctions, which prohibit all trade except for food and medicine. **********Clearly, Iraqi decision-makers have yet to formulate an answer. **********On Monday the Government convened its 250-member Parliament with the intent of officially recognizing Kuwait. But as the Security Council debate that followed the passing of the resolution dragged on in New York, it became clear that such a step would not be enough. **********Finally the Parliament simply adopted a resolution that said it would do anything the leadership and President Hussein agreed to do. **********This morning the Iraqi-controlled news organizations were busy looking for silver linings in this latest duel with the United States, with headlines announcing that the ""big crossing"" toward an end of the hardships had begun. Yet Government officials were conceding elsewhere what is becoming increasingly evident here: they are running out of concrete ways to cope with the situation. **********Last month the meager rations guaranteed to every citizen, which barely fulfilled two-thirds of internationally recognized minimal nutrition requirements, were cut in half. **********On Monday Iraq's Trade Minister, Saadi Mehdi Saleh, showed reporters the meager rations to which people are entitled now: a little rice, wheat flour, tea, sugar, cooking oil and detergents, saying ""this is the quota for a people who are living on a lake of oil, one of the richest people in the world."" **********With its oil exports blocked by the United Nations, the Iraqi Government is simply running out of money, which means that Iraq is increasingly unable to guarantee the minimum requirements to feed its people. **********Baghdad's apparent gamble that resorting to a military expedition might somehow help focus attention on its plight and result in lifting of the sanctions backfired as the United States moved thousands of troops and overwhelming air power to the region. **********It is particularly galling for Iraq, which possesses the world's second largest oil reserves, after Saudi Arabia, to find its main source of revenue mothballed by the international community while the Saudis moved four years ago to take over Iraq's share of the international oil market. Four years ago that share stood at three million barrels a day. **********When asked whether he can see the connection between the embargo and the behavior of the Iraqi Government, Mr. Saleh, the trade minister, vigorously responded: ""We all stand behind President Saddam Hussein and are proud to follow him. We will resist."""

Gen. Mike Williams. He gave them assurances that they will be able to express their grievances to reporters who are expected to visit the base Tuesday. **********The group of Cubans near the beach and in surrounding fields dwindled today to ""several hundred,"" Major Thomas said, and no violence was reported in today's demonstrations. **********More than 28,000 Cubans and 14,000 Haitians are being held in separate camps at Guantanamo."

But because of operating conditions in one of the capitalist world's newest outposts, this is both the best of markets and the worst. **********""It can be very frustrating,"" Alexander Angell, director of sales and trading at Wood & Co, said. ""We spend so much time collecting information and then analyzing it and then publishing it. And by the time it is out, the stock that we were saying was a good buy at 1,200 koruna ($40) and might go to 2,000 is trading at 2,500."" **********Prague's bourse is the product of Eastern Europe's most audacious privatization program, begun in the spring of 1992 when the country that was then Czechoslovakia offered each citizen a coupon book to use in bidding for portions of nearly 1,500 state-owned companies. The coupon books cost 1,000 koruna. Now, Czechs who chose well could sell those shares for as much as 200,000 koruna. **********Launched in June 1993 with securities bought by 6 million Czechs, Prague's market emerged just as emerging markets had come into vogue with international money managers. Poland, in the midst of an eightfold rise in 1993, whetted appetites for Eastern Europe. The Czech Republic's market - with price/earnings ratios then in the single digits and an inflation rate one-third that of Poland - seemed destined to be caught in the same updraft. **********Since August, international players have dumped $100 million a month into Czech equities, according to Andrew Reicher of CS First Boston in Prague. The company has fielded orders from institutions as far away as Melbourne and Los Angeles. **********With just under 1,000 equities, the Czech market appears gigantic beside its regional competitors; Poland and Hungary boast fewer than 60 shares between them. But if foreign investors expected a smorgasbord in Prague, they have wandered into something more like an Easter-egg hunt. **********Nearly half of the Czech Republic's equities have not yet traded, Mr. Reicher said. Only about 100 trade ""with any degree of regularity,"" he added, and he only rated five as ""really tradeable."" **********For investors weary of hyperefficient markets where news has been so thoroughly discounted that a dart thrown at a list of stocks can outperform professional investors, Prague is delightfully inefficient. Analysts here are still trying to pry results for 1992 out of many companies. With even stale data scarce, ""it's really a question of kicking the tires, doing our own due diligence,"" Mr. Angell said. **********Once a broker identifies an attractive company, the game has just begun. Seventy-two percent of Czechs who invested entrusted their privatization coupons to investment funds that bid for stocks for them; now, nearly half of all shares are held by just 14 such funds. Aspiring buyers must negotiate with the managers of these funds. **********""I've got to go knock on doors,"" Mr. Angell said. ""Typically, to get blocks of stock out, one has to pay between 2.5 percent and 10 percent over the last traded price."" **********With the ratio of a stock's price to the company's earnings per share pushing above 40 on some issues, Czechs appear amused by their market's lofty levels. **********""We ask how long it can go on like this,"" said Michal Konecny, director at Komero Brokers, which has seven offices. Mr. Konecny, formerly a professor of economics, said most of his company's 700 retail customers come in only to sell the shares they had bought in the original voucher privatization. ""Last week, one client sold his bank shares and got 160,000 koruna,"" he says. ""Someone who invested in a bad way still has 6,000 or 7,000 koruna."" **********In another sign of eagerness to cash out, sellers outnumber buyers by 2-to-1 on the so- called RM System, an over-the-counter network designed for retail investors. In part because of this predominance of retail sellers, prices on the privately owned RM System are as much one-third below those on the stock exchange. **********CS First Boston's Mr. Reicher shared the retail investors' caution. ""These companies were dumped into the private sector warts and all,"" he said, and will need a couple of years to get up to speed. It will be entrepreneurs and foreign companies, not publicly traded companies, that will generate the 3 percent to 4 percent growth projected for the Czech economy in 1994, he said. **********At Wood & Co., Mr. Angell is more sanguine, at least about Ceske Energeticke Zavody AS, which supplies 80 percent of the country's electricity and accounts for one- quarter of the Czech market's estimated capitalization. **********It would cost $13 billion to replace Ceske Energeticke generating capacity, Mr. Angell said, yet the company's current market capitalization is only about $4.5 billion. ""I'm hoping and praying that it will correct back 20 or 30 percent,"" he said, so that investors can buy more of the stock."

Whites Visiting to Say Hi," **********If Ursula Pretorius was surprised to find herself, for the first time in her 29 years, in a black township, it was nothing compared to the amazement she created -- a fair-skinned Afrikaner woman with long auburn hair and vermilion eyeshadow, on foot in Soweto on a Saturday morning. **********The shoppers and the children playing dodge ball and the front-yard gossipers stared as, smiling nervously, this pale apparition crossed the dusty street and opened her mouth. **********""Sawubona!"" she hailed in her novice Zulu. ""Kunjani!"" **********For Mrs. Pretorius and eight other white students in the beginner Zulu class of Vusimusi Baloyi, the field trip to Soweto was the culmination of six weeks of study, in which the subject was not just language but their own country. **********The students are part of a white rush to study African languages. Some are driven by fears for their job security, others by curiosity about the newly empowered black majority, or simply by a sense that with political equality normal human discourse is now possible. **********""Before, no matter what your thoughts were, you were white,"" said Glenda Maasburg, 31, another student on the Soweto excursion. ""You were the cause of their being where they were. Now they have a black President, and maybe we'll become a little more acceptable to them."" **********The students on this field trip are all employees of the Central News Agency, a chain of stores selling reading material and office supplies, which has begun offering Zulu study as a post-apartheid perk for white employees. For six weeks they have met each Wednesday night at the company's human resources office, under a sign proclaiming, ""We need to redefine management in this country by appreciating the Africanness of our people."" **********They paired off with black teaching assistants to practice the difficult clicks of their new language. They sang freedom songs. They learned sentences they had selected as most useful to them. **********""Some ask for phrases they can use with their gardeners -- 'Take that weed, not the shrub,' or 'Please water here,' "" said Johan van Niekerk, a 36-year-old regional manager. **********Having no gardener, Mr. van Nierkerk learned phrases that would enable him to share the thrill of transition: ""How does it feel to vote?"" and ""We can make it work."" **********""It's actually opened my mind a bit,"" he said. ""Getting to know the culture, why they think the way they do."" **********""Like, we always wondered why they talk so loud,"" said Mrs. Maasburg, a systems manager, whose daughter is learning Zulu in fifth grade. ""They explained it's just the way they speak. It's things like that."" **********Their black teaching aides have given the students Zulu names, a reversal of the tradition that blacks adopt English aliases for the convenience of white masters. Mrs. Pretorius is Nobuhle, meaning Mother of Beauty. Mrs. Maasburg is Busisiwe, or Blessing. Mr. van Niekerk is Lwazi, Seeker of Knowledge. **********A few of the men had been in Soweto before, as soldiers manning roadblocks after the student uprising in the 1970's. Most had never set foot in any black township. **********Today they rode into Soweto the way most blacks do, boarding a bright red minivan from the black taxi depot in downtown Johannesburg and paying the 60-cent fare. **********Alighting in Diepkloof, a middle-class neighborhood of the vast black metropolis, they strolled the streets, gawking and being gawked at. **********They shopped for groceries, and then prepared an African lunch of cornmeal mush and tomato gravy. They sang and played games. Most of all, they talked, growing bolder as Soweto residents welcomed them with evident delight and shouts of new-South-Africa solidarity. **********""This is very absolutely wonderful,"" said Cameron Tlhabela, after bantering with Glenda Maasburg at the doorway of his simple cottage. **********Like most of his neighbors, Mr. Tlhabela has impressive credentials as a linguist, speaking English, five African languages and a smattering of school Afrikaans, but he was warmly forgiving of his visitor's grammatical blunders and admiring of her intentions. **********As they walked, the whites grew more confident of their Sawubona (""Hello"" -- literally, ""I see you""), Kunjani (""How are you?"") and Yebo (""Yes,"" used as an all-purpose response). **********South Africa has always had whites who mastered the indigenous languages, but until the elections drove home to them their status as a minority most were content with Afrikaans and English, increasingly the national lingua franca. **********Now universities and private language schools report a deluge of applications from whites eager to dissociate themselves from the past. **********""I felt this helplessness,"" Mr. van Niekerk said. ""What's happening around me? I'm not part of it."" **********If there were Soweto residents who viewed the expedition as patronizing, none said so. **********Anna Tshabane, a cousin of the teacher, said it was the first time she had had whites in her house. At first, she thought they were coming to arrest her. Relieved that they were students, she invited them in for tea. **********""My neighbors will see I've had white visitors -- I will be very great,"" she said. ""They'll think twice before they try to harm me."""

Ever so quietly, these funds are beginning to say goodbye to fee waivers, an industry staple in recent years that has bolstered investors' returns. **********By waiving or absorbing some management fees, fund companies were able to lift returns during a period of extraordinarily low interest rates. Now that rates are rising, and with them money fund returns, the expenses can be reinstated without driving investors away, the reasoning goes. Fund mergers and  recent investment losses are also contributing to the change. **********Because yields are rising, investors may not notice that they are paying higher expenses, but keeping one eye on expenses and one eye on returns will probably pay off. Funds with high expenses will have a hard time staying among the leaders. **********Fund companies needed marketing ploys like fee waivers when yields were under 3 percent, said Walter Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue Inc., an Ashland, Mass., company that tracks the funds. ""As interest rates go up, the funds find that the interest in money market funds increase,"" he said. **********The seven-day compound yield on taxable money funds averaged 4.29 percent on Sept. 27, with the leaders breaking the 5 percent threshold. That compares with  an average annual return of 2.72 percent at the end of last year. When rates fell over the last five years, so did money funds' share of industry assets. After all, who wanted to stay with an investment that barely kept pace with inflation? Since Jan. 5, the assets held by individuals in money market funds has risen 14 percent, to $425 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute. **********Money market funds generally contain Treasury bills and other short-term financial instruments, making yields fairly uniform across the industry. To distinguish themselves in a crowded field, some managers in recent years bought  risky derivative investments, whose returns are based on, or derived from, an underlying security or index. **********The investments generated exceptional returns last year but created losses at dozens of funds when rates rose sharply this year, forcing some companies to  bail out their money funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission has put money funds on notice to dump such investments. **********Derivatives aside, the primary way for a fund to enhance its return is to lower costs or to absorb some of its management fee. Even a small change in the  fee can have a big impact, given that returns of the leaders and the losers are  only a couple of percentage points apart and the average management fee is just  over half a point. **********Fee waivers have been used primarily to build market share. Fidelity and Dreyfus began a fierce price-cutting war on their money market funds in the late 1980's to get customers in the door. They intended to make back the lost money by converting investors to more profitable equity funds. **********At least for now, such strategies are waning. A study by IBC/Donoghue shows  that 57 percent of the 1,065 funds it tracks waived part or all of their fees in the second quarter, down from an all-time high of 60.2 percent in the first quarter. The drop was the first significant one since the second quarter of 1989 and marks the beginning of a gentle decline, Mr. Frank predicted. **********""You have to stop your loss leaders some time,"" said Bruce Bent, president of the Reserve Fund, New York, and the inventor of money market funds in the early 1970's. ""People who constantly give away a product go bankrupt."" **********Some fund advisers have given up not only on the waiver, but also on the fund. The Oppenheimer T-E Cash Reserves fund, with $25 million in assets early this year, is a case in point. A fee waiver added 0.30 of a percentage point to  the fund's yield, said Ellen Schoenfeld, manager of strategic planning at Oppenheimer Fund Management Inc., New York. ""We got rid of the subsidy,"" she said, ""and later merged it into our billion-dollar Centennial Tax-Exempt Trust."" **********Even with the waiver, the fund's expenses were well above average at 1.03 percent of assets in the first quarter. After the merger with Centennial, expenses were 0.72 percent. **********The bigger a fund, the lighter the expense bite. That's partly because a crucial element in the expense ratio is the transfer agency fee, which is the same for each fund. The largest money market fund in the country, Merrill Lynch  CMA Money Fund, does not waive fees. But at more than $27 billion in assets, it  enjoys economies of scale that keep its expense ratio at a fighting 55 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. The average expense ratio at money  funds stood at 58 basis points at the end of 1993, down from 65 basis points four years earlier. **********Small young funds are at a distinct disadvantage. Jane Naeseth, senior vice  president and principal at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., and portfolio manager of Stein Roe Government Reserves, said, ""It's virtually impossible to start a new fund without waiving fees."" **********Smith Barney absorbed some fees when it started its Smith Barney Muni Bond New York Money Market fund, but changed its policy in the second quarter when it had attracted enough assets to make its expense ratio competitive. Smith Barney investors now have to pony up 0.67 of a percentage point, instead of 0.60, but they can take comfort in the knowledge that the fund's expense ratio may fall in early November. The fund is scheduled to merge then with a fund from Shearson, said Heath McLendon, executive senior vice president at Smith Barney. **********The latest wave of consolidation in the fund industry has led to fee changes elsewhere as well. The Laurel funds from the Mellon Bank altered their expense ratios after the bank acquired the Boston Company last spring. Among the nine Laurel funds that were waiving fees in the first quarter, shareholders are now paying higher expenses in two funds, and lower fees in three funds. **********""We had two fund families coming together, and we had to choose an expense ratio suitable for both sets of shareholders,"" said Cindy Sokel, product manager for Funds Distributor Inc., which distributes the Laurel funds. Laurel funds are probably headed for further consolidation and perhaps more fee changes now that  Mellon has acquired Dreyfus. **********To be sure, not all the funds that appear to have stopped waiving fees have  changed policies. Stein Roe Government Reserves shows up in IBC/Donoghue reports as charging customers all the expenses it incurs, but Mrs. Naeseth said it still waived fees. The problem is that the cost of running the fund has fallen, and reported expense ratios represent merely an accountant's best guess of what expenses will be. **********The derivatives debacle has also played a role in the move to reinstate fees. Louis Harvey of Dalbar Financial Services Inc. in Boston explains: ""Fund A may have never invested in a derivative, but when the institution has had to lay down $250 million, it's tough not to collect fees from everywhere you possibly can."""

For several years now, that phrase has been used to shrug off the persistently extreme valuations in the American stock market..By conventional methods of measuring value - the ratios of share price to earnings, book valu...",7162,,International Herald Tribune,Your Money,,article,Is This Bubble Really Puncture-Proof?,Is This Bubble Really Puncture-Proof?," **********This time it's different. For several years now, that phrase has been used to shrug off the persistently extreme valuations in the American stock market. **********By conventional methods of measuring value - the ratios of share price to earnings, book value and dividend yield being the most common - stocks simply are selling for more than they're worth. All three indicators remain above levels that in the past have foretold the onset of a bear market, and they have been there for two to eight years, depending on the market index and the measure of choice, according to the chartists at Ned Davis Research. **********Consider the price-to-dividend ratio. When the stocks that make up the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index trade for more than 32 times their annual dividends, they are considered too expensive and primed for a fall. The index is close to its all-time high, and its components recently fetched 37 times their dividends. **********The other closely followed measures look the same. With corporate earnings picking up, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has fallen back to 23 from its all-time peak of 26 late in 1991, but it is still well above the 18 that has signaled market tops. The price-to-book ratio of the S&P Industrials index was 3.68 at the end of December, well beyond the two-times-book considered expensive. The last time it was below two was late in 1985. **********Differences in accounting practices make inter-market comparisons of valuation gauges difficult. Japanese PE ratios, for instance, will always seem high to Americans. Still, with an average PE of close to 70, even after Monday's colossal five percent drop, the Nikkei 225 index would seem high to Japanese traders, as well. That's higher than the index's PE at the end of 1989, before it fell more than 50 percent. **********The high valuations that have been built into U.S. share prices have, for obvious reasons, alarmed many an analyst. Robert Prechter, who publishes the Global Market Perspective, writes that ""current market risk is unprecedented in U.S. history. In fact, it's probably not much less than what existed in 1720 at the top of the investment manias that occurred then in England and France."" **********Many assets lost 90 percent of their value when that bubble burst. So far, however, this bubble, if that is what is indeed forming, remains intact. Why? **********One opinion is that stocks are not really overvalued, that the traditional ways of valuing companies no longer measure what they used to. For instance, today's high price-to-book values are dismissed by some who say that modern accounting methods understate assets, and therefore book values. **********One who fearlessly dismisses the apparently high valuations is Elaine Garzarelli, the highly respected analyst at Lehman Brothers who has swiped the position of most closely followed market wizard away from Mr. Prechter. In a widely quoted pep talk made at a business lunch last week, Miss Garzarelli said stocks were not overvalued at all, but were actually 20 percent undervalued when compared with today's miserly interest rates. She foresees the rally continuing indefinitely, with any correction from here limited to a painless 4 to 7 percent. **********""This stock market party could go on forever,"" she said. **********Really? Forever? **********""The party will continue until rates go up,"" she added. Chances are that event will be a lot closer to now than to forever. But if the famed analyst finds it difficult to keep her enthusiasm more tautly tethered, it is because interest rates are indeed truly low, pretty much as low as they've been in three decades. So low that they make dividend yields - and therefore stocks - look pretty good. **********By Miss Garzarelli's reckoning, short-term rates, lately around three percent, would have to rise a percentage point or more before stock prices weaken appreciably. Others not as sanguine as her also credit low rates with keeping stocks propped up as long as they have been. **********""Interest rates are so low for the first time in so long,"" notes Bernadette Murphy, a technical analyst at M. Kimmelman & Co. ""It's been my observation that when interest rates are low, PE multiples are high, and the traditional concerns about yields being below three percent are diminished because investment choices are so limited."" **********But is choosing the least of several evils a sound way to invest? Lance Stonecypher, research director at Ned Davis Research, points out that in the good old days, when three percent money was the rule, many a market slide began with dividends high relative to Treasury bill rates. **********""If you go back prior to 1968, the dividend yield-to-T-bill indicator missed calling a lot of bear markets,"" he said; exactly 13 between 1929 and 1968. ""The point is, at some point, while the bulls make a strong case [for valuations not being high] on relative levels, the absolute valuations have to come back into the picture."" **********When they do, the picture could turn ugly. With valuations so high, Mr. Stonecypher warned, stocks look precarious and accident prone. **********""It may be just too early,"" said Miss Murphy. ""Excessive valuations can persist for years; they did in the '60s."" **********Indeed, Miss Garzarelli looks to that decade for inspiration. Then, as now, stocks were overvalued for several years, almost without let-up, driven by flows into mutual funds and rates that stayed low for years. And they made a nice run early on, nearly doubling in the first half of the decade, much as they have done since 1990. After that, though, there is less to be inspired by. After peaking in the mid-60s, the market went sideways, lumbered to a slightly higher top in early 1973, then collapsed. **********Today's high valuations make James Stack, editor of the newsletter InvesTech Market Analyst, nervous, but he says that a catalyst is needed to send the market to its doom. **********""Valuation is very much like the mutual fund frenzy we're seeing today: It is not a healthy condition, but by itself it is also not a trigger for a bear market,"" he explained. ""Valuation does not cause the market to decline. If we step back to the decade of the '60s, the market averages continued to frolic for most of that decade at overvalued levels. It wasn't until we saw a massive shift in Federal Reserve policy in 1968 that the blocks dropped into place for a bear market. **********There is one key difference between today's market and the one a generation ago: That one was driven not only by stable, low rates, but by strong economic growth, as well, something conspicuously lacking lately. **********""This is a liquidity-driven market,"" Mr. Stack said. ""It's a market that's probably far more interest-rate sensitive than in the past.... I have seen a number of analysts who are adamantly bullish come out and say that as long as we don't see more than a half-percent uptick, everything will be fine, [but] by the time we see short-term rates up half a percent, we'll probably see the market down 10 to 15 percent already."""

It did not describe the agreement with the United States in any detail, but a later announcement by North Korea's Foreign Ministry suggested that international inspectors would only be permitted into the country's seven declared nuclear sites for one-time inspections. The announcement said that North Korea refused to allow the kind of regular visits by the International Atomic Energy Agency that are required under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. **********Both the United States and South Korea have said that nothing short of full compliance with the treaty would be sufficient if the North wants to go ahead with talks about normalizing diplomatic relations and opening the door to foreign investment and trade. **********The White House said today that it would not comment on the statement by the North Korean leader. But Clinton Administration officials indicated that there had been no final breakthrough in the standoff. **********In his speech, delivered to the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, Mr. Kim made no direct connection between resolving the nuclear dispute and North Korea's other major objective: establishing trading links to economic powers it once scorned. But he suggested that North Korea would have to change dramatically in order to develop foreign markets. **********The State Department said Thursday, without revealing details, that the two sides had ""moved closer"" to some kind of preliminary agreement on the nuclear inspection issue. But officials say that first, North Korea must come up with an inspection plan that satisfies the atomic energy agency. **********Officials familiar with the talks say the ""joint statement"" referred to by Mr. Kim, who is 81 years old and has ruled North Korea for nearly five decades, would come after a team of atomic energy agency inspectors arrived at North Korea's nuclear installations in Yongbyon. The United States would then officially announce the cancellation of its annual military exercise with South Korea. American and South Korean officials say they have little desire to hold the exercises this year. **********The statement would likely also include some agreement about the exchange of envoys between North and South Korea, a prelude to restarting talks that have essentially gone nowhere since the two countries signed a declaration of nonaggression in 1991. **********If the inspections went ahead smoothly, probably in the next several weeks, the two countries would then meet in Geneva to discuss a ""package deal"" of economic incentives in return for broader inspection rights. For the United States, the most critical inspections involve two nuclear waste dumps that may reveal how much plutonium Mr. Kim's Government has produced. Waste Dumps Not Covered **********But a ""special inspection"" of those sites, which the atomic energy agency has been demanding since early 1993, is not covered in the current talks. North Korea argues that the sites are military locations unrelated to its nuclear program, and that since it has only ""suspended"" its decision last March to pull out of the nonproliferation treaty, it is not bound by any treaty obligations. **********Discussions about conducting a ""special inspection,"" American officials have said, would be part of any talks in Geneva. **********Any evidence that Washington was backing down from its initial stand that the North must agree to full regular inspections as well as the special inspections later could open the Clinton Administration to charges that it is giving in to nuclear blackmail. Critics of the Administration are already arguing that Mr. Clinton is reluctant to back up his declaration of a month ago that North Korea would never be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. Believed to Have Bomb **********American intelligence agencies, in a conclusion disputed by the State Department, concluded recently that Mr. Kim's Government probably has already made at least one bomb. By insisting on regular inspections, the Administration is trying to assure that Mr. Kim does not acquire enough plutonium to build more, but officials concede they are unlikely to find completed weapons. **********At times in his speech today, Mr. Kim sounded a militant note. While calling for an overhaul of the North Korean economy, Mr. Kim also said his country had to strengthen its ""defense power to counter the enemy's moves to provoke war,"" an apparent reference to both the United States and South Korea. **********But amid the usual denunciations of Washington and Seoul, Mr. Kim dealt at length with a new policy to save an economy that his Government admitted last month was in desperate shape. What Mr. Kim described was a new economic structure that sounded much like China's, with its mix of heavy political control and a new emphasis on exports and light industry. **********After years of concentrating on heavy industry and forbidding foreign investment as part of a national philosophy of self-reliance, Mr. Kim endorsed a new agenda established last month at a meeting of the ruling party's Central Committee. Over the next three years, he said, the country must ""implement to the letter the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign-trade policy."" **********He said the greatest emphasis would be placed on developing the coal industry, the power industry and rail transportation. The selection of those three areas is particularly telling. With the country's oil supplies dwindling -- Russia has cut off supplies to North Korea and China is reportedly demanding hard currency -- coal is the only domestically produced source of energy. Reporters visiting the country last year saw armed troops guarding the few piles of coal at major railroad junctions. **********Cars are even scarcer than fuel in North Korea, and the roadbeds for the railroad system are in such poor condition that it takes days to move the length of the country. Much of the track, Japanese officials say, dates to Japan's colonization of Korea in the first half of the century. **********In what may be an effort to placate a populace that by some accounts is growing increasingly restive over shortages of all kinds, Mr. Kim called for ""a great upsurge in the production of consumer goods."" **********""In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation,"" he said."

Since then there has been only uplifting news -- a large investment by Shamrock Holdings Inc. disclosed in May, strong earnings for the company's first quarter ending May 31, the ripple effect of Johnson & Johnson's willingness in August to pay handsomely for the Neutrogena Corporation, a smaller rival, and, yesterday, earnings of 70 cents a share for the second quarter ending Aug. 31, far above the Wall Street mean forecast of 53 cents a share. **********Investors who bought the stock have been rewarded. After rising $1.875 to finish at $36.125 in trading yesterday, the shares are at their highest level in more than a year. But the company still faces doubters on Wall Street who expect the stock to run out of steam long before it breaks $40 unless the entire stock market takes off, pulling Helene Curtis and its rivals along for the ride. **********""The stock is being driven by very short-term factors,"" said Gabriel Lowy, who follows personal-care companies for Oppenheimer & Company. ""They are doing better primarily because they couldn't do worse than last year."" **********Mr. Lowy praises Helene Curtis's production, distribution and brand management skills but figures that the fair price level for the shares is somewhere in the middle to high $20's. He bases his estimate on several factors: the intense competition that Helene Curtis's main products, like Suave shampoo and Degree deodorant, face from huge competitors like Procter & Gamble, the slow growth in overall demand for personal-care products and the growing demands on companies like Helene Curtis to sink money into sophisticated inventory management services and marketing support for major retailers. **********All of those factors, along with dismal results from the introduction of Vibrance shampoos, contributed to slow sales growth and a 40 percent earnings plunge in 1993 that drove the stock to its lows this spring. **********Skeptics say investors should be wary of Helene Curtis's longtime penchant for spending more heavily than competitors on promotions to push sales. That sustains sales growth so the company looks cheap on a market price-to-sales basis, a common way of judging consumer products companies. But even before the stock topped $30 during this summer's climb, Andrew Shore of Paine Webber was warning that the shares were no bargain when their price was compared with operating cash flow or earnings per share. **********Some analysts wonder whether investors have misinterpreted the likely impact of Shamrock's acquisition of 6.5 percent of Helene Curtis's common stock. Shamrock, an investment firm created by Roy Disney, attracted notoriety in the 1980's for stock acquisitions that turned hostile while generating big short-term profits for shareholders. It forced Faberge Inc. into a leveraged buyout, attempted a takeover of the Polaroid Corporation and gained control of the Central Soya Corporation, a soybean processor that it partly dismantled and then sold. **********In this case, though, Shamrock is relying solely on timing for its profits. Helene Curtis is virtually immune from hostile moves by Shamrock or any other outside shareholder because the Gidwitz family owns 99 percent of its B shares, which have 10 votes for every 1 vote of the A shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Shamrock and other fans are betting that Helene Curtis can continue moving forward by expanding internationally -- foreign sales account for a third of its business -- and by expanding successful brands into new areas, as it is doing this year with Suave-branded baby care products. **********""We're a long-term holder,"" said Clifford Miller, Shamrock's managing director. Mr. Miller said he first met Ronald J. Gidwitz, Helene Curtis's chief executive, in early August after receiving an invitation to drop by Helene Curtis's headquarters here when he was next in the neighborhood. ""All we told him was, 'Thanks a lot and keep up the good work,' "" Mr. Miller said."

The Cleveland-based company still expects to report record 1994 net income. **********The charges from selling low-yielding, longer-maturity securities ""will likely result in a pretax loss of up to $100 million spread over the remainder of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995,"" said Jim Wert, Keycorp's chief financial officer. **********Because of the actions, the company expects to recognize a fourth-quarter charge of $25 million to $35 million, or 7 cents to 10 cents a share. **********Keycorp was expected to earn 94 cents a share in the fourth quarter, based on the mean estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Institutional Brokers Estimate System. **********The charges will trim 1994 earnings to between $3.45 a share and $3.50, compared with a Wall Street mean estimate of $3.60 a share. **********The remaining charges of $65 million to $75 million will likely be recognized in the first quarter of 1995, said Victor Riley Jr., chairman and chief executive."

About 37 million workers receive no insurance through their employers and 16 million of them have no coverage at all. **********""This report makes clear that employer-provided health insurance is still the bedrock of America's health care system, but it's ailing,"" Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said when he announced the findings late last month. Not surprisingly, Mr. Reich said the research underscores the ""urgent need"" for health care reform. **********The explanation for the drop in coverage -- cost -- isn't surprising either. Employers are dropping sponsorship of plans and employees are more likely to decline coverage. **********What is most surprising, however, is that the decline appeared at companies of all sizes, not just at the small businesses supposedly at risk of oblivion if, under a new health insurance order, they were required to provide coverage. From 1979 to 1993, coverage in businesses with fewer than 25 employees dropped 2 percentage points, to 31 percent. **********IN companies with more than 100 workers, the comparable decline was 10 percentage points: to 73 percent from 83 percent. Theoretically, the smaller base of smaller companies offering coverage could account for the disparity: There's more room to cut in the big-company category. But apparently it doesn't. ""The lower base accounts for some of it, but it's a pretty significant change,"" said Richard Hinz, director of research and economic analysis at the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, the Labor Department agency that sponsored the research. ""One of the myths is that erosion of coverage is erosion of small-business coverage. In fact, it's across the board."" **********Large companies are still more likely to provide health coverage in retirement. Last year just over half of the companies with more than 1,000 workers made coverage available to retirees, a jump from about a third for businesses of the next-largest size. The startling finding was the proportion of people older than 45 -- 25 percent to 40 percent, depending on company size -- who didn't know if they would be covered, despite the fact that by that age most people have had inklings of mortality. ""That's a remarkable finding,"" Mr. Hinz said. ""The 'don't knows' don't seem to be associated with any particular characteristic."" Of course, perhaps it is better to be oblivious since retiree insurance at many companies may soon go the way of Robespierre's head. **********The report, which is based on questions asked during the Census Department's April 1993 Current Population Survey, provides more detailed information than usual on pensions and health benefits in companies of all sizes around the country.  Women at Risk **********A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute last week suggested that women electrical workers may be at a higher risk for developing breast cancer than women in other jobs. Previous research has indicated a possible connection between exposure to electromagnetic fields and increased risk for certain types of cancers. **********Researchers from the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina compared the death certificates of women exposed to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields -- the kind produced by high-voltage power lines, for example -- and women in nonelectrical jobs. Of 267 cases of women in traditional electrical occupations, 68 had died of breast cancer -- a rate 38 percent higher than expected, the study said. **********The higher mortality rates occurred among women who had worked as electrical engineers, telephone installers, repairers and line workers. The researchers found no ""excess of breast cancer"" among telephone operators, data entry clerks or computer operators and programmers, though they, too, often have more exposure to electricity than other workers. A CREATIVE OUTLOOK ON WELFARE **********IS welfare a dependency that promotes what sociologists used to call ""serial monogamy"" even while it saps the individual's will to work? Or is it a coping strategy poor people use intermittently and rather creatively to stave off disaster? **********Continuing studies from the Institute on Women's Policy Research in Washington suggest the latter. Contradicting the image of the welfare population as inert and irresponsible, the institute found that only one-third of a sample of single mothers on Aid to Families With Dependent Children from 1984 through 1990 relied exclusively on their grants and benefits to get by. Forty percent ""package"" wages from work with grants and benefits to achieve a livable income, either moving back and forth over time between work and welfare or simultaneously combining income from several sources. **********The information that nearly half the single-mother welfare population is working at least part time does not seem to have contaminated the debate on reform, which is no longer about labor force participation but about preventing teen-age pregnancy. The institute's research indicates that a ""two years and you're out"" plan like the one proposed last week by President Clinton would leave most women on welfare at the mercy of the low-wage labor market. ""Dependency,"" in other words, can be a rational choice."

Gen. Sir Michael Rose, the United Nations commander on the ground here, and Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the NATO commander whose air power enforces the existing ultimatum to the Serbs who have besieged Sarajevo for 22 months, began discussing the plans this morning. **********Reports from the field indicated that the Serbs had either pulled back most of their heavy weapons from a 12.4-mile radius of the city or put them under United Nations control, the conditions NATO has imposed with the threat of air strikes. Mostar May Be Next **********The southwestern city of Mostar is a prime candidate as the next site of the ultimatum tactic. For months it has been under a brutal siege, not by Serbs but by Croatian separatists. **********Late last year it became a symbol for the savagery of this war -- in which populations, religious edifices and cultural landmarks are treated as military targets -- when its graceful, beloved Ottoman bridge finally collapsed under shelling. **********Mostar, a senior staff officer said tonight, ""would link in the third element, namely the Croats."" **********There has also been some discussion among United Nations and NATO officials saying that a new drive would be launched in March to open up the airport at the city of Tuzla, where Muslims ousted in fighting in other parts of Bosnia have taken refuge. Like Sarajevo, Tuzla has been surrounded by Serbian forces for months. **********Spurred by widespread outrage over a single mortar shell on a crowded market in central Sarajevo that killed 68 people, NATO ordered the Serbs to remove their artillery, mortars, tanks and rocket launchers within the 10 days that ended at 1 A.M. today. **********After days of niggling negotiations, a face-saving Russian intervention and a frantic deadline struggle with snow-clogged roads, they managed to satisfy United Nations officials. Despite Pullback, Siege Goes On **********Despite the withdrawal of most of the weapons, people here point out that even without the artillery pounding, Sarajevo is still a city under siege, surrounded, its roads blocked, its utilities fitful at best, its economy strangled, its population dependent on meager rations of international aid that gets in by airlift. **********A United Nations spokesman said late this afternoon that ""the last piece of metal"" had been turned in, but in the Serbian-held mountains ringing Sarajevo, eight 120-millimeter mortars were seen standing in open defiance of the NATO threats, flanked by multiple-rocket launchers, antiaircraft guns and other weapons. **********Nevertheless, the NATO military commanders want to move fast to capitalize on the momentum they have gotten in the wake of the market bombing and the world attention focused on the brutal Bosnian war. The General's Evolving Tactics **********Characteristically, General Rose, a former commander of Britain's elite unconventional warfare special air service, has moved fast here to take advantage of changing conditions, improvising tactics as he goes along. **********He is operating under a mandate, he has said, ""whereby I, flying by the seat of my pants, am actually going to be a part of a coherent strategy which links and relates everything together."" **********In the wake of the bombing, he brokered a cease-fire between the Serbs and Bosnians -- still holding after 10 days and bringing a rare calm to this battered city -- then used the threat of NATO air strikes to hammer out plans, constantly evolving, for the withdrawal or turnover of weapons. **********""General Rose believes we can build on the Sarajevo model, and use it in other parts of Bosnia to break the back of this war,"" one of his senior staff officers said today. **********""We've had great success around Sarajevo over the past 10 days,"" the officer said, ""but there's no way to maintain an island of peace in a sea of war."" **********The removal of the heavy weapons that bombarded Sarajevo may drastically change the course of the Bosnian war, provided that surveillance and the threat of future air strikes keep them from returning. **********Bosnian officials have expressed public fears in the last few days that Serbian guns are in hiding or close to their old firing positions. They are also concerned about the presence of the 400 Russian paratroopers who arrived here exchanging the three-finger Orthodox salute with the Serbs, who regard them as saviors and greeted them with bottles of rakia, a potent home-brewed plum brandy. Mood on the Street Is Bitter **********In contrast to the heady mood at the United Nations command, the mood on the street here was one of bitter disappointment that there had been no air raids. Pounded by shelling for 22 months, many people waited up all night -- ""as if it were Christmas Eve,"" said one -- to see the Serbs finally punished. **********To them, the quiet passing of the deadline was another betrayal. **********""We had hoped for intervention,"" said Mehmed Husic, a columnist for the daily paper Oslobodjenje. ""Now we don't expect anything from anybody. We are sad and feel lonesome."" **********The people selling chunks of wood for the sheet tin stoves that provide warmth here, their bundles perched on sleds in the snow in front of the indoor market, shrugged glumly when asked about the situation. **********""Its too bad there was no intervention,"" said a man who collected his wood during his stints as a front-line soldier in the hills above the city. ""Maybe it will happen someday."""

The bigger question is whether the governing party will win a majority in the new 250-seat Parliament. **********Renamo is stronger in the north, where it feeds on regional resentment of the more southern-oriented Government, and where the Government is vilified for bombing attacks against the rebels that often hit civilians. Renamo also has strong support from tribal leaders whom Frelimo scorned as relics of the past. **********The election may be less a verdict on the candidates than on the Western countries that have made Mozambique, as the United Nations special representative here put it, ""a kind of political laboratory."" **********The special representative, Aldo Ajello, speaks of Mozambique as a chance to make amends for past United Nations failures like Angola, where a hasty election collapsed back into civil war when the loser refused to accept defeat. **********So far, Mozambique has been mostly successes. **********The United Nations brokered a cease-fire between the war-weary combatants that has held for two years under the watch of 7,000 peacekeeping troops. It demobilized more than 75,000 combatants and paid them to go home. It helped bring home most of the 1.5 million refugees, who have since replanted a fertile country. It helped register 6 million voters, and has deployed enough observers that most expect the election to be reasonably fair. **********But even two years of peace have not erased the fear of war, and many worry what will happen when the foreign peacekeepers pull out, which they are expected to do by January. **********Mr. Dhlakama, while insisting he would never go back to war, has repeatedly declared that only fraud could deny him victory and that he would not necessarily accept the verdict of foreign election monitors. **********""I have already won,"" he asserted in a recent campaign speech. If he was cheated of victory, he told reporters on another occasion, ""we won't return to war, but we won't recognize the result."" **********A new, joint army composed of 30,000 former rivals was supposed to be one bulwark of the peace, but only 10,000 soldiers volunteered for the low-paid duty, leaving thousands of men at large and unemployed in a country still awash in unsurrendered weapons. The police force is inadequate and notoriously brutal. **********Mr. Ajello and other Westerners say the real danger is not renewed war but wide-scale banditry, which has already plagued many regions. **********All of this conjures uneasy comparisons with Angola, which is now the last great bleeding wound in the remarkably orderly southern end of the continent. **********But if Mozambique is not South Africa, most agree is not Angola either. The weariness of war is palpable, among civilians and former combatants alike. **********Dennis Jett, the American Ambassador here, noted that all the neighboring governments that once aided the rebels -- from South Africa, Rhodesia and Malawi -- have been swept aside by free elections. **********""For the first time in history, Mozambique is surrounded by democratic governments,"" he said. After suffering Mozambique's refugees and the cut-off of access routes to the Indian Ocean, he added, all the neighbors are ""desperate to see peace and prosperity here."" **********Above all, said Mr. Ajello, the Mozambicans know that unless they cement the peace, they will lose all hope of the Western aid and investment the country desperately needs. **********""If they lose this chance, the donor countries will switch off the television, and they will not see Mozambique any more,"" he said."

But the activists, stung by a rare defeat, say they are likely to concentrate now on restricting or banning all cigarette advertising, not just Camel's. **********Reaction to the decision involving Joe Camel -- the most recognized, and demonized, figure in tobacco marketing -- was somewhat muted yesterday because commission members refused to confirm widespread reports that they had voted, 3 to 2, not to pursue a complaint against the character. **********The complaint, filed in 1991 by the Coalition on Smoking or Health, asserted the character was unfairly aimed at persuading children to smoke. It is estimated that the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which has marketed Camel since 1913, spends upward of $75 million a year on the brand, the nation's eighth largest. **********""This certainly ought to be the end of the opposition to Joe Camel,"" said William G. Brown Jr., the president of Mezzina/Brown Inc., the New York agency that has handled the creative portion of the Camel account since October 1991. **********""I personally hope this sends a signal to the anti-smoking industry and self-interested politicians,"" he added. **********Anti-smoking groups have declared Joe Camel emblematic of all they perceive as objectionable about cigarette sales pitches. They contend the character, based loosely on Old Joe, the drawing on Camel packages, tells young people that smoking is fun-filled and pleasurable. **********Joe Camel, a caricatured, anthropomorphic camel with an oversized nose, was created by a British artist in 1974 for a French ad campaign that sought to imbue the venerable brand with a more contemporary image. The character, introduced in this country in 1988, wears T-shirts, leather jackets, sunglasses and other garb intended to impart ""smooth character,"" the campaign theme. **********""There has never been any attempt to have that appeal to children,"" Mr. Brown said, ""and there is no appeal to children."" **********Scott D. Ballin, chairman of the coalition, which represents the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association, disagreed. **********""Joe Camel blatantly targets children and encourages them to take up smoking,"" he said. ""The F.T.C. has shirked its responsibility to protect consumers."" **********The coalition now plans to push the commission to rule favorably ""on other petitions we have pending,"" such as one on cigarette ads aimed at women, he said, adding that it will also advocate ""a much broader view that all cigarette advertising is inherently unfair because the product is addictive and not safe."" **********And a third strategy, Mr. Ballin said, is to lobby for cigarettes to be treated as a drug, ""giving the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products, including advertising and marketing, because if that happened, Joe Camel would be taking a hike."" **********One anti-smoking activist, however, was not displeased. **********""If the commission had banned Joe Camel, it would have gotten us into the realm of prohibition,"" said Dr. Alan Blum, founder and chairman of Doctors Ought to Care in Houston. ""And ridicule is a much more potent weapon than prohibition."" **********Dr. Blum, whose organization sponsors countercampaigns that mock tobacco ads, complained that the ""obsessive cries on our side that 'Joe Camel must go' "" have meant ""we forgot the Marlboro man"" -- the symbol of Marlboro cigarettes, the nation's, and world's, top-selling brand. **********An article in the June 21 issue of Financial World magazine suggests that market forces may have harmed Camel, and Marlboro, far more than any strictures against advertising. **********The article attempts to place values on cigarette brands based on criteria like sales and earnings. It reports that the dislocations in the tobacco industry since April 1993, when the Philip Morris Companies slashed Marlboro prices to stem sales losses to cheaper brands, have significantly reduced the values of so-called premium brands: Camel fell 69.6 percent last year, to $1.6 billion, while Marlboro fell 27.1 percent, to $33 billion. **********The F.T.C.'s apparent decision ran counter to a recommendation by the commission staff last year. It was welcomed by trade organizations for the advertising and marketing industries, which have stoutly defended the Joe Camel campaign on free-speech grounds. **********Wallace S. Snyder, the president of the American Advertising Federation in Washington, said that Reynolds's apparent victory was important because ""anti-smoking groups saw Joe Camel as very symbolic, an icon to knock down."" **********Still, he added, ""I don't think this is going to stop them."" **********The apparent decision might reduce the rhetoric on both sides of the Joe Camel issue. For instance, when Mezzina/Brown recently reintroduced female camels in ads set in a bar called Joe's Place, anti-smoking activists fumed that dromedary dames, or ""Josephine Camels,"" were becoming Joe's consorts. **********Actually, the change seemed intended to fix previous bar-themed ads, filled with male Joe Camels dressed as cowboys, motorcyclists and construction workers. In other words, they looked to be advertising a reunion of the Village People rather than cigarettes."

That amounted to a 15 percent gain in the peso's value on the day. **********With trading thin everywhere in the week between Christmas and New Year's, movements in all financial markets were as exaggerated on the way up as they were on the way down. **********But the change in direction resulted from the first clear sign that the Mexican government was prepared to take painful measures to defuse the crisis. **********That came in Wednesday morning's auction of 28-day Treasury bills, known as Cetes, which set the wholesale cost of money for banks. With demand weak from frightened investors, prices fell and interest rates were bid up to 31 percent, roughly double the rates before last week's devaluation of the peso set off the current crisis. **********Later in the day, traders pushed up same-day rates to to 34 percent, a premium intended to keep money from flowing out of pesos into dollars. Interbank rates were close to 40 percent. **********This show of determination to hang on to capital heartened the Mexican stock exchange, which gained more than 60 points, or almost 3 percent, on the peso's rebound. **********Investors in other Latin American markets also seemed to get the message. Rising Mexican stocks were about the only strong play on Wall Street, and markets in Brazil, Argentina and Peru began recovering from this week's panic, although Argentina's dropped back after the central bank reported record dollar outflows. **********Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo of Argentina flew to New York for talks with officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was expected to talk about arranging a credit line like Mexico's. **********Any Mexican rescue package would have to strike a careful balance, with enough domestic austerity to underpin the peso and satisfy the foreign investors who finance Mexico's growth but not enough austerity to anger Mexican workers."

Perry was picked in January to replace Les Aspin as Defense Secretary, the engineer and high-technology entrepreneur was billed as just the man to manage the Pentagon. **********But a Defense Secretary always wears two hats, that of manager and foreign-policy strategist. And while the crisp approach he brings to running the Pentagon has been applauded as an antidote to Mr. Aspin's rambling style, Mr. Perry's recent comments on Bosnia have raised questions about how well he is fitting into his second role. **********Today the President's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, went out of his way to erase a perception created by Mr. Perry that the United States was unwilling to use force to protect a besieged Muslim town in eastern Bosnia.  State vs. Defense **********In an effort on Sunday to clarify Administration policy on Bosnia with mathematical precision, Mr. Perry had painted the White House into a corner. In a television appearance, he stated that the United States would not use military force to prevent Gorazde, which the United Nations Security Council had promised to protect, from falling into Serbian hands. **********While the State Department had wanted to keep open the option of using air power to protect Gorazde, Mr. Perry had all but shut the door. While the State Department had wanted to keep its cards close to the vest, Mr. Perry wanted to put his on the table. **********The end result has been confusion about Washington's Bosnia policy, which Mr. Lake tried to dispel today. Math Major as Policy-Maker **********""One question is whether precision is useful,"" said Charles William Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy. ""Another is whether it should be publicly expressed. I think it is a mistake for the United States and any great country to say that it won't use force. It could embolden people to do things we do not want them to do."" **********Mr. Perry, 66, is an intelligent, erudite official. After serving with the army occupation force in Japan after World War II, he earned a Ph.D. in mathematics. During the Carter Administration, he ran the weapons-development arm of the Pentagon. **********Lawmakers have praised Mr. Perry's direct style and his acumen in discussing budget issues, and senior generals and admirals say they are impressed with his businesslike efficiency and decisiveness. **********But in his new post, Mr. Perry must not only help the Pentagon develop new weapons, but also shape the policies for using them. And that has raised the question whether the soft-spoken Pentagon chief is equipped to make military force and the threat to use it relevant to diplomacy in the post-cold-war world. **********In addressing Bosnia, Mr. Perry is dealing with a complex issue. **********Earlier this year, the United States joined other members of the Security Council in declaring Sarajevo, Gorazde and four other besieged Muslim towns to be ""safe areas."" The enclaves were to be protected by United Nations troops who in turn could be protected through use of air power. **********And on Aug. 9, NATO passed an important resolution warning the Serbs that they faced NATO air strikes if the ""strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues."" **********But in a recent speech and in his appearance Sunday on NBC, Mr. Perry recast the issue in a way that reflected the military's anxiety about being drawn into the Bosnia conflict but which overlooked the Security Council and NATO resolutions, which Washington had supported. **********Asked whether the United States would prevent the fall of Gorazde, Mr. Perry said Washington ""would not enter the war to stop that from happening."" **********Pentagon officials said the Defense Secretary was merely trying to be precise about the limits of American power and to avoid raising the Bosnian Government's expectations that Washington would help the Muslims recover lost territory. **********But the comments led to criticism of both the substance of what was said and the wisdom of saying it. What Perry May Have Done **********State Department officials worry that Mr. Perry has prejudged the Administration's options, inadvertently encouraged the Serbs to pursue their tank and artillery offensive on Gorazde, undercut Washington's efforts to use diplomatic pressure against the Serbs and deviated from commitments by the United Nations to protect the ""safe areas."" **********By Monday, the White House was trying to push open the door that Mr. Perry had begun to close, an effort that culminated in Mr. Lake's speech. **********One former general observed about a previous Defense Secretary: ""Dick Cheney knew the utility of studied ambiguity. He kept the adversary guessing. But Perry is too honest a man. He goes out and speaks his mind when he should be giving a Cheshire cat smile."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/09/business/worldbusiness/IHT-media-markets-papers-for-homelesswho-benefits.html,Thomas Crampton,1994-11-09,"Special to the International Herald Tribune.To hear Jean-Claude Boulard tell it, newspapers sold all over France by the homeless are in it for the profit..""I think they are newspapers that exploit human misery,"" said Mr. Boulard, a city offi",5166,,International Herald Tribune,Business Day,,article,MEDIA MARKETS : Papers for Homeless:Who Benefits?,MEDIA MARKETS : Papers for Homeless:Who Benefits?," **********Special to the International Herald Tribune **********To hear Jean-Claude Boulard tell it, newspapers sold all over France by the homeless are in it for the profit. **********""I think they are newspapers that exploit human misery,"" said Mr. Boulard, a city official in Le Mans. **********In little more than a year, the newspapers sold by the homeless in France have, according to their own figures, grown into an industry that generates revenue of about 100 million francs ($19 million) a year. It is an industry that, contrary to public perception, is dominated by very private, and probably very profitable, companies. **********In September, newspapers that are said to help persons sans domicile fixe - the French expression for homeless - sold more than 900,000 copies in France. **********While their circulation is close to the sales levels of established French newsmagazines, the autumn is the slow season for these publications. Reports of the homeless freezing to death this winter, the newspapers predict, will almost certainly boost circulation to well over a million a month. **********Most of these papers sell for 10 francs, 6 francs of which is retained by the vendor. **********There is little dispute that those 6 francs have helped a great many people through tough times. But no one seems to know, or will say, what happens to the other 4 francs. **********""I don't think many people know the reality of these papers,"" said Mr. Boulard. ""In the name of helping others, exploitation can happen."" **********Sophie Crépon, editor-in-chief of Le Réverbère, a Paris-based newspaper sold by the homeless, disagreed. ""Since the paper-sellers earn 5 or 6 francs per issue,"" she said, ""I do not think we exploit these people. Our paper allows them to house themselves and take care of themselves."" **********In a study of the newspapers, Julien Damon, who works with the homeless at Mission Solidarité SNCF, said their profit margins appeared to be high but that there was little evidence that either of the two largest-selling ones - Macadam Journal and Le Réverbère - had put much money back into helping the homeless. **********Macadam Journal says it gives money back to the homeless by hiring former vendors to run distribution depots and that it offers free legal advice to vendors. **********""We also direct people to the institutions that help the homeless,"" said Martine Vanden Driessche, publisher and editor-in-chief of Macadam Journal. Le Réverbère has a long-standing, but unrealized, project to renovate a barge to house the homeless. **********Most analysts draw a distinction between papers that are nonprofit institutions set up to help the homeless and those that are there to make money. Mr. Damon and Mr. Boulard point to La Rue as an example of a newspaper that works with many associations that help the homeless. **********""La Rue is different. It is really controlled by people who work with the unemployed,"" Mr. Boulard said. ""With the other newspapers we have no idea what happens. The monitoring of the profits is very uncertain."" **********In response to questions raised in the mainstream French press about these newspapers, La Rue drafted a code of ethics for street newspapers. **********The guidelines include financial transparency and setting up the company as an Entreprise d'Insertion, which means that government grants pay for several jobs at the paper intended to bring the homeless in from the margins of society. **********But Macadam Journal and Le Réverbère both sneer at La Rue for accepting government handouts. **********""We want to prove that the homeless can really create and run a real company, with no outside help,"" Mrs. Vanden Driessche of Macadam Journal said. Mrs. Vanden Driessche has never been homeless herself. Her company, MVD Publications SA, took over Macadam Journal after the paper's initial success. **********After just 18 months of existence, Macadam Journal now sells 550,000 copies a month, distributed for sale by the homeless from more than 40 depots across France. Le Réverbère's success is no less remarkable. Its first issue sold out. **********Georges Mathis, a former homeless person, founded the newspaper by getting a printer to advance him the cost of 20,000 papers. ""It took off right away,"" Ms. Crépon, the editor-in-chief, said. ""Two months earlier, Macadam was born, which created enthusiasm in the media and assured the paper a good deal of publicity."" Réverbère now sells 300,000 copies a month. **********After huge circulation increases for all the newspapers last winter, the bad publicity began. At Macadam Journal, a dispute erupted between Jacques Chamut, the paper's founder, and Mrs. Vanden Driessche. Not long afterwards, Infomatin, a French daily, raised questions about where the money raised by Réverbère and Macadam Journal was going. **********According to Mr. Damon, this competition between newspapers for the homeless covering the same territory is unique. Profit margins are high, he said, because the papers hire a skeleton staff and pay free-lance fees for all articles. Le Réverbère has five full-time employees; Macadam Journal has 23."

W. de Klerk, who approved a request from the Independent Electoral Commission for the extension, said more election monitors would be sent to the six regions, and votes cast there on Friday, as well as in all areas were irregularities have been reported, will be kept separate when ballots are counted. **********Judge Johann Kriegler, the head of the electoral commission, said the group was ""satisfied that because of its difficulties in provisioning those areas, the voters there have not had a fair and free opportunity to express their views."" **********Although Judge Kriegler did not spell out the scale of the problem since voting began on Tuesday, millions of voters have turned out only to find a shortage or an absence of ballot papers. Some polling stations had exhausted their supplies of invisible ink, which were applied to voters' hands to try to prevent people from casting more than one ballot. Other sites lacked electricity or the lamps under which people placed their hands to be examined. **********Ballot counting, originally planned to start on Friday, will now begin at 6 A.M. on Saturday. It was not immediately clear whether the extra day of polling would delay the inauguration of the president of the country's first black-led government, a ceremony scheduled for May 10. **********The areas affected by the voting extension are KwaZulu, a predominately Zulu area and the political stronghold of Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party here in Natal; Venda, Gazankulu and Lebowa in the Northern Transvaal, and the former nominally independent homelands of Transkei and Ciskei in the Eastern Cape region. **********Natal has been the main arena of conflict between the country's dominant black-led party, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, and Mr. Buthelezi's Inkatha party, which boycotted the election until two weeks ago. Of the more than 3,000 blacks killed last year in political violence, nearly 2,000 died in Natal. To Insure Every Vote **********The decision to extend the voting seemed to serve three purposes. **********It provided yet another opportunity for voters who, because of administrative errors or incompetence, had not been able to vote. It served to help persuade leaders of Inkatha and their supporters that the Government and the A.N.C. had gone the last mile to assure that every possible vote was counted. **********And even if Inkatha or others challenged the fairness of the balloting, the extension -- a show of good faith -- gave the Government and the A.N.C. a basis for winning support from Inkatha supporters and the rest of the world. **********Earlier Mr. Mandela, who is expected to become South Africa's next president, urged election officials to consider an extra day of voting. He said it was clear to them that there had been ""massive sabotage"" during the three-day election. Mr. Mandela also said that polling stations in black rural areas, many of them desolate tracts that are hard to reach, had not been as well organized as those areas where white and mixed-race voters gathered.  Responds to Challenge **********Reacting to Mr. Mandela's comments, President de Klerk initially voiced strong reservations about extending the voting period to Friday, saying up to 95 percent of those who wanted to vote had done so. He also called upon Mr. Mandela to substantiate his claim that there had been widespread ballot-tampering. **********Apparently in response to Mr. de Klerk's challenge, Carl Niehaus, the A.N.C.'s chief spokesman, later backed away from Mr. Mandela's assertion that the voting had been rigged, calling it ""an expression of frustration."" **********""We have no reason to believe that there is massive sabotage,"" Mr. Niehaus said. **********But the electoral commission suspended several of its officials in the southern city of Port Elizabeth after the police said they had found officials sifting through ballot papers.  'People Were Tampering' **********""The ballot boxes were open,"" said Col. Chris Martiz, a police spokesman. ""The seals were broken and I.E.C. people were tampering with the ballot papers."" The police did not release the names of the officials nor did they say how many were involved. **********According to election monitors, there were far fewer people waiting in line at polling stations today than there were on Wednesday, when huge columns of people, some several miles long, waited for hours to vote. **********Election officials worked through the night printing millions of extra ballot papers, and today South African Air Force planes and helicopters rushed them to polling stations. Photographers and election monitors were dispatched to issue hundreds of thousands of temporary identity cards to voters. **********Efforts to distribute voting materials were given added impetus when Chief Buthelezi hinted that he might take the drastic step of pulling Inkatha out of the elections if the long lines at voting booths and the ballot irregularities persisted. **********The Inkatha leader objected, in particular, to the suggestion that his supporters -- the bulk of whom are believed to be illiterate -- could simply write the party's name on the bottom of their ballots if stickers carrying the party's name were not available. **********For much of the night the Inkatha leader met with election officials. He emerged early this morning to say that he had accepted an understanding with the commission to provide additional specially printed ballot papers, which would include Inkatha's name, and extra workers in KwaZulu. On-the-Spot Education **********At one Natal voting site near here, election workers were having to conduct on-the-spot voter education because it had been ignored during Inkatha's boycott. There was a huge backlog and Jayaseelan Naidoo, a senior A.N.C. official, told Reuters that he and other polling officials were showing first-time voters how to mark an ""X"" on ballots. **********Election officials have acknowledged that they badly underestimated the number of potential South African voters. On Wednesday, Judge Kriegler ordered the printing of 9.3 million additional ballots. He also asked the police to investigation the distribution system to insure that ballot materials had not been tampered with. **********Shortly after polls closed Wednesday night, men with automatic rifles attacked a polling station in Umlazi, a black township on the outskirts of Durban. No one was hurt in the attack, which followed an election bombing campaign blamed on white extremists opposed to black majority rule. The bombs have killed 21 people and wounded scores. The death toll in political violence since Sunday, when the bombs claimed their first victims, is 34."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/08/business/media-business-advertising-seeing-something-mine-venerable-bromo-seltzer-brand.html,Stuart Elliott,1994-07-08,,775,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Seeing something to mine in the venerable Bromo Seltzer brand.,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Seeing something to mine in the venerable Bromo Seltzer brand.," **********AN entrepreneur who specializes in reviving flagging products is hoping to put the fizz back into the moribund Bromo Seltzer brand. **********Jeffrey S. Himmel, who with his father, Martin, rejuvenated neglected ""ghost"" brands like Doan's Pills, Porcelana fade cream and Lavoris mouthwash, and is now working to resurrect Ovaltine and Gold Bond medicated powder, is acquiring the rights to Bromo Seltzer from Warner Wellcome Consumer Healthcare. **********The terms of the long-term licensing agreement, which took effect last Friday, were not disclosed. **********Warner Wellcome was recently formed by the Warner-Lambert Company, the longtime owner of Bromo Seltzer, and Burroughs Wellcome, as a vehicle to market their largest, best-selling consumer brands. That description has not fit Bromo Seltzer, an effervescent antacid and analgesic sold in granulated form since the days when a bottle of Coca-Cola cost a nickel and the Dodgers played doubleheaders in Brooklyn. **********Once so powerful a product that ""Gimme a Bromo"" entered the vernacular, Bromo Seltzer's popularity has plunged as shoppers turned to antacids in liquid and tablet formulations. The brand and similar products with sodium bicarbonate formulas like Alka-Seltzer, Bisodol and Brioschi have also suffered from the shift to more moderate life styles by consumers. They are eschewing products marketed as relieving hangovers and other vestiges of overindulgence. (""Eat too much? Drink too much? Take Brioschi, take Brioschi,"" that brand's jingle advised.) **********Last year, sales of Bromo Seltzer, which was developed in 1888, were as tiny as a bubble in a glass of water fizzing with the product. At about $1.7 million, they were roughly one-hundredth of what a leading brand like Maalox, Mylanta, Pepto-Bismol or Tums now sells. **********That made Bromo Seltzer too small for its giant parent's attention, a fate that has befallen scores of other once-puissant brands, from Brylcreem hair dressing to Aqua Velva aftershave to Chase & Sanborn coffee. They have become increasingly difficult to market as retailers grow reluctant to stock slow sellers that contribute to the clutter on their shelves. **********""Brands get neglected because they're too small,"" Mr. Himmel said in a telephone interview yesterday. He is chairman and chief executive of the New York-based Himmel Group and chairman of its parent, Himmel Holdings Inc. **********""But brands don't exist for 106 years if they don't have something going for them,"" he added. ""We want to tap into that equity and heritage."" **********Those intangibles include fond memories of a time when the blue glass Bromo Seltzer bottle was a fixture in pantries and medicine cabinets across America. Advertising for the brand included radio commercials that began with a piercing train whistle followed by an insistent male chorus chanting the words ""Bromo Seltzer!"" -- imitating the sound of a train hurtling along the tracks. A Bromo Seltzer tower still looms over downtown Baltimore. **********But Mr. Himmel said he realized the arduous nature of his rescue efforts and recognized that nostalgia alone would not bring back Bromo. **********""In many ways, it's a product ahead of its time,"" he said, because unlike products like original Alka-Seltzer, which combine sodium bicarbonate with aspirin, Bromo Seltzer combines it with acetaminophen, the ingredient found in analgesics like Tylenol that is usually gentler on the gastrointestinal tract. **********""That gives Bromo Seltzer a point of differentiation,"" Mr. Himmel said, ""and a story to tell."" **********Mr. Himmel will tell that story in the trademark family style. As the top executives of a Himmel Group predecessor company, Jeffrey Martin Inc., Mr. Himmel and his father, who died in 1991, gave tired old brands a treatment of heavy doses of broadcast advertising featuring no-nonsense consumer testimonials. The commercials, produced in-house, run most often in the cheaper wee hours of the broadcast day. **********""Frequency is the Holy Grail of our business,"" Mr. Himmel said, adding, ""We'll follow the pattern of investing heavily in radio and television commercials at a level very disproportionate to our market share."" **********While Mr. Himmel declined to discuss figures, his ad spending last year for Ovaltine, which he markets through a license granted by the Sandoz Nutrition Corporation in 1992, totaled about $8 million. Sales of Ovaltine have doubled to $26 million, he said, and its market share has also doubled, to 22 percent. **********""As a brand builds,"" Mr. Himmel said, ""we'll take the profits and reinvest them in more advertising, gradually but nonstop."" His goal for Bromo Seltzer is for sales to reach $50 million or more in the next five years. **********""This may be taking a brand from the graveyard,"" he concluded, whistling metaphorically, if not literally."

As for this particular exercise, many of the marines looked upon it as just another day in the Marine Corps, where, quite often, training is the first thing you do after breakfast. **********""It's what we get paid for,"" said Staff Sgt. Natalio Rodriguez of Fresno, Calif. **********For Lieut. Col. Rick Barry, a veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf war and commander of the parent unit of marines who landed today from the amphibious assault ship Tripoli, the exercise was a matter of prudence. **********""How do you know they're backing up for sure?"" Colonel Barry asked, referring to the Iraqi Republican Guards of President Saddam Hussein. ""It could be a trick. He could redeploy as soon as we stop our deployment. I think you have to follow the safe option and continue to deploy."" **********Following the same logic, the Clinton Administration said on Wednesday that it was going to continue its rapid buildup in the gulf, raising the size of the American force in the region from just under 4,000 troops now to possibly 30,000 over the next week to 10 days. American military officers here will not say just where the troops are going to be assigned or what they will be doing. **********Until today, the American units had kept mainly out of sight. But the marines in the exercise not only landed before an army of international photographers and reporters, but their formation of helicopters also pointedly flew past the banks of glass and concrete towers of offices, apartments and hotel rooms along Kuwait City's elegant waterfront. **********Part of the idea, said Lieut. Hal E. Pittman of the Navy, was ""to let the Kuwaiti people know we are here, we are visible and we are ready to go."" **********But the Kuwaitis have already relaxed considerably since last weekend, when they learned, along with the rest of the world, that Mr. Hussein had massed more than 70,000 Iraqi troops within a few miles of their northern border and seemed poised for a repeat of his 1990 invasion. **********These days there are no signs of heightened security precautions. There are no roadblocks or extra patrols on the streets. The high-intensity lights that sparkle along Kuwait City's broad boulevards and the marquees of its luxurious marble and gilt hotels burn through the night. Expensive restaurants are doing well, as usual, and the shopping malls that feature designer clothes and jewelry from Europe and the United States are crowded. **********""Nothing is going to happen,"" said Mohammed al-Saad, a 20-year-old teacher, as he lounged in the passenger seat of his friend's burgundy Corvette the other evening in front of a downtown hotel. **********The owner of the car, Saad al-Aber, the son of a wealthy businessman, sat behind the wheel. ""We're not afraid anymore,"" he said, ""because there are many soldiers here -- American and Kuwaiti -- and the whole world is standing with Kuwait."" **********As the marines touched down in the desert this morning, clouds of fine, tawny sand billowed around their helicopters. Crouching in firing position, they watched as the aircraft lifted back into the sky. **********Then, bent under their packs, they made their way to a firing range, where they maneuvered back and forth against rows of olive-drab silhouettes of enemy soldiers. While most of the marines worked with their automatic M-16 rifles, some laced the targets with machine-gun fire, and a few others fired anti-tank missiles with thudding explosions. **********Only 125 marines took part in the exercise. But, Colonel Barry said, that did not diminish it as a show of force. ""It's not the numbers,"" he said, ""so much as showing the capability and the ability."" **********The patch of desert the marines occupied today could not have been more symbolically chosen. It skirts a stretch of highway where United States bombers pummeled a convoy of retreating Iraqi soldiers in 1991 in one of the biggest single defeats the Iraqis suffered in the gulf war. Hundreds of trucks and jeeps and tanks were destroyed, and scores of Iraqi soldiers died. **********Colonel Barry said that as far as he knew, the Kuwaiti Government chose the site of the exercise because of its firing range and because it is near the coast and only about 25 miles north of Kuwait City. **********""But,"" he said, ""it's not a bad idea at all to say, 'Look, we're back where you guys bought the farm.'

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/world/ethnic-war-lacerates-former-soviet-resort-area.html,Raymond Bonner,1994-06-08,,1375,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Ethnic War Lacerates Former Soviet Resort Area,Ethnic War Lacerates Former Soviet Resort Area," **********In the Soviet era, one of the favored spas of the Communist elite was the Georgian province of Abkhazia, where the cragged range of the Caucasus, snow-covered most of the year, lies within sight of mile after mile of Black Sea beaches. **********The land now lies in ruins. At hillside homes with sweeping views, artillery shells collapsed the roofs, and looters followed. Downtown, buildings are charred skeletons. Luxury beach-front hotels are empty hulks. **********The province's Georgians, who once made up nearly half the population, have been killed or have fled, and there is an eerie emptiness to this capital, where heavily armed men in mufti roam the streets. **********Sukhumi has become the ghostly symbol of another brutal ethnic war, one in which Abkhazian separatists claim a victory the world does not recognize. **********""We're de facto independent,"" Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Abkhazian Parliament, said in a recent interview. Mr. Ardzinba, who only a few years ago was a hard-line Communist, is determined that Georgians never again dominate Abkhazia. Russia's Role Crucial **********But Georgia believes that Abkhazia must return to the fold, and is looking to other countries for help. In the end, just about everyone agrees that Russia will determine Abkhazia's future, just as it was Russia that contributed to the upheaval. **********So far, no one has recognized Abkhazia's independence, because other countries take the position that Georgia's territorial integrity is to be respected. **********This position rests on the fear that if borders can be changed by force, there will be even more separatist bloodshed in the new world disorder. To Georgia's south, in Azerbaijan, the ethnically Armenian province of Nagorno-Karabakh has been fighting a long and bloody war to secede. **********Whether the rest of the world will actually do anything to enforce the principle of territorial integrity is uncertain, if not unlikely. Like ethnic disputes elsewhere in the world, the question of whose land this originally was depends on how far back in history one goes. But during nearly two centuries of Russian domination of Abkhazia, first by the czars and then the Communists, it became a multiethnic community. **********""Many nationalities lived here -- Georgians, Abkhazians, Armenians, Greeks, Russians,"" said Natella Akaba, deputy chairman of Abkhazia's commission on human rights and interethnic relations. ""We lived in peace.""  After Soviets, Nationalism **********Then came the collapse of the Soviet Union and the unleashing of nationalist forces. **********In Abkhazia, a movement for greater autonomy met the radical nationalism of Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's first post-Soviet head of state, who preached ""Georgia for the Georgians."" **********After Mr. Gamsakhurdia was ousted in January 1992, the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, sought an accommodation with the Abkhazian separatists. But Mr. Shevardnadze did not control the men with the guns -- he still does not -- and in August 1992, his Defense Minister, Tengiz Kitovani, invaded Abkhazia without Mr. Shevardnadze's approval. **********Georgian troops, joined by paramilitary gangs, engaged in wholesale looting, rape and killing. Cease-fires were broken, and skirmishing continued until September 1993, when Abkhazian forces opened a major offensive. This time they had outside support. **********Western diplomats and military officials -- in Tbilisi, in Moscow and in neighboring countries -- say Russians supplied the Abkhazians with weapons, tanks and money, and helped plan operations. Russian border commanders also allowed thousands of mercenaries from other Caucasus republics to cross into Abkhazia. **********It is not clear who in Moscow authorized the intervention, but most Western diplomats believe that it was the hard-liners in the Russian military. The diplomats note that the Abkhazian attack came at the very time that President Boris N. Yeltsin was under siege from conservatives holed up in the Russian Parliament. **********After the Abkhazians drove the Georgian forces from the land, it was their turn to rape, pillage and plunder to exact their revenge, adding to the devastation. Interview With Ardzinba **********In recent weeks, Mr. Ardzinba, the Abkhazian leader, has appeared more conciliatory, saying Georgians are welcome back, except those who took part in the war. He also appeared to strike a more moderate stance when he said that while Abkhazia wanted complete independence, it would consider a confederation with Georgia. **********In the interview, Mr. Ardzinba, 49, a dapper man who was wearing a pin-striped suit, white shirt and a tie with flags of the nations of the world, spoke eloquently about democracy, capitalism, the need to protect minority rights and even protecting Abkhazia's environment. **********But his outward charm, diplomats say, masks a steely determination to maintain Abkhazian dominance in an independent state. **********""He is dead set on independence, and in order to get it he will lie, he will cheat, he will do anything,"" a senior diplomat said. ""He pretends he's negotiating. In my view he's buying time. He's assessing how the winds are blowing in Moscow, and right now they are blowing in his favor. His supporters are out of prison."" **********The diplomat was referring to Aleksandr V. Rutskoi and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, who staged the uprising against Mr. Yeltsin in October. Mr. Ardzinba, who joined the Communist Party when he was 22, is also close to the Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. Cease-Fires Violated **********Another diplomat said Mr. Ardzinba ""has broken every agreement he has ever signed,"" including several cease-fires, and noted that in early April, when Abkhazian officials were in Moscow negotiating an agreement for the return of the refugees, Abkhazian troops were engaged in operations to clean a small ethnic Georgian subgroup out of its villages. **********Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Ardzinba have both requested a United Nations peacekeeping force, but they hold different views of what the troops' role should be. **********Mr. Ardzinba wants the peacekeepers stationed only along the Inguri River, Abkhazia's border with the rest of Georgia; in any other part of the country, he says, they will be considered an occupation force. **********Mr. Shevardnadze wants peacekeepers deployed throughout Abkhazia so it will be safe for Georgians to return under the refugee agreement. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here agrees, saying that without a neutral force, it will not be possible for the refugees to go back to their homes. **********In early February, several thousand Georgian refugees tried to return to their villages in the Gali region. They were met with violence. Exactly what happened is not known, because the Abkhazian officials refused to allow the small United Nations monitoring team that is based in Sukhumi to travel to Gali. **********""He has not carried out the most complete ethnic cleansing in recent history to let them back,"" a senior diplomat said. In terms of numbers killed, the carnage in the former Yugoslavia was far worse, of course, but the Abkhazians, he said, have succeeded in getting rid of virtually the entire population from its territory. **********[ On May 14, the Georgians and Abkhazians signed an agreement in Moscow that calls for a cease-fire and the stationing of troops from the Commonwealth of Independent States, under Russian command, along the Inguri River. **********[ Western diplomats say they doubt that the agreement will lead to a settlement and consider it generally a victory for the Abkhazians and Russians. Georgia wants United Nations, not Russian troops, but Russia has asked the United Nations Security Council to deploy the commonwealth force, and approval is expected. ] **********Though it has said it will not send American troops, the Clinton Administration has offered to pay part of the costs of a United Nations peacekeeping operation. But the United States and the United Nations have said there can be no peacekeeping operation until Georgia and Abkhazia reach a political settlement. **********""That means that Ardzinba has a veto forever,"" a European diplomat said. **********The only way there will be any change in the situation in Abkhazia, diplomats agree, is if Russia puts pressure on Mr. Ardzinba. At the moment, that is not happening, diplomats involved in the negotiations say. That means that Abkhazia's de facto independence seems destined to remain that for a long time, unless it is incorporated into the Russian Federation, which many diplomats think will happen."

The action appeared to be something of a ""put up or shut up"" dare to Mr. Murdoch's New York Post to cut its price from 50 cents, as that newspaper has been quietly threatening for months. **********Price increases typically drive away some readers even though they bolster revenue from newsstand sales. But for The News, there are special risks because it could be vulnerable to attack from The Post in a newsstand fight -- caught, so to speak, with its price up. **********The Post, which has always had a special interest in trying to make The News miserable, has been toying with a drastic cut in its cover price. The move would be aimed at pumping up The Post's anemic circulation, which fell to a weekday average of 381,254 in the six months that ended March 31, from 427,319 in the corresponding period a year earlier. The News's weekday circulation has been relatively stable -- 764,230, compared with 769,801 a year earlier. **********In Britain, Mr. Murdoch has seen circulation surges after sharp cover-price cuts at two of his newspapers, The Sun, a tabloid, and The Times of London, a broadsheet, and there has been well-founded speculation that he might import the tactic to the United States. Since May in New York, The Post has been trying a sharp price cut, from 50 cents to 25 cents, on Staten Island, a low-circulation borough. **********Martin Singerman, The Post's publisher, described the Staten Island price cut as ""a test."" **********The results: ""We've had very, very buoyant sales,"" Mr. Singerman said. ""Very."" **********He said that meant increases of more than 50 percent. He also said the experience had been ""good enough to keep looking at"" a price cut for the entire circulation of the newspaper. **********For now, the third of the city's tabloids, New York Newsday, is just watching. It has a five-borough circulation of 247,695, down from 274,845 last year; its total circulation for both the New York City and Long Island editions this year is 720,352. With advance notice of the action by The News, though, New York Newsday did add a headline that ran in the top corner of the front page last week: ""Still only 40 cents."" **********The New York Times, whose total weekday circulation fell to 1,187,950 from 1,230,127 a year earlier, sells for 50 cents in New York City. William K. Adler, a spokesman, said the newspaper had been working to increase the proportion of the revenue that comes from circulation. But the paper never comments on its pricing plans, he said. **********The Daily News's co-publisher, Fred Drasner, said his paper made its move partly because circulation has been strong and there have been improvements in the paper. Since the start of The Post's price-cut test on Staten Island, he said, The News's Staten Island circulation has been stable. **********Will The Post try the slash-the-price tactic? Mr. Drasner would not guess. If it did, though, ""I think it will have a devastating financial effect on them,"" he said. **********But as everybody knows, Rupert Murdoch, who seems nearly addicted to making mischief in the New York newspaper market, did not necessarily buy The Post to make money. Reaching Out in Hartford **********David S. Barrett, managing editor of The Hartford Courant, wanted to reach his newspaper's readers. Literally. **********So he rented a van, had a ""Greet the Press"" sign made up and put The Courant on the road with a mobile office -- and giveaway trinkets with the newspaper's name -- during the week of June 20. **********The Courant's have-van-will-travel program is among the scores of ways newspapers across the country are trying to forge new connections with readers to combat newspapers' image of remoteness and arrogance. **********""Greet the Press"" was part of a reader outreach program Mr. Barrett began more than a year ago to try to increase The Courant's visibility and to make its writers and advertising and circulation executives more accessible to the public. **********Mr. Barrett said the whole process had been sobering. During periodic call-the-managing-editor nights, he said, he gets ""mostly complaints, as you would imagine."" **********The van, he said, gave other editors and reporters the chance to hear firsthand, for example, the kind of competition that newspapers face in capturing the attention of their busy readers. **********""They tell you they have only 15 minutes for the paper,"" Mr. Barrett said. **********One lesson from the van's stops at shopping-center parking lots in towns like Vernon, Enfield and Bristol -- ""It really drives home the point that our stories had better be really concise,"" Mr. Barrett said. Because if they aren't, he said, the readers will just move on. **********Stan Simpson, a reporter for The Courant in Windsor, got the point. In general, he said, people at the Edwards Super Food Store said the newspaper's coverage of Windsor was good. **********But he added: ""We didn't have any in-depth conversations about the coverage. They were kind of running in and out getting their groceries."" Trees Still Grow in Brooklyn **********There are some things even newspaper publishers cannot change. **********The Cleveland Plain Dealer, a Newhouse newspaper, opened a new $200 million printing plant in Brooklyn, Ohio, last month. Newspaper printing plants tend to be, well, messy, and The Plain Dealer's planners made a special effort to make this one as clean as possible. **********The Brooklyn plant, The Plain Dealer's president and publisher, Alex Machaskee, said, is environmentally sophisticated. The newspaper used recycled airport runway as part of a nine-foot-thick base for its color presses and worked to preserve three wetlands sites on the 84-acre grounds. **********When trucks left the construction site, Mr. Machaskee said in a conversation last week, workers used hoses to wash off the muddy tires. **********And The Plain Dealer even moved 60 trees to a tree farm during construction, then moved them back and replanted them. **********Trees? **********Yes, the publisher said. ""Why would you destroy a tree?"" he asked. **********But surely, he was asked, with a weekday circulation of 400,000, The Plain Dealer kills quite a few trees every day. **********""Of course it does,"" he said, ""but I can't change that."""

Ornelas struggled with that question six years ago when he started his own agency on his dining room table here. He decided that he did not want to be swallowed up as a Hispanic division of a general market agency, as was the trend. Instead, he built his agency by forming an alliance with Tracy-Locke Inc., now part of DDB Needham Dallas Group. **********The affiliation, which involves the sharing of clients but not agency ownership, put Ornelas & Associates on its feet, and now it is running so hard that it is one of the fastest-growing Hispanic advertising agencies in the country. Last month, Hispanic Business magazine named Mr. Ornelas its national entrepreneur of the year, based on the agency's growth record. **********Billings, which were $150,000 the first year, are expected to reach $25 million this year and $50 million in the next three years. Ornelas & Associates has won many large advertising accounts on its own, including Hispanic marketing campaigns for the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the Banc One Corporation, Borden Inc., the Southland Corporation and Wrangler Jeans. **********The idea behind the affiliation with DDB Needham was to share the general market agency's clients that wanted to reach the Hispanic market -- companies like the Pepsi-Cola Company, a division of Pepsico Inc.; the McIlhenny Company, maker of Tabasco brand hot sauce, and the GTE Corporation. Mr. Ornelas has added several key Hispanic employees from DDB Needham, including his agency's account service director and creative director. His agencynow has 35 employees, most of them Hispanic. **********""We knew that once we formed a strategic alliance, it could really accelerate our growth,"" Mr. Ornelas, who is 46, said from his office filled with brightly colored Mexican art and pre-Columbian artifacts. **********Marketing to Hispanic consumers goes beyond merely translating an ad into Spanish, Mr. Ornelas said. It means developing a separate strategy for the Hispanic community, with consumers from many different countries bound by a common language. **********""If you're marketing soft drinks, for example, how much do they consume, where, when and what?"" Mr. Ornelas said. ""First and foremost you have to understand what is relevant to the Hispanic community. We recommend a lot of primary research, such as focus groups and quantitative surveys. Once you have that foundation, you can test the market strategy and position and see if it's relevant and works."" **********Tracy-Locke was handling Pepsi's national promotions and field advertising and marketing -- including major Hispanic markets in Southern California and Texas -- when it decided on the affiliation with Mr. Ornelas in 1989. **********""It was the right move at the right time,"" said Mike Rawlings, president of DDB Needham Dallas Group. ""We got a great resource and can act as one agency on a GTE or a Pepsi account. We have close financial ties, but it's his company."" **********The ""Pepsi Man"" campaign, introduced in June 1993, established Ornelas & Associates as an agency to watch. Styled as a caped crusader to do battle with rival Coca-Cola, Pepsi Man, played by the comedian Paul Rodriguez, took the Pepsi Challenge taste test to the Hispanic market. It was, indeed, a challenge because many Hispanic consumers had grown up drinking Coca-Cola. **********""Coke does have an advantage in the Hispanic market because historically they have had a stronger Latin American business than we have had,"" said William C. Cobb, Pepsi-Cola's vice president of marketing for colas. **********While Pepsi-Cola declined to release any specific sales figures or market data, Mr. Cobb said the ""Pepsi Man"" campaign had increased brand awareness of Pepsi in key Hispanic markets. **********""In San Antonio, for example, business is absolutely booming,"" Mr. Cobb said. ""We're very pleased with our sales results in intensely targeted markets."" **********The campaign is still running and is one of the largest advertising campaigns ever aimed at a Hispanic audience -- how large, neither Pepsi nor Mr. Ornelas would say, except that it was in the millions of dollars. Pepsi-Cola is the largest client of Ornelas & Associates. **********The agency also created Wrangler's ""Viva la Tradicion"" campaign, which featured a Mexican vaquero, or cowboy, and developed a campaign for Budweiser that doubled the beer's share of the Hispanic market in Texas. **********But the market is a moving target, Mr. Ornelas said. That might pose challenges for advertisers in the future, but it also could give Hispanic agencies more opportunities to grow, he said. **********""The whole market has become a paella,"" Mr. Ornelas said, referring to the traditional Spanish dish with saffron rice as its base and an assortment of vegetables, seafood and meat tossed in. ""Every element is unique and distinct. General market agencies have not become that diverse. They can't walk the bicultural line."""

The agreement -- between Mr. Ball, the brokerage and its parent, the Prudential Insurance Company of America -- was signed in August 1991, about six months after the announcement of Mr. Ball's departure. **********S.E.C. investigators have obtained a copy of the 27-page agreement and have conducted interviews about the term requiring document destruction, people with knowledge of the situation said. Lots of Silence **********William Ahearn, a Prudential spokesman, said the firm turned over the severance agreement to the S.E.C. in March, after a request by the agency. He declined further comment on the S.E.C. inquiry. **********Michael Armstrong, a lawyer for Mr. Ball, also would not comment. The S.E.C., as a policy matter, does not comment on cases under investigation. **********Legal experts said that on its own there was nothing improper about the agreement's term requiring the destruction of certain documents that Mr. Ball prepared or that his staff prepared for him. And because the agreement does not cite specific documents, but rather calls for wholesale destruction of those records containing confidential information, the firm would presumably not know the relevance of any of the documents to litigation, they said.  A Defensive Tactic **********As a general matter, a company would seek the return or destruction of confidential documents under the control of a departing chief executive to make sure that the executive did not have ""a potential weapon"" that could be used against the company in future litigation, said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor. **********But in the Prudential case, the requirement could present problems. When the agreement was reached, the firm was facing hundreds of suits stemming from one of its single biggest businesses in the 1980's: the sale of limited partnerships. Prudential sold about $8 billion worth of partnerships, but many of the clients have charged that they were fraudulently told that the risky and illiquid investments were safe. The value of the partnerships has since collapsed. **********Under legal rules of discovery, the destruction of any such documents might have been prohibited, lawyers said. When the agreement was reached with Mr. Ball, Prudential was already putting together a defense in the partnership matter. More than a year before the severance agreement, Prudential retained the law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell to investigate its partnership business and to represent it in litigation. **********Moreover, Prudential had been served with discovery requests before the signing of the severance agreement in cases involving the partnership division. Lawyers involved in some of those cases said they believe those requests would have covered documents under Mr. Ball's control, although no court or arbitrator was asked to make such a ruling at the time. **********The records of Mr. Ball would have had potential importance because of his role in building the limited-partnership business. The partnership division boomed after he became chairman and chief executive of Prudential in 1982. Throughout most of his tenure, Mr. Ball remained one of the biggest advocates for the division and its chief, James J. Darr. Several Inquiries **********Since the destruction, Mr. Ball's personal records have been subpoenaed from him in a number of cases. In those instances, lawyers said, Prudential and Mr. Ball have replied that no such records exist. **********The problems in the partnership division have since resulted in civil and criminal investigations. In October, Prudential settled fraud charges with securities regulators and agreed to compensate investors who had been tricked into buying partnerships. At the time of Mr. Ball's severance, people with knowledge of the situation said, the firm had not been notified of any criminal investigations and so the document destruction would not have violated criminal laws. **********Legal experts said that even if no rules were broken in the document destruction, the requirement could prove troublesome in future litigation. **********""For strategic reasons, a lawyer will not want a document destroyed,"" said Stephen Gillers, a New York University Law School professor, ""because the opposing lawyer will be free to use his imagination before a jury about what smoking-gun evidence that document must have contained."""

Stock prices have been going down. Cash returns remain pretty low. Where can an investor make some money? **********Financial stocks, say a growing group of professional investors who have been buying the shares of banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies. **********That may seem to fly in the face of common sense; after all, financial stocks usually suffer when interest rates rise. But money managers who favor financial stocks point out that much of the damage has already been done, driving stock prices down to the point that there are good values that may hold up well in shaky markets. Furthermore, the very thing that may be pushing rates up -- a stronger economy -- should also push up banks' profits as loan demand rises. **********While financial stocks have long been favorites of value-oriented investors, who seek out securities that are selling at bargain prices, these issues have also started to attract the attention of some growth managers, who invest in companies with improving earnings prospects. ""There aren't a whole lot of places in the market where you can find earnings growth in the double digits, price-earnings ratios in the single digits, dividend growth in the double digits, and where the underlying fundamentals are good,"" said Robert Doll Jr., the growth-oriented manager who runs the Oppenheimer Special Fund. **********Mr. Doll has been buying a slew of banks, including the Bank of Boston, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Banking, First Union, Keycorp, Midlantic, Signet Banking, Suntrust Banks and his favorite, First Interstate Bancorp. **********""What they have in common,"" Mr. Doll said, ""is that earnings and revenues are on the up side, they've had earnings surprises, and on a price-to-earnings basis, they are cheaper than they historically have been."" **********Even more than he likes banks, Mr. Doll likes financial services firms, including brokerages. The Paine Webber Group, for example, has diversified its businesses while keeping costs under control, but its stock is selling as if it had not changed. For the stock to get the multiple it deserves, ""It may take a cyclical downturn, so they can show us that they are not going to run red ink,"" Mr. Doll said. ""At the bottom of the cycle they could earn $1.25 a share -- and that's if everything goes wrong. That's not red ink."" **********True, Mr. Doll said, rising interest rates could erode financial firms' profit margins. But he notes that while short-term rates have risen a bit, long-term rates have risen far more -- and it is the difference between the two that counts for these firms. ""As long as the yield curve is steep,"" he said, ""over time, these companies can coin money."" **********Another investor who plays down the effect of rising interest rates on at least some financial stocks is Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management, a value-oriented institutional investment firm in Boston. Bank stocks do tend to move inversely to interest rates because people assume that their margins will be squeezed. ""But that doesn't mean that reflects reality,"" Mr. Black said. ""Whoever said Wall Street is smart?"" **********He favors regional banks in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, where there's strong population growth. Part of the attraction, he said, is that he expects to see ""more economic concentration, which is a fancy way of saying the little ones will get snapped up by the bigger ones."" **********He looks for banks that have lots of reserves, double-digit returns on equity, low multiples and strong local demand for loans. Among those that make the cut: Colonial Bancgroup, Compass Bancshares, First Commerce Bancshares, First Tennessee National, Grenada Sunburst System, Southern National, Union Planters and West One Bancorp. **********One exception to the rule: the Republic New York Corporation, which does not make many loans. But it does have some attractive businesses, and should earn $5.60 a share this year by Mr. Black's reckoning. **********If Mr. Black likes the little banks, Kent Simons likes some of the bigger boys, including the Bank of New York, Bank of Boston and Nationsbank. The co-manager of Neuberger & Berman's Guardian Fund, Mr. Simons gets a little impatient with all the talk about banks suffering from rising interest rates. ""Gosh, that's never happened before; no bank has ever dealt with rising rates,"" he said sarcastically. ""Banks are the only group that acts bad when it gets a price increase."" **********Other areas of the financial services industry also offer value, in Mr. Simons's view. He is a longtime fan of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (a.k.a. the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), the two mortgage lenders. He likes some insurers, from the giant American International Group to the little-known Sphere Drake Holdings. **********If the stock market continues to go down, ""I think this is a place where you won't lose as much, assuming long-term interest rates don't go to 10 percent,"" Mr. Simons said. ""But anybody who thinks rates are going to 10 percent shouldn't be buying stocks."""

At least 10 people were reported killed and hundreds wounded. **********The stadium, where the refugees had been trapped for more than a week without food, was barraged by at least 30 artillery shells this morning, and shelling and small arms fire continued around the stadium throughout the day, the officials said. The Red Cross said it had managed to evacuate 33 seriously wounded people from the stadium and distributed 25 tons of food there. **********Unconfirmed reports said that fighting had erupted in or near some refugee camps near the Burundi border, and that the anarchy that had engulfed the capital was spreading into the countryside. **********The fighting in Kigali appeared to be between the Rwandan Army and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which have been battling for control of the capital for the past two weeks. Tens of thousands of Rwandans have been killed and thousands more have fled the country. Communications Are Poor **********Since Monday, nearly all phone lines in Rwanda have appeared not to be working . Prior to that, phones had continued to function despite the chaos, permitting Rwandans to reach aid workers, human rights officials, foreign embassies and friends to tell of massacres and fighting. **********There are now only two working satellite phones in Kigali, one belonging to the Red Cross and the other to the United Nations. Both organizations have little access to areas away from their compounds, and relief officials and diplomats said they have little information about what is happening in the country. **********""The situation appears to be getting worse rather than improving,"" Reuters quoted Abdul Kabia, the executive director of the United Nations mission in Rwanda, as saying. ""We are continuing to talk to both parties but our efforts have stalled and we're not getting anywhere."" **********The 2,500 United Nations troops in Rwanda were originally deployed to monitor a cease-fire that had halted earlier civil fighting. Since the current fighting resumed, the United Nations troops have stood by helplessly.  U.N. Debates Presence **********On Monday, the Security Council said the United Nations mission would remain in Kigali only if the Government forces and the rebels could reach a peace agreement. **********Belgium, the colonial power in Rwanda prior to the country's independence in 1962, withdrew its 450 troops from the United Nations mission after 10 Belgian soldiers were killed last week. **********""The scale of the massacres make any figures meaningless,"" said Patrick Fuller, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Nairobi. **********If the United Nations was to pull out of Rwanda, it would further complicate plans to send in food and medicine, United Nations officials in Nairobi said. So far, virtually no emergency aid, except for a Red Cross medical convoy, has been able to get into Rwanda, they said.  Danger of Cholera **********Tens of thousands of people are in need of food in Kigali, where there is no safe drinking water and a danger of cholera, the Red Cross said. **********""Our priorities are food and sanitation, especially the prevention of epidemics due to the tremendous number of dead bodies."" said Lance Clark, senior relief officer for the United Nations effort in Rwanda. **********In numbers alone, the relief crisis is staggering. In the past 12 days, more than 400,000 Rwandans have been forced to flee their homes near Kigali. Relief officials estimate that as many as two million Rwandans, about 20 percent of the population, are displaced."

New York's Terror Taxis, Explained"," **********YOU sense your mistake the second you close the taxi door. Perhaps you should have seen it earlier, when the cabbie flew across three lanes of Manhattan traffic to pick you up, but for the next 15 minutes you are at the mercy of your frantic driver, who is completing his very first week behind the wheel in the United States. **********By the time you arrive at your business meeting -- by the most congested route possible -- you are so shaken that you can barely gather your indignation. Maybe you even jot down the driver's brand new hack number to file a complaint. **********What you don't realize is that New York City has essentially written this script, turning what may be the business world's most common transportation experience -- the New York yellow cab ride -- into its most hair-raising as well. **********Not long ago taxi driving in the city was a viable career option, and cabbies were a comparatively relaxed, if eccentric, bunch. Drivers earned a percentage of their daily receipts, meaning garage owners shared the risk of a bad night. Fuel and repair costs were covered by the owners, as were health benefits and vacations. Many drivers stayed in the business a long time, supporting families, even building up retirement funds. **********But in 1979 the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, under pressure from politically powerful taxi-fleet owners, transformed the industry. It allowed the owners to lease out their cars. **********Since then, drivers have not been treated as employees, with all the attendant benefits. Instead, they pay flat fees for car rental and shoulder most of the other expenses themselves. Owners have no more payroll taxes to pay, no more risks to share. If a driver has a bad night, the garage still gets its fee up front. Cabbies who previously worked normal schedules now need to stay at the wheel for 12-hour shifts, six days a week, for the same money. **********Within a few years of the commission's action, most of the old-timers got out of the business. What they left behind was the latest form of immigrant sweatshop. At least 90 percent of the new drivers are foreign-born. Rarely as street-savvy as their predecessors, they are more likely to steer into traffic jams and lose their way, which costs them money and makes them all the more frantic on the road. **********That frenzy is easy to understand when you consider the dollars behind taxi driving. Cabbies pay about $90 for car rental an average night shift, usually 5 P.M. to 5 A.M. Figuring another $20 for gasoline, they are out $110 the minute they leave the garage. Every fare and tip above that is theirs, but they may not start earning for themselves until their eighth hour in the car. On bad nights, drivers take home almost nothing -- maybe $40 -- after a 12-hour ride. And if something goes wrong with the car, they may even end up losing money. **********Leasing has actually proved to be a double whammy for the hapless driver. Every yellow cab in New York City requires a taxi medallion, the aluminum hood ornament that licenses the car. Because leasing promised fixed revenues for the first time, the value of each medallion soared after the taxi commission's action, nearly tripling from 1980 to 1989, to $140,000. It has not helped that New York's medallion market has always been particularly liberal. Like Boston and Chicago, New York restricts the number of cabs on the road. But unlike its counterparts, New York guarantees unrestricted trading in medallions. **********Dentists, lawyers, anyone looking to make a quick return, began speculating in taxi medallions.  But as prices have edged up -- reaching $182,000 last December -- owners have needed more money to finance their investments. So drivers wind up subsidizing them through higher lease rates, which means still more hours on the road. **********Even city-approved fare increases reward owners more than drivers. While raising medallion values and increasing owners' equity, the increases also allow garages to demand higher lease rates, because the drivers are taking in more money. With that and the inevitable drop-off in ridership, drivers claim they never see any extra cash. **********As any passenger can attest, there has been a steep price to pay for this squeeze on drivers. Cabbies fly through red lights, cut off other vehicles, make surprise turns from the wrong lane. They drag-race down busy streets in search of the elusive raised arm. Whereas rudeness used to be the chief gripe of passengers, poor driving is now the leading complaint lodged with the taxi commission -- up 166 percent from 1985 to 1992. **********Clearly, the system needs some serious rethinking. How about placing limits on the trade in medallions, or capping lease rates, so owners cannot gouge drivers while making hefty profits for themselves? Or how about putting a floating number of new medallions on the road, according to demand, to answer the needs of riders rather than investors? **********Whatever the answer, New York's yellow taxi doesn't need to be such bad business."

Koppers had very serious environmental problems; we were spending $50 million a year cleaning up what we knew about and had 40 engineers trying to find all the problems. **********I was on the audit committee, and every year I would have a grand battle with our auditors. I would suggest that we provide our shareholders with information on the high cost of our environmental obligations, even though we might have only very rough guesses about those costs. Year after year, I was sharply told that until we had really investigated and had hard estimates of the cost to clean up each site, it was not an acceptable accounting practice to make such information public. It was also made clear that it was appalling to think of taking reserves against such expenditures. We did, of course, tell our shareholders of the cost of all the obligations for which we had estimates, and we did tell them that we had serious, continuing problems. But we could not inform them of how serious the problems were until we had hard numbers. **********Perhaps the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is pressing companies to make timely disclosures of environmental costs, should talk to the accountants? **********In 1988, there was a hostile takeover of Koppers by Beazer P.L.C., a British construction group. We tried to tell Beazer about the environmental problems, but the British company was apparently advised to the contrary -- that the obligations were far less than they actually were. It is my opinion that this was a cause of subsequent problems that ultimately resulted in Beazer's takeover in 1991 by Hanson P.L.C., the British industrial conglomerate. **********The whole story is one of those typical 1980's hostile takeovers with no particular improvements, but a great transfer of money to bankers and advisers. But it probably could have been avoided if we had been permitted to tell shareholders all of the bad news.

The drop is most pronounced in Brandenburg, where births have fallen by more than two-thirds, from nearly 38,000 in 1989 to barely 12,000 last year. In the four other eastern states, births are down by more than half over the same period. **********Demographers say that such precipitous declines have never before been seen except in times of war, plague or famine. This time the astonishing drop in birth rates, which has been attributed in large part to economic uncertainty, seems to be a byproduct of German unification that no one predicted. **********In Brandenburg, Premier Manfred Stolpe said in announcing the plan last week that he was sending out ""a special signal"" to couples who have been reluctant to have children because of worries about money. **********The payments to new parents in Brandenburg are to begin immediately, and will be in addition to both the national health insurance, which covers obstetric and other medical expenses, as well as a monthly allowance called Kindergeld that is awarded on a sliding scale based on income and may be used for a variety of the expenses of raising a child.  Kindergeld, which has been distributed in western Germany since 1955, can reach a monthly cap of $420 for a family of four. **********Birth rates have also fallen in Europe's other formerly Communist countries, but not nearly as steeply.  Under East Germany's Communist system, jobs and day care were available to all, and a strong social safety net prevented anyone from falling into poverty. Today, unemployment is high in eastern states and prospects are clouded. **********Many eastern couples are reluctant to have children because they are unsure whether they will be able to survive in the newly competitive society. This insecurity has led not only to a sharp decline in the birth rate but also to a drop in the marriage rate and a more than tenfold increase in sterilizations. **********""Young people in east Germany used to think that the most important conditions for marriage were love and a good partnership,"" said Jutta Gysi, who recently completed a study of family life in Brandenburg. ""Now they are seeing that the crucial condition is a secure job."" **********A report in the newspaper Berliner Zeitung concluded that birth rates in eastern states were in ""free fall."" **********""The main reason for this development is the uncertain social situation, especially in the job market,"" the report concluded. ""Many women prefer a secure job to having a child."" **********A study by two German experts concluded that in 2010 there would be fewer than half as many children in eastern Germany as there are today. **********The eastern city of Schwerin is one of many depressed communities where the birth rate has fallen to especially low levels. The rate there has fallen by 59 percent over the last five years. **********""We have some fears that the tree of life may be falling,"" said Wolfgang Jahmer, who directs social welfare programs in Schwerin. **********Nearly all the formerly Communist countries in Europe have experienced drops in birth rates, although nowhere has the rate dropped as sharply as in eastern Germany.  Some countries, including Hungary and Poland, provide payments to families that have newborn babies, but they are much smaller than the payments Brandenburg will now make. **********In the West, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal offer money to the families of newborns.  Birth rates are also very low in western Germany, where for the last several years slightly more people have died than have been born. This has led some officials to begin worrying about the country's demographic future. **********After the Brandenburg program was announced on Friday, support for applying it nationwide came from Claudia Nolte, who became the minister in charge of family policy in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new 14-member Cabinet. **********During the recent national political campaign, all major parties favored continuing or increasing such payments. **********""This problem of falling birth rates, which you can really call dramatic, goes beyond Brandenburg and beyond the eastern states,"" said Manfred Krohn, a spokesman for the Brandenburg government. **********""All over Germany, people are feeling insecure, especially young people,"" he said. ""They're thinking about studying and working, not about families. Naturally you see this more in the east, but it has spread westward and is now a serious national problem. We have to confront it."""

One of them is tuned to the latest entrant in the region's warming satellite television wars: Asia Business News, or ABN. **********""It's a channel for Asia only,"" Mr. Li said, ""and it gives me what I need."" **********With television satellites cluttering the heavens above Asia like beer cans strewn along a forest trail, the great need is not so much for more orbital litter -- although a wave of new satellites is coming -- but for something to beam off them, particularly something that can appeal to a regional, as opposed to a local, audience. **********Paul France, a big, garrulous New Zealander who is the chief executive of ABN, thinks he has found a recipe for attracting Asian viewers by capitalizing on the explosive growth of Asia's economies, the huge expansion of trade and investment within the region and the demand for more and faster business news by the legions of executives frenetically shuttling around Asia. 'Let's Do a Business Network' **********""The potential in Asia is enormous, but it's still only potential,"" Mr. France said in a recent interview at the channel's headquarters in a glittering office tower in downtown Singapore. ""After looking at all the options, we said, 'Everybody in this part of the world is interested in money. It's part of their lives. Let's do a business network.' "" **********So in May, from a pristine expanse of journalists' cubicles, control rooms filled with television monitors, satellite control panels, high-powered graphics computers and a broadcast studio designed by Janet Patterson, the costume designer on the movie ""The Piano,"" Mr. France began transmitting the region's only channel dedicated to Asian business news. **********For 18 hours a day, news and analysis of the region's multitudinous markets, big and small companies, investments and politics is showered on millions of satellite dishes across Asia, all in English except for a short segment in Mandarin Chinese. (While cable television has made inroads in some Asian nations, like Taiwan, satellite dishes are a much more common means of television reception than in the United States.) **********""We are the only regional business network in Asia, for Asia, by Asians,"" Mr. France said. ""Everybody's talked about it, but nobody's done it."" Advertising Is Thin **********ABN can be received in Japan, much of China, all of southeast Asia and as far away as Australia and eastern India. But in Singapore, where private satellite dishes are illegal because the Government cannot control the programs received by viewers, ABN was banned from cable until Sept. 1, when the Government decided to permit Singaporeans to see an hour a day of ABN programming. Paradoxically, even as it limits public access to the channel, the Singapore Government owns 10 percent of ABN. **********The real question for Mr. France's venture is whether it can succeed as a business. So far, advertising has been thin, not only on ABN but also on other satellite programs like Star TV, a channel owned by Rupert Murdoch that features a mix of music, movies and news, and CNN International, the international news venture of the Atlanta-based cable channel. **********NBC has just started an Asian satellite service that features programming from the network's United States business news channel, CNBC, but the service is only available from midnight to 8 A.M., and there are few places in Asia where it can be seen. **********Nikhil Srinivasan, a vice president at Baring Securities in Hong Kong who specializes in media and telecommunications, said that while there was a need for ABN, its success was not assured. **********""If you think about business in this region, intracountry trade has only been growing recently,"" he said. ""There is an increased interest in business news across the region. From that point of view, there should be a major business magazine, but there is no business magazine of note. Television is the next best alternative."" **********Critical to ABN's goal of being regarded as a regional network, Mr. France said, is the need to be seen as an outgrowth of the region itself.  2 American Partners **********""We're clearly seen as not being American,"" he said. ""It's the feeling that there's not somebody in New York telling us the meaning of life. Our reporters come from all over the world, all over the region."" The channel has 110 employees, 43 of whom are involved in the gathering of news. **********But while Mr. France, a former producer for Television New Zealand, one of ABN's investors, is from New Zealand -- ""we're part of Asia, aren't we?"" he said -- there are also American interests in the network. Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable operator in the United States, and Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and the owner of Telerate, a financial news service, each own 30 percent of the network, as does Television New Zealand. **********While much of the news product is generated by ABN's reporters here and in Hong Kong, Dow Jones requires many of its staff members from The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review, its weekly news magazine, to participate in the network's programs. And Telerate provides ABN with financial data that are automatically updated and displayed in a dizzying array of graphics. **********ABN has been pushing hard to gain entry to satellite and cable markets across Asia, which is essential if the network is to attract advertisers. Several agencies try to gauge viewership for satellite channels in Asia, but it is difficult to do so. And without solid viewership figures, attracting advertisers is that much harder. **********""One of the problems is that this industry has been stung by extravagant audience claims,"" Mr. France said. ""The difficulties we face are a distrust of the satellite industry in Asia, because of all the hyperbole."" **********In addition, Mr. France cited difficulties in persuading corporate advertising executives to shift some of their local spending to the broader evolving regional market. Advertising a Critical Issue **********The channel's start-up costs were $20 million.

The second round of job cuts will mean a charge in the fourth quarter, the company said, without providing details. **********Analysts said the cuts showed that Novell was serious about streamlining Wordperfect's fixed costs. **********""It demonstrates that the company is willing to take the aggressive steps necessary,"" said Walter Winnitzki, an analyst with Dillon, Read. ""Wall Street will welcome that."" **********The announcements were made after the New York markets had closed. Shares of Novell ended the day at $14.75, down 12.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading.  Wordperfect Acquisition **********Earlier this week, Novell said its earnings would be lower than estimates because Wordperfect, which it acquired in June for $855 million, had lower revenues than Novell expected. **********Novell writes software that lets personal computers exchange information through networks. Novell bought Wordperfect to establish itself as a publisher of applications, or general business software like word processors and spreadsheets, and to prevent the industry leader, the Microsoft Corporation from gaining more market share in the PC software market. Novell also bought the Quattro Pro spreadsheet program from Borland International Inc. But most analysts do not expect Novell to see a benefit from that acquisition for at least two more quarters. **********Novell said earnings from operations rose 35 percent, to $77 million, or 21 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 30, from $57 million, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. **********Wall Street expected Novell to post profit from operations of 24 cents a share, according to a recent survey of 27 analysts by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System. **********With a charge of $120 million for the acquistions of Wordperfect and Quattro Pro, Novell posted a loss of $4 million, or 1 cent a share, which was improved from the third quarter of 1993, when Novell lost $257 million, or 69 cents a share, including a $320.5 million charge for acquiring Unix System Laboratories and three other software companies. **********Third-quarter revenues rose 12.7 percent, to $489 million, from $434 million a year ago. The results included Wordperfect and Quattro Pro sales."

But the healthy quarter was also the result of strong fee income from securities processing and growth in the bank's credit card business. **********""Over the last couple years, they've become a major force in securities processing and credit card lending,"" said Dennis F. Shea, a banking analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Net income rose to $178 million in the first quarter, from $134 million in the first quarter of 1993, the bank said. Fully diluted earnings in the first quarter of 1994 were $1.75 a share, up from $1.37 a share in the comparable period in 1993. **********Net interest income rose to $383 million, from $366 million in the comparable period a year earlier, because of increased loan demand in the first quarter. Bank of New York said its credit card business grew by 23 percent, to 4.9 million accounts. Its provision for loan losses fell to $45 million, from $93 million. **********Noninterest income rose to $350 million, from $330 million. It included the sale of a portion of the bank's interest in Wing Hang Bank Ltd. of Hong Kong. The sale brought in $22 million before taxes, and $12 million after taxes, Bank of New York said. **********Analysts had expected Bank of New York to report earnings thataveraged $1.66 a share , according to Zacks Investment Research, which tracks earnings estimates. **********The news yesterday prompted even Mr. Shea, whose earnings projections were at the high end of analysts' expectations, to increase further his estimate for the bank for 1994 to $7 a share, from $6.85 a share. **********The announcement of a quarterly common stock cash dividend of 55 cents a share amounted to an increase of 22 percent from the 45 cents the bank had been paying."

In Thailand, the child mortality rate would be 103 out of 1,000, as against an estimated 21 without the disease. **********Until the onset of the epidemic in the mid-1980's, these countries, like the other developing nations analyzed in the report, had seen marked improvement in the survival rates of children from birth to 5 years of age. AIDS to Double Death Rate **********The report, compiled by the bureau's Center for International Research, also predicted that AIDS would double the overall death rate expected to occur naturally from 1985 to 2010 in the African countries the center studied, and in Brazil and Haiti. In Thailand, the researchers said, the epidemic would triple the expected mortality rate. **********As a result of the large number of adults in their 30's and 40's who will die from AIDS, and the large number of infants who are infected in their mothers' wombs, life expectancy rates that have been rising over the last 40 years have started to fall in a number of countries. **********For example, the report predicted that by 2010, the average life expectancy in Uganda would drop to 32 years. Without AIDS it would be 59. In Haiti, bureau demographers estimated, life expectancy would drop to 44 years from 59 years. **********It is the rate of childhood survival in the third world that will be most significantly affected by AIDS, researchers said. Because 94 percent of the AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa are the result of heterosexual intercourse, a higher percentage of women become infected during their childbearing years than is the case in the West. But because it may be years before a person infected with the AIDS virus develops symptoms, women may not realize they carry the virus until after they have passed it on to their children in utero. AIDS Cases at 14 Million **********The predictions are included in ""World Population Profile: 1994,"" a report prepared by the bureau every two years and tracks worldwide population growth, fertility, mortality and contraceptive use. This year's report includes a chapter on the effects of AIDS on population trends. **********It notes that despite the 14 million people estimated to be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, the epidemic will not cause a decline in the population in most third world nations, including sub-Saharan Africa, where the World Health Organization has estimated 8 million people are infected. **********But it will slow population growth. The demographers estimate that there will be 121 million fewer people in some of the most highly affected countries in Africa like Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- as well as in Haiti, Brazil and Thailand -- by 2010 because of the epidemic than if there had been no exposure to AIDS. **********One country whose population is expected decline as a result of AIDS is Thailand, where the report predicts a change from a growth rate of 0.9 percent in 1985 to a loss of 0.8 percent by 2010. Researchers say Thailand already has a low birth rate and its death rate is expected to triple by 2010 because of the disease. Economies to Be Hard Hit **********Moreover, the Census Bureau and researchers from the World Bank say, AIDS will devastate the economies of many countries in sub-Saharan African, already some of the world's poorest nations. **********""Economic growth will be encumbered by increased morbidity and decreased productivity of H.I.V.-infected workers, and many others will be unable to enter the work force because of care-giving responsibilities among families,"" the report said. **********Not only will AIDS strike down many workers in their most productive years, but research has also found that the disease disproportionately strikes at these countries' more educated populations. **********Studies have shown that in many developing nations, especially Africa, men with more education and higher status tend to engage in more encounters of casual sex, and were thus more likely to be exposed to the virus. As a result, the disease has infected a higher proportion of the class of men whose education tended to make them more productive workers."

The demand for basic and cellular telephone service is so large it is difficult to measure: China currently has only one telephone for every 33 households, compared with almost one in every household in the United States. **********BellSouth plans to start its business in China with a cellular network, which is relatively easy to set up, but for which there is a limited market. Getting a cellular phone in Beijing today costs nearly $2,000, according to Mr. Neel. Installation of a home telephone costs about $800, a significant expense for most Chinese citizens. **********China Unicom, as the Chinese partner is called for short, is described by American analysts as a promising company backed by Chinese investors that is starting out in a lucrative but still uncertain field. **********""In a developing country, the important thing is to have the right partner,"" Frank J. Governali, an analyst at CS First Boston, said. ""You don't go by the technology, but by the local contacts they have."" **********BellSouth will probably help China Unicom negotiate with foreign equipment suppliers, coordinate telephone standards, and design telephone networks, Mr. Governali said. **********Beijing and Tianjin already have telephone systems that are more advanced than in the rest of the country. But the demand there for more telephones is still great, analysts said. **********BellSouth is the nation's second-biggest provider of mobile telephones after the McCaw Communications Corporation, Tim Horan, an analyst at Smith Barney, said. BellSouth has more than 4.5 million cellular customers and also services more than 19 million telephone lines in the Southeastern United States."

New Problems for U.S. **********In both areas, the prospects have suddenly grown even more uncertain, creating some unpleasant new difficulties for the Clinton Administration. **********Late last year, American officials began to relax some of the trade pressure on Mr. Hosokawa and expressed patience with his goal of passing the reform bills in the belief that he represented the best hope for a major opening of Japan's economy. **********As was the case with Russia, where the United States threw its support behind President Boris N. Yeltsin, the Clinton Administration has been relying more on an individual in Japan than on a society or a political process. **********With Mr. Hosokawa's future suddenly in jeopardy and another realignment possible among Japan's parties, American officials are being forced to reconsider the approach. Their political support for Mr. Hosokawa did not help him noticeably, and economic problems were not addressed. Cloud Over Economic Package **********The Government had been expected to present a package of emergency measures to stimulate the economy next week, including an increase of perhaps $100 billion in public works spending and a big tax cut. Prices on the Tokyo stock market soared recently in anticipation of approval of the long-delayed measures. **********Now Mr. Hosokawa is so preoccupied and so weakened politically that nobody expects the recession to be tackled right away, a development that is sending a shiver of apprehension through the business sector. **********Even if a compromise package of electoral reform is hastily cobbled together and passed next week, as some are predicting, the divisions in what remains of Mr. Hosokawa's Government run so deep that the politicians are unlikely to override critics of its economic plan. The Finance Ministry, for example, is fighting large-scale reductions in income taxes on the ground they will create huge budget deficits. **********The problems with the United States could be even trickier, and more frustrating for both sides. **********Mr. Hosokawa is to meet with President Clinton in Washington in three weeks, in part to conclude a trade agreement that Mr. Clinton has said will be one of the cornerstones of future relations with Japan. **********The Clinton Administration had vowed that it would succeed where previous administrations have failed by obtaining guarantees from Tokyo of tangible increases in American exports to Japan and reductions in Japan's surpluses. Japan's overall trade surplus came to more than $120 billion last year, and the surplus with the United States alone came to more than $50 billion. **********The summit meeting on Feb. 11 was going to produce Japan's first down payment on that policy, with agreements to open the markets for autos, auto parts, medical equipment, insurance and telecommunications. **********The Clinton Administration was also anxious to extract a promise that Japan would take strong measures to re-energize the economy. A Breakthrough Is Unlikely **********But even if his Government survives until then, Mr. Hosokawa is expected to remain so weak that it is unlikely he will be able to face down the Government bureaucracy and produce the breakthrough that some in the Clinton Administration had been hoping for. **********Over the last two weeks, the trade negotiations have grown unusually bitter, with American negotiators suggesting that the Japanese have been acting in bad faith, and the Japanese accusing the United States of trying to brutishly interfere in their markets. **********The slow pace presents a stark choice to President Clinton. He can criticize Mr. Hosokawa for failing to satisfy American demands, and thus possibly weaken further a leader he clearly regards as an agent of change, or he can ease the pressure and give the Government time to rebuild, and risk fierce criticism in Congress from those who feel the United States has been manipulated. **********""The meeting was already bound for failure,"" said Yukio Okamoto, a former senior Foreign Ministry official. ""The American expectations were too inflated from the start. This is going to be unfortunate for the U.S.-Japan relationship."" **********Haruo Shimada, an economics professor at Keio University, said the Prime Minister ""will go on the trip just waiting to be victimized. Clinton is likely to be unsatisfied. It could be a very destructive kind of summit."""

This is only a test. It is not -- repeat, not -- the interactive television and home-shopping system that will be in your home by Christmas. Or next Christmas. Or maybe ever. **********That, roughly, is the cautionary message from executives at Time Warner Inc. as they prepare to plug in their long-awaited ""full service network"" in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday. **********After two years of preparation, a torrent of publicity and a delay of more than six months, Time Warner will hook up the first of about 4,000 homes to the most ambitious experiment yet in interactive television. By some time next year, the company hopes, nearly the entire group of homes will be wired. **********But for all the sizzle -- and there will be plenty of it -- the watchword is still caution, not just at Time Warner but at most other telephone and cable television companies that are conducting similar tryouts. No company has yet committed itself to offering exotic new services on a broad basis. **********Time Warner executives refuse to say how much they are spending on the Orlando project, though in terms of the company's revenue it is surely a drop in the bucket. And they refuse to predict when they might reach a verdict on a wider expansion. **********""The task here in Orlando was basically to build a time machine,"" said James Chiddix, senior vice president for engineering and technology at Time Warner Cable and a principal architect of the Orlando network. ""This platform represents where technology can be a couple of years hence, and we are now in a unique position to discover how real people are going to spend real money to buy services."" **********Over the last year, the cost and difficulty of building interactive video systems has become more apparent. One trial after another has been delayed by technical problems. Within the cable television and telephone industries, there is great uncertainty about which services will be popular and whether they can be offered profitably, particularly exotic services, like interactive video shopping and grippingly realistic on-line video games. **********Even in what is widely expected to be a popular service, like video on demand -- allowing customers to order movies whenever they want from an on-screen menu -- many experts say the economics are dubious. In an extensive test of movies on demand completed last year by U S West and Tele-Communications Inc. in Denver, customers bought fewer than three movies a month on average. In surveys, moreover, viewers have proved unwilling to pay much more for a movie than the $3 or $4 charged by video stores. **********That leads to basic cost problems for a telephone or cable service, said Robert Alexander, head of Alexander & Associates, a New York consultant. ""A movie can tie up your line for two hours,"" he said. ""if you can only charge about $4, and Hollywood is going to take about half of that, it means you're getting about 1.6 cents a minute for the line."" That is less than what telephone companies often charge for ordinary phone calls. **********The point of the Orlando experiment, Time Warner executives say, is to find out what people will want when the equipment that is now so expensive becomes affordable several years down the road. **********The Orlando system is undoubtedly the most futuristic network introduced so far. Beyond using the latest switching and computer technology, Time Warner and marketing collaborators like Spiegel Inc. have done more than any other group to blend Hollywood magic with Madison Avenue marketing in developing new video services. **********Viewers will turn on their television sets to see a rotating carousel on the screen that will allow them to select and watch specific movies at any time of day, shop in an ""electronic mall"" and play what promise to be grippingly realistic video games. **********Entering the mall, viewers will pass by graphical representations of storefronts and they will be able to view video displays of products from Spiegel, Eddie Bauer, Crate and Barrel and other merchants. A printer next to each television will be able to deliver tickets, discount coupons and printed information. **********Time Warner has plenty of competition. Nationwide, cable or telephone companies have started or are planning more than 30 significant trials of new video services, according to Alexander & Associates, which has monitored the experiments. Most of these will let viewers call up movies from a library -- a service known as video on demand -- and many will offer a selection of two-way information services as well. **********But nobody is sure how much interactivity the ordinary viewer will want. ""The vast majority of consumers are very interested in better entertainment and information options, but what 'better' means varies among different segments of population,"" said Nicholas Donatello, president of Odyssey Inc., a market research company in San Francisco that surveys customer attitudes toward new media technologies. **********Many companies are being conservative even as they try out new services. In West Hartford, Conn., for example, Southern New England Telephone has started a trial in 400 homes that allows customers to get ordinary cable television service and to choose from a library of 1,650 movies and shorter programs. But the company is wary about plunging into more unusual services, and chiefly views the video on demand as an added option with which to win over cable subscribers. **********""There is a real danger that you can overload customers with a bunch of services that are too complicated and not easy to use,"" said Ron Serrano, a senior vice president at Southern New England Telephone. **********In Castro Valley, Calif., Viacom Inc. has been preparing to test an elaborate system that includes video on demand, interactive games, information services and shopping. But that project has been repeatedly delayed as executives rethink elements of the plan, and the company now says only that it hopes to test its newest services some time in 1995. **********Two other prominent trials, one by Bell Atlantic in Alexandria, Va., and the other by U S West in Omaha, have been delayed by technical and regulatory problems. **********But the biggest uncertainties are over where the real opportunities lie. Proponents of video on demand note that video-rental stores already represent a $15 billion industry; they maintain that the new technology would save customers the trouble of leaving home and worrying about late fees. Most systems, including Time Warner's Orlando project, would allow viewers to pause or rewind the programs, as if they were using a videocassette recorder. **********The demand for video shopping and on-line computer games is even more difficult to predict. Catalogue sales represent a $54.7 billion business, and many consumers may indeed appreciate the ability to view video images. Spiegel, for example, will let customers view moving video images of curtains, as they are hanging in a window, in each of the colors they have available. **********Davia Kimmey, corporate vice president of advertising at Spiegel, speculated that it would also be possible for customers to get experts on video to offer advice about particular products or problems. But the costs of producing interactive advertising are high, and customers will still have to wait for any product that must be shipped by regular mail. **********Time Warner executives readily acknowledge the uncertainties, but add that the only way to learn is to develop a system that offers people as much as possible. To that end, they have used all the tricks of a movie and television studio to make services entertaining and easy to use. They have also used numerous focus groups to refine the look and feel of each application. **********Early on, for example, the company created a vivid three-dimensional graphic presentation of a city. Viewers fly through the city, with its tall buildings and signs, and stop at their particular destination. But early focus groups of viewers found the demonstration confusing, and the company shifted to the much simpler image of a cylindrical carousel that offered different choices -- movies on demand, video games and shopping. **********The technology is advanced and, at least for the moment, costly. Silicon Graphics built the computers, known as servers, that act like jukeboxes to store video programs in electronic form. With Scientific Atlanta, it built set-top boxes that have many times the processing power of current personal computers. **********The devices cost several thousand dollars each -- nobody will say precisely how much -- but the theory is that those costs will plummet as chip technology advances and production in volume allows for economies. **********Even more exotic services and features are in the works. Time Warner is already preparing a system that will allow viewers to call up different programs or services by giving spoken commands. **********Still, they emphasize that they are not assuming the success of interactive services. The company is already investing heavily in fiber optics, which will allow it to increase capacity, improve quality and expand into the local telephone business. These modernized networks will allow room for expanded pay-per-view services and other alternatives to full video on demand. **********""We are not simply spending money to enhance our systems in the hope that interactivity will some day pay off,"" Mike Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner, said. ""The fiber upgrades will accomplish a number of things before interactive services come along. This is a very careful, prudent, phased introduction."" PREPARING FOR THE DIGITAL ERA Interactive television systems that are already operating or have advanced tha most in planning  1: Alexandria, VA: Bell Atlantic has begun an experimental video-on-demand service to some employees' homes last summer.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/business/fed-faces-decision-today-on-rate-rise.html,Keith Bradsher,1994-05-17,,958,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Fed Faces Decision Today on Rate Rise,Fed Faces Decision Today on Rate Rise," **********An unusual pattern of growth has emerged in the American economy in the last few years that poses a predicament for the Federal Reserve as its top officials gather here on Tuesday to decide whether to continue raising short-term interest rates. **********For the first time since the late 1940's, the economy is growing strongly despite a sustained drop in purchasing by Federal, state and local governments. The private sector is the only engine of growth in this recovery, unlike every other recovery in the last four decades, in which government spending accounted for at least part of the expansion. **********The Federal Reserve must decide whether to brake that engine by raising interest rates sharply on the theory that that will prevent future inflation, or whether to do little or nothing for fear that higher interest rates together with falling government spending could halt economic growth.  An Increase Is Expected **********The betting of many economists is that Fed officials will raise short-term interest rates on Tuesday, because concerns about the braking effect of lower government spending are balanced by a desire to reassure bond and foreign exchange markets that inflation is under control. **********Higher rates would force consumers to pay more for adjustable-rate mortgages and car loans, although higher returns on bank deposits would partly offset this cost. **********Through the boom of the Korean War years, the rising prosperity of the late 1960's and the prolonged growth of the mid-1980's, government spending was a big part of economic expansion. But primarily because of a sustained drop in military spending that began late in the Bush Administration and continues under President Clinton, as well as other budget cuts, total government purchases, adjusted for inflation, have edged down slightly each year since 1991. **********During the first quarter of this year, the private sector, including consumer spending, investment and net exports, grew 4.3 percent, as interest rates, still relatively low by recent standards, helped produce strong sales of everything from bulldozers to cellular telephones. The overall economy, however, grew only 2.6 percent, dragged down by a 6.2 percent drop in government purchases of goods and services. **********The first-quarter drop in government spending was particularly sharp because bad weather appears to have slowed state and local government construction severely, and because deliveries of some military goods were delayed. Yet the first quarter was not a fluke. Adjusted for inflation, government purchases shrank nearly 1 percent from 1991 to 1993. The Fed's Focus **********Federal Reserve officials have indicated repeatedly in interviews and speeches over the last month that they are looking at the strong private sector growth rather than just the 2.6 percent overall growth. ""I think that figure probably understates the economy's current strength,"" said Robert T. Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a speech on Thursday. **********Government purchasing figures are used to calculate the nation's economic output and exclude transfer programs like Social Security that redistribute income without actually producing goods or services. Government purchasing accounts for 18 percent of the nation's output, while the private sector accounts for the rest. **********Including transfer programs, government spending has been roughly constant in inflation-adjusted terms for the last three years, edging down slightly in 1993 and climbing a little in 1992 and 1994. **********Quarterly figures from the Commerce Department show that the Federal budget deficit has fallen as a percentage of the nation's economic output to 3.2 percent by the end of last year from 4.8 percent in the third quarter of 1992. The Clinton Administration is trying to cut the deficit to 2.5 percent of economic output in 1995. **********As the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee meets on Tuesday -- its first meeting in two months -- one of the critical questions it faces is whether the slump in government spending by itself will prevent the economy from overheating, with little further action on interest rates. **********In the latest sign that the economy may be approaching full capacity and may encounter inflationary pressures, the Fed announced today that the nation's industrial production rose three-tenths of a percent in April while factories and mines operated at 83.6 percent of capacity last month, the same as in March. **********But some economists say that such figures no longer signal rising inflation very clearly, because more and more overseas factories can step in to make similar goods if American factories run out of spare capacity. **********Many economists expect the Fed to raise the discount rate -- the interest rate that it charges banks for overnight loans -- for the first time in more than five years. Because the Fed actually lends very little money to banks -- just $46 million last week -- this would be a largely symbolic measure to show that it remains on guard against inflation. Rise Seen in Rate Target **********Many economists think it fairly likely that the Fed may also push up its target for the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, as it has already done three times this year. Such a move would signify that the Fed is not satisfied that a contractional budget policy by itself is enough to prevent the economy from overheating. **********The Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress warned in a report earlier this month that with only the private sector growing, further interest rate increases by the Fed could halt the nation's economic expansion. **********But Fed officials have been concerned this spring that much of the effects of budget cuts may have already been felt, so that further interest rate increases may be needed to keep the private sector from growing too fast."

About 10 basis points, or one-tenth of 1 percent in annual interest. **********A tenth of a percentage point or more is the annual interest Texans willingly forgo by favoring bonds from their own state over comparable bonds from other states without income taxes, according to Timothy T. Browse, portfolio manager of the Eaton Vance Texas Tax-Free Marathon Fund. **********Texas investors can choose from at least a dozen Texas municipal bond funds, even though limiting a fund to Texas, one of seven states with no income tax, offers no tax advantage to residents. **********For the state and its local governments, with about $125 billion in outstanding debt, the annual interest savings amount to at least $125 million, enough to employ 3,300 teachers or buy the sliced brisket plates at Angelo's barbecue in Fort Worth for nearly all 18 million residents of the state. **********Most other single-state bond funds boast double-tax-free income, because states usually do not tax the interest that they or their cities pay to their own residents. New York City investors, burdened with a city, as well as a state, income tax, often buy triple-tax-free bonds or bond funds. **********Talk with Texans and they will list their own reasons for investing locally. They can see the highways, schools and stadiums their money is building and they can question the officials in charge face to face. **********""Somebody who lives in Texas has more of a feel for Texas,"" said Frederick E. Rowe, whose money management firm in Dallas bears his name. ""You know the people. Maybe there's a New York City fund, but who knows what those Yankees are going to do?"" **********But some municipal bond analysts would not agree. Catherine Voss Sanders, associate editor of the Morningstar Mutual Funds Newsletter, says she sees little reason for buying single-state funds from places like Texas. **********""If you are in a state with no income tax, you probably would be best to shop among the national municipal funds,"" she said. This provides diversification, making the investor less dependent on the fortunes of one state. **********The number of Texas funds has doubled in the last few years amid talk in Austin, the capital, of imposing an income tax. Texas municipals have gained, because a new tax would make tax-free income more valuable. The economic recovery in the state has also firmed up some credit ratings and prices. **********""It's one of the fastest-growing states around, and with the North American Free Trade Agreement, that's only going to improve things,"" said Stella Wong, a senior portfolio manager for the Franklin Texas Tax-Free Income Fund. **********Texas voters tried to stop the tax talk last November by amending the state's constitution to require a two-thirds vote for an income tax. Since then Texans have stood by their bonds, which have done at least as well as others in the rout of the credit market. **********For the year through the end of March, Franklin's $142 million Texas fund, the largest, had a net return of 4.02 percent, acccording to Morningstar, while the average return from single-state funds was 2.22 percent. **********Even if politicians never succeed in passing a state income tax, by keeping the discussion going they could frighten more investors into buying municipal bonds and saving state and local governments even more money."

Anheuser-Busch Inc. startled Madison Avenue yesterday by unexpectedly dismissing the St. Louis office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, which has served as the sole agency for its flagship Budweiser beer brand since 1915. **********Effective in 90 days, the creative responsibilities on the estimated $125 million account of Budweiser, America's best-selling beer, will be consolidated at the Chicago office of DDB Needham Worldwide, which handles the light, dry and ice-brewed versions of the brand. **********Bud Light in particular has enjoyed robust growth in the last two years, fueled by humorous commercials from DDB Needham Chicago featuring an inept liar who asserts, ""Yes, I am,"" when his many outlandish claims are challenged. **********Until Sunday, when Anheuser-Busch executives notified D.M.B.& B. executives of the surprising dismissal, the ties between the nation's largest brewer and one of the world's largest agencies had withstood all manner of challenges -- even Prohibition, when Anheuser-Busch produced products in lieu of banned beers like Bevo, a nonalcoholic malt-based beverage, and Carcho, a chocolate-flavored soft drink. **********D.M.B.& B. began working on Budweiser 32 years after Anheuser-Busch began brewing and distributing the brand. It was under D.M.B.& B.'s stewardship that Budweiser surpassed Schlitz in the late 1950's to become the nation's No. 1 beer, a ranking it has never relinquished. **********But that relationship -- reinforced by the agency's hiring of James B. Orthwein, a top executive who was a cousin of Anheuser-Busch's controlling Busch family -- could not survive the intensely competitive nature of the beer market. Budweiser sales have declined because of consumers' weakening brand loyalties, as they have increasingly experimented with dozens of lighter, tastier, more flavorful brews, including several being rushed onto shelves by Anheuser-Busch. **********""It's a big step for Anheuser to sever that relationship,"" said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Paine Webber who follows the nation's $50 billion beer industry. **********""Yet the domestic brewing business is more competitive than it has ever been,"" he added. ""That being the case, you really want to bring out your best."" **********Those feelings were reflected in a statement by Patrick T. Stokes, president of Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis. **********""The people at D'Arcy have done a tremendous job in helping us create memorable brand-building advertising,"" he said. ""While this was not an easy decision, we believe Anheuser-Busch is best served at this time by combining these major brand assignments under one roof."" **********The creative duties on other Anheuser-Busch assignments, with billings estimated at $50 million -- including new products like Red Wolf that D.M.B.& B. was awarded only recently -- will be handled by various agencies on a project basis. They include the Michelob line of higher-priced beers; O'Doul's, a nonalcoholic brew, and a moderation campaign carrying the theme ""Know when to say when."" **********While the cost efficiencies of consolidating Budweiser and Bud Light were probably a big factor in Anheuser-Busch's decision -- for instance, there could now be more campaigns teaming both brands -- it helped mightily that Bud Light's sales were growing, compared with Budweiser's slowly slumping results. Indeed, Anheuser-Busch said during the summer that Bud Light would become the country's top-selling light beer, overtaking its longtime rival, Miller Lite. **********""That's what's at the heart of this move,"" Mr. Goldman said. ""As they say, nothing succeeds like success."" **********""Anheuser wants to give DDB Needham the opportunity to work its magic with the Budweiser brand,"" he added. While Bud Light sales are expected to increase by 10.9 percent this year from 1993, according to Mr. Goldman's estimates, Budweiser sales, by contrast, are expected to decline by 5.1 percent. **********D.M.B.& B. and its predecessors, dating to D'Arcy Advertising, have coined familiar Budweiser slogans from ""Where's there life . . . there's Bud"" and ""King of beers,"" to ""Best reason in the world to drink beer"" and ""Nothing beats a Bud."" Only four weeks ago, D.M.B.& B. brought out a huge campaign carrying the theme ""It's always been true . . . This Bud's for you,"" echoing one of Budweiser's most popular themes, which ran from 1979 to 1990. **********D.M.B.& B. also created campaigns like the ""Bud Bowl,"" which used special effects to simulate football games between bottles of beer during the last six Super Bowls. Though derided as corny, it has helped build beer sales during a traditionally slow time of the year. **********In retrospect, Anheuser-Busch's decision last month to assign Bud Bowl VII to DDB Needham Chicago rather than to D.M.B.& B. foreshadowed the shift of all the brand's creative assignments. There were other signs of tension in the last year, too, such as Anheuser-Busch's unhappiness that a D.M.B.& B. media unit, Televest, had agreed to handle some media buying duties for the Miller Brewing Company. But few expected a change of this magnitude. **********""It's a great disappointment to us,"" said Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive at the New York headquarters of D.M.B.& B. **********Budweiser served as a cornerstone account for the agency as it grew through the decades, helping D.M.B.& B. attract other clients -- particularly companies run by ex-athletes exposed to a steady diet of Budweiser commercials during football and baseball games. **********""On the other hand,"" Mr. Bostock added, ""in this business over the last 10 years, the large agencies have all been subject to some shock of this kind. You have to be realistic and understand that."" **********When D.M.B.& B. completes its work on Budweiser, he said, ""we'll talk to anybody in the brewing business,"" including Miller. **********Charlie Claggett, the chief creative officer at D.M.B.& B. in St. Louis who became the office's managing director six months ago, was equally philosophical about the loss. **********""We've really been on a roll in the past 10 months,"" he said, ""gaining more than $170 million in new billings"" from accounts including Blockbuster Entertainment, Trans World Airlines and Ralcorp's Chex cereals. **********Those billings equal or slightly exceed the Anheuser-Busch assignments that D.M.B.& B. will lose to DDB Needham Chicago and the other agencies; Blockbuster, for example, is probably the office's biggest account, ahead of Anheuser-Busch. **********Mr. Claggett said that while ""I haven't had time"" to assess whether there would be layoffs in St. Louis, ""with all the new business we've won, we've got a number of open positions."" **********Another reason D.M.B.& B. executives are not more agitated about the loss, at least publicly, is that the account was once even larger. Many duties that the agency had handled for Anheuser-Busch, including media services and field service, were moved in-house in recent years, as the account shifted to a fee basis from a commission system of payment."

The motorist is sometimes taken hostage and later dumped along a roadside, left to watch his what may represent his life savings roll off in a cloud of red dust to a chop shop for dismantling or out of the country for resale. **********Everyone seems to know someone whose car has been hijacked if he himself has already not become a victim. Taxi drivers have been hijacked after dropping off their last passenger, truck drivers have been hijacked for their cargo of rice or cigarettes, and some people's B.M.W.'s have been hijacked, recovered and then hijacked again. **********The crime wave has resulted in part from the years of apartheid, when guns streamed into the country for the resistance and people grew accustomed to violence. **********""There is a contempt for the law because of a culture of violence,"" said Col. David Bruce, spokesman for the South African Police Service in the Johannesburg area. ""Your massacres and your political violence have dissipated. Now, I believe that violent crime is the biggest problem in South Africa."" **********The violence threatens to overwhelm the new Government as it tries to attend to the basic tasks of providing jobs and shelter. As reality has set in that it will take years for the Government to bridge the disparities created by apartheid between rich and poor, black and white, crime has soared. **********This year, carjackings have more than doubled in South Africa, rising in the Johannesburg area alone from 1,879 in the first six months of 1993 to 4,656 in the first six months of 1994. About 40 people have died in carjackings in Johannesburg this year and many others have been wounded. **********A motorist is 10 times more likely to be carjacked in South Africa than in the United States, where the rate is one carjacking for every 6,200 cars, according to figures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In South Africa, one out of every 600 cars is hijacked, according to police and insurance company figures. **********Every week, from the wealthy white suburbs north of here to the poorer black neighborhoods of Soweto, 200 vehicles are taken from their drivers at gunpoint. **********It happened to Mapula Plessy, a real estate agent, when she stopped for a traffic light in Soweto during rush hour one afternoon. Two young men came up to her B.M.W. with a 9-millimeter pistol. **********""The keys, sisi,"" she recalled one of them saying as he used the township term for 'sister. **********The motorists behind her, she said, nervously sped around her and never looked back. **********""I was left with nothing,"" she said. ""I felt paralyzed. People were standing there and did nothing."" **********It happened twice to Thabo Setaka, a truck driver. Once he was parked by the side of the road to finish some paperwork on the 450 bales of rice he was hauling. Two robbers came up to him with automatic weapons, took the truck and the rice and left him by the highway. **********The second time he and his crew thought they were being pulled over by plainclothes police officers doing cargo checks. The men were robbers instead and ordered them into another car to be dumped far from the carjacking site. **********Mr. Setaka looked closely at their faces, praying that they were strangers. ""I thought, ""Please, my God, I don't want to know them,' "" he said. ""If they know you, they will kill you. If you can recognize them, you are supposed to die."" **********He was spared. But when the police came in pursuit of the robbers, a co-worker was killed in the crossfire. **********What is in all the vehicles is quick money in a country where nearly half the people are unemployed and where the economy is trying to shake a recession. With the involvement of body shops and gangs, auto theft has become such an organized business here that some cars and parts are stolen to order, police and insurance officials say. **********Because of decades of isolation and protectionism that added heavy tariffs on imports to South Africa, car prices are wildly inflated; some cost more than the average house. In the great majority of cases, no one is arrested and the car is never found. That is partly because blacks, the primary victims of carjackings, are wary of going to the police out of fear of reprisal from the carjacker or suspicion of the police after decades of abuse under apartheid. **********The threat of a carjacking figures into people's everyday routines now. Some people no longer stop at traffic lights, especially at night. They just pause and move on. Some are careful not to drive with a full tank of gas, hoping that if the robbers find that the tank is near empty, maybe they will let them pass. **********Many insurance companies refuse coverage unless a car has an alarm system and some reject the priciest B.M.W.'s altogether. Insurance rates have risen 60 percent for some cars in the last year because of the increase in claims. Because of the cost, 70 percent of cars here have no insurance at all, said Damon Deavin, executive manager of the Aegis Insurance Group here. **********Fear has prompted motorists to seek ever more advanced means of protecting their cars, but robbers immediately find ways to decode or sidestep them. Nearly every new car includes a remote control alarm system and a device that prevents a would-be robber and sometimes even the hapless motorist from starting the engine unless the security system is overridden. **********""To make sure the driver doesn't use the cutoff device, they take the driver hostage,"" Mr. Deavin said. **********Some people like Timothy Jiyana have changed their driving habits now, riding only in certain kinds of cars, the more downscale and beat up the better. **********The other day a friend wanted Mr. Jiyana to help haul some equipment in a pickup truck like the one that was seized from him at gunpoint early one morning in Soweto. Mr. Jiyana said he preferred to ride in his old hatchback, which he figured nobody would want. **********""I told him, ""I will not ride with you,' "" Mr. Jiyana said. "" 'I will follow you. So if they take your buggy, I can give you a lift in my car.' """

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, bade elaborate farewell at the White House today, dousing each other with praise and gratitude for the American military operation that will return Father Aristide to power Saturday after 1,111 days in exile. **********""We've helped to curb the violence that threatened tens of thousands of Haitians, to secure our own borders, to bring democratically elected government to the 34th of our hemisphere's 35 nations,"" Mr. Clinton said at a ceremony before diplomats, lawmakers and a military band assembled on the White House driveway. ""In so doing, we have helped to give the people of Haiti a chance to remake the democracy they earned, they deserve, and they so plainly wish."" **********Mr. Clinton called Father Aristide an insightful and eloquent leader whose return is ""a victory for freedom around the world."" **********And Father Aristide, who once balked at endorsing the White House negotiations that are restoring him to office, had nothing but praise today. **********""Once again,"" he said, turning to Mr. Clinton at their rain-spattered podium, ""the people of Haiti thank you for the leadership that you have demonstrated. You just said 'bonne chance' to Haiti, and we say 'thank you so much.' "" **********At sunrise on Saturday, three airplanes bearing Father Aristide, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and congressional and Administration emissaries are to leave Washington for Port-au-Prince and a speech by Father Aristide at the Haitian presidential palace. **********Today, the White House denounced news accounts, including a report in The New York Times, stating that the Administration had effectively agreed to provide a luxurious exile for Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and the other members of the departing dictatorship. **********In particular, officials labeled as ""completely erroneous"" reports in The Times and elsewhere that have now been acknowledged as incorrect that General Cedras and some 600 military officers and supporters would regain control of $79 million in assets now frozen in financial institutions in the United States. **********""Most of that money is money that was the money of large business families in Haiti,"" the deputy national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said at a briefing. ""None of that money was Cedras or Biamby money."" **********Mr. Berger and other Administration officials said that the $79 million represented all the money that had been blocked in the accounts of Haitian civilians and military officers as of Sept. 15. They said that virtually all of that money, the bulk of which belonged to Haiti's business elite, was released to its owners on Oct. 6, some 10 days after Mr. Clinton made a speech at the United Nations calling for an end to economic sanctions against Haiti. **********What remained, the officials said, was several hundred thousand dollars at most, held by at least some of the 600 Haitian military officers who are denied access to United States accounts. The official could not say how many of those officers actually have bank accounts or other assets in this country. **********The President signed an executive order at today's ceremony that frees any accounts those officers may hold, and ends all other American economic sanctions, upon Father Aristide's return. **********Mr. Berger said the only assets directly linked to the Haitian dictators that remain frozen is a $1,000 check in the name of General Cedras's wife, Yannick. **********Asked where General Cedras and other military leaders have stored their gains from three years of military rule, Mr. Berger replied, ""I have no idea."" **********Private experts on Haiti said today that the Haitian generals probably made millions during their reign from control of state-run companies or by cornering the black market during the period in which Haiti was under an international economic embargo. But they said it is commonly assumed that the country's top rulers had moved most of their assets to places beyond the reach of American law. **********If President Aristide's return goes smoothly over the weekend, senior Pentagon officials said today, at least four ships and about 2,000 marines could leave Haiti by early next week. **********Under the plan, the American commander in Haiti, Lieut. Gen. Hugh Shelton. would turn over command of the operation to the head of the 10th Mountain Division, Maj. Gen. David Meade. **********Marines aboard two Navy ships off northern Haiti would return to their bases on the East Coast, as would the aircraft carrier America and the command ship Mount Whitney now in waters off Port-au-Prince. The Pentagon's plan is to reduce the number of American troops in Haiti to about 15,000 by the end of the month, from 19,200 now. **********Senior military officials cautioned that the troops scheduled to leave could stay longer if President Aristide's return sparks violence in Port-au-Prince or unrest in other parts of the country. **********The Administration also moved to defuse complaints about its decision to rent three luxury homes on the island from the departing General Cedras. Mr. Clinton's special emissary to Haiti, former Representative William H. Gray 3d, said the United States will pay $60,000 to rent the homes for a year, and that they will probably be sublet to groups moving or returning to Haiti with its return to democratic rule. **********In an election season in which he is viewed as a drag on many Democratic candidates, Mr. Clinton has missed no chance to rewind and play back the story of his Haiti success on the imposing White House stage. Today was perhaps his final opportunity, and he made the most of it. **********With the Haitian and American flags to his back, a Marine band tootling out the Haitian anthem ""La Dessalinienne"" to his right and one of his last-minute Haitian emissaries, the retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, the former Chairman of thge Joint Chiefs of Staff, in civilian blue in the front row before him, Mr. Clinton praised the nation's military as ""the steel and the sword of America's diplomacy."" **********As the cameras ground away, he asked a clutch of the audience, mostly women relatives of American servicemen in Haiti, to stand for the crowd's applause. And he reminded his listeners of his apparent success in staring down the Iraqi military, saying American forces are bringing ""a message of hope and confidence to the people of Kuwait."""

In what will be the end of an era, Mo Ostin said today he would step down after 25 years as head of Warner Brothers Records when his contract expires on Dec. 31. He will become a consultant to Time Warner Inc., the parent company. **********Lenny Waronker, the president of Warner Brothers Records for the last 12 years, will become chief executive, continuing a management reshuffling that began last month at the Warner Music Group and that has brought new heads to all three divisions. The group is made up of Warner Brothers Records, Elektra/East West and the Atlantic Records companies. **********While Mr. Waronker has considerable strength in working with new artists, having spent years as a record producer, he is thought to have lived in the shadow of Mr. Ostin, whose career is considered legendary. Mr. Ostin, 67, cultivated artists from Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Ella Fitzgerald to Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Prince, Madonna, R.E.M., and Candlebox. He managed Reprise Records for Frank Sinatra in the 60's and built Warner Brothers Records from scratch into one of the world's biggest labels. Put Burbank on the Map **********""His accomplishments are the greatest in the record business,"" said David Geffen, whose Geffen Record company had links with Warner Brothers Records when it began in 1980. ""Music was entirely a New York business until he put Burbank on the map."" **********While few other executives are as responsible for as many platinum and gold hits a year as Mr. Ostin, Warner Brothers' glow has faded somewhat, according to some in the industry. Warner's own Atlantic Records surpassed Warner Brothers Records, which also includes the Reprise and Sire labels, as the biggest recording company in the country. **********Of the 72 million recordings sold by Warner Music in this country so far this year, 43 percent are from Atlantic, compared with 39 percent from Warner Brothers, according to Soundscan Inc., which tracks record sales. **********The label is criticized for not having broken new acts and relying too heavily on established artists like Eric Clapton, Prince and Neil Young. Yet Mr. Ostin and Mr. Waronker say the label's success is a result of a balance between new and old, and point to two new groups, Candlebox and Green Day, as evidence of its ability to develop artists. Both groups were among Billboard's top 15 best-selling albums last week. New Releases Due Out **********And with nearly every star on the Warner Brothers roster coming out with new releases by the end of the year, some in the industry predict that Warner Brothers will have its best year. **********Mr. Ostin's departure is making way for younger executives to step into music's top ranks. Nowhere is this more visible than at Warner Music. In an attempt to focus the North American music operations, Robert J. Morgado, the chairman and chief executive of Warner Music, named Doug Morris in early July to the new position of president and chief operating officer of the American labels. Mr. Morris, 54, had turned around the ailing Atlantic group and was succeeded as president there by Danny Goldberg, 43. **********But Mr. Morris's promotion rattled Mr. Ostin and Robert Krasnow, who was then the head of the third Warner Music group, Elektra. Mr. Ostin had been accustomed to reporting directly to Time Warner's head, Gerald Levin, and Mr. Krasnow to Mr. Morgado. Feeling passed over, Mr. Krasnow, 59, abruptly resigned and was replaced by Sylvia Rhone, the 40-year-old head of the East/West label."

McNall, part-owner and president of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, was charged by Federal prosecutors today with defrauding banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans. **********Some lawyers in the case estimate the loans exceeded $200 million. **********Mr. McNall was charged with one count of conspiracy, two counts of bank fraud and one count of wire fraud in Federal District Court here. Tom Pollack, a lawyer for Mr. McNall, said in a statement today that his client had been negotiating with the Government since May and had been cooperating with a Federal grand jury's investigation of his banking practices. **********Mr. McNall could face a sentence of nine years in prison, according to lawyers in the case. He will be arraigned on Nov. 28. **********Mr. McNall will step down as president of the Kings, according to Mr. Pollack, but will continue working for the team and collecting a $400,000-a-year salary that was negotiated when he sold a controlling interest in the team in May before he was forced into bankruptcy. **********Mr. McNall is the sixth person to face charges in what prosecutors called a conspiracy to defraud several banks over a 10-year period. The others charged were Mr. McNall's auditor and employees of McNall Sports and Entertainment Inc. of Los Angeles, a holding company that owns sports franchises, film interests, horses and a stable, rare coins and sports memorabilia. **********Today's charges accuse Mr. McNall of inflating his personal worth by falsifying tax returns, financial statements and appraisal values to obtain loans from six lenders -- Bank of America, Bank of California, European American Bank, First Los Angeles Bank, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland and Union Bank. **********He is accused of using phony inventory and of hiding assets from bankers through the use of 10 sham companies. **********In the charges, prosecutors say Mr. McNall bribed officers, directors, agents and employees of the financial institutions by offering them ""things of value."" Prosecutors say one Bank of America loan officer personally received a $50,000 unsecured loan from Mr. McNall. Other lawyers involved say prosecutors are investigating various bankers' roles in the case. **********Other charges against Mr. McNall involve a rare-coin limited partnership that he managed for Merrill Lynch & Company. He is accused of diverting as much as $20 million from the partnership by setting up fake purchases and sales of coins by sham companies. **********In August, Merrill Lynch, in an attempt to distance itself from Mr. McNall's escalating problems, agreed to return the initial investments of about 3,500 investors in three funds sold by the firm and Mr. McNall in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The refunds could cost Merrill Lynch as much as $30 million. **********Mr. McNall was forced into bankruptcy in May after defaulting on $160 million in loans. He had to sell a 72 percent stake in the Kings, his biggest asset, to Jeffrey Sudikoff, a telecommunications executive, and Joseph Cohen, an entertainment executive, to repay another loan, for approximately $100 million, to the Bank of America. **********He owes creditors more than $200 million and his assets are slowly being liquidated by a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee."

""And the Asian countries are very wary of appearing to promote gambling."" Grundy adapts game shows for television audiences around the world. **********Another wheel of fortune rolled into Hong Kong last week as several thousand Asian and Western buyers and television broadcasters converged on MIP Asia, an international TV market and conference. **********As several U.S. companies unveiled major ventures in the region, local programming emerged as a key for Western producers. **********The market for TV programming in Asia is exploding. With 1 million cable subscribers, Shanghai has the highest percentage of cable penetration in the world. India, with a middle class as large as the entire U.S. population, doubled its number of TV channels this year to 40 last year. **********Forty additional satellites with the potential for carrying hundreds of new channels will be launched over Asia in the next three years. **********""The present light rain of channels will soon become a monsoon,"" said Niwat Boonsong, president of International Broadcasting Corporation Ltd. of Thailand. **********The most successful channels will invariably be the ones devoted to home-grown programming. Even MTV Networks, the music channel that reaches a quarter of a billion homes around the world, has seen the wisdom of tailoring its programs to local audiences. MTV India is already under way, and an MTV version in Mandarin and one subtitled in Korean are in the pipeline. MTV is a unit of Viacom Inc. **********""The global village with everyone watching the same programs is never going to be a reality,"" said Tom Freston, chief executive of MTV Networks. ""Local programming will drive the evolution of television - particularly in Asia."" **********A number of Western TV producers, including Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Children's Television Workshop, are poised to launch joint ventures for TV production in Asia. News Corp.'s STAR-TV and NHK, the Japanese state broadcaster, are also active in Asian coproductions. **********""The early players putting seed capital into East-West coproductions recognize that Asian viewers will soon grow tired of the novelty of unfamiliar Western programs,"" said Susan Schoenfeld, president of Advisors for International Media, a Hong Kong- based media consultancy. **********""The initial investors are being wary,"" she added. The most likely candidate for coproductions are game shows, children's animation, wildlife and other nonpolitical documentaries. Because of linguistic and cultural differences, drama series and situation comedies are proving problematic. **********STAR-TV, the News Corp. unit whose programs and films blanket the region, is engaged in secret negotiations with Chinese authorities on the creation of a ""large television-production center to transmit the full gamut of programs,"" according to John Olone, a program executive. He said the official announcement of the facility and its location should come in six to eight weeks. **********STAR-TV has just wrapped up a grueling season of soccer matches pitting provincial Chinese teams against one another for the first time. **********This coproduction with Chinese Central TV proved to be a ""logistical nightmare,"" Mr. Olone said, despite widespread viewership. In future coproductions, the broadcaster plans to streamline local staff, speed up programs and upgrade technical facilities. **********In addition to another soccer season, STAR will continue business programs in China and India, with several expanded programs under discussion. **********Michael Solomon, chairman of Solomon International Enterprises and former head of Warner Brothers Inc.'s TV production unit, was one of the first to recognize the potential for East-West joint ventures. He conjured up the concept of barter programming eight years ago in Shanghai. This system enables program suppliers to sign on advertisers in return for air time. **********At MIP Asia, Mr. Solomon announced a $35 million joint venture with Armitraj Entertainment to be based in Madras, India. The first coproductions will be two epic serials on the Raj period and another on an Indian deity. They will be shot back-to- back in English and Hindi. Solomon plans to export the programs to Indian-speaking communities in the West and then Westernize them for Latin American viewers. **********Chinese versions of Bert, Ernie and Miss Piggy are on the horizon. Children's Television Workshop has planned a coproduction of ""Sesame Street"" with STV of Shanghai. It will be distributed throughout China in the Mandarin language. **********As in other adaptations of ""Sesame Street,"" local curriculum specialists will tailor the programs, according to David Jacobs, a Children's Television Workshop vice president. ""The shows will address what's important to Chinese children, not to children around the world,"" Mr. Jacobs said. **********NHK, the Japanese broadcaster, is one of the most experienced co-producers in the region, with 43 projects launched last year, 10 of which were joint ventures with other Asian partners in China, Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Hong Kong. **********In the United States, NHK has coproduced critically acclaimed series on the world oil industry. ""Coproduction is an excellent means of discovering one another's cultures,"" said Nagari Tajima of NHK. **********But it is not always easy. In one historical documentary covering the Nanking massacre of Chinese civilians by Japanese soldiers, Chinese partners strongly objected to Japan's low estimate of the casualties. The diluted compromise solution was to omit mention of any numbers at all. **********With their Asian partners, the Japanese are contending with difficulties similar to those faced by American producers attempting to export to the region. ""American producers can get away for two or three years forcing a style unfamiliar to Asian viewers,"" Mr. Tajima said. ""After that, it won't work."""

It was the Saturday morning after Fox Television made its first test run as a broadcaster of professional football, a preseason National Football League game in San Francisco last month. **********In his Hollywood office, Mr. Hill, the president of Fox Sports, was recovering from the effort and ruminating over the performance. **********""I'm exhausted,"" he said. ""No one breathed for the first 20 minutes. Couldn't relax until the end credits ran. But we overcame any vestige of doubt that Fox could do football."" **********An official for a rival network called to say the game's rating was disappointing, that the baseball strike and Fox's months of tireless promotion should have caused a stampede to the fledgling network. **********""Hell, it was awesome!"" Mr. Hill shouts. ""First time out? Fox had never done football before? Awesome!"" **********Ever since Rupert Murdoch bid a breathtaking $1.58 billion last December for the television rights to the National Football Conference for the next four years, Mr. Hill has been scrambling to build a sports broadcasting division from scratch. The eccentric, 48-year-old Australian is an unqualified cheerleader for the start-up, usually brimming with bravado. But Mr. Hill has his moments of doubt. He has been spotted in his office, his head in his hands, and muttering, ""I'm bleeping scared."" **********""I have great mood swings,"" Mr. Hill conceded. ""I wake up a lot at 4 in the morning with a lot on my mind."" **********He should have a lot on his mind. It is up to Mr. Hill to make good on Mr. Murdoch's billion-dollar-plus gamble, one the biggest bets in the recent history of television. For Mr. Hill, as for the on-the-field quarterbacks like Troy Aikman and Randall Cunningham, the real season begins today. The network starts at noon with its one-hour ""Fox N.F.L. Sunday"" pregame studio show, then six games including the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys playing the Pittsburgh Steelers. **********For Fox, there is far more at stake than simply success or failure in football. It is a big step into the mass-market mainstream for the seven-year-old Fox Television Network, which has attracted youthful audiences with programs like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Melrose Place."" **********Featuring big-name N.F.C. teams from major metropolitan markets -- the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Redskins, Chicago Bears and others -- will attract new viewers to Fox, well beyond fans of Bart Simpson and Heather Locklear. **********Football is a crucial part of the audience-building drive at Fox, but there are others. After Fox outbid CBS for television rights to the N.F.C. -- NBC has the rights to the N.F.L.'s American Football Conference games, while ABC has Monday night games -- Mr. Murdoch invested $500 million for 20 percent of New World Communications. That deal will permit Fox to switch from weaker UHF stations in 12 cities to stronger VHF stations, including markets where it now has football rights like Detroit, Dallas and Atlanta. Eight of the 12 new stations Fox is picking up were CBS affiliates. **********Football, then, is a means to Mr. Murdoch's larger agenda at Fox -- enhancing its brand recognition, increasing the value of Fox stations and broadening the network's reach to the nearly 100 percent of American TV households touched by ABC, CBS and NBC. Today, Fox is available in 98.6 percent of all television households. Pro football should do a lot to bridge Fox's fourth-network credibility gap. **********It is only as a long-term investment to build the Fox franchise that the $1.58 billion Mr. Murdoch is paying for football television rights makes sense. He is, after all, spending 49 percent more than CBS paid for the previous four years. When the rights charges of $395 million a year are added to the operating costs for football programming, estimated at $100 million to $150 million annually, nobody expects Fox to make a profit on its four-year deal. **********Mr. Murdoch seems to regard questions about the pricetag as quibbling. ""Did we overpay?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Of course we did."" **********Fox Sports will be the most scrutinized sports start-up ever. ESPN, the last major TV sports kickoff, began in 1979 with a slow-pitch softball game. But Mr. Murdoch doesn't believe in half measures. ""We needed something people would come looking for,"" said Mr. Murdoch, who is now eyeing the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and baseball. ""We could have started with minor sports, but no one would have paid notice."" **********The established networks all built up their sports divisions gradually. When football began on CBS in 1956, the network paid teams separate fees, and there was no complete N.F.L. network package. William MacPhail, a former vice president of CBS Sports, recalls paying the Green Bay Packers $31,000 one year. In 1962, CBS struck its first network deal with the N.F.L. for $4.7 million. **********The times, and the stakes, have certainly changed. Even if Mr. Murdoch's move into pro football is less about profit than a patient bet to build Fox, the goal is still to attract audiences and limit the losses. Analysts expect Fox Sports to lose hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years as advertising is unable to keep up with costs, because Mr. Murdoch paid the N.F.L. so much for the rights. Still, the financial difference between success and failure could be sizable, and a real worry for the shareholders of the News Corporation, Fox's parent company, if things go poorly. **********""For a company like Fox to try to create a brand, using clearly definable programming like the N.F.L. makes great strategic sense,"" said Christopher Dixon, an analyst for Paine Webber. ""The question is at what cost. The jury will be out on that question until the end of the season."" **********Mr. Hill is the man in charge of managing this enormous financial bet. At first glance, he seems an unnerving choice. ""I'm a financial illiterate,"" he cheerfully confesses, while eating an onion and cheese sandwich in his office. **********His manner and personality bear little resemblance to the serious, deal-making executives who tend to head the sports divisions of other networks. On airplane trips, he plays the Tetris video game on his Nintendo Game Boy. He licks a male publicist on an earlobe to reward a suggestion. A man of eclectic interests, he is learning Yiddish expressions. So he has taken to scribbling newly learned Yiddish words on the back of his appointment book: ""nebbish,"" ""schmear"" and ""mensch."" **********Mr. Hill's notion of a business night out in Chicago recently was to take his staff to a blues bar, where he gushed over legendary guitarist Buddy Guy, who owns the place. A devoted surfer, Mr. Hill loves Bruce Brown's 1966 cult documentary about surfers, ""The Endless Summer,"" and he attended the premiere of its sequel this year. His daughter Anne's birth announcement in June was accompanied by a quotation from Martin Farquhar Tupper, a 19th century English writer. **********Mr. Hill's philosophy for success in sports programming is simple: be generous in signing up name-brand talent and make sure the production is slick and cutting-edge. Audience ratings and revenues, he figures, will follow. ""As much a business dyslexic as I am, I know that,"" he said. **********He has spared little expense in hiring well-known football commentators and personalities. Fox is paying John Madden, football's manic Rabelaisian wit, a total of $30 million for four years, making him the highest paid man, on the field or behind a microphone, in the sport. Pat Summerall, Mr. Madden's longtime partner at CBS, will get $1.5 million a year. Terry Bradshaw, the former star quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, will collect $1.75 million annually from Fox. A sportscasting newcomer, Jimmy Johnson, who left as coach of the Cowboys last year, after winning two Super Bowls, has been signed up for $600,000 a year. **********BESIDES high-priced on-the-air talent, Fox is banking on the sports programming instincts of Mr. Hill. First in Australia, and later for Mr. Murdoch's Sky Television in Britain, Mr. Hill adapted the tools of American sports TV by using more cameras in more locations, instant replays, enhanced graphics and flashier analyst commentary. For coverage of the America's Cup yacht races in 1987 in Australia -- ""little triangles on blue water,"" he calls it -- he put tiny cameras aboard yachts for close-up coverage. **********""I saw a guy who cared absolutely nothing about boating bring that event alive,"" said Geoff Mason, the former executive producer of ABC Sports. **********In 1988, Mr. Murdoch hired Mr. Hill away from the rival Nine Network, owned by another Australian entrepreneur, Kerry Packer. ""The Nine Network was always our competition, and Hill was a legendary figure in Sydney,"" Mr. Murdoch recalled. The Hill reputation was based largely on using American sports programming techniques to alter the look and quicken the pace of soccer, cricket, yachting and auto racing. **********MR. MURDOCH liked Mr. Hill's work in Australia so much that he soon gave Mr. Hill two sports start-ups in Europe to direct: Eurosport, a pan-European cable sports service, much like ESPN, which Mr. Murdoch eventually sold, and Sky Sports, a fast-growing British network for satellite dish owners. **********What Mr. Hill did to cricket programming, first in Australia, and then in Britain, is typical of his approach. The sport of flat bats, white pullover sweaters and tea breaks is decidedly slow-moving -- so much so that cricket's detractors say that you can gain weight while playing the sport. Mr. Hill abhors boredom, and he was committed to accelerating the pace of cricket, at least for television viewers. A smile comes over Mr. Hill's ruddy face, topped by bushy white curls, when he describes the changes he made and the mixed reaction to his innovations in presenting the tradition-steeped sport. **********With a black marker, Mr. Hill sketches a circular cricket field with two triangles on top to depict the conventional locations of television cameras, behind the batsmen (hitter) and facing the bowler (pitcher). **********""Cricket was always covered from one end, so the bowler bowls from one end, and all you'd see is the batsman's butt,"" Mr. Hill recalled. ""That was stupid, so we put cameras at the other end as well . . . This was regarded as the end of civilization."" **********Then came the duck. Mr. Hill ordained that an animated duck waddle across the TV screen when a batsman whiffed to illustrate the term, ""out for a duck."" The first time he used the duck animation, Mr. Hill did not give any advance warning to the commentator, who had once captained the Australian national team. When he saw it, the ex-cricket star, with voice shaking, said, ""It's obvious David Hill never played cricket!"" **********And Ian Woolridge, sports columnist for The Daily Mail of London, said, ""Bloody ducks ruined cricket for me. Hilly is totally, absolutely mad. Bonkers -- with a 10-dimensional mind."" **********Paul Fox, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph of London, observed, ""Hill changed cricket beyond all recognition."" **********WHEN Sky Sports acquired Premier League English soccer, Mr. Hill dubbed the weekly presentation ""Monday Night Football"" as homage to the long-running ABC series created by his idol, Roone Arledge, the sports-programming impresario who started ABC's long-running weekly football game broadcast. **********But does Mr. Hill know American football? Mr. Hill pondered the question one June evening in the backyard of a rented Brentwood house he shares with his third wife, Joan, and their infant daughter, Anne. **********""How much do I know about football?"" he asked aloud. **********""He doesn't know much,"" said Barry Frank, Madden's agent. ""I'm not sure if he'll know if some of the people he's hired are good or not."" **********""He's absorbed the visceral element,"" said Tim Green, a neophyte Fox analyst. ""Now he's working his way outward on the technical aspects."" **********Mr. Hill's football I.Q. is good, not great. He knows big names, big plays. He loves the hitting, the sounds, the drama, the quick turnarounds in fortune. He knows Emmitt Smith, the Dallas Cowboys running back, from Emmett Kelly, the famed sad-faced circus clown. **********Yet Mr. Hill, colleagues say, favors a wide open and loose management style, so Fox Sports is not depending on his grasp of American football minutiae. Although he is a protean chatterer -- a ""human filibuster,"" his friend, film director Peter Faiman, says -- he listens well, and gives his executives extensive free reign. **********THE lavish start-up means satisfying the wish lists of defectors from other networks. Sandy Grossman, Mr. Madden's CBS director, will present Fox games with 12 cameras, four more than he had at CBS. **********Mr. Hill's core group has worked merciless hours, and many are smoking so much it seems that Marlboro has bought a sponsorship at Fox Sports. Rick Dovey, Mr. Hill's chief of staff at Sky Sports, said that pace is nothing new: ""It was easy to work for Hill as long as you wanted to work 100 hours a week. He doesn't organize well but picks people to put his vision into effect."" **********Most importantly, Mr. Hill has satisfied Mr. Madden, a 21st-round draft choice of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1958, who is now the highest paid man -- the Cowboys' quarterback Troy Aikman is next, averaging $6.25 million a year -- in all of football. Mr. Madden refused Capital Cities/ABC and General Electric's NBC, whose offer included a G.E. train to travel to games. **********MR. MADDEN is the totem for Fox Sports. He's in the most promotional spots. He was host of one of Fox's pre-season specials. He adorned the cover of TV Guide. He will call virtually every important game, including the 1997 Super Bowl. He is a happy man, for aside from his hardware, shoe, video game and athlete's foot spray endorsements, Mr. Madden is consumed by football. So, for now, is Fox. **********""They'll listen to anything,"" Mr. Madden said. ""At CBS, we'd do some of my ideas and not others. Anything I've thought we ought to do at CBS, we'll do at Fox. It's selfish, but Fox Sports is only football."" **********If Fox's game telecasts match the quality attained by Madden & Company at CBS, Mr. Hill will be satisfied. That will be a big challenge given the intricate choreography required of American football programming with its constant replays, instant on-screen diagrams of plays and cutting from one camera to another. And behind Fox Sports's big-name stars are a corps of low-priced, mainly young announcers who have called few if any football games. **********Besides the additional on-field cameras, Fox Sports is changing the weekly pregame schedule with an hour-long studio show, compared with CBS's 30-minute program, ""The N.F.L. Today."" **********Fox, by all accounts, faces a huge challenge in trying to attract a football audience as large as CBS had, given the smaller network's more limited reach. But Mr. Hill's staff is not conceding any losses yet. ""Say we get 90 percent of the CBS football audience,"" said Tracy Dolgin, executive vice president of marketing. ""I have to get 10 percent percent back. If I don't, I'll hold a gun to my head -- after I'm fired."" **********Still, the top Fox executives are more concerned with using football to build the network's franchise than with this season's audience ratings. ""We'll build our coverage, strengthen our affiliates and increase revenues year after year,"" said Chase Carey, the chairman of Fox Television. ""No question that after four years, the N.F.C. deal will be materially profitable for us."" **********Mr. Hill obviously hopes so. But he also has to worry week to week. Before the kickoff today, he seemed to be suffering from some preseason jitters, his moods swinging between confidence and anxiety. **********In a self-assured moment, he said, ""In reality, this isn't so hard. If you never think you can fail, you probably won't."" **********Yet later, Mr. Hill ruefully joked, ""What's that the captain of the Titantic said? 'How's it going? Fine!'

The United States court of appeals threw out a summary judgment in favor of Danbury issued in June by a Federal district court that found that Bristol-Myers's patent on the drug, which it sells under the brand name Buspar, was invalid. The appeals court sent the case back to the Federal district court for trial. Bristol-Myers had filed a lawsuit against Danbury in 1992 to block the company from making a generic version of buspirone, contending that Danbury's efforts would infringe its patent. Buspar brought in sales last year of $240 million, or about 2 percent of Bristol-Myers's earnings of $11.4 billion."

Microsoft produces Microsoft Money, which has not made much of a dent in Quicken sales, despite collaborative agreements with several large banks that link the program to their personal-computer home banking services. **********Intuit shares closed today at $47, up $2.375 in Nasdaq trading, after moving up $1.875 in heavy volume on Tuesday. Microsoft shares rose 43.8 cents today to close at $56.25. **********The rumor arose Monday in ""Notes from the Field,"" a Silicon Valley gossip column in the trade magazine Infoworld. **********Further fueling the rumors was the abrupt cancellation Tuesday of a planned link between Microsoft Money and Chase Manhattan's home banking services, which was scheduled to be announced this week. Neither company would comment on why the announcement was canceled. Some industry analysts said that investors might see a link between the Infoworld column and the Microsoft-Chase Manhattan cancelation, causing them to bid up Intuit's stock. **********While Microsoft could easily afford to buy Intuit, which has a market value of $560.5 million based on today's closing price, analysts were skeptical that such a deal was in the works. Although Intuit has broadened its product line, in part through internal development, and in part through the acquisition last year of Chipsoft, which produced tax software, none of these other products is nearly as successful as Quicken. **********And while Microsoft has shown a greater willingness to acquire companies recently, its usual practice is to stick with its own products, even when they are slow starters. **********One analyst saw Intuit's stock movement as based less on rumors and more on the company's fundamentals. David Readerman, an analyst with Unterberg Harris, noted that Intuit's president, Scott Cook, spoke today at an industry conference. ""People like the Intuit story because he's pushing into financial planning now, probably talking about some linkups with insurance companies,"" Mr. Readerman said. ""There isn't much competition there."" **********Intuit is shipping a new enhanced version of Quicken this week that includes additional financial planning assistance on a multimedia CD-ROM. The disk includes video clips of Jane Bryant Quinn, a financial columnist for Newsweek, and Marshall Loeb, the former editor of Fortune and Money magazines, offering advice on investment strategies, as well as data on various mutual funds. Mr. Cook, Intuit's chairman, has said the company will expand its financial planning offerings."

A widely held view here is that if the United States President is going out of his way to visit a country that his own Administration lists as a sponsor of terrorism, then he must come away with a significant concession from Mr. Assad. **********""I don't believe he can afford to go there for free,"" a high-ranking Government official said. **********The Israelis would be delighted if Mr. Clinton's price is an agreement by Mr. Assad to resume direct negotiations with Israel, which had been going on for more than two years until they were broken off in February. Since then, the Syrians and Israelis are not known to have talked to each other except through the Americans, mainly Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his advisers. **********That indirect approach has not been fruitless. Differences have perceptibly narrowed on the core questions: what kind of peace is Syria ready to offer Israel, and how soon, if at all, are the Israelis prepared to withdraw all of their forces and settlements from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967? **********But the progress is glacial compared with the almost lightning speed with which Israel and Jordan settled their disputes, even allowing for the fact that the Israeli-Syrian issues are more complicated and laden with problematic security considerations. **********Still, many Israelis sense that after the giant peace steps they have taken in the last year with Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization, a deal with Syria is not far off. **********Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, making the first visit by a Cabinet-level Israeli official to the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain, predicted today that a peace settlement with Syria would be reached in 1995. **********The Syrians have not hidden their displeasure with King Hussein of Jordan for striking out boldly on his own instead of holding back and waiting for the ""comprehensive"" Arab peace with Israel that Damascus champions. But Syria has done nothing to try reining in the Jordanians -- perhaps because the automatic veto it once commanded no longer exists -- and it has wished the King well. **********As for itself, Syria promised today in advance of the Clinton visit to make ""all-out efforts"" to bring about a peace ""based on justice, comprehensiveness and dignity."" Translation: Israel must give up the entire Golan Heights and all other territories captured from the Arabs in 1967. **********""It's possible to expect that on one or two issues there will be Syrian progress toward our positions,"" Itamar Rabinovich, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, said on Israel Radio today. For example, he said, Mr. Assad might agree to stretch out the period of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, from the year Syria demands to something closer to the five years that the Israelis want. **********But Mr. Rabinovich added: ""I don't expect here that Assad will immediately double or triple the period he proposed. That simply is not his style."" **********In fact, other officials said, Mr. Assad's style is very much to take his time while asserting his primacy in the Arab world. One reason Mr. Clinton may be going to Damascus, they said, is not because he expects stunning achievements, but because he cannot risk the damage to peace talks by snubbing Mr. Assad entirely during this quick swing through the region."

Indeed, as the onetime movie star again takes up the cudgels for art and antiquity as Greece's Minister of Culture, she seems almost to relish the fray. **********Since she and other Greek Socialists returned to power in October, Ms. Mercouri has served notice of an array of plans to refurbish her nation's heritage, from Athens to the Aegean. She has also become embroiled in something of a brawl. **********At issue is her public assertion that part of a magnificent 1,081-item collection of Minoan antiquities owned by Constantine Mitsotakis, the former Prime Minister, stems from illegal excavations. Mr. Mitsotakis denies any wrongdoing and has warned that he may sue. **********Dismissively, Ms. Mercouri says he would be ""a little ridiculous"" to go through with the threat for, she says, there are other things at stake. **********""This is a moral issue,"" she said in an interview. **********""This is mudslinging,"" Mr. Mitsotakis said at a news conference. The Pursuit of the Fallen **********But as the duel between two titans of Greece's public life consumes the column inches in the newspapers here, it seems clear that Ms. Mercouri's impassioned campaign to protect Greece's ancient heritage risks becoming entwined with a much newer practice: the pursuit of those stripped of protection because they have fallen from power. **********It is, however, a tradition that the conservative Mr. Mitsotakis himself revived when he took office as Prime Minister in 1990 after defeating his Socialist nemesis, Andreas Papandreou. Mr. Mitsotakis sought to bring Mr. Papandreou to trial on phone-tapping and corruption charges, but they were ultimately dropped. **********Mr. Papandreou and his Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement did not forget the attack. After the Socialists returned to power last October in a stunning electoral comeback, they turned the tables and are now seeking to prosecute Mr. Mitsotakis on charges of ordering illegal wiretaps, including some on the telephones of his own supposed supporters. **********""It is becoming a cycle in Greece that once you get power you bring in your family, try to throw your opponents in jail and pardon any of your own who'd been in trouble,"" said a business executive who insisted on anonymity. ""Then, when you lose power, the same happens to you."" **********Parliament, dominated by Mr. Papandreou's followers, has voted to give amnesty to a Socialist official caught out in an illicit grain deal. **********[ Parliament voted on Jan. 28 to form a commission to determine whether it should vote on bringing wiretapping charges against Mr. Mitsotakis. ] **********Then there is the antiquities business, bubbling to the surface after years of public pondering about the provenance of the Minoan relics that Mr. Mitsotakis has displayed so proudly to visitors, including former President George Bush. **********For all it has come to resemble a public slugging match, the claims and denials hovering over Mr. Mitsotakis's collection go to the core of Greece's heritage. As in other lands like Italy, Egypt and Turkey where antiquity assumes huge commercial and financial overtones in modern times, the central question is: how can ancient treasures be protected from exploitation by the few and be used for the benefit of all? **********The question is all the more pertinent in Greece in light of a 60-year-old law, initially intended to prevent foreigners from stripping the land of its archeological assets, that permits licensed Greek collectors like Mr. Mitsotakis and many others to declare their collections to the authorities without saying how they came by them. **********In Mr. Mitsotakis's case, Ms. Mercouri ordered Culture Ministry archeologists to inspect the collection, which he maintains in his home in the Cretan town of Hania and which includes ancient gold coins, jewels, scarab seals and many other items. **********Then she announced that Mr. Mitsotakis had enlarged his collection while he held high office at a time when illegal excavations had been carried out at Cretan sites. **********""I didn't want to make a campaign,"" Ms. Mercouri said in an interview in her Athens office. ""It was my duty, without passion or hate."" **********The ""moral issue,"" she said, is whether high officials should be able to make use of their office to benefit from unlawful activities and lenient legislation. **********The Mitsotakis family does not see it that way. ""I don't think there's any doubt that the case is one of political expediency,"" said Dora Bakoyianni, the daughter of Mr. Mitsotakis and Culture Minister in his Government. ""Those with knowledge of antiquities collections know that it is not possible for the collector to verify the origin of all items -- nor is he obliged to."" **********The dispute has diverted attention from some of the broader campaigns for which Ms. Mercouri wants to be remembered during her latest stint as Culture Minister. An Ambitious Program **********At age 70 and in uncertain health, the former actress, who starred in such movies as ""Never on Sunday"" (1960) and ""Topkapi"" (1964), remains the most exotic of Greek Socialists. **********Her sentences slide easily from Greek to English to French as she outlines ambitions that include the creation of a new archeological park in central Athens, the rehabilitation of Aegean antiquities, the introduction of art at first-grade level in European schools and, as ever, the return to Greece of the Elgin Marbles from the British Museum in London. **********The vast trove of antiquities was removed from the Parthenon in the early 19th century by Lord Elgin, then Britain's Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. The campaign against the British is one she has been fighting for more than 10 years. **********""I will never stop on the Elgin Marbles,"" she said. **********Such is her passion about them, she said, that when a planned museum opens in Athens in the lee of the Acropolis, ""we will leave one room empty to wait for the marbles."""

The first 91 left on Wednesday after being trapped in Haiti for more than a month. **********The 91 refugees made it safely across the border on a bus into the Dominican Republic, the first political refugees to leave the country since the United Nations sanctioned an American-led invasion of Haiti. **********A spokesman for the American Embassy here, Stanley Schrager, said Haitian officials had agreed to let about two buses make the trip each week. **********While news of the departure gave refugees hope, some said they would remain in hiding because they were certain that the military and its civilian backers would hurt or even kill them if they found them. Many of the political refugees are supporters of Haiti's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. **********Haiti's acting foreign minister, Charles David, confirmed today at a news conference that the administration had agreed to allow some 1,100 refugees to leave the country. Another 1,000 or so Haitians will soon receive documents and approval they need from the United States and international organizations for migrants and will join a waiting list. **********For more than a month the Haitian military leaders t have refused to allow the refugees to leave. Several have been beaten, raped and threatened since the United States granted them asylum, and almost all are in hiding around Port-au-Prince. **********It is the second time this week that Haiti has complied with requests from the United Nations and the international community.

But Mr. David gave no hint of that at a news conference this afternoon. **********He said the retirement of Haiti's military leader, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who led the 1991 coup against Father Aristide, was not even being considered. The United States has demanded that general resign to make way for Father Aristide."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/31/world/france-tries-new-tack-on-jobs-for-young.html,Alan Riding,1994-03-31,,751,,The New York Times,World,News,article,France Tries New Tack on Jobs for Young,France Tries New Tack on Jobs for Young," **********Hoping to forestall new student protests called for Thursday, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur today revoked a Government decree allowing young people to be paid less than the minimum wage and proposed instead that employers be rewarded for hiring those under 25. **********Thrown onto the defensive by three weeks of demonstrations, Mr. Balladur suspended the decree for one week on Monday to allow time for a new policy to be drawn up. But students have continued protests in many cities to press their demand for the decree's formal withdrawal. **********With students preparing a new mass demonstration here Thursday, the announcement from Mr. Balladur's office today had every appearance of being rushed, not least because talks between a top Government official and representatives of students, trade unions and employers have barely begun. **********While loudly proclaiming victory today, however, many student leaders said the protest on Thursday should go ahead to underscore young people's demand for assured employment when they complete their studies. At present, one in four French under 25 is out of work. An Image of Weakness **********The three-week-old dispute has proved costly to Mr. Balladur, whose popularity rating has fallen sharply for the first time since he took office a year ago. Having abandoned policies in face of street protests on two earlier occasions, his latest retreat has also given him an image of weakness. **********Further, while intended to create job opportunities, his decree lowering the minimum wage for young people has had the effect of awakening a long-docile and apolitical student population to the frustrations and difficulties that await them on the job market. **********The so-called youth wage -- varying between 30 percent and 80 percent of the $1,000 monthly minimum wage, depending on the employee's qualifications -- had been drawn up to encourage employers to hire young people at a time when many companies were looking to cut costs and shrink their staffs. **********Today, the Government said it would instead pay companies the equivalent of $175 a month for nine months for every young person given his or her first job. Describing the plan as ""an incentive to anticipate the emerging economic recovery,"" it added that the subsidy would be $350 a month for every job created before Oct. 1 this year. **********Michel Bon, the head of the National Employment Agency, who was given the job of finding a substitute for the youth wage, said the program could help as many as 500,000 youths and would cost around $1 billion in 1994 alone. The Government is already struggling with a $50 billion budget deficit this year. Student Leader Disapproves **********One student leader, David Rousset, said he disapproved of the incentive program because it involved giving ""more money"" to companies instead of channeling the funds toward training programs for the unemployed. Other leaders demanded that the Government drop all charges against youths arrested during protests and order the return of two young Algerians deported from France after joining demonstrations in Lyons last week. **********The opposition Socialist Party, looking to revive itself after being drubbed in parliamentary elections last March, has jumped at the chance of exploiting the Government's embarrassment, with Jean Glavany, the party's spokesman, describing Mr. Balladur's policies as ""three steps forward, three steps back."" **********Mr. Glavany said the entire dispute was avoidable. ""Now we must rebuild hope among these young people and it will be more difficult,"" he said. ""The mistake was to think you could speculate with the anguish of young people."" Michel Rocard, the party's leader, said revocation of the decree was ""late but necessary."" **********In government for 10 of the last 13 years, the Socialists were in fact no more successful than Mr. Balladur's conservative coalition in bringing down unemployment, which, with the exception of the late 1980's, has risen steadily since the mid-1970's. Today, 3.3 million French, or 12.2 percent of the work force, are unemployed. **********The Government's mishandling of the youth wage conflict and the accompanying drop in the 64-year-old Prime Minister's popularity have nonetheless had the effect of breathing life into the campaign for the May 1995 elections to pick a successor to President Francois Mitterrand. **********Until recently, Mr. Balladur was the strongest contender for the conservative nomination, but his recent troubles have encouraged his two main coalition rivals, former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, as well as Mr. Rocard, the likely Socialist candidate."

""Her father and brothers have disowned her. She wants money to get married again. We will give her $75."" **********The six men seated in the room nodded in agreement and the group moved on to the next request. **********More than the fiery words and promise of change of the militant movement, such scenes have served to give the militants broad appeal among Egypt's huge underclass.  And it is such scenes that the Government, in a new program to win over the poor, has begun to combat aggressively. **********A few blocks from where the sheik held court, women and children stood patiently in line outside the beige walls of a new Government medical center. A prominent sign on the wall read, ""In the name of God the Beneficent, the Merciful."" Patients pay 15 cents for medical and dental care. **********The clinic is part of a nationwide effort to meet the needs of Egyptians living in areas of militant activity.  Here in the Imbaba slum, the effort also includes miles of newly paved roads, a new sewer system, more garbage collection, a vegetable market, a youth center, three new bus lines, improved electrical service and water lines. **********The Government has invested more than $10 million in the slum and will spend more than $200 million in other poor neighborhoods and villages this year. Over all, the Government says, it will spend $1.5 billion on slums, poor villages and shantytowns over the next three to five years. **********""This is a political war, not a religious war,"" said Abdel Rehim Shehata, the Governor of Giza Province, which includes much of Cairo. ""Religion is used as a banner by the terrorists to exploit those suffering from poverty and unemployment, to exploit those living in filth or those who cannot get their children into schools. The violent clashes that took place in Imbaba were the least that should have happened, given the living conditions we found there. Actually, there probably should have been more violence."" **********The Government's response to the recent flash flood and fire from an oil explosion that killed hundreds in southern Egypt showed the importance the Government now places on helping the poor. **********After an earthquake rocked Cairo in 1992, Government workers failed to appear for days and Islamic charities provided much of the relief. But such charities were banned from the area of the flood and fire, and the Government sent in senior officials to supervise relief efforts. **********Since underground Islamic groups began their campaign to topple the Government in 1992, more than 460 people, mostly militants and policemen, have been killed. **********""This is just another attempt by the Government to steal money,"" Sheik Ali said. ""Local officials just pocket the money. They have paved a few roads, but what about the sewers? Whatever they do, we will always control Imbaba."" **********Imbaba, its one million people crammed into tottering mud-walled buildings and narrow dirt alleys, once harbored this city's most violent militant cells. **********Gangs of militants armed with knives and clubs roamed the slum, attacking Christians, burning video shops, forcing people to hand over money and assaulting women who did not cover their heads. There were many parts of the slum that policemen feared to enter after dark. **********But police sweeps, coupled with the Government aid, have forced the militants to retreat. Terrorist attacks have decreased, and the new social services have won the Government a few converts. **********""After the Government crackdown on the militant groups, they came in and built us a hospital and a youth center,"" said Rabe Sayid Ahmed, a 20-year-old truck driver. ""It came as a big surprise to us that the Government started to care."" **********Osama Abdel Meguid, an 18-year-old, once spent his afternoons listening to militant leaders call for the overthrow of the Government in small storefront mosques. ""But now I go to the youth club,"" he said, ""and a lot of my friends who were always getting arrested go there too."" **********But the country's slow rate of economic growth, just 2 percent in the last three years, and the influx of 400,000 new laborers into the work force each year, has led to a steady decline in living standards for most of the country's 60 million people.  Hassan Mohammed, a 56-year-old father of six children, sat on the newly paved Luxor Street playing dominoes with a group of men. A donkey cart ambled past a pile of fetid garbage a few yards away. Laundry hung from small balconies and windows to dry in the dusty air. **********""There are no jobs,"" he said.  ""Children walk a mile to school and many of us do not have clean water.  You still need connections and money to get what you need. Even at the new school you must bribe a teacher with $20 to get your child enrolled.  The poor, like me, remain poor."" **********His friend Ahmed Ali, a 47-year-old baker, looked up from the board. ""I pay our local policeman $30 a month or he will shut my bakery down,"" he said, ""and I only make $150 a month. How do you expect us to feel about the Government, no matter how much they build, when the officials exploit us like this?"""

Treasury bill rates were down as well, with the average down about three-hundredths of a percentage point. **********While the dollar did stabilize somewhat, it is still considered weak, and that weakness limited any real advances by Treasury securities yesterday. Most market participants continue to view this market as a bear market, or at best as one that is caught in a trading range. **********The only distractions to investors yesterday came in the form of the Johnson Redbook report on retail sales and the Treasury's $17.25 billion auction of two-year notes. **********The Johnson Redbook report yesterday showed sales down 1.5 percent for the three weeks ended Aug. 20 compared with July. **********The high yield at the two-year auction was 6.27 percent. But that was below the 6.30 percent yield than many traders expected and 10 basis points below last month's auction. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********After the auction, the demand for the two-year note seemed to continue, as the price fell further, and the yield in the when-issued market ended late in the day at 6.25 percent. **********Hugh A. Johnson, a senior vice president and chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said that the competitive bids on the issue were impressive at $1.5 billion. Substantial institutional interest, he said, made it easy for the Treasury to auction the two-year notes at a very attractive interest rate. ""It was particularly good news to see large institutions such as banks buy the two-year issue so heavily, because they have been certainly reducing the buying of Treasuries and increasing their lending,"" he said. **********If there were no other auctions this week, he added, the market would have finished with strong gains. ""Unfortunately, we still have to work our way through tomorrow's auction of five-year notes, and that promises to be much more difficult,"" he said. **********In when-issued trading, the five-year note yesterday was trading at a price to yield 6.94 percent, a four- basis-point improvement from the previous day as investors' interest in the issue grew. **********According to Mr. Johnson, one of the reasons that investors are nervous about the dollar's recent declines is that they fear the falling dollar will alienate foreign investors. **********""We depend a great deal less on foreign capital to meet our borrowing today than at anytime in the last 10 years,"" he said. ""But that does not mean that foreign investors with big positions in United States bonds cannot put enormous pressure on our bond markets by selling in response to a decline in the dollar for fear their investments will lose value."" **********A second concern is that a falling dollar adds to inflation through the higher prices paid for foreign goods sold here. These price increases also provide an umbrella under which American manufacturers may begin to raise their own prices. **********Raising short-term rates to defend the dollar will not necessarily lead to a stable dollar or its strengthening, said Mr. Johnson, who said the Fed had provided only a patchwork defense of the dollar so far, including intervention in the currency markets. ""But Mr. Greenspan also believes that a strong economic policy which fosters strong growth and low inflation will help the dollar,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""On that score he's dead right."" **********The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) High Yield . . . 6.27%  Low Yield . . . 6.23%  Median Yield . . . 6.26%  Accepted at low price . . . 22%  Total applied for . . . $56,426 736  Accepted . . . $17,256,732  Noncompetitive . . . $1,504,000  Interest set at . . . 6.25%  The two-year notes mature on Aug. 31, 1996."

Another goal is to attract tenants to the area, which is also known as Houston's ""Second Downtown,"" six miles west of the central business district. Five vacant office buildings in the neighborhood are glaring reminders of the city's overbuilt office market. **********Uptown Houston, a half-square-mile area just outside Loop 610, the city's inner beltway, has 4,500 hotel rooms, more than 100 restaurants, 1,700 high-rise residential units, 4 million square feet of retail space and 24 million square feet of office space. **********Its retail stores ring up more than $1 billion in sales annually, and a healthy 94 percent of the retail space is leased. But only 79.4 percent of the office space is occupied. Despite an average rental rate of just $12.53 a square foot a year, nearly five million square feet of office space remain empty. **********""In a market where everyone is competing for the same tenants, a distinct image will allow us to compete at a much higher level,"" said John R. Breeding, president of the Uptown Houston Association, a private, nonprofit organization overseeing the tax-financed renovation program. **********""We want to give the area a high-quality image and create an environment where major retailers, hotel chains and new companies looking for office space will want to locate,"" he said. **********The project, scheduled for completion in early 1995, will coordinate street lighting, signs, landscaping and sculpture to give the district a distinctive visual style. **********The centerpieces of the modernistic design by Communication Art of Boulder, Colo., will be six stainless steel arches that will span Post Oak Boulevard at intervals along a one-mile stretch. The polished arches, reaching more than three stories high, will be anchored on both sides of the boulevard by 12 ""pocket parks,"" each about 100 feet wide by 20 feet deep. Each park will have a whimsical feature -- bronze cowboy boots; a 14-foot stainless steel sofa; a fountain representing the planet Texas. **********One of the most striking elements of the design will be 42-foot-diameter stainless steel rings suspended from 55-foot-high poles above the district's seven major intersections. **********The area is one of five major office submarkets in and around the 581-square-mile city. All have been forced into sharp competition as relocations and cutbacks by corporations have reduced demand for space. The downtown and uptown areas have been especially hurt by a migration to outlying areas by companies trying to reduce commuting times on Houston's congested freeways. **********The overall Houston office market, which has 139 million square feet, has inched its way up from a low of 71 percent occupancy in 1987 to slightly above 79 percent today. **********But even with those gains, people in the real estate industry still feel uneasy. One worrisome factor is what H. Lee Goodwin, senior director of Cushman & Wakefield of Texas Inc., refers to as pent-up excess space. The weak market has forced a number of tenants to hold onto large blocks of space that they would like to shed. As soon as the vacancy problem shows signs of easing, those tenants will begin to unload their unwanted space, Mr. Goodwin said. **********""It could take Houston 10 years to get out of the hole,"" Mr. Goodwin said. **********Still, uptown is no worse off than most other areas of the city, according to Patrick O'Connor, president of the Houston appraisal and research firm O'Connor & Associates. And other areas do not have the Galleria, with its 1.7 million square feet of luxury retail shops on three levels around an ice-skating rink. The mall is one of Houston's top tourist attractions. **********""Uptown Houston has already gained its reputation on the coattails of the Galleria, but the new street design will help crystallize and focus the image and give it something tangible to identify itself,"" Mr. O'Connor said. **********The $11 million project is being financed by bonds sold by the Harris County Improvement District No. 1, which was formed by the State Legislature in 1987 at the request of area property owners. The bonds will be repaid by taxes imposed on property owners at a rate of 10 cents per $100 of assessed property value. **********According to Mr. Breeding, the assessed value of all land and improvements in the district totals $1.8 billion. That means the tax will yield $1.8 million annually, half of which will be used to retire debt and the rest spent on street and landscape maintenance and traffic planning, he said. **********""This is a case of property owners willing to spend some of their profits to make the area more beautiful and, ultimately, more profitable,"" Mr. Breeding said."

A buck ain't worth what it used to be and it probably won't remain what it is today.

He also opened Japanese rice markets to imports for the first time and apologized to the country's Asian neighbors for Japan's aggression in World War II. **********But in recent months, under increasing attack, Mr. Hosokawa lost his focus and was quickly overrun by many of the forces he was trying to combat. His approval ratings suffered, although at a current level of around 50 percent, his popularity remained high by Japanese standards. **********Supporters of Mr. Hosokawa insisted today that he had begun an unstoppable tide toward economic and political reform, and that it would continue no matter who is chosen. But they acknowledged that their first mission now is political survival. **********The governing coalition consists of some rebels who broke from the Liberal Democratic Party, along with the Socialists and members of smaller longtime opposition parties. **********There were many predictions today that the coalition could splinter apart in the battle to find a successor to Mr. Hosokawa. Such a step that could even bring the Liberal Democrats back to power, although most analysts regarded the chances of that as remote. Also considered remote were the chances of a new election. **********Mr. Hosokawa, appearing at a news conference today, had lost his usual self-confident air. ""I sincerely apologize to the people of Japan,"" he said. ""Many reforms are still under way and have not been completed, and my role will now be different. But I will continuously work toward the fruition of the goals we set."" **********The man who came to office with a reputation as Japan's cleanest politician left many questions unanswered about his financial connections to a trucking company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, that spent much of the 1980's buying influence from the country's leading politicians. **********The company has also been linked indirectly to Japanese gangsters. Mr. Hosokawa took what he described as a loan of nearly $1 million from the company in 1982. Though he insisted that he had paid back the principal, he conceded today for the first time that he did not pay the interest on the loan. Instead, the interest was diverted and ""used for my political activities,"" he said. **********He said he had decided to resign after receiving other specifics about how his office had let ""an old personal friend of mine,"" whom he did not identify, profit from the management of other political funds when he served as Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, in southwestern Japan. **********Many of the details remained vague, and it was unclear whether any laws were broken. Nor was it clear that Mr. Hosokawa had been trying to cover up or simply had been misled by his staff. **********The Clinton Administration had invested heavily in Mr. Hosokawa's success, and counted on him to bring about reforms that would make Japan's markets far more open. **********The disappointment today was evident in the face of Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador here. **********""I'm very sad,"" the former Vice President said. ""I liked Hosokawa, I consider him a friend, and I feel very sorry for him."" **********""Here is a guy who offered a new Japan,"" Mr. Mondale continued. ""He appealed to the young; he had a Kennedy-esque appeal; he talked about political reform, administrative reform, opening Japan to the world, finally responding to the consumers. There was such hope. Here was the fresh political persona, coming from prefectural politics, and ending up in charge of a system that needed so many changes."" Possible Scenarios Cited **********Amid the chaotic juggling for position under way in Tokyo today, three rough scenarios for the creation of a new government have been sketched out -- none of them very promising for the Clinton Administration's goal of speeding up the process of reform and opening the Japanese market. **********The simplest calls for the elevation of Mr. Hata as prime minister. After Mr. Hosokawa, he is clearly the most personally popular member of the Government, a former bus company executive who helped lead the revolt last summer that ousted the Liberal Democrats after endless scandals. **********But Mr. Hata will probably not be acceptable to the Socialists, the biggest party in the coalition. He is closely associated with Ichiro Ozawa, Japan's most powerful politician and the other end of the coalition's ideological spectrum from the Socialists. **********Another, more drastic scenario involves a deal in which Michio Watanabe, a former Foreign Minister and leader of one of the biggest factions in the Liberal Democratic Party, would abandon that party and join the Hosokawa coalition. **********In return, Mr. Watanabe, who is believed to be suffering from cancer, would fulfill a lifetime dream and become prime minister. **********But Mr. Watanabe would have to bring 40 so members of his political faction from the Liberal Democratic Party with him to the coalition. Even that might not compensate for the loss of roughly half the Socialists, who would undoubtedly bolt the coalition if Mr. Watanabe took office. **********A third scenario involves stalemate. If neither the Liberal Democrats nor the coalition can put together a convincing majority, the country could be run, at least in theory, by a minority government. But it would be so weak that few believe that it could last. That would be the worst case for the United States, because it would leave the bureaucracy even more free to run the country in the absence of political leadership.  Surprise to Close Allies **********Mr. Hosokawa's decision came as a shock even to some of his closest political allies. **********""Just yesterday afternoon I had a long discussion with him, and he indicated many points on how he planned to overcome his difficulties,"" said Hajime Ishii, a leader of the Shinseito party and one of the Prime Minister's key strategists in Parliament. ""His feelings must have changed quite suddenly."" **********Others suggested that Mr. Hosokawa had simply been outmaneuvered by his enemies in the Liberal Democratic Party, who skillfully used the investigation into his past to bring Japan's Parliament to a halt. **********They held the national budget hostage, demanding that Mr. Hosokawa allow his private political secretary to testify under oath. **********Mr. Hosokawa received little aid from allies in his own party. The Socialists regularly abandoned him on key votes. The chief Cabinet Secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, who is supposed to act as the Prime Minister's spokesman, has publicly feuded with Mr. Hosokawa for several weeks. **********""I think the psychological pressure on him was enormous,"" said Mr. Shimada, a longtime adviser to Mr. Hosokawa. ""He had too many enemies surrounding him, and he could no longer survive."""

Kravchuk. Administration officials said they were seeking to reward Mr. Kravchuk for agreeing to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear arms and encourage him to press for economic reforms. **********The Administration hopes Mr. Kravchuk's visit, and a visit Monday by President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia, will help rebuff criticisms that its policy toward the former Soviet Union favors Russia over the other 14 republics. **********Mr. Shevardnadze, whose nation is ravaged by civil war, is to urge Mr. Clinton to back international peacekeepers in Georgia, a proposal the Administration is ambivalent about. **********The new aid total for Ukraine is to include economic aid of $350 million and $350 million to help disassemble the atomic weapons. Each figure is about double previous commitments.  More Pressure on Ukraine **********Administration officials said that to further help reform Ukraine's teetering economy, President Clinton would urge the International Monetary Fund to withhold $1.1 billion in loans for Ukraine unless it takes bolder steps to privatize industry and lower inflation, which is about 90 percent a month. **********The White House is disappointed that Mr. Kravchuk will not be delivering Ukraine's formal accession to the accord to eliminate nuclear arms. Despite repeated efforts, he has failed to persuade Parliament to ratify the agreement he signed in January to eliminate 176 long-range missiles and more than 1,600 nuclear warheads. **********Administration officials voiced confidence that Parliament would soon agree, though some officials fear that Mr. Kravchuk's declaration that he would not seek another term may complicate matters. **********This raises the prospect that the Administration might have identified itself too closely with Mr. Kravchuk, just as many critics have asserted it has done with Russia's embattled President, Boris N. Yeltsin. Position Seems Shaky **********But, as one White House official said, ""Kravchuk is the President of Ukraine and therefore he's the one we deal with."" **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a Congressional committee on Tuesday that he was not convinced that Mr. Kravchuk was a lame duck. **********Bowing to demands made by striking miners, Mr. Kravchuk has agreed to hold elections this June; they were originally scheduled for 1996. But Mr. Kravchuk has suggested that he might cancel the elections on the ground that it was wrong to yield to such coercion. **********Before leaving Kiev, Mr. Kravchuk told journalists that his message would be that helping create an economically strong Ukraine is critical. In seeking billions in aid, he said, ""I'm convinced that if a democratic and independent Ukraine exists and is given the necessary support, then imperial policies of any European country, not only Russia, will fail."" Looking Toward Georgia, Too **********Mr. Kravchuk, 60, was once the chief ideologist of the Ukrainian Communist Party. He resigned from the Politburo only after the failed Moscow coup in August 1991, and became a national hero soon after when he brokered a deal with Ukraine's nationalists to pursue independence from Moscow while keeping Ukraine's Communist establishment in power. **********Administration officials said countries other than Russia would receive more than half the $2.5 billion in aid authorized last fall for former Soviet republics. **********Over the past two years, Washington has committed $233 million to Georgia, most of it to help victims of the civil war. United States officials expect to contribute at least $100 million this year. **********Washington sympathizes with Mr. Shevardnadze's request for peacekeepers. Concerned that Russia is flexing its muscles in Georgia, United States officials say they would rather see peacekeepers there than Russian troops. But Washington hesitates to back such a plan because of the cost, and fears that such a commitment would be open-ended, officials said. **********One subject Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Clinton are certain to discuss is the Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that is part of Ukraine but dominated by ethnic Russians. On Jan. 30, the Crimeans chose a regional president who supports seceding and joining Russia. **********Administration officials said they back Mr. Kravchuk's position that Crimea should remain part of Ukraine -- a stance vigorously opposed by Russia's restive nationalists. **********""Crimea could blow up into a major problem,"" said one official."

She has approached some companies three times to impress them with her zeal. Most days she misses classes because she has heard that if she is not home when a company calls, she will not get a second chance. **********But so far, the 20-year-old Miss Hazama has been granted only one interview, and no job offers. ""I'll take anything,"" she said. **********These are trying times for Japanese students. Only a few years ago students could look forward to a plethora of job offers promising steady pay increases and, often, lifetime security. **********But as Japan's economic slump continues, new graduates are finding that they are, in effect, the victims of the country's lifetime employment system. Needing to reduce their work forces but unable to discharge employees, Japanese companies are cutting back sharply on hiring. **********The Government's Management and Coordination Agency estimated that 150,000 students who graduated in March had not found jobs by graduation time, becoming what are known here as ""ronin,"" a term once used to describe samurai warriors without a master. They accounted for 12.1 percent of all job-seeking graduates, the highest percentage since the Government began keeping track in 1984. **********This year, various surveys indicate, hiring will drop further. **********The Toyota Motor Corpation will hire 1,120 graduates this year, down 40 percent from last year and only one-quarter of the peak of 4,460 in 1991. The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company is cutting hiring by 40 percent, to 500 people, the lowest level since 1979. The Mazda Motor Corporation plans no new hires. **********The problem is particularly acute for women, who have long been largely confined to clerical jobs and are usually the first people discharged when times turn tough. Some major companies, notably the Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Life Insurance, have said they will hire no women for clerical positions this year. **********The influx into the work force of jobless graduates could lead to a swelling of Japan's unemployment rate, which is now only 2.8 percent. But many ronin do not show up in the unemployment figures because they do not declare that they are seeking jobs, preferring instead to travel or go to graduate school. **********Because companies like to hire only new graduates, some students who have not found a job as graduation approaches opt to stay in school another year. **********""If you have already graduated, you do not belong to the new graduate category, and they will not offer you the kind of job they offer to new graduates,"" said a student who is deliberately spending a fifth year at Meiji University. **********But the tight job market could help companies that have traditionally found it tough to recruit here. Silver Lining for Small Companies **********In a nation where personal status is linked to one's company, students have flocked to the largest Japanese companies, which offer the highest pay, the most prestige and lifetime employment. This tradition is one reason Japan has not developed the entrepreneurial culture found in the United States. **********But now, smaller Japanese companies are getting many good applicants. Foreign companies with offices in Japan, which are less prestigious for Japanese and do not offer lifetime employment, are also benefiting. ""We've been able to raise the caliber of people we've been able to bring in,"" said Brian T. Taylor, chairman of the employment practices committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. **********Because a graduate tends to join one company for his or her entire career, a lot rides on the hiring process here. And recruiting is much more regimented than in the United States, culminating on April 1 each year, when companies hold welcoming ceremonies for their new crop. **********For engineering and science graduates, who are in highest demand, job hunting is the easiest. Japan's major companies inform each of the major universities how many students they want. Professors then decide which students to recommend to which companies. Sometimes, the students also have some say in their future. **********Graduates in liberal arts fields seek general white-collar jobs and are more on their own. **********More than 300 of the largest companies subscribe to a ""gentlemen's agreement"" in which they promise to delay contact with students until July 1 of their senior year and not to offer jobs until October. This is meant to allow seniors to attend classes. But with each company afraid of lagging behind the others, the agreement is barely observed. Wearing the 'Recruit Suit' **********Job hunters can be spotted easily because almost all wear the same ""recruit suit"" -- for women, a white blouse, navy blue jacket and skirt and plain black shoes; for men, a navy blue suit, white shirt and diagonally striped tie. The idea is not to show one's individuality, but rather one's ability to conform to the group, a trait that is valued in Japan. **********""My teacher said you can wear anything that fits, but I feel secure in wearing what everyone else is wearing,"" said Kaori Isozaki, a student. **********Most companies pay scant attention to academic records or a student's experience, preferring to train new recruits themselves. Often, students sign on with a company without knowing what their jobs will be. Postcards Are Clipped **********Students usually start their job hunts in December of their junior year by clipping postcards in recruiting magazines and sending them to companies to obtain employment information. This year, Hitachi Ltd., one of the most popular employers, received 65,000 postcards for only 100 administrative positions. **********Receiving the company information is vital because it is often accompanied by invitations to company seminars, which serve initially to screen job seekers. **********Another route into the company is through contact with what the Japanese call O.B.'s, or ""old boys,"" who are alumni of one's college. Employers send the O.B.'s to their former universities to maintain relationships with professors, scout for students and screen applicants. Hitachi annually dispatches 400 to 500 such employees for campus visits. **********A job hunter might have to get past several O.B.'s, starting with the youngest and working up, before winning a coveted interview with the personnel department. **********The recruiting system can be difficult for women and other outsiders, especially when jobs are scarce. The Labor Ministry found that only 75 percent of women graduating from college last March had found jobs, compared with 92 percent of men. **********Most companies have been reluctant to hire women for career track positions, fearing they will quit when they marry or have a baby. Rather, women are hired as clerical ""office ladies"" and expected to quit after marriage. Some companies will not hire single young women unless they live with their parents. Foreign Applicants' Troubles **********Foreign applicants can also have trouble. Huy Doan, an engineering student who was born in Vietnam but attended college in Japan, said he had approached 80 companies unsuccessfully. ""We try to be good Japanese,"" he said, ""but however hard we try, they still don't accept us."" **********During the boom years of the late 1980's, Japanese companies hired with abandon, often trying to lock students into jobs while they were still college juniors. The practice became known as ""aotagai,"" or harvesting the rice while it is still green. But now companies are heavily over-staffed, especially with general white-collar workers. **********Some economists say the current problems are temporary because the economy is improving, and the number of people entering the work force is declining as a result of Japan's low birth rate. Many companies expect an eventual shortage of workers. But a new Labor Ministry report by an advisory group projects that a surplus could persist through the decade. **********The recruiting system is gradually changing in Japan, along with the lifetime employment and seniority systems to which it is closely tied. There is more job-hopping. There are more part-time workers. Some supermarket chains have recently said they will hire twice a year instead of once, to be more flexible. **********But change will be slow. Kotaro Muneoka, a personnel manager at Hitachi, said, ""As long as we can get good applicants, we have no intention of rejecting the current system."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/30/business/the-fall-came-quickly-for-mexico-s-rising-star.html,Tim Golden,1994-12-30,,919,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,The Fall Came Quickly For Mexico's Rising Star,The Fall Came Quickly For Mexico's Rising Star," **********No sooner had Jaime Serra Puche taken over as Mexico's new Finance Minister this month than the pundits began to rate him as a favorite to succeed President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. **********That a nomination was more than five years away seemed to matter little: Mr. Serra was the man who had brought home the North American Free Trade Agreement for the previous Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a smooth-talking symbol of Mexico's new confidence in its economic future. Among Mr. Serra's supporters, it was inconceivable that the handsome, articulate former Trade Minister would somehow not succeed. **********Yet in the economic chaos that forced his resignation today, Mr. Serra became the most prominent casualty to date among a new generation of Mexican technocrats who reveled in their reputation as models for the rest of Latin America. **********That he was replaced by the owlish, understated Minister of Communications and Transportation, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, only seemed to confirm a new sobriety among the talented, young men whom Mr. Salinas had brought to power. **********""What we are seeing is the legacy of a whole administration that is now crumbling,"" a spokesman for the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, Ricardo Pascoe, said. ""It is the whole economic model that is in crisis. Jaime Serra is its scapegoat."" **********Reflecting on the hard-charging reputation that Mr. Serra earned during the long debate over the trade accord last year, some critics ascribed his downfall today to hubris. Had he and other Government officials not been so utterly convinced of the rightness of their economic strategy, the critics said, they might have seen vulnerabilities earlier on. **********Others were more generous. Government officials noted that while Mr. Serra, 43, had played a central role in mishandling the devaluation of the peso on Dec. 20 that sent the economy into decline, it was his predecessor as Finance Minister who might bear deeper responsibility for the problems. **********When the devaluation came, foreign investors clamored for the previous minister, Pedro Aspe Armella, saying he would never have failed to prepare them for a move that immediately cut the value of their Mexican holdings by 15 percent. **********Mr. Serra had not only failed to warn them, brokers and fund managers complained, but had insisted publicly a few days earlier that a devaluation was not in the offing. Then, some of them said, he would not even take their phone calls. **********When Mr. Serra and other officials proved unable to convince investors that they had a viable plan to support the peso's new value, pressure on the currency mounted again. Within a day, the Government gave up its efforts to defend the peso's new value and allowed it to trade freely against the dollar, precipitating a second plunge that brought the value down at one point this week by about 40 percent of what it had been two weeks ago. **********It was Mr. Aspe, however, who fought perhaps most strongly to avoid a devaluation when one was proposed late in the Salinas administration. And it was Mr. Ortiz, then a chief deputy to Mr. Aspe, who officials said argued most vehemently that one had to be carried out. **********""The idea that Aspe should come in now to save us from a situation that Jaime created is ridiculous,"" said one Government official who has worked closely with both men. But the official added, ""This is a crisis of confidence, and it is Jaime who has lost the credibility."" **********Some economic analysts faulted Mr. Serra for not devaluing the peso further the first critical day last week. Others criticized him for not raising interest rates days before that, when, they said, it was already clear that the reserves of foreign currency used to prop up the value of the peso were dangerously low. Such a move might have helped draw in more of the foreign capital that Mexico used to cover the huge current-account deficit created by its foreign debt payments and a voracious demand for imports. **********But aides to Mr. Serra said today that the situation deteriorated more quickly than they could have imagined. Over the two trading days before the devaluation, officials said, nearly $2 billion flowed out of the country. After some investors panicked on Dec. 19 at exaggerated news-agency reports of new deployments by peasant rebels in the southern state of Chiapas, the reserves fell to about $7 billion, they said. **********""I don't think he was overconfident,"" one senior aide to Mr. Serra, Antonio Arguelles, said today. ""Based on the information he had, he did not think there was a need for a shock. He thought the adjustment could be made gradually."" **********Mr. Arguelles dismissed the notion that Mr. Serra simply did not have the contacts among investors that Mr. Aspe had so carefully developed. ""It would be very innocent to say that since we didn't have their Rolodex, we didn't know who to call,"" he said. **********Others, however, saw a broader lesson for Mr. Zedillo in the fall of his close friend and fellow Yale schoolmate. Both men were trained by Mr. Salinas to avoid crises. Neither of them, however, had gained significant experience in managing them. **********""He was clearly a star,"" one official said of Mr. Serra. ""But when the pocket broke down, he turned out not to be a scrambler."""

Automotive and other goods that last a long time were in particularly strong demand. **********""This is a very, very robust economy,"" said James E. Annable, chief economist for the First Chicago Corporation. ""It's growing too fast."" **********All year long, the Federal Reserve has kept a close eye on the operating rate of industry. The gauge has proved a fairly reliable guide to economic overheating. At current levels, bottlenecks may begin to develop, increased costs can often be passed along to consumers, and companies may find they need to bid up wages to attract or hold workers. **********The Fed, which compiles the figures on capacity use and output, said its moves today to raise short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point ""were taken against the background of evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilization."" **********Other signs also pointed to a robust economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, in a report today on manufacturing conditions in the Southeast, said that an index for prices paid by companies jumped to 48.4 last month from 41.2 in September while an index of prices obtained soared to 22.1 from 9.1. **********Nationwide, the industrial utilization rate climbed four-tenths of a point, to 84.9 percent. That increase slightly surpassed the August pace to become the biggest jump since March 1980, when the economy had just passed a peak in the business cycle and was slipping into a brief recession. **********The increase came after a decline in September, when the rate eased three-tenths of a point. **********For factories alone, the step-up in operating rate was even more pronounced, rising to 84.6 from 84.1 and tending to confirm other recent data showing exceptionally high factory overtime as well as a growing number of manufacturing jobs. The October operating rate, the Fed's report pointed out, was 3.4 points above its 1967-93 average. **********At the same time, pressure eased on mines and utilities, where output has been falling for months, partly because of unusually mild weather. **********Output by the industrial sector, some 30 percent of the economy, surged seven-tenths of 1 percent last month after edging down one-tenth of 1 percent in September when an automobile strike curbed production. Assembly of motor vehicles held at a rate of 11.9 million last month but production of parts rose sharply. **********Consumer goods other than motor vehicles and utilities rose four-tenths of 1 percent, continuing what the Fed called a sluggish pattern of recent months as output of appliances and other goods for the home slackened, probably reflecting higher interest rates. But output of business equipment, basic metals, construction supplies and other materials remained brisk. **********The 1.1 percent gain in retail sales, reported by the Commerce Department, was not only larger than had been expected but also came on top of upward revisions for August and September. With last month's sales 7.5 percent above those of October 1993, John E. Silvia of Kemper Financial Services said that ""retail sales have more momentum now than at this time last year, despite the rise in rates by the Fed."" **********Sales of durable goods, those meant to last three years or more, soared 2.3 percent over all, the department reported. Automobile dealers took in 2.9 percent more money; merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes took in 1.7 percent more and those selling furniture and other goods had a 1.5 percent gain. **********""We're still seeing a pretty strong consumer sector,"" said Jeff Craitenberger, an analyst at CS First Boston. **********In nondurables, a larger sector, sales were up 1.4 percent at clothing stores, 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores and three-tenths of 1 percent each at food stores and those selling general merchandise. On the other hand, sales at gasoline service stations fell nine-tenths of 1 percent while restaurants and bars had a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent. **********From August through October, retail sales were 7.9 percent above the comparable 1993 period with no adjustment for inflation. Consumer prices rose 3 percent for the 12 months through September."

Not long ago, aware that new Federal rules could limit his scallop catch, the robust 55-year-old spent $60,000 to temporarily outfit...",1768,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"In New England, Battle Plans for Survival at Sea","In New England, Battle Plans for Survival at Sea"," **********IF the commercial fishing industry here survives, the tenacity of people like Malvin Kvilhaug will be one reason. **********Not long ago, aware that new Federal rules could limit his scallop catch, the robust 55-year-old spent $60,000 to temporarily outfit one of his four 100-foot boats for crab fishing. He then dispatched it to nearby Nantucket island instead of the distant Virginia coast, where it had been working. After three trips he was satisfied that there is money to be made catching red crabs. But in these hard times he couldn't get his bank to finance new equipment. **********Mr. Kvilhaug (pronounced kah-VEAL-hog) is one of thousands of New Englanders who earn their livings from the sea and are fighting to salvage their businesses. **********The cod, haddock, scallops and other popular species that gave birth to America's commercial fishing industry 370 years ago are steadily disappearing from East Coast waters, victims of decades of overfishing and of controversial government policies (see sidebar). So for many fishermen in this historic seaport and elsewhere along the East Coast, the future will be increasingly defined by their ability to replace that quarry with something new. **********At sea, boat owners like Mr. Kvilhaug are testing -- with varying success -- ways to catch plentiful but previously shunned species like red crab, cusk, butterfish, dogfish and pout. On shore, they and others are extolling the virtues of such ""nontraditional"" fish in hopes of overcoming resistance to their different flavors or unappetizing names. **********Longer term, at least one group is laying plans to manufacture the lowly herring into a feed for pen-raised fish. And many people in the region are working to restructure the industry by developing more equitable dockside pricing and seeking stronger Federal policies on matters that influence fish supplies, like the number of licensed vessels and the shape of international trade agreements. **********""The fishing industry isn't dead; we can turn 85 percent of the biomass"" -- underwater fish and vegetation -- ""into money,"" said Edward J. Lima, director of the Cape Ann Fishermen's Cooperative, formed last summer by 13 boat owners in Gloucester. **********In fact, the Northeast fishery, which produces 18 percent of the nation's catch, could represent 27 percent if better managed, a recent Commerce Department study said. New England still accounts for $3.8 billion of the $10 billion-a-year national fishing and fish processing business, and New Bedford often has the most valuable catch of any United States port. **********But times are tough here -- as they are in many of the world's richest fishing zones where man is depleting supplies of key fish. Hundreds of jobs and many millions of dollars have been lost in New England in the last two years. And new Federal regulations are supposed to further cut fishing on the Northeast Coast by 50 percent over the next five to seven years so that dwindling species can replenish themselves. **********MR. KVILHAUG, whose father and grandfather were seafarers in Norway, has operated from here for 26 years, and has clearly prospered. His four boats are worth $1.3 million each. His recent experiment with red-crab fishing illustrates how expensive and tricky it can be to switch from scallops or groundfish like cod and flounder to something new. **********The upside is that fuel and crew expenses fishing off Nantucket are much lower than the $50,000 a month he spends now running to the Virginia coast for scallops. Plus, the crabs are plentiful and buyers eager because the meat can be easily substituted for Alaskan crab in dishes like seafood salads. **********However, crab fetches only $4 a pound while scallops bring about $6, he said. Plus, as with most other new catches, crab fishing requires different gear: Mr. Kvilhaug had to buy a special net and related towing and lifting equipment, and rent on-board machines to shell, cook, package and freeze the perishable meat. **********Over all, he determined it would cost about $200,000 a boat to convert his fleet properly and train his crews. Given the current crisis, banks have stopped lending to the troubled industry. Mr. Kvilhaug couldn't afford a conversion without such loans, so he's back chasing the shrinking supply of scallops off Virginia. **********Catching alternate species is only part of the solution, too. Experts say it will take time to wean finicky seafood eaters from tender white cod or delicate flounder and turn them on to curly strips of chewy pout, or chowders made of cusk or dogfish, a type of shark. If nothing else, the very names repel some people, said Roger Berkowitz, president of Legal Seafoods Inc., a Boston restaurant, retail and mail-order chain. **********""In blind tastings, people like the nontraditional fish just as well"" as the old favorites, he said. It just may take a couple years of promotion in cookbooks and in demonstrations by celebrated chefs before they'll sell in high volume. Eventually, he predicted, the unfamiliar species will be 15 percent of his sales. **********The newcomers certainly have an edge at the checkout counter. Cod and haddock were retailing in Boston last week for about $7.99 a pound where available, and gray sole was $12.99. By contrast, cusk and hake, two less distinguished mild white fish, were going for $4.99. Pout was $2.99. **********Unfortunately for boat owners, those same numbers suggest that unless people start eating a lot more fish, the days of profits of $100,000 a year for each vessel may be over even if everything else works out. **********Recognizing that, some have been hedging their bets. Reidar Bendiksen three years ago invested $30,000 to catch skate, a flat, wing-like species popular in Europe, and about the same time opened a marine supply business. For a while, things were great: he was taking in $400,000 a year from skate and $300,000 from the supply business. **********But now the general decline in waterfront activity has cut the marine business in half, and skate fishing has soured because others saw how lucrative it was and began to deplete those stocks, too. **********Matthew B. Stommel of Woods Hole, owner of two boats, has cut a person from each crew by buying special machinery to unload his catch. An experienced crew member can cost $40,000 or more a year. He also keeps three kinds of nets on board so crews can change prey on a moment's notice. ""If we can sell it, we'll fish for it,"" he explained. **********The problem is that foreign markets can be difficult to break into and, in the United States, low-cost fish from nations that subsidize their fleets drive down prices. Imports now account for half of current United States fish sales. **********Banding together has helped some fishermen market their changing catch. The 47-year-old Point Judith Fishermen's Cooperative in Narragansett, R.I., is successfully selling squid, butterfish, monkfish and other unusual species to distributors, restaurants and supermarket chains as far away as Philadelphia and Baltimore. **********The Cape Ann Fishermen's Cooperative is working an entirely different angle. It wants to catch large amounts of mostly ignored herring, sell some of it whole and turn the rest into feed pellets for farm-raised fish. It is trying to negotiate a sales contract for frozen fish in Poland, where herring is popular, while working with Gloucester officials on plans for a possible pellet factory at home, said Mr. Lima, the director. **********Two New Bedford boat owners, Ellen B. Skaar and Judy M. Ramos, are looking for profits at the other end of the equation. In some ports wholesale buyers, who control what fishermen are paid for their catches, underestimate weights and renege on privately quoted prices, they said. At best, fishermen get only about $1 of every $5 of wholesale prices, they said. **********Mrs. Skaar and Mrs. Ramos are trying to establish a $20 million network of nonprofit auctions at New England ports that would be linked to create a regional market. Fish would be displayed, independently weighed, and bid on publicly. At one such auction in Portland, Me., last winter, Mrs. Skaar said, she realized 25 percent higher revenues than usual.WATCHED BY FEDERAL EYES **********THE fishing industry has been regulated by the Federal Government since 1977, when it became the Commerce Department's job to oversee the conservation of the fish and the development of the business. **********In the last 17 years, the department has spent about $1 billion to help devise, approve and help enforce rules that tell fishermen where to fish, when to go out, what gear to use and how much to catch. **********Yet almost half the nation's fish stocks are depleted and the domestic industry is rapidly losing ground to imports, which now account for half of the $30 billion a year in retail sales, according to Garry L. Brown, vice president of A. T. Kearney/Centaur, an economic consulting firm. **********The stocks of fish are dwindling as fleets grow and fishermen use ever-sharper technology. **********What is more, the Commerce Department in the 1970's and 1980's was unable to have its own conservation rules enforced. The Government also increased pressure on the remaining fish by ceding about 30 percent of the New England supply to Canada to settle a boundary dispute. And through guarantees on low-cost loans, coupled with tax shelters, it encouraged the launching of too many boats, said Peter Shelley, lawyer for the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation. **********In March, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown declared the Northeast fishery to be in an economic emergency. He proposed $30 million in aid: $12 million to help the industry and $18 million for communities that depend on it from Cape May, N.J., to Maine. **********While an application process has begun, the department has yet to dispense aid to help fishermen and processors restructure loans or buy the new gear to diversify. **********""This is a stalling game,"" said Edward J. MacLeod, a former fish processing executive and Federal regulator. ""There's a real fear here that the money will go to the same researchers who always get it and not to the fishermen and processors who can really turn the industry around."" **********But Secretary Brown said in an interview, ""I am absolutely committed to get these funds to the people who are really affected by the crisis."" **********Financial aid isn't the only issue. Some fishermen and scientists have suggested that a bed of young scallops off Virginia should be closed for two years so it can reseed the entire Northeast for a decade of scalloping. Otherwise, the bed could be depleted by next winter. **********So far, the Commerce Department and the New England Fishery Management Council have not acted on the request."

The book retailing sector in the United States is worth an annual $14.3 billion. Small wonder that analysts and investors have tuned into it. **********Mr. Donald Trott, a senior vice president and analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, notes that bookselling is ""generally viewed as a somewhat mundane industry"" in the United States but that industry growth over the last decade has averaged 8.5 percent and is generally projected to accelerate to about 10 percent over the next couple of years."" **********Mr. Trott, along with analysts at two other major firms, have current buy recommendations on the shares of Barnes & Noble, the retailing giant that mushroomed under the stewardship of Leonard Riggio, the company's aggressive chief executive officer, who built the business from a single store into one of the largest booksellers in the world. **********Barnes & Noble runs around 734 regular size mall bookstores, operates over 200 superstores, and has plans to open 70 more superstores by the end of the year. The company is far larger than its competitors, the combined Walden Books and Borders owned by K mart, Crown Books and Books-A-Million. **********Observers said that much of the large book retailers' success hinges on opening as many well positioned superstores as possible. In that regard, analysts note, Barnes & Noble is well ahead of the pack. **********""In terms of superstores, Barnes & Noble currently has more stores than all of those guys put together,"" said Mr. Trott. **********Another reason analysts are particularly favorable on booksellers is a reported line-up of new book titles by best-selling authors scheduled to come out later this year. **********Bruce Missett, a retail analyst with Morgan Stanley who has a purchase recommendation on Barnes & Noble, notes that ""the very attractive feature to this business is that the base grows, in the sense that there are always new titles coming out, and the back list titles of a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, don't stop dead. **********""They continue to be things that are in demand,"" he said. ""Obviously, the rate of demand slows down, but in essence, it's a growing product base."" **********The major book retailers are also doing a lot with product mix. Some superstores offer fairly large music sections, in addition to books. Mr. Missett notes that the Barnes & Noble stores have the potential to take advantage of the information superhighway, however that eventually takes shape, whether through CD-ROMS or some other vehicle. **********Amy Ryan, an analyst with Prudential Securities, also rates Barnes & Noble a buy, noting that the shares' multiple, relative to long-term growth potential, is still low.

During the day, the stock traded as high as $39.625. **********Apple's stock began to surge on Wednesday, gaining $4.125, after rumors circulated that Motorola was preparing to acquire Apple.

Microelectronics. CISC refers to the older chip technology used by Intel. **********""I think it is quite an aggressive price, and it's basically what they have to do to make good on the promise of twice the performance at the same price,"" as Pentium, said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ""It's good news, and its reassuring, but it doesn't change the fundamental fact that you need software,"" he said. **********Current I.B.M. machines, and a forthcoming line of computers from Motorola that use the Power PC chip run Unix, operating system software commonly used in powerful networked computers in technical applications. Only Apple has a personal computer operating system that will run on the Power PC, but Apple has been slow to license the Mac OS, as it is now called, to other manufacturers."

The triggering device is meant to be the Super 301 trade legislation that President Bill Clinton resuscitated last week. **********The move is more likely to irritate Japan and other major trading nations without getting America what it wants. But it is dangerous all the same. **********Super 301 aims to speed up the removal of other countries' unfair trade practices by singling out the worst offenders (in this case, of course, Japan) and setting deadlines for them to mend their ways under threat of U.S. trade sanctions. **********By reviving it, the United States has not yet technically broken any international rules. But it has certainly violated the spirit of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks that came to a successful end last December. **********Just as a renewed bout of international protectionism appeared to have been averted, Washington has introduced a nasty new note of confrontantion into the trading system. It has opened the way to a dangerous chain reaction of retaliation and counterretaliation. **********In citing the Uruguay Round as a big achievement of his first year in office, Mr. Clinton likes to stress how much it opens markets for U.S. exports. He says less about the Uruguay Round's other main purpose: to transfer the last word in future trade disputes to a new World Trade Organizaton, which will in important ways be able to overrule the U.S. Congress. **********Of course, Super 301's subliminal message is addressed as much to Capitol Hill as it is to Tokyo. Mr. Clinton is humoring congressional protectionists whose votes he will need on health care and welfare reform. He also is seeking to reassure Congress that the Uruguay Round will not necessarily prevent the United States from acting alone to protect its trade interests. **********He may end up proving the opposite. **********If Super 301 runs its course against Japan, its procedures likely will still be under way when the new World Trade Organization starts operating next year. That means that before introducing trade sanctions, the United States will first have to convince an international panel that Japan is in the wrong - at least in areas covered by world trade rules. **********Fine, say Super 301 enthusiasts, but many of the problems we have with Japan, such as its notoriously impenetrable distribution system, are not covered by the rules. So we can go ahead on our own. **********But there is a catch. restrictive Japanese practices may not be covered by the rules, but U.S. sanctions against them almost certainly would be. To be effective, sanctions would probably have to be imposed on Japan's exports to the United States, which the rules do cover. So the Japanese could in turn take the United States before an international panel. **********It is not clear whether Super 301 allows the United States to act against private Japanese cartels and other anti-competitive practices, unless Washington can prove that the Japanese government ""tolerates"" such behavior. **********According to a report published in Washington last week by the Coalition for Open Trade, many of Japan's import barriers, in such major sectors as steel, cars, auto parts and semiconductors, fall into that category. **********The report argues convincingly that since the 1960s the Japanese government has been quietly handing over responsibility for protectionism to the private sector. The United States, it says, must develop new weapons to crack these cartels. **********But it would be much better if the United States joined the European Union and others to press for new international rules banning such anti-competitive practices. There is already fairly wide agreement that the next world trade negotiations should cover corporate behavior. **********Washington says it cannot wait for that. But the United States is not the only player on the field. Mr. Clinton and the U.S. Congress may not like it much, but the Uruguay Round is meant to steer the world toward international dispute settlement and away from fruitless trade wars. **********The United States should not be allowed to use multilateral negotiations to open up markets for its exports and retain the sole right to act unilaterally when it pleases. **********Instead of plotting trade explosions, Mr. Clinton should be working to strengthen the world trading system. That is where America's real long-term interest lies."

The November unemployment rate hit a four-year low as 350,000 jobs were created, news that would normally have sent stocks and bonds falling out of fears of inflation and another move by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. **********Instead, except for a small downturn before 10:45 A.M., the Dow Jones industrial average rose most of the day, closing up 44.75 points, at 3,745.62. **********Contributing to the surge in stocks was a powerful rally in the bond market, where prices soared and the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 7.91 percent from 8.01 percent. Apparently, many bond investors would now welcome the Fed's taking strong early action to resist inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities. **********The dollar also surged, rising above 100 Japanese yen for the first time in nearly two months. **********""It was an absolutely crazy day -- exactly the opposite of what people expected,"" said Anthony Conroy, managing director of equities for Mabon Securities.

So many Wall Street stock traders expected a rout yesterday after release of the unemployment figures that when prices did not fall, the market was squeezed into what is known as a short-covering rally, trader argot for professional short-sellers forced to buy stocks to stem their losses. **********Short-sellers sell borrowed shares in the expectation that prices will fall and they can buy back the shares at a lower price, thus pocketing the difference. But if prices rise, all bets are off and investors must scramble to buy back the stock to cut their losses. **********Bargain-hunters also contributed to the rise of some stocks that have been under pressure as of late. Best Buy rose7/8, to 33 3/4, in a slight recovery, after plunging 11 3/8 on Thursday when the electronics retailer said its third-quarter earnings would be below analysts' expectations. **********Dell Computer rose 1 3/8, to 41 1/8, as it also recovered from a sharp drop on Thursday after CS First Boston downgraded the stock because of concerns about Intel's Pentium chips. Even Intel, dogged by market doubts about the Pentium chip, saw its shares rise 1/4, to 62 7/8, on heavy volume of 7.4 million shares. **********Among other stocks, ITT gained 3 1/8, to 80 1/8. Paine Webber raised its recommendation on the stock to a ""buy"" rating. **********And Coca-Cola gained 1, to 51 1/2. **********Of the 30 component stocks in the Dow industrials, 26 rose, led by General Electric, which rose 1 1/2, to 47 1/8. **********Among the losers, Whirlpool fell 2 1/4, to 46 1/2, after the company said the Justice Department was conducting an antitrust investigation of the company's sales practices. **********In Tokyo, stocks closed slightly lower in quiet trading. The Nikkei index of 225 issues slipped 15.30 points, to 18,998.30."

But only the company's logo, a crossed golf club and paint brush threaded through a ""CB"" insignia, offers any clue to his true line of work. **********Mr. Boxall's five-year-old firm makes golf signs. You know, the signs on golf tees that list the hole number, yardage and number of strokes required to make par. **********""Other companies do golf signs by default,"" says Mr. Boxall, the 30-year-old founder of CB Designs. ""We market ourselves as makers of high-quality golf signs."" **********Working out of a second-floor set of offices in Rickmansworth, just north of London, that he shares with a local osteopath, Mr. Boxall and a full-time staff of seven have to date furnished about 100 golf courses with signs. His clients range from the golfing world's holiest of holies, such as St. Andrews in Scotland, to Spain's Valderrama, home of the 1997 Ryder Cup, and the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club. He's even supplied courses created by British Coal on the sites of some of its abandoned open-pit coal mines. **********What CB Designs offers its customers is high-quality signs - any size and shape - made of anything from cast aluminum or bronze to etched slate or granite. **********""We are delighted with our signs,"" said Greg Dukart, director of golf at the East Sussex National Golf Club, home of last year's British Open. East Sussex bought four sets of slate tee signs for each hole to spruce the course up in preparation for the Open. **********""They turned our order around in just six or seven weeks,"" he said. **********It was five years ago, while he was working as an accountant for Touche Ross in Paris, that Mr. Boxall began casting about for a lucrative business niche in which he could found his own company. Being an avid golfer with a 7 handicap, indeed, had much to do with his move toward the links. **********So too did the high average income of people who play golf, and the fact that golf signs - from those at the course entrance to the tees - were frequently just not, as he saw it, up to snuff. **********""People spend millions on new courses and when you go there the first thing you see is a tatty piece of plastic with the course name hanging off a dinky little pole,"" he observed, noting that the tee signs are rarely any better. **********CB Designs' signs are not tatty. On the other hand, they are not cheap either. Mr. Boxall's price for outfitting a typical 18-hole golf course in tee signs alone ranges from £800 ($1,224) to £45,000, depending on the aesthetic ambitions - and budget - of the course's owners. **********Once upon a time, the posh, country-club look that Mr. Boxall specializes in was anathema to most British golf clubs. Only recently, under the influence of some of the most prodigious and deep-pocketed creators - in particular, the Japanese - have owners become more image-conscious. **********To Mr. Boxall's chagrin, the most traditional and some of the most famous of Scottish courses still eschew signs altogether. At some venerated courses, notably Muirfield, the only clutter permitted on the course is a tin box on each tee containing sand and grass seed so that golfers can dutifully undue their divot damage. If confused golfers cannot find the seventh tee from the sixth green, fine. Scottish traditionalists insist their courses can be played in any order. **********After nearly five years in business, Mr. Boxall is hoping finally to break into the black this year, with expected revenues of around £500,000. Key to that forecast is a major new diversification into house signs under the name Strawberry Signs. **********""With that name, we are going for an English, traditional, soft look,"" explains Michael Freedman, a private investor who earlier this year pumped cash into the company to help it gear up for its latest market foray in return for a large slice of the parent company's equity. **********""Strawberry has a fruity feel to it without the hierarchical 'oomph' of CB Designs International Ltd."" **********Strawberry's house signs, like CB Designs' cast aluminum golf signs with their raised, hand-painted numerals, will be made to order. **********""If you've got a dog with fourteen eyes and you want that on your sign, we will do that,"" said Terry Donovan, CB Designs' sales manager. **********When it comes to the marketing, the two units will diverge. To service the 400-odd British garden centers, gift shops and iron mongers who have enlisted to carry CB Designs' products, Mr. Boxall and his colleagues say they emphasize a cheery familiarity - not the icy efficiency apparently favored by golf clubs. **********""Golf clubs call up and insist on discussing their order with our managing director,"" notes Mr. Freedman. He contrasted that with the new house sign unit, where titles are conspicuously absent from business cards."

Each year MCI pays local phone companies $5 billion in access charges, which account for about half the cost of long-distance phone calls. They are by far the most lucrative segment of the local telephone market. **********Over the longer term, MCI executives outlined a vision of providing local ""driveways"" onto a high-speed national network that offers video on demand and enough speed to transmit an entire library of books across the country in a few seconds. It also hopes to compete with the Bell companies by offering local access to other long-distance carriers, including its archrival, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********Portions of MCI's plans were reported last week in The Wall Street Journal. **********MCI officials said today that the first wave of new networks would be built in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and more than a dozen other big cities. While the plan seems skeletal at first glance, MCI officials said these networks would run through high-traffic corporate corridors that now account for 40 percent of all its long-distance traffic. **********Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman and chief executive, said, ""By now it is clear that the local telephone monopolies will never give us what we need,"" contending they had not provided ""local access capabilities at a decent price."" **********Today's move will intensify a debate now under way at both the White House and in Congress about eliminating the legal barriers that prevent local and long-distance carriers from invading one another's territories. **********The antitrust consent decree that broke up the old Bell System 10 years ago prohibits the seven regional Bell companies from entering the long-distance market, a restriction drafted out of fear that the Bells could use their local monopolies to stifle competition. A complex web of state and Federal rules effectively limits local telephone competition in all but a handful of markets. **********The Bell companies immediately used MCI's announcement today to repeat their call for ending the remaining restrictions in the antitrust consent decree. It also bars them from manufacturing equipment. **********But MCI, in views echoed by A.T.&T., argued that the Bell companies must still be restricted because 99.6 percent of all long-distance calls still go through a local telephone company. **********A.T.& T., banned from the local telephone business by the 1984 Bell System breakup, has not tried to build its own local access system to compete with its Bell offspring. But it is buying the nation's biggest cellular company, McCaw Cellular Communications, which will give it local wireless networks covering more than half the country. **********For MCI, today's announcements mark the latest attempt to stake out a role in building the much-hyped information ""highway."" The company announced it is upgrading its entire network with a new fiber optic transmission technology called Sonet that can transmit 2.5 billion bits of data per second -- a speed that would makes it possible to transmit the entire contents of a small library in a few seconds. Sonet is short for ""synchronous optical network."" **********Both A.T.& T. and Sprint have already introduced Sonet services, but A.T.&T.'s lines are slower than those planned by MCI, and Sprint's are not yet available nationwide. **********In an interview today, Mr. Roberts said MCI's strategy was partly a response to the recent wave of mergers and alliances between telephone and cable television companies. MCI had been seeking its own cable TV partners, partly hoping to use the cable networks as a competitive alternative to the Bell companies. **********But Mr. Roberts said the recent telephone-cable TV deals, like the pending merger between the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the cable leader, Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, had pushed the company to a more independent strategy. **********""MCI could have aligned itself with a cable company, and that was certainly a desirable approach,"" he said.  ""But now we're faced with a situation where with cable companies aligned with"" the regional Bell operating companies, ""we felt it was time to strike out on our own."" **********MCI has a formidable war chest with which to finance its campaign. Thanks to successful marketing and shrewd uses of technology, it has consistently taken market share from the long-distance leader, A.T.& T.  MCI's revenues and profits have grown at more than 15 percent a year for some time. In the third quarter, its earnings were up 13 percent to $174 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $3.05 billion. **********In Nasdaq trading yesterday, the company's shares were down $1.875, closing at $26.675, on heavy volume of more than 10 million shares. **********Meanwhile, MCI last year sold a 20 percent stake to British Telecommunications P.L.C. for $4.3 billion. Having already used an initial down payment of $800 million from that transaction to pay down debt, MCI is now about to receive the final $3.5 billion in cash and can use that for whatever it pleases. Industry analysts note that MCI effectively has easy access to more than $7 billion, because it can borrow an amount equal to its new cash without hurting its overall financial strength. **********""What they are doing is investing in themselves, and that's the smartest investment they can make,"" said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst with Paine Webber Inc., adding that MCI currently produces a 20 percent return on its assets. ""When you have an asset like that, the best thing you can do is pour more money into it,"" he said."

Nichols was skeptical. Three states have mandated an imminent future for electric vehicles, but Dr. Nichols, an official with Ford's electric vehicle program, was saying that compliance might be impossible and the strict timetable counterproductive. **********Then an electric Chrysler mini-van zipped past her. **********It was the first day of the American Tour de Sol, a weeklong race of electric cars, held this year from New York to Philadelphia and completed over the Memorial Day weekend. This was only the exhibition run, from lower Manhattan to Liberty State Park here, and entries were lined up at a traffic light just beyond the Holland Tunnel. The white Chrysler van with blue trim, entered by the Philadelphia Electric Company, had pulled out of the lane behind Dr. Nichols and silently slipped past her on the right. **********Dr. Nichols swung her Ecostar out into the right lane and quietly zoomed past the cars on the left, in hot pursuit. In Jersey City's congested streets, she did not catch the Chrysler by the time she reached the afternoon's destination. But other participants insist that Dr. Nichols and the car made racing history anyway, becoming the first entry by a major car company in an electric race. **********Whether they like the rules or not, Dr. Nichols and the Ford Motor Company are in the race. Ford's Ecostar, based on a van model of the Ford Escort sold in Europe, is ridiculously expensive, leasing for $100,000 for 30 months -- and Ford says that doesn't cover costs. If Ford has to build a vehicle to meet the 1998 mandates in California, New York and Massachusetts, it will not be the Ecostar, at least not with the sodium-sulfur batteries used by a pilot fleet 105 strong. The batteries, made by ABB of Mississauga, Ontario, run $46,000 per car. **********It may be impractical, but the car is no wimp, Dr. Nichols insisted. Nor is the company. **********For years now, the car companies -- that is, the ones everyone has heard of, not such upstarts as Solectria and Electrica -- have had a toe in the water. G.M. sells components to racers through its subsidiary, Hughes, and many companies have bought electric versions of vans from Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. But now Ford has jumped into the race, a Goliath that cannot add to its name recognition by coming in ahead of the teams that have competed in the Tour de Sol for years, with one-of-a-kind vehicles or, at best, vehicles with sales measured in the dozens. **********Ford's presence, however, has given new credibility to the event, an eclectic showcase of vehicles from the practical to the flights of engineering fancy, including cars that one participant disparaged as ""pimples on wheels."" Ford won in the ""production"" class, cars of which at least five have been built.  [ Officials announced on Sunday that it had won with an ""adjusted time"" of one hour and six minutes less than Solectria, of Arlington, Mass., which had dominated the category. Adjusted time combines speed with endurance; after each leg of the race, competitiors may run extra laps and deduct one minute for each extra mile completed. ] **********Ford will eventually lease 80 Ecostars, as a test fleet, but has no plans to build more or to sell any. **********[ Friday after a battery fire -- the second one -- Ford asked users to stop driving the experimental vehicles until it could determine the cause of the fires. Both occurred as the batteries were charged, and no one was injured. One occurred Friday at the California Air Resources Board in El Monte, and the other on May 2 at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. ] **********James D. Worden, co-founder of Solectria, who has competed in the race since it began in 1989, said he was not troubled by Ford. He has two strengths that Ford lacks: a product offered for sale and customers lined up to buy. He has delivered 85, with orders for 65 more, at prices ranging from $26,000, for a converted Geo Metro with lead-acid batteries, to $59,000 for one with nickel-cadmium batteries. His pickup trucks go for a little over $40,000, depending on equipment. **********In practice, though, Ford's goal is different from Solectria's. Mr. Worden's customers are mostly electric utilities or other companies that want the cars for evaluation. They will pay for the high costs of conversion, including scrapping a new internal combustion engine, as Mr. Worden must do. Ford, which can manage mass production, is looking to sell vehicles for fleet use to companies that have no particular interest in energy -- say, florists or plumbing companies. ""We aren't going to be accomplishing anything without a happy customer,"" Dr. Nichols said. **********Mr. Worden still did well. His entry in the American Commuter category not only won the race, but also set a new distance record -- 214 miles -- between rechargings. His car also set another record, traveling a mile on just 92 watt-hours of energy -- enough electricity to light a 100-watt bulb for 55 minutes. **********The Geo Metro, before he converted it to electricity, was rated at 58 miles a gallon. If the same energy contained in a gallon of gasoline were used to fuel a power plant, it would produce 11.8 kilowatt-hours. Even assuming 10 percent of the electricity is lost in transmission, that could run the car 115 miles, twice as far as the gasoline-powered car. **********But Ford turned in an impressive performance in another way, changing the nature of the race, which to date has been an endurance contest, not a sprint. Dr. Nichols -- who once drove a methanol-powered Model A Ford 190 miles an hour at Bonneville, and is a former president of the National Drag Boat Association -- like a typical suburbanite, nudged past the speed limit on one leg, and was penalized 5 minutes for crossing the finish line seconds too early. **********The driver of Solectria's production-category car, Andrew M. Heafitz, drove parts of the race as if he had an egg between his foot and the accelerator, trying to conserve energy by avoiding jack rabbit starts and hard acceleration. ""I could zip up this hill and beat all these people,"" he said outside Jersey City, ""but then I would never be able to beat Ford."" **********As it was, he came in third in the production category. First was an Ecostar entered by Pennsylvania Electric Transportation, a consortium, and then Dr. Nichols's Ecostar. **********Meeting for the first time, Dr. Nichols and Mr. Worden were a study in contrasts. Dr. Nichols, a grandmother, told Mr. Worden, who is 26, about a diesel car she modified to get maximum mileage in 1970. She said she enjoyed meeting other racers, but not the questions asked by race organizers: her weight and her age, ""two things you do not ask a lady.""  Relationships Uncertain **********The relationship between the Big Three and companies like Solectria is not yet clear; nor is it clear whether electric vehicles will be popularized by Detroit, or whether, on the model of Apple Computer, a new product will come from a new company. **********The Big Three are supposed to make 2 percent of their production electric in 1998, but Solectria could end up selling electric models and generating credits that it would sell to them. Or it might supply components. Or Ford, G.M. and Chrysler might sell ""gliders"" -- car bodies without engines, transmissions or gas tanks -- to converters like Solectria. **********Still, there is some common ground. Although Mr. Worden does not share Dr. Nichols's view of the electric car as impractical, in a way he shares her caution. **********""You can't hurry up and push this thing,"" he said in a conversation with her at the World Financial Center, where their respective vehicles were on display before the race began. ""You have to gradually and reliably develop this thing. There need to be good vehicles that are safe vehicles, that really work."""

Continental Airlines took that tack last year and United Airlines plans a similar switch. A DifferentNew Approach **********But Delta has gone a step beyond them, and bypassed another popular money-saving idea: trading an ownership stake in the company for wage and work-rule concessions from its employees. **********While Delta said it would likely set up a high-frequency, low-fare service in parts of its system, that strategy would be a small part of the overall plan announced yesterday. **********""Instead of addressing costs in just one market, we are attacking the root cause of the issue directly by reducing costs everywhere,"" said Ronald W. Allen, Delta's chairman, president and chief executive. **********Julius Maldutis, an airline industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, said: ""It's extraordinary, unprecedented. It reflects a fundamental recognition that changes to the domestic air travel market are permanent and that the large carriers who have been relatively immune to the forces of deregulation now have to adapt."" **********Some analysts questioned whether Delta could meet its ambitious targets, which will require drastically changing the way it operates and unsettling a somewhat cloistered corporate culture. **********""It is a tall order,"" said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley. **********Precisely how Delta will adapt is unclear. The company has established 11 so-called leadership teams to carve hundreds of millions of dollars in savings from areas that include flight operations, administrative support and marketing. **********The broad goal is to reduce its operating costs by 21 percent -- measured by the average cost of flying one seat one mile -- to 7.5 cents by June 1997, from 9.52 cents last year. **********Yesterday's announcement appeared to reinforce Delta's track record of responding slowly but decisively to change. Three years ago, for example, it set a goal of reducing costs by $700 million annually, a target it beat a year ahead of schedule. **********Delta's stock rose $1.875 yesterday, to $45.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Allen, reiterated his goal yesterday of achieving a 5 percent profit margin, presumably by 1997. Delta last recorded a profit in its 1990 fiscal year. **********""We feel it's a stretch goal,"" Mr. Allen said yesterday. ""We need to do this in light of the marketplace today. Customers more and more are demanding low fares."" **********Delta has a distinct advantage over other large, established airlines in trying to cut costs because only about 12 percent of its work force is unionized. That gives it the flexibility to make changes without requiring approval from many union leaders. Aiming at Pilots **********Even so, Atlanta-based Delta said it would need the help of the 8,000 members of its pilots' union, the Air Line Pilots Association. In a thinly veiled threat, Delta said yesterday that it would explore possible joint ventures with other airlines to take over some of its flying if its pilots do not cooperate in meeting Delta's goal for them of saving $320 million to $340 million a year. **********Leaders of Delta's pilots' union said yesterday that they were reviewing the announcement. ""Our goal, as always, is to protect pilot careers while helping our company return to sustained profitability,"" Bill Brown, chairman of the Delta pilots' union, said. **********Delta said it would try a variety of ways to eliminate as many jobs as possible without furloughing workers, but Mr. Allen said yesterday that it might have to lay off up to 4,000 employees. The company also said it would announce details of a new profit-sharing program before July. **********Delta's plan adds to the list of ways the largest, established carriers have sought to lower their costs to meet travelers' demands for low fares. **********Continental, for example, has achieved its relatively low operating costs in part by a recent tour through bankruptcy court. Trans World Airlines also emerged from bankruptcy protection with help from employees who traded pay cuts for a stake in the company. **********Northwest Airlines also swapped an equity stake for concessions last year, and United is seeking to give majority control of the company to employees in return for pay cuts and work-rule changes that will allow it set up a separate, low-fare division. Losses for the Quarter **********Underscoring the need for those cost reductions, both Delta and United announced losses yesterday for the most recent quarter. **********Delta said its fiscal third-quarter loss narrowed to $77.9 million, or $2.10 a share, from $152.3 million, or $3.61 a share, a year ago. Delta will take a $400 million to $600 million charge in the fourth quarter ending in June to cover the restructuring. **********The UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, also reported a smaller first-quarter net loss of $97 million, or $4.37 a share, from $157 million, or $6.69, a year earlier. **********""With our higher cost structure, we are unable to compete effectively in these markets,"" said Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of UAL, referring to domestic markets where low-cost carriers have expanded. **********Last week, the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, said its first-quarter loss narrowed to $7 million, or 30 cents a share, from $22 million, or 43 cents a share, a year ago."

Salerno, Nynex vice chairman, said yesterday that his company might want to restructure its investment in Viacom Inc., but added that there were no discussions about such a move at this time. **********Viacom is already said to be facing pressures from its potential merger partner, the Blockbuster Entertainment Company, about renegotiating its own deal in the wake of Viacom's stock decline. Blockbuster has some leverage because its merger with Viacom has not yet been approved by the Blockbuster board or shareholders. **********Nynex has put $1.2 billion into Viacom's battle for Paramount Communications Inc. Under its contract, however, it cannot renegotiate the agreement, Mr. Salerno said yesterday. **********But Nynex may have reasons to be unhappy with its deal. When it was first announced last October, Nynex was criticized for the financial aspects of a deal that gave the giant telephone company no voting stock. Instead it got a convertible preferred stock with a 5 percent dividend that was convertible at $70 a share. Viacom's class B stock is currently trading far below that level. Yesterday it closed at $27.75, up 75 cents, on the American Stock Exchange. Some Questioned Move **********At the time, some people wondered why the phone company was spending money in the entertainment business at the same time that it was planning extensive layoffs. Mr. Salerno said in a telephone interview yesterday: ""Our strategic thrust is that we want the content portion of Viacom-Paramount,"" referring to the film and television production operations as well as the cable networks. ""We are not interested in managing content."" **********He said that U S West, for example, had gained access to Time Warner's programming operations by putting its money into Time Warner Entertainment, a subsidiary that owns the bulk of that company's programming businesses. That seemed to indicate that Nynex wanted a direct investment in similar programming at Viacom-Paramount and had little interest in the company's publishing or cable system business. **********News that Nynex was considering an effort to restructure its investment first appeared yesterday during a Raymond James & Associates investment conference in St. Petersburg, Fla. Later in the day, Nynex acknowledged that it was sufficiently concerned about its deal to consider such an alternative, though it did not ""imply or confirm the existence of any negotiations with Viacom that would involve such a restructuring."" **********A person close to Viacom said there were no negotiations going on. Mr. Salerno said, ""We might make it into something else later on."" **********Blockbuster Entertainment is rumored also to be unhappy with its own merger with Viacom, in which the chairman, H. Wayne Huizenga, has agreed to accept Viacom stock for Blockbuster stock. The Viacom board must approve any revision of the merger, by a majority. Nynex now has two seats on the Viacom board, not enough to give it the leverage to veto any action as a way of forcing Viacom to revise its arrangement with Nynex. ""If there is no legal ground for Nynex to revise its deal, then what kind of pressure tactic is this leading to?"" Lizbeth Barron, an analyst at S. G. Warburg, asked yesterday, referring to Mr. Salerno's public statements. **********Mr. Salerno has responsibilities for finance, business development and strategic planning at Nynex."

In addition, Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who was on a visit to North Korea, sought to resolve the crisis in several meetings in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. **********North Korea has insisted that the unarmed two-seat OH-58 Kiowa helicopter was on a hostile surveillance mission three to five miles inside North Korean territory, but Pentagon officials maintain that the two pilots strayed innocently across the demilitarized zone during a routine training mission. The helicopter went down in the area of Kungang. **********Pentagon officials said today that they remain unsure whether the helicopter was shot down, forced down or perhaps had mechanical difficulties, although many officials said they assumed the helicopter was downed by hostile fire. **********Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today that he was eager to learn how the Army scout helicopter had strayed so far over the 155-mile long, 2.5-mile wide demilitarized zone. The Kiowa helicopter is a reconnaissance aircraft frequently used for scouting and training. **********""The Defense Department has launched a full investigation of the circumstances that led to this tragic loss on a routine training flight,"" Mr. Perry said in a statement. ""Results will be reported as this investigation reaches its conclusion."" **********The White House statement said that Warrant Officer Hilemon ""was killed in the downing of the helicopter"" and that Warrant Officer Hall ""is alive and reportedly uninjured."" **********Several American officials said they were frustrated with North Korea's handling of the incident, saying it has been slow to release information. They also questioned why North Korea's official news agency at first said the two pilots were being held for questioning. **********Administration officials said that some North Korean diplomats had informed them and Mr. Richardson early on that Warrant Officer Hilemon had died when the helicopter went down. But they said other North Koreans, especially some officials in the army, were sending different signals. One American official said the lack of a clear message could indicate that the country's new leader, Kim Jong Il, was not firmly in control. **********In its initial comments, the Clinton Administration was eager to get the pilots released quickly to ease tensions in the hope that Washington and Pyongyang could concentrate on the delicate task of putting the month-old agreement to restrict North Korea's nuclear program into effect. But with the news of Warrant Officer Hilemon's death, Administration officials took a tougher line. **********Mr. Clinton said he has asked Representative Richardson to extend his stay in North Korea to help resolve the crisis. Mr. Richardson arrived in North Korea early Saturday for a two-day visit to examine the human rights situation there and discuss the nuclear accord. **********In the agreement, the North agreed to scrap its current policy on nuclear weapons. In return, the United States pledged to lead an international effort to build $4 billion in new, less-threatening reactors for North Korea. **********American officials said the biggest move Pyongyang could make to reduce tensions would be to let Mr. Richardson bring Warrant Officer Hall and Warrant Officer Hilemon's remains with him back to the United States on Monday, the day he was scheduled to leave North Korea. **********""The first and most important thing is a full accounting of what happened, and the release of the body and of the other pilot,"" said a senior Administration official. ""If that doesn't happen, it would be hard not only for Congress, but the Administration to proceed with other discussions, like exchanging liaison offices."" **********American officials said they told North Korea that the wisest course would be to follow what South Korea did last January after capturing two North Korean soldiers who drifted into South Korean waters. They were released to the North four days after being captured. **********One message American diplomats say they have conveyed to North Korea is that if it moved quickly to turn over Warrant Officer Hilemon's remains and release Warrant Officer Hall, the nuclear agreement will not be threatened. **********Stu Nagurka, a spokesman for Representative Richardson, said he has warned Pyongyang that ""failure to aggressively investigate this case and failure to return the missing servicemen would have a serious impact on U.S.-North Korean relations."" **********According to the Pentagon, Warrant Officer Hilemon was 29 years old and is survived by his wife, Berit. He joined the Army in February 1988 and became a pilot in August 1989. He was assigned to Fort Campbell, Ky., from June 1990 to March 1994 and earned a medal for combat service for flying a helicopter in the Persian Gulf war. On Nov. 4, he arrived in South Korea, where he and Warrant Officer Hall were stationed at Camp Page at Chunchon with Company A, 4th Battalion, 501st Aviation Regiment of the Army. **********Before the White House announced Warrant Officer Hilemon's death, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, issued a warning to the North Koreans on the CBS news program ""Face the Nation."" **********""They're not exactly in an enviable position in the world, are they?"" he said. ""Their dictator's dead.  Their economy's dead. And they've got two American pilots, and they'd better get them back fast."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/business/media-business-publishing-bookstores-this-year-selling-valentine-s-day-became.html,Sarah Lyall,1994-02-21,,758,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; At bookstores this year, the selling of Valentine's Day became a many-splendored thing.","THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; At bookstores this year, the selling of Valentine's Day became a many-splendored thing."," **********MAYBE you spent Valentine's Day gorging on chocolate, waiting in dark distemper for someone to send flowers, or treating your romantic interest to dinner at a place more significant than the Chirpin' Chicken. Or maybe -- this is what book publishers hoped -- you went to the store and bought some books about sex, love and romance. **********Book publishers traditionally use any holiday they can as a vehicle to promote their books. The practice has increased over the years as marketers have become at once wiser and a bit more desperate, and Valentine's Day has metamorphosed in their minds from a greeting-card holiday to a major marketing opportunity, a time to put out much of the year's selection of books that are even tenuously connected to romance. **********The books don't have to be published on Feb. 14; they just have to appear in stores sometime before that date. And they do: relationship books about finding, keeping, splitting or recovering from a spouse; books of highly sexed fiction, like Robert Olen Butler's ""They Whisper""; academic treatises on the sociobiological imperatives for love, and, of course, the tiny books that appear briefly by the cash register, sell tens of thousands of copies and for some reason are called ""small treasures."" **********That is why Simon & Schuster decided to cash in on Valentine's Day by publishing ""The Kiss,"" a 4.5-square-inch book of illustrations and snippets of poetry, prose and song, just in time for the holiday. At $9.95, the book isn't cheap, but it still qualifies as an impulse buy. **********""We like to tie into the holidays -- Halloween, St. Patrick's Day, the Fourth of July,"" Victoria Meyer, the publicity director at the adult trade division of Simon & Schuster, said. ""Retailers are always looking for more ways to market their books, and the sense that we're getting is that Valentine's Day is building."" **********Some bookstores said the barrage of books had inspired them, for the first time this year, to devote their windows to Valentine-themed displays. At Just Books, a small independent store in Greenwich, Conn., workers organized a witty love-related window around the holiday, throwing in a slew of newly released books as well as titles like Sue Miller's ""For Love"" and Patti Davis's ""Bondage."" **********""I put together a cupid, a heart and a present and lined them up with all the books,"" said Cheryl Barton, a store employee who organized the window. Romantic books always sell well, she said, particularly when romance is, or is supposed to be, on everyone's mind. ""It's such a perennial topic for the human race, and one of the greatest pastimes -- even in bookstores,"" she said. **********Stores report that sales generally go up at the end of January and the first two weeks of February, though they can't attribute the rise exclusively to Valentine's Day. **********But as much as retailers might want to parlay Valentine's Day into increased sales, Maryann Palumbo, the vice president of marketing for the mass-market division of Penguin U.S.A., cautioned that it was a particularly ephemeral holiday. ""What you have to remember is that there's a lot of stuff like this out there, and it's really just a one-shot deal,"" she said. **********And while books about relationships are clearly growing as a genre, according to Sharon Hails, the vice president for merchandising at Waldenbooks, Valentine's Day isn't the top book holiday by any means. Robert Wietrak, a director of merchandising at Barnes & Noble, said, ""It's like No. 10 for holidays."" His list of more successful days included Christmas, Mother's and Father's Days, Halloween and graduation time, for starters. **********Bookstore owners say most Valentine's Day book buyers are women. At Ballantine Books, the publicity director, Carol Fass, noticed with interest that copies of the Tamara Nikuradse-Scott Matthews paperback ""To the Man I Love, Thank You for Being Mine,"" outsold copies of ""To the Woman I Love, Thank You for Being Mine,"" also written by the couple, by a ratio of about 3 to 1, though sales of ""Woman"" picked up right before the holiday. ""Men wait a lot longer, perhaps until the last minute,"" she said. **********Do people prefer sensual prose to luxurious sweets? Carol Schneider, associate publisher and director of publicity at the adult trade division of Random House, said a volume of erotica could well be the best gift of all. **********Of course, Ms. Schneider admitted, she already has all the books she needs -- she works for a publishing company. ""I'm rather in favor of underwear, myself,"" she said."

Both cars were hit, and the four officers and an Egyptian worker for Unicef were killed. **********The United Nations Children's Fund was withholding the name of the slain staff worker, but an Interior Ministry statement identified him as Labib Ibrahim, a cameraman. An assistant project manager, also an Egyptian, was wounded and suffered head injuries, a Unicef spokeswoman, Nagwa Farag, said. **********The United Nations Children's Fund representative in Egypt, Baquer Namazi of the United States, and his deputy, Vanessa Tobin of Britain, were traveling in the Unicef car but were not hurt. **********Interior Ministry officials said they suspected that the attack was the work of the militant Islamic Group, which has been waging a violent campaign for more than two years to topple the secular Government of President Hosni Mubarak. **********The gunmen, who ambushed the cars near the village of Khuzam, 320 miles south of Cairo, recovered the police officers' weapons from the lead car and escaped into the surrounding farmland. The dead officers included a police captain, his driver and two conscripts. **********The campaign of violence by Muslim militants in Egypt has chosen as its targets police and Government officials, as well as foreign tourists, Coptic Christians and intellectuals. More than 400 people have died in such violence since the campaign began. **********The attack ends a lull that began several months ago after the police captured or killed several high-ranking leaders of the Islamic Group and shut down many of its cells in a series of raids. **********In February and March the group was killing several policemen a week. By April the attacks had dropped off significantly, and the tensions stirred by the bombings, shootings and threats against foreign residents diminished. **********The group has emerged from the shadows over the last 10 days. On Thursday, the police killed two militants in a gun battle near the town of Mallawi, 140 miles south of Cairo. On Wednesday, militants ambushed a police car in southern Egypt, killing one policeman and wounding four others. **********On Monday, armed militants attacked a police patrol in Mallawi, killing two policemen and wounding four others. **********The Islamic Group threatened to attack foreign delegates to the United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, which ended Tuesday.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/01/business/us-japan-talks-head-to-the-wire.html,Thomas Friedman,1994-10-01,,942,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,U.S.-Japan Talks Head To the Wire,U.S.-Japan Talks Head To the Wire," **********Japanese and American negotiators swapped proposals late into the night in an 11th-hour push to reach agreements on opening Japanese markets after 15 months of acrimonious talks. Both sides said the most likely result would be partial agreements and partial American sanctions on Japan. **********A deal opening Japan's closed insurance market, officials said, is virtually certain, as well as an agreement on opening Japanese Government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. The latter became possible when Japanese negotiators arrived late today with new language on how the two sides would measure whether Japan was following through on its promises to open these  markets. **********As negotiators worked into the night they said there was a slim chance they  could strike a deal opening the closed Japanese glass market, but there seemed little hope for an agreement that would induce Japanese companies to purchase more American autos and auto parts. **********The Administration has said it will initiate proceedings to impose economic  sanctions on Japan if there is no progress on glass and autos. But it has stressed that any sanctions would have a specific target, would take some time to go into effect and should not undermine the overall economic relationship between the world's two biggest economies. **********The Japanese have almost 100 trade negotiators, experts and aides in Washington for the talks -- almost equal to the entire staff of the United States trade representative's office. **********Financial markets in New York and Tokyo watched nervously as the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and  Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan engaged in their marathon, all-night negotiating session to determine what was possible and what was not. They are not expected to adjourn until noon Saturday, when Mr. Kantor will announce the results and any American sanctions. **********Billions of dollars have been bet in the currency and bond markets on hunches as to where these talks will end up. Any deal, even one that involved limited, focused sanctions on Japan, would probably help to strengthen the dollar, as traders conclude that the Americans will not have to rely solely on a weak dollar and strong yen to bring down Japan's $60 billion trade surplus. If there are no agreements, the dollar may be hammered, and the yen may soar. **********The dollar was up against the yen today in New York, reflecting anticipation that slightly more good news than bad will come out of the talks. Several big money managers are believed to have hedged their dollar bets by going short in the bond market -- meaning that if the talks fail and the bond market goes down, as it did last time, they will not lose as much by betting on the dollar. **********When the Administration initiated the idea of these framework negotiations with Japan in July 1993, it hoped to be able to announce a package deal of market-opening measures. Such a package was to include Japanese purchases of American autos and auto parts, insurance, telecommunications equipment and medical technology. **********After 15 months of frustrating negotiations, the Administration has resigned itself to a different strategy -- one of basically cutting whatever deals it can in these different areas, and initiating sanctions in areas where no satisfaction is forthcoming from Tokyo. **********The main problem has been Japanese refusal to accede to an American demand that any market-opening deals they agree to include specific yardsticks, known as ""objective criteria,"" to measure whether Japan is really living up to the agreement. The Japanese say this amounts to setting import targets. **********The most likely deal in the area of insurance would involve a Japanese agreement to eliminate rules requiring American companies to consult with Japanese competitors before introducing products. There also would be some way to measure the approval rate for foreign companies wanting to sell insurance in  the highly regulated Japanese market. **********In the area of Japanese Government procurement, the American side has been asking Tokyo to increase, from what is now a very low level, the amount of American medical equipment and telecommunications equipment it purchases. This is entirely in the hands of the Japanese Government to do. The Japanese have indicated a general willingness to comply and the two sides have basically been  arguing over what should be the minimum level of purchases against which they can measure whether Japan is buying more each year. **********The areas that pose the biggest problem, though, are autos and auto parts, which make up two-thirds of Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States. Here, there are three issues. First, the United States wants the Japanese Government to reduce regulations and inspection requirements, which Tokyo has used to limit imports of replacement auto parts. This is a multibillion-dollar market, of which the Americans have only a tiny share. There has been some progress on this issue, but Tokyo has been hesitant to make concessions, since it could mean fewer Japanese jobs. **********The Americans' other automotive demands are greater purchases by Japanese companies of original auto parts for Japanese cars made in Japan and the United  States, as well as more access for American car makers to Japan's dealer showrooms. **********These are areas that are basically in the hands of private Japanese auto companies, which in the past have tended to work together to restrict American access to their markets. But these companies have also had complaints about the  quality of American parts and the willingness of American manufacturers to make  cars with steering wheels on the right side, since the Japanese drive on the left side of the road. The Americans have been seeking the Japanese Government's help in dealing with Japanese auto makers."

Articles have titles like ""Portrait of a Time Too Beautiful to Forget,"" ""Savor Indian Summer in Tasha Tudor's Garden"" and ""Shopping for Romance."" **********Not exactly every postmodern woman's porcelain cup of tea. **********But Victoria is a phenomenon. In 1987, when power was the password for women, Hearst Magazines bucked the trend and quietly placed 400,000 copies of this reverie-filled magazine on newsstands without advertising or promotion. The cover of the first issue showed a woman in a large straw hat near a huge bouquet of peonies. **********The response surprised even Hearst executives. Eighty percent of the copies were bought -- an astonishingly high percentage considering that even popular magazines usually sell only half the copies they place on newsstands. Equally gratifying for Hearst were the 55,000 requests from women who returned subscription cards inserted into the issue. **********The magazine evolved into a monthly in 1989 as its gained readership among a diverse female audience. Victoria's circulation is now more than 900,000, according to the latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. John Mack Carter, director of magazine development at Hearst, who created the magazine, said that circulation would probably reach a million next year. **********Cindy J. Sperling, publisher of Victoria, said the magazine had been profitable for several years. ""Beautifully profitable,"" she added. **********Hearst is eager to duplicate its success with its newest magazine, Marie Claire, a monthly life-style publication aimed at women 25 to 44 years old. The company began the magazine last month through a joint venture with the French publisher Marie Claire Album. Hearst officials said it was too early to gauge the success of the magazine, which has an initial newsstand circulation of 700,000. **********Mr. Carter maintained that there were few similarities between the start-ups of Victoria and Marie Claire. In fact, Marie Claire's debut more closely resembles that of Smart Money, a 1992 joint venture between Hearst and Dow Jones & Company. The first issue of Smart Money sold 68 percent of the 250,000 copies on newsstands. **********Marie Claire already has name recognition. The magazine originated in France in 1937 and publishes editions in 22 countries. Its start-up is being heavily promoted by Hearst, as was the case with Smart Money, which received a lot of publicity for being the joint creation of two leading publishing companies. **********Victoria, on the other hand, hit the streets with no advance fanfare, yet seemed to touch a chord in stressed-out women longing for time to be alone, time to retreat from the demands of their lives. **********""We hit a nerve,"" said D. Claeys Bahrenburg, president of Hearst's magazine division. ""So many magazines are full of improve yourself, make yourself over, how to be a better mother, how to be a better wife. Women have pressure from family, work, professional commitments, and yet they want to keep a strong sense of their feminine identity. Victoria gives them that."" **********People who respond to the magazine, Mr. Carter said, tend to be busy, educated women who are as likely to live in urban environments as in smaller towns in Middle America. **********Mr. Bahrenburg and Mr. Carter give credit to the magazine's founding editor, Nancy Lindemeyer, who is now the editor in chief. They say Victoria under Ms. Lindemeyer is another example of how the most successful magazines come about from a strong editorial vision rather than from a blueprint drawn up by the business department. **********Ms. Lindemeyer brought in writers like Susan Minot, Phyllis Theroux and Madeleine L'Engle. She also felt that readers already bombarded with the realities of life wanted to hear more about its beauty. **********""For instance, all I heard about children was their problems,"" she said. ""No one was focusing on the beauty of life."" **********While the response from readers has been steadily enthusiastic, advertisers have been slower to accept the magazine. Victoria has run few ads in trade publications and is about to start its first ad campaign. **********The magazine, which has a price of $2.50, was up 9 percent in ad pages in the first eight months of the year, compared with the corresponding period in 1993. ""We need to do a much better job of articulating to our advertising public what this magazine is,"" Mr. Bahrenburg said. **********Ann Clurman, a partner in Yankelovich Partners, a research company in Norwalk, Conn., is conducting a study for Victoria of 500 women, age 25 to 54, to help define to advertisers exactly what need the magazine fills. **********""Victoria was very early in picking up on something that was going on in our society: this perception that we had lost something,"" she said. **********""It has to do with an emotional side,"" she continued. ""Women, regardless of their ideology or their employment status, are saying I need this back."" **********Advertisers may not get this, but readers obviously do. Take Randal Mapstead, owner of White Wolf Flowers in Bakersfield, Calif., who said he and his wife enjoyed the magazine so much that earlier this summer they sent 36 dozen lilies to the staff. **********""One day I was just sitting around, and I thought 'I bet they never get flowers in the office,' so I sent them some,"" Mr. Mapstead said."

Earlier, Intel shares fell 87.5 cents, to close at $58.625 in Nasdaq trading, because of uncertainty about the earnings report and an analyst's downgrading of the stock. **********Intel said its net income rose to $640 million, or $1.46 a share, for the quarter, compared with $569 million, or $1.30 a share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 30 percent, to $2.77 billion from $2.13 billion. **********Intel, the world's largest chip maker, said Pentium processor shipments were up substantially in the quarter, although it did not give exact figures. The company, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., also said orders exceeded the level of products shipped and billed during the quarter. **********""We had a solid quarter as growing sales of PC's increased demand for Intel microprocessors,"" Andrew S. Grove, Intel's president and chief executive, said in a statement. Focus on Price **********Analysts said increasingly competitive prices for Pentium-based personal computers had made the machines more widely accepted in homes and offices. ""They are starting to get the Pentium systems to the market at price points that are very attractive,"" said Thomas Thornhill 3d, a semiconductor analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ""It's like offering a BMW 5 series at the price of a Ford Taurus."" **********Intel said it still expected to produce six million to seven million Pentium chips this year. The Pentium family is expected to account for 25 percent of shipments to PC makers in the fourth quarter, normally a heavy sales period for computers. **********On the negative side, Intel said that its gross margins were essentially flat from the first quarter and that it expected trends that have produced lower gross margins to continue. **********Intel's largely optimistic report came after shares of chip makers slid on Friday. Texas Instruments reported higher revenue and earnings, but also forecast that the runaway growth in chip sales in the first half of the year would slow. That caused investors to flee chip makers' stocks. **********Before Intel released its earnings yesterday, a Cowen & Company analyst, Gerry Moore, downgraded 10 semiconductor stocks, including Intel, citing a possible buildup in inventories in PC distribution channels. He lowered his recommendation on Intel's shares to neutral from buy. **********Last week, the semiconductor industry reported its first monthly decline in orders since September, amid signs that corporate demand for personal computers that use the chips was beginning to slacken. **********Some industry experts have raised questions about the health of demand for PC's and forecast additional price cuts. Analysts have said Intel is likely to see significant margin declines for its processors as rivals eat into its market share and force the company to trim prices further. **********In the third quarter, Intel said, it would cut some microprocessor prices, including the Pentium's, for customers who buy 1,000 units or more. Prices will range from $964 for a 100-megahertz chip to $418 for a 60-megahertz version, after a price reduction that takes effect on Aug. 1."

The only ethical claim they make is that the market will, in the long term, lift the exploited from misery. **********Following the trend of environmentally sound investing, however, some fund managers have begun to build emerging market funds with a conscience. **********This sounds nice, but would you know an ethical company if you saw one? **********Not outside the United States, said Peter Chines of the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center. The center is an investment research company that gathers information on the S&P 500 companies to allow subscribers to screen their portfolios on a variety of social issues. **********""We get our information from government sources,"" said Mr. Chines. ""This information is available to anyone who asks, we just compile it on a daily basis."" **********""It is very different outside the U.S,"" Mr. Chines added. ""In America there are certain laws that require public reporting, like the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Freedom of Information Act also allows us to go through information that is not intentionally distributed to the public."" **********Even in developed markets, Mr. Chines said the information is hard to find. ""Elsewhere we have found nothing like the information that is available in the U.S. We did a scoping study in the U.K., but found that it was not feasible."" **********Beyond a simple lack of accurate information about companies, Mr. Chines said investors must decide what criteria to use. One method is to compare a company's performance against its peers in a given industry. Another method is to judge companies by their gross impact - a given amount of toxic emission is bad no matter who is responsible for it. But the latter criterion, said Mr. Chines, ""will lead you to reject large companies, and even entire industries."" Another consideration ""is environmental justice, or, what the company puts back into the community."" **********Two funds, Calvert's World Values Global Equity Fund, and Crédit Lyonnais's Eurco Solidarité, wrestle with ethics in emerging markets using radically different approaches. **********The Calvert World Values Global Equity Fund was set up in 1992 with what Steve Schueth, vice president, socially responsible investing for the Calvert Group, called a ""double bottom line."" **********""We look at the traditional bottom line, which is quantitative: How much money can we make? Then we look at the second bottom line, in which we try to gauge the quality of the company relating to its products and how it operates,"" Mr. Schueth said. **********He added: ""We look at all the stakeholder groups, meaning not just the shareholders, but also employees, vendors and suppliers, the communities in which the companies operate, and the environment. We get a character profile of companies and invest in the most socially responsibly managed in any given sector. We look for companies that are head and shoulders above their peers."" **********Andrew Preston, investment manager at Murray Johnstone International Ltd., which manages the Calvert World Values Global Equity Fund, said that identifying those companies can be difficult. ""The problem is a lack of information or the veracity of that information."" **********""It is basically impossible to check up on everything a multinational is involved in. We just do it to the best of our abilities,"" Mr. Preston said. ""In many Third World countries, where it is next to impossible to find out enough, we are forced to fall back on negative screening."" **********The Calvert fund's negative screening checks companies for involvement in the tobacco industry, weapons-making and nuclear power. The positive screening deals with human rights, the environment and labor relations. **********Social conscience aside, Mr. Schueth said, clean companies are a sound long term investment. ""They are less likely to be faced with the liability of a large cleanup tomorrow, if they are clean today."" The Calvert fund, with $107 million under management, returned 21.25 percent over the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg Business News. **********Mr. Schueth is upbeat about the future of ethical investing in emerging markets. ""Our U.S.-based socially conscious funds provide us with a history of showing that we can do well by doing good."" Unlike the Calvert fund, Eurco Solidarité tackles ethical problems with its profits, not its investments. **********The fund does not directly invest in emerging markets, and its investments are ethically blind. ""For the moment this fund is made up exclusively of French stocks, and we look for the best-performing companies to get as high a revenue as possible,"" said Michel Vaslin of Crédit Lyonnais, which manages the fund. **********""It is essential that we make as much money as possible, as half the earnings go to the Société d'Investissement et de Développement International, or SIDI, to develop small companies in Central and Eastern Europe,"" Mr. Vaslin said. **********SIDI is a company run by the Catholic Church, and organizes loans, training and Western expertise for small companies in Eastern Europe. Rather than worry about the subtleties of ethics, Mr. Vaslin said, this system allows him concentrate on the job of running a profitable fund rather than having to worry about ethical subtleties. **********The fund, he said, ""is a way for bankers, who do not necessarily know anything about how to help impoverished people, to aid in developing market economies."" **********Set up in 1991, Eurco Solidarité has grown to 132 million French francs ($23 million). Last year the total return was nearly 21 percent, , half of which went to SIDI. Not only do investors know that their money is helping to develop Eastern Europe, said Mr. Vaslin, but they also get a tax break on their profits. **********Laurence Rouget-Le Clech, a director at SIDI, concurred with Mr. Vaslin. ""A problem we have often run into in Poland is that people only want to make fast money. It is difficult to find responsible entrepreneurs who will carry a business through for as long as a year."" **********Although the objective is development, not maximal profits, Mrs. Rouget-Le Clech said unethical companies are not necessarily excluded from receiving help from SIDI. ""If we made ethical treatment of workers a sine qua non for investment, we wouldn't put any money into Poland."""

For several years, small companies were soundly beaten by their larger rivals on the London Stock Exchange. **********Until things changed in 1993, when the long awaited economic recovery came into view. Investors began to cast their minds back to times when the British economy was growing at a healthy pace. They recalled that stocks in smaller companieshad provided some of their best investment returns and began to buy them. **********The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, the classic yardstick of British **********smaller companies stocks, climbed 44 per cent in sterling terms last year. It **********made the FT-A All Share broad market index's 15.6 per cent look meager. **********Advocates of Britain's smaller companies expect them to achieve better returns than larger stocks for the next few years. They also think they will do well compared with cash. This is despite the recent correction in equity markets worldwide and fears of higher inflation and rising interest rates in Britain. **********Andy Yeo, a research analyst at Hoare Govett Securities, says: ""We believe the **********next two to three years will be a good time for smaller companies."" **********In fact, the securities house is sticking by its forecast of a 20 per cent rise in the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index this year, he added. **********That prediction is based on Hoare Govett's estimates of earnings growth for the 600 stocks that make up the index and, by definition, comprise the bottom 10 percent of the British stockmarket. It is underpinned by a faith that smaller **********companies will once again prove to be the chief beneficiaries of economic **********revival. **********""Within the smaller company section of the market we have a lot of companies **********that are tied to the domestic economy, whereas a lot of the bigger companies **********have operations overseas or are utilities,"" says Ashton Bradbury, one of the **********five-strong smaller companies team at Hill Samuel Investment Management which has 800 millions pounds ($1.2 billion) under management and advises Bank von Ernst on the UK smaller companies part of its offshore Global Portfolio umbrella fund. **********""If you look at smaller companies, they tend to be housebuilders, property, or **********engineering stocks; those companies that do particularly badly in recession and **********there is now the prospect of them outperforming."" **********The recent fall in the stockmarket has failed to take as much shine off smaller **********companies as larger ones. While the FT-A All Share Index fell 6.2 per cent in **********the first three months of 1994, the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index **********actually rose 2.9 percent. **********Mr Yeo believes that much of the hiccup has been caused by a switch in **********stockmarket consensus. Earlier in the year it was that the next move in interest **********rates would be down, now it is that they will rise. **********Still he believes that after a quiet summer, smaller companies will start to move higher once more in the autumn. This will be fuelled by a combination of announcements of strong half-year earnings and a restoration of liquidity after the winter's demanding flood stock issues, he says. **********But a sea-change seems to have taken place in the British stockmarket that **********should make picking the right stock far more important than it has been so far during in this rally. **********Mike Giddings, a director of Rothschild Asset Management which runs the offshore Five Arrows UK Smaller Companies Fund, says: ""Inevitably, the urgency to achieve an exposure to smaller companies, where stock is often scarce, led to rapid price appreciation and some fairly indiscriminate buying. **********""That phase has probably now run its course. From here on, earnings growth is **********likely to be the chief determinant of stock price performance."" **********But, although smaller companies seem set for a period of outperformance, there **********is still a question mark over Hoare Govett's contention that smaller companies **********are the best equity investments over the long term. Despite 1993's strong **********performance, the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index only surpassed its 1987 pre-Crash peak in January. **********The index has achieved an 18.7 per cent annual compound return since its **********database began in 1955. And it has beaten the FT-A All Share Index by an average 4.3 per cent a year. **********Doubters say this may be because few investors bought smaller companies before the 1970s and, as a result, they traded on a lower and cheaper ratio of share price to earnings per share. They have since become more popular and caught up, so some of the glittering returns must be thanks to **********starting from a lower base. **********Mr Yeo is steadfast. **********""If you look at the 4.3 per cent return, two thirds of that has come from higher dividend growth. ""What we are saying is that the smaller companies end of the market is able to produce higher dividend growth and it is that that drivesoutperformance."""

But at heart they haven't changed much. These giant postcards of Americana have somehow managed not to sacrifice their hog-pulling, cotton-candy roots as they've sprouted into very big businesses indeed. **********Just look at the Wisconsin State Fair, which drew close to a million fairgoers at its 11-day run earlier this month. Rural rubbed shoulders with urban, old with new. Farmers in overalls munched turkey legs alongside bikers in Harley-Davidson T-shirts. Local brewery workers and Mediterranean Leghorn roosters stared at each other in the Poultry Barn. Wide-eyed children watched jumpers swan-dive off a 14-story Bungee jump, cheered the Miller High Life Pig Racing contest or climbed the World's Largest Piggy Bank (16 feet high). **********The Ferris wheel, of course, still turned, but nearby, business people in Ray-Bans and teen-agers in the latest grunge lined up to try the new virtual-reality game. At the 15,000-seat grandstand, the line-up included Reba McIntyre, Motley Crue, the Beach Boys, and Barry Manilow. **********The site itself had a tale to tell, too. In 1892, the 200-acre Wisconsin State Fairground was carved out of rural farmland, 10 long miles from Milwaukee. Now, the creeping city has almost engulfed the fairground -- with some of it even lying within the city limits. **********But the fair survives -- just one of more than 3,000 in the United States and Canada that are doing just fine in this decidedly non-agrarian age. You can still see exhibits of champion sheep -- which is, after all, where some say it all started: In 1807, a man named Elijah Watson, sometimes called ""the father of U. S. agricultural fairs,"" staged a modest sheep exhibit in Pittsfield, Mass., and the rest is history. **********Nearly two centuries later, you can still see pig races, pumpkin-carving contests or farm equipment displays -- but they're interspersed with hundreds of product displays and industry showcases. You can still hear plenty of country music, but heavy metal and rap have found their way in, too. And don't be surprised to find a Karaoke machine next to the saltwater-taffy stand. **********That sheep exhibit, in short, has evolved into a diversified, billion-dollar business, with the full weight of corporate sponsorship and civic boosterism mixed in with old-time agricultural showcasing and carnivals. According to Thomas Powell, associate publisher of the trade paper Amusement Business, the estimated 158 million North American fairgoers spend about $300 million a year at the gates, $300 million more on carnival rides, and even more on food, drinks and games. And that doesn't include the millions spent on hotel rooms, restaurants and shopping. **********The economic impact of a fair can be considerable. The Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield, Mass., brings an estimated $50 million into the local economy during its run (this year, Sept. 16 to Oct. 2). The Texas State Fair claims a $160 million lift for the Dallas/Fort Worth economy. **********And in Milwaukee, ""It's like having two major league baseball teams in town each day,"" said Mayor John O. Norquist. ""People from all over the state patronize local hotels, restaurants, bars and other shops."" **********And nested inside each nonprofit fair is another world unto itself: the carnival. Carnivals are private businesses that travel year-round, setting up and operating their rides on the fairgrounds' midways, then moving on. Many are family-run and decades old, traveling long-established routes. Most have just 6 to 8 rides and may move 5 to 10 miles a week. But these days, many are huge interstate, or even international, businesses, with more than 100 rides. **********Carnivals spend only a few days at each event, typically paying 25 to 40 percent of their gross to the fair's nonprofit sponsor, with rides costing $1.50 to $3. In off-season, they play all kinds of events. Dominick Vivona, one of five brothers who run Amusements of America of Englishtown, N.J., said his 120-ride carnival is booked year-round from Florida to Canada. ""In the spring we play what we call 'still dates' -- shopping centers, coliseum parking lots, racetracks or stadiums,"" he said. ""Then, in June and July, we start playing our fairs -- county fairs, state fairs, festivals, celebrations."" **********Carnival revenues can be enormous. ""A large carnival, with 60 or 70 rides, has the capacity to gross anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million a week,"" Mr. Vivona said. And a handful go far higher. Murphy Brothers Expositions, based in Tulsa, Okla., the No. 2 carnival last year, has an annual gross of $30 million to $40 million. **********But ""if you make a 5 percent profit, you're doing well,"" Mr. Vivona said. ""By the time you pay your percentage of the ride gross, and your insurance, your payroll, your transportation, and your maintenance payments on the rides, there's very little left."" **********When Mr. Vivona's parents started Amusements of America in 1940, they bought a Ferris wheel for $3,500. Today, though, ""a little kiddie ride costs $50,000 to $100,000,"" said Jerry Murphy, owner and president of Murphy Brothers. ""A very big ride costs upwards of $1 million."" **********Regulation also causes big headaches. ""The red tape has become unbelievable,"" Mr. Vivona said. ""If you're a big carnival, and you have to operate from state to state, it has become very difficult and expensive because every state has different safety laws, different permits, different licenses."" **********Operating a big carnival ""is like running a little city,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""You've got to be the mayor, the police chief, the fire department, and everything."" **********The visitors to that little city, and the rest of the fair, have changed over a century as a population that was 97 percent rural did a back flip to become 97 percent urban or suburban. Not only have people moved to cities, but -- as in Milwaukee -- the cities have often surrounded the fairs. **********""A hundred years ago the fair was primarily educational for the farmer, because it showed him different kinds of livestock and seedcorn and produce,"" said Lewis Miller, general manager of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions. And that past is clearly alive. The Wisconsin fair got about 17,300 entries in 1993 for livestock, home economics, horticulture, and the like. ""But the educational value,"" Mr. Miller said, ""has probably become much larger to the city dweller, who comes out and says, 'My goodness, there's a cow being milked.' "" **********A fair's traditional features, though, bring in little revenue and are in effect subsidized by modern elements. Agricultural associations have long been sponsors. The Wisconsin Bakers' Association, for instance, has been showcasing its products for over 70 years, as have the Wisconsin Beef Council, the Wisconsin Pork Producers and the Wisconsin Poultry Industries. **********But corporate participation picked up noticeably in the past decade. ""It's cost-effective advertising,"" said Joe LaGuardia, marketing director of the New York State Fair in Syracuse, which opened on Thursday. ""Where else can you reach 86,000 people a day"" -- people who are prime consumers ""because they're here to look."" **********And corporate America is becoming quite creative in promoting its products. At the Wisconsin fair, in addition to the Miller High Life Pig Race, you could attend the Bud Light fireworks, a concert sponsored by Skoal or Fleischmann's, or events sponsored by local banks, restaurants and radio stations. You could drink beer in pavilions built long ago by Miller, Pabst or Budweiser. **********The Wisconsin fair also had over 700 commercial booths and displays. A ""Smart Mop"" demonstration was so effective that 500 were sold in a day at $19.99 apiece. Fairgoers tried out the ""Kneading Fingers"" pillow-sized massager, oohing and ahhing all the while, and bought 40 at $150 each. **********IS the cost of promotion at fairs worth it to corporations? ""The typical sponsor would be looking for 3.5 to 1 return on promotion dollars,"" says Richard Bjorklund, director of the Wisconsin fair. ""I would be comfortable in saying that if you polled them you'd find they easily get that return and much more."" **********But in the end, ""fairs are not a labor of money, they're a labor of love,"" Mr. Miller said, with much that's thrown in free. ""We've historically had entertainment as part of the gate price, with stages going at all different times, for 141 years,"" said Norbert Bartoski, general manager of the California State Fair and Exposition in Sacramento. **********The recession made things tougher. State governments nationwide cut subsidies to state-operated fairs. Many states mandated about four years ago that their fairs become self-sufficient. **********That trend toward self-sufficiency has spurred public fair organizations into better use of their facilities year-round. At the New York State Fair, also called the Empire Expo Center, ""we have several major exhibit buildings, a 50,000-seat grandstand where we have auto-racing, a 45,000-seat coliseum with a hockey program in the winter, and parking for 25,000 cars,"" Mr. LaGuardia said. **********One constant hazard for a fair's budget is nature's bad moods. ""Weather is the universal fear in the fair business,"" Mr. Bjorklund said. ""We have a lot of eggs in one 11-day basket."" Last summer, in fact, the worst storms in 40 years hit the Indiana State Fair's opening weekend. **********Last year in Iowa, though, the floods that deluged the state stopped half a mile short of the fairgrounds. The state fair, which called itself ""11 Days of Flood Relief,"" had record attendance of 893,000. ""People were ready to come out after so many weeks of flooding and rain,"" said the manager, Marion Lucas. 'State' Is an Elusive Concept THE term ""state fair"" refers to fairs and expositions run by nonprofit organizations in a variety of arrangements, says Lewis Miller, general manager of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions. Of the 50 largest fairs and expositions in the United States and Canada, many are indeed ""state"" fairs -- bona fide state agencies, publicly owned and operated. But many are private nonprofits, including No. 1, the State Fair of Texas, which dwarfs the rest with attendance of over 3.1 million. **********No. 8 isn't a state but a county fair -- the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona. It had 1.4 million fairgoers in 1993, half a million more than the Wisconsin State Fair. And No. 3 isn't even in this country -- 1.75 million people attended the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto last year, one of five Canadian fairs to make the top 50. Average attendence at the top 50 is between half a million and 1.5 million people, according to Amusement Business. The fairs generally run 10 to 17 days, mainly in August and September. **********Fair revenue comes from four major areas: gate admissions, carnival rides, food and entertainment, with the fair normally receiving about a quarter to a third of the gross. Carnivals typically pay 25 to 40 percent of their grosses to the fair. Some fairs sell concert tickets for the bigger acts, with the fair retaining only 10 to 20 percent. **********Per capita spending varies, but a survey for the New York State Fair outside Syracuse, for instance, found that the average person spent about $21.50. Multiply that by an attendance of 860,000 people over 12 days, and that comes to over $18.5 million."

A number of Sun Belt Blue Cross plans, as well as several in the Middle West, may be among the first in line. **********Even before the association's governors voted last week to let investor-owned companies use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield insignia, at least six of the 69 state and local Blue Cross plans were already considering a public equity financing of a subsidiary, following the example of the California plan's Wellpoint Health Networks. **********The Missouri Blue Cross plan filed last month to sell stock in a managed-care unit and is expected to proceed with the sale soon. **********And yesterday, underwriters for United Wisconsin Services, a managed-care unit of the Wisconsin Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, completed a $70 million stock offering, pared from the $96 million they first sought. As health maintenance organization stocks declined, the number of shares in the offering was cut to 2.5 million from 3.2 million. **********Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virgina, which analysts said had discussed going public with eight or nine investment bankers, announced yesterday that it  was renaming itself Trigon Blue Cross and Blue Shield, apparently with an eye to spreading beyond the state line. **********Todd Richter, a health care analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said he had recently met with Blue Cross executives in Virginia and Georgia. Blue Cross plans in Florida, Illinois and Michigan are also on many analysts' roster of strong candidates to be stock market companies. **********Mr. Richter said Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, which had been on  the critically ill charts until recently, was recovering under new management, although it must still rebuild depleted reserves. Fred Hillman, a spokesman, said it had no immediate plans to sell stock. **********A turnaround can sometimes be swift. Wellpoint's parent, California Blue Cross, is now one of the strongest plans, Mr. Richter said, ""even though it was  a disaster only five or six years ago."" **********Kimberly Purvis at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said Wellpoint was ""one of the best-managed H.M.O.'s around,"" but its shares have slumped from a 52-week high of $37 in March. Although Wellpoint's earnings are rising 10 to 15 percent  this year, the stock lags behind the H.M.O. group, she said, because three-quarters of its customers are in a slow-growing preferred provider discount network. Wellpoint closed at $29.50 yesterday, unchanged on the Big Board. **********It was a poor day in the markets for most managed-care companies, following remarks by Representative Sam Gibbons, now chairman of the House Ways and Means  Committee. He is pushing ahead with a health care bill that could slow earnings  growth at these companies. **********Shares of United Wisconsin Services dropped $1.125 yesterday, closing at $28  on the New York Stock Exchange. Also on the Big Board, United Healthcare declined $2.75, to $45.125, and Humana was down $1.375, to $16.125. U.S. HealthCare was off $2.31, to $37 in Nasdaq trading. **********Richard Shapiro, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, said H.M.O. stocks  had been selling at much higher prices than shares of companies selling traditional fee-for-service health insurance. But Salomon Brothers thinks that the ""huge disparity will erode,"" he said, because the traditional insurance companies are controlling costs more closely, while many H.M.O.'s are loosening  some constraints."

Dougan's office at the Mackie International factory sits astride the peace line, the wall -- imaginary in some spots, quite real in others -- that divides the Protestant and Roman Catholic neighborhoods of West Belfast. **********""If you look over there to the left, you can see houses flying tricolors,"" Mr. Dougan said as he pointed out the window, referring to the Irish flag, a symbol of the Catholic minority's demands for a British withdrawal from the province. ""Over there to the right, you can see Union Jacks."" **********At Mackie, no flags fly at all. They would not, said Mr. Dougan, the company's chairman and owner, be a good idea at the plant, once a bastion of Protestant employment and now the site of one of the more ambitious efforts to desegregate Northern Ireland's economy. **********Of the 400 workers at the plant, which makes machinery for the textile industry, 29 percent are Catholic, up from 11 percent in 1991, when Mr. Dougan took over. Catholics make up about 42 percent of Northern Ireland's population of 1.6 million. **********For Mr. Dougan, a wealthy Catholic entrepreneur, who was viewed with deep suspicion by Mackie's work force when he was recruited by the Government three years ago to revive the ailing company after the previous American owners filed for bankruptcy, the opportunity to hire more Catholics has been a byproduct of his success in stabilizing and then expanding Mackie International. **********Relations on the shop floor have generally been harmonious, workers said, and Mackie is profitable again. **********But even now, as the peace process in Northern Ireland gains momentum, Protestants arrive to work each morning through a gate adjacent to their neighborhood and the Catholics at a separate gate near their homes. **********""I frankly don't see that wall coming down anytime soon,"" Mr. Dougan said. ""But we have a gospel to preach, that it is possible to be successful right here on the battlefield, the erstwhile battlefield I hope, when people want to work together and get on with their lives."" **********Workplace integration in Northern Ireland is a huge task, given the province's deep-rooted patterns of segregation and employment discrimination, primarily against Catholics, and the enduring enmity between the two communities. Even putting history aside, male unemployment in the neighborhoods visible from Mr. Dougan's window runs as high as 60 percent, spawning levels of poverty, disillusionment and resentment that have made the area the primary recruiting ground for the terrorist forces on both sides. **********Such integration is also a subject watched with great interest among American supporters of Northern Ireland's Catholics. New York City's municipal pension fund and other public pension funds are among the investors that subscribe to guidelines known as the MacBride Principles. The principles, which were named after an Irish politician, Sean MacBride, include a call for selling the stock of American companies operating in Northern Ireland that are shown to discriminate against Catholics. American companies account for about 10,000 jobs in Northern Ireland, or less than 2 percent of the total. **********With Northern Ireland enjoying its best chance for peace in 25 years, Government officials and business leaders said they saw great opportunities to breathe new life into the economy, create jobs and redress the imbalances of the past while providing hope to both sides. **********By some indicators, Northern Ireland has a long way to go. Catholic males, with a jobless rate estimated at 28 percent, are more than twice as likely to be jobless as Protestant males, who have an unemployment rate around 13 percent. With the economy still feeling the effects of recession, few industries are hiring new workers, making it hard to provide opportunities to Catholics. **********At many of the biggest industrial employers, a combination of prejudice, fear and economic difficulty has left Catholics badly underrepresented. Of the 2,000 employees at Harland & Wolff, the shipyard that is Belfast's largest employer, only 5 percent last year were Catholic. With the company struggling to avoid further job cuts, the prospects for hiring more Catholics there are dim. **********By the same token, there are employers with predominantly Catholic work forces who are having as much trouble hiring Protestants. Despite efforts to step up recruitment, the Sean Quinn Group, a cement manufacturer near Fermanagh, had only six Protestants among its 280 employees last year. **********Although there is a growing Catholic middle class, in inner-city ghettos many Catholic families are enduring their second or even third generation of male unemployment. Skill and educational levels are low among those Catholics. Even when jobs in Protestant companies are available to Catholics, they are often passed up out of fear of violence. Catholic workers are a primary target of Protestant paramilitary forces. **********Still, there has been measurable progress over the last few years in reversing discrimination. Catholics held 36.6 percent of all jobs last year, up from 34.9 percent in 1990, according to the Fair Employment Commission, the British agency that enforces a tough antidiscrimination law enacted in 1989. **********""We're heading in the right direction, and the pace of change could accelerate very substantially if we were to have peace,"" said Robert G. Cooper, the panel's chairman. ""You'd hope to see an expansion of the economy. And you would not have the enormous chill factor, the reluctance and fear on the part of many workers to go to jobs in particular areas."" **********The textile industry has a long history in Northern Ireland, and Mackie, which was founded in the mid-19th century and makes machines that prepare and spin fibers for textile companies, has suffered badly along with the rest of the industry over the last several decades. Employment at the company dwindled from the thousands down to 270 in 1991. **********Mackie had been acquired in the mid-1980's by an American company, Lummus Industries of Georgia, but after Lummus went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1992, threatening Mackie's already precarious chances of survival, Mr. Dougan agreed to buy the company, with the price being the assumption of its $21 million in debt. **********Mr. Dougan, who has turned around other companies, expanded Mackie's sales force, pushing into Asian markets, for example. He diversified into environmental services. And with some help from the gradual world economic recovery, Mackie's sales this year will be about $30 million, up from $9 million in 1991. The company should record a $3 million profit this year after a long period of losses, Mr. Dougan said. **********Later this month, Mr. Dougan will take Mackie public through a $16.5 million share offering on the London Stock Exchange. The proceeds will go to debt repayment and modernizing machinery. **********As he has added more than 100 new jobs over the last few years, Mr. Dougan said, he has recruited actively among Catholics, but never hired workers just because they were Catholic. He praised his Protestant work force for what he called its strong work ethic and reliability. **********The biggest problem, he said, is finding skilled Catholic workers, who are in short supply. Many of the Catholics he has hired have been recently trained in jobs like welding, rather than in more highly skilled fields like machine-tool operations. **********Catholics from nearby neighborhoods used to throw rocks at Protestant workers as they went in and out of the plant. But now, as the Catholic proportion in Mackie's work force grows, workers on both sides said they get along well, and that at least within the walls of the factory no one focuses on religion. **********""You can't change the balance overnight, because you've got to hire the people who can do the kind of work we do,"" said Paddy Auld, a plant supervisor, who is Catholic. ""If we don't get the proper people in, then the company can't survive, and one thing that people in all sections of the community are finding out is that if you lose your job, it doesn't matter what religion you are.""                    --------------------       Belfast Hilton Planned **********LONDON, Sept. 7 (Reuters) -- In a joint venture with a Northern Ireland real estate development company, Hilton International will build a 187-room hotel in the center of Belfast, the company said today.

""She should be executed."" **********Since it broke away from Pakistan 22 years ago, Bangladesh has had more than its share of travails. It has been buffeted by cyclones and floods, and burdened by illiteracy and poverty that place the country's 120 million people among the most disadvantaged in the world. **********It has been rocked by bloody coups, assassinations and popular uprisings against military dictatorships, although military rulers have held sway, either under martial law or through pliant parliaments, for all but seven years. **********Now, once again, the country seems poised on the edge of turmoil that could engulf the government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the widow of a former military ruler who was assassinated after winning election as President. **********Amid the tensions swirling around Miss Nasrin, who went underground after the Government brought criminal charges against her six weeks ago for allegedly insulting the Muslim faith, Muslim militants have unleashed a battery of strikes and protest rallies in Dhaka, the capital, and in other cities. **********Thousands have surged through the streets, echoing Muslim clerics' calls for the writer's head with cries of ""Death, death and only death for the apostate Nasrin!"" **********Militant leaders have used the turmoil to promote a wide agenda of fundamentalist demands, including calls for Bangladesh to be made an Islamic republic, and for the Muslim penal code, to be imposed as criminal law. **********They have demanded the expulsion of privately run foreign aid organizations that administer much of the $2 billion the country receives each year in development assistance, describing the agencies' efforts to foster more jobs and education for women, among other projects, as ""decadent"" and ""un-Islamic."" **********The demands have come just as international aid agencies have been saying that Bangladesh has begun to turn the corner, with striking gains in primary education for girls, in employment opportunities for women, and in lowering birth rates. **********But as the social advances have gathered speed, they have met increasing resistance from the male-dominated hierarchies in the villages where 80 percent of Bangladeshis live, particularly from the Muslim clerics at the top of the rural power pyramid. **********Under a stronger Government, many Bangladeshis opposed to the militants say, the militants could scarcely have hoped to turn the utterances of a writer, even one as controversial as Miss Nasrin, into a platform for creating major political unrest. Educated, urban Bangladeshis insist that the traditions of Bengali Muslims incline toward tolerance, not zealotry, in religious matters. **********""The Bengali mind is basically secular,"" said Serajul Islam Chowdhury, an English literature professor at the University of Dhaka. ""The mullahs are good men, but we have never wanted them in politics."" **********Instead of confronting the militants, the Zia Government has seemed eager to placate them. **********The charge against Miss Nasrin was brought under a little-used statute on religious defamation dating from British colonial days. Cabinet ministers have tried to outdo one another in condemning the writer. **********The Foreign Ministry's press office has been distributing translations of one of Miss Nasrin's more sexually graphic poems. ""As you can see, it is more or less pornographic,"" a spokesman said. **********The Prime Minister has maintained silence on the affair, but several of her ministers who discussed the controversy say they are merely carrying out a law designed to prevent the kind of religious violence that has racked India. **********""We have gone to court to safeguard the feelings of the people, as any civilized country would,"" said the Foreign Minister, Mustafi Zur Rahman. ""Now we leave it to the court. If she convinces them, she walks a free woman."" **********Senior ministers have acknowledged that they see the controversy over Miss Nasrin as a potential trigger for wider disturbances that could hasten the Government's downfall. Although initially popular in 1991, when it became the the country's first truly civilian administration since 1975, the Zia Government has been weakened by a political stalemate that developed when the entire opposition walked out of Parliament five months ago, vowing not to return until the installation of a neutral ""caretaker"" government empowered to hold new elections. A Political Stand-Off **********The impasse has led to a competition between Prime Minister Zia and her main rival, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, leader of the Awami League, for the support of the Muslim fundamentalists. **********The main fundamentalist group in Parliament, the Party of God, originally backed the Prime Minister's party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, allowing it to form a government after the 1991 elections, but it subsequently joined the opposition boycott. Now the Party of God, along with the Awami League, is threatening to broaden the street disturbances. The scale of the turmoil has shaken many here who had taken comfort from the apparent weakness of the Party of God. **********Few can be more shaken than Miss Nasrin, who has struck an almost panic-stricken tone in messages smuggled from her hiding place. ""The mullahs are everywhere,"" she said in a message last month. ""If I stay here, they must kill me.""  Messages From Hiding **********The messages have been a far cry from the plucky impertinence that turned Miss Nasrin from an obscure physician in a Government clinic into the scarlet woman of Bangladesh. In newspaper columns and novels, in poems and interviews, Miss Nasrin advocated the right of women to choose their sexual partners and to have children outside of marriage. Three times married herself, she has said Muslim women should have the right to have four husbands simultaneously, just as the Koran permits men to take four wives. Her poems are ripe with sexual imagery daring even by Western standards. **********Anger among Muslim militants began to boil over in 1993, after Miss Nasrin wrote a novel, ""Shame,"" published in India as well as Bangladesh,that depicted the fictional sufferings inflicted by Muslim militants on a family of Bangladeshi Hindus. **********The Zia Government banned the book after it had sold 60,000 copies here, making it a best-seller. It also revoked Miss Nasrin's passport, restoring it after protests from western Governments and writers' groups. **********She lit the fuse that caused the current upheaval by giving an interview this spring to an Indian newspaper, The Statesman in Calcutta, in which she was reported as saying that the Koran should be ""revised thoroughly."" **********As death threats cascaded from Muslim clerics in Bangladesh, Miss Nasrin issued a statement saying that she had been misquoted, a claim denied by The Statesman. Later, she added fuel to the flames with a letter to The Statesman saying that urging the Koran's revision would have been ""irrelevant"" since, like the Bible and other religious texts, it was ""out of place and out of time."" Little Support from Peers **********Always a loner, Miss Nasrin made few friends among her fellow writers and intellectuals. Many have been harshly critical, saying that by provoking fundamentalists, Miss Nasrin has endangered causes, including women's rights, that others have worked for years to achieve. **********""She's been irresponsible in many ways,"" said Khushi Kabir, who heads a private organization, Nijera Kori, meaning ""Do It Ourselves,"" that works for the empowerment of rural women. Miss Kabir said that she had worked for two years in a rural village, and had avoided provoking the local imams despite ignoring Muslim traditions such as the one requiring women to cover their heads. **********""You learn how to handle these people,"" she said. ""It's something Taslima has never understood."""

The holdings include underground wooden, clay or plastic conduits laid by Western Union to hold telegraph lines. Through these pipes, some dating to the 19th century, must run the high-capacity fiber optic lines that will make possible video conferencing, video-on-demand and other services. **********In a news conference yesterday, Bert Roberts, the chairman of MCI, emphasized that the Western Unionconduits would provide the backbone of a network for more than 2,000 buildings in more than 200 cities, including the nation's 20 largest cities. MCI said construction had already begun in Atlanta and would be completed by midyear. MCI's stated goal: link directly to its corporate customers, rather than pay costly ""access"" charges to reach them through the local telephone networks. **********But in a telephone conference with reporters yesterday, Mr. Roberts seemed to indicate that the proposed network might also be a useful lobbying tool. Asked whether MCI intended to wage ""regulatory war"" at the state and Federal levels to reduce access charges, Mr. Roberts said MCI would wage ""the biggest war we can possibly make."" Access Charges High **********MCI collects annual revenue of more than $12 billion, but up to 45 percent of that is immediately returned to local phone companies in access charges. **********Other telecommunications companies had considered buying the Western Union pipes, but found them in disrepair and, in many cases, in locations that would not be useful for reaching some of the most lucrative corporate customers. **********""A lot of the conduits were old and completely collapsed -- especially the wooden and clay ones,"" said an executive at a telephone company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""But even if they were good, they wouldn't give you near the coverage. A lot of them are clustered near the railroad, and the center of town has moved away from the railroad since the turn of the century."" **********His company was one of more than two dozen telephone and cable companies that considered buying the Western Union assets. **********Western Union, operating under bankruptcy protection at the time, put the conduits up for sale in 1989 as part of its move to sell the company's Advanced Transmission Systems unit, which operated and leased fiber optic lines. Pipes Sold for $30 Million **********Western Union's asking price was $200 million, but the final sale price -- more than a year later -- was less than $30 million, because MCI bought only the conduits of Advanced Transmission, which is no longer in business. **********""Put it all together, and the whole thing just wasn't a good fit,"" recalled an executive at another telecommunications company that looked at the Western Union assets and passed. ""The city that was in the best shape was Atlanta because a lot of the pipe there was plastic that was built or refurbished in 1988 and 1989 just before the sale."" **********Warren R. Bechtel, a spokesman for the New Valley Corporation, the successor company to Western Union, sharply disputed the criticisms of the assets it sold MCI.  ""Those claims are absurd,"" he said. ""Starting in the 1970's, a lot of money was spent to upgrade that network because we were thinking of expanding at that time."" **********Gary M. Parsons, the new chief executive of MCI Metro, the company MCI has created to run its local networks, acknowledged that some of the Western Union conduits were built for long-defunct telegraph lines. But he said that MCI was aggressively buying conduits from utilities or other companies to complement the Western Union lines. **********In Atlanta, for example, the Western Union lines cover downtown Atlanta, but not the fast-growing Buckhead and Perimeter Center areas in the suburbs. MCI is buying additional conduits for those areas."

""It prevents me from bowing before the powerful."" **********From his bullet-proof, bomb-proof office overlooking a leafy midtown park here, Colombia's top prosecutor takes special delight in tweaking the occupant of another bullet-proof, bomb-proof office six blocks away: the United States Ambassador to Colombia. **********The Prosecutor accuses Washington of waging a ""dirty war"" to discredit him. He recently described the Clinton Administration's refusal to study legalization of drugs as ""not an ostrich policy, but a McCarthyite, Stalinist, fascist policy."" **********Replying in more diplomatic language than he uses in off-the-record conversations, Morris D. Busby, the Ambassador, recently told a newspaper here, ""The Prosecutor's words about legalization certainly have created confusion for us."" **********This tense duet will come to an end this month when Myles Frechette, the new United States Ambassador, arrives. And President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo is to send to the Supreme Court this month a list of three candidates to replace the Prosecutor, who has reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. **********But Mr. de Greiff indicates that in retirement he plans to continue to trumpet to Colombia and to the world his view that the drug czar has no clothes. **********""Legalization is the worst thing that could happen to drug traffickers,"" Mr. de Greiff, a former law professor and former principal of a Roman Catholic school, said recently, sitting at a desk adorned with pipe racks and religious statuary. **********""In Colombia, a kilo of 90 percent pure cocaine costs $2,000,"" he said. ""That same kilo sells wholesale in New York for $20,000, in London for $45,000."" The difference, he said, ""pays for the corruption of police, of customs agents, of airport authorities."" **********""As long as the trade is illicit, the narcotraficantes will continue to receive these immense profits that allow them to corrupt everyone,"" he continued, as a telephone buzzed insistently. **********Picking up the telephone, he patiently reassured his wife that no, he was not dead; that yes, there weredeath threats, and that yes, she should be more careful than usual. **********Hanging up, he said a new terror group, composed of remnants of the Medellin drug cartel, had threatened to kill him and President-elect Ernesto Samper ""in such a way that will make everyone's jaw drop."" **********Mr. de Greiff said of the drug war: ""This war does not have victories, only failures. Despite spraying and manual eradication, the areas of cultivation have not diminished, but have increased. Drug interdiction doesn't even reach 10 percent of the drugs that reach international markets. We kill the big capos, we put them in jail, we extradite them to the U.S. -- and yet prices don't even move overseas."" **********The telephone rang again. More reassurances to a family member. Apologies to the visitors. And a fresh round of strong Colombian coffee. **********""We have to study legalization,"" he said. ""Who would make the drugs? Private companies under government supervision? Or governments? How would they be distributed? All days? Or only on certain days?"" **********But the Government recently squelched a Constitutional Court ruling that decriminalized possession of a ""personal dose"" of drugs. Mr. Gaviria, whom Mr. de Greiff has denounced as ""servile"" to the United States, used administrative decrees to restrict drug consumption to inside private residences where minors or pregnant women are not present. **********""The President directly promoted an amazing hysteria,"" he said. ""Central governments are very opposed to legalization. **********""Change frightens people. There are a lot of vested interests in the drug war. There are a lot of people who would lose their jobs with legalization."" **********Mr. de Greiff has argued for legalization at international conferences and on the opinion pages of American newspapers. He said he had received the most favorable American responses from mayors and police chiefs. **********At the Federal level, the United States response has been a cold shoulder. Asserting that Mr. de Greiff wanted to negotiate lenient sentences with major traffickers, United States Justice Department officials stopped sharing criminal evidence with Colombia last March. **********""His effort frustrates, instead of advances, our common interest in bringing to justice people whose criminal activities have resulted in the death of many citizens,"" an unusually blunt State Department note said of Mr. de Greiff in April.

McAdoo, the former chief financial officer of People Express, who recently ended an eight-year stint as an airline stock analyst. ""And far more than for the money, you want to go back and do those things right."" **********Mr. McAdoo said there were no plans to bring back some aspects of People Express, like on-board ticketing and charging for coffee, soda and baggage. But, he said, there are plans to revive the basic strategy of keeping operating costs and fares low. **********Mr. McAdoo is chairman and chief executive of TSP Inc., which is based in Kansas City, Mo., and has applied for the certificate to start the new airline. People Express employees who have joined him include Fred L. deLeeuw, vice president of finance of TSP, and Ronald L. McClellan, vice president of maintenance of TSP. Founder Not Involved **********William F. Hambrecht, the chairman of Hambrecht & Quist, who helped raise money to start People Express and is a director of TSP, is also an investor in the new carrier. **********The founder of People Express, Donald C. Burr, who is not involved in the venture, said from his home at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., ""It's a lot of fun to see their dander and courage up and go for it again."" **********Mr. McAdoo said TSP had not decided on a name for the airline or if it made sense to find out whether the name People Express was available. TSP stands for Tampa-St. Petersburg, the Florida cities where Mr. McAdoo said he thought several years ago he might want to base the airline. **********But Mr. McAdoo said he saw a better opportunity to start an airline with two to four Boeing 737's in his hometown of Kansas City and serve cities like Milwaukee, Denver and Wichita, Kan. One-way fares would range from $59 to $79 and follow a two-tier structure for peak and off-peak travel times, he said. **********Because of overcapacity in the airline industry, there are jets and airline workers available at prices and salaries that would let the company re-create its early-80's low-cost structure, Mr. McAdoo said. **********Hambrecht & Quist, an investment bank and venture capital concern in San Francisco that has put up most of the $2 million in start-up financing for TSP, has said it will raise an additional $4 million before the airline's first flight sometime before Thanksgiving. **********Mr. Hambrecht was a director of People Express and helped raise nearly $25 million before the first People Express plane took flight. **********People Express, which was based in Newark, started flying in 1981 with a modest business plan of low fares on short routes with small planes. But with early successes it expanded overseas and attracted the ire of some established competitors, who used computerized pricing to match its low fares. Even though its annual revenues grew to more than $1 billion, the competition undercut People Express and it was acquired by Continental Airlines in 1986. **********""Our experience with People Express left us with sense of, 'If only . . .' "" Mr. Hambrecht said. In subsequent years, he said, he looked at many airline business plans and agonized over Mr. McAdoo's before deciding to back him. **********Mr. Hambrecht said he had not seen an industry in which a little success had changed people so drastically. But that is not a worry with Mr. McAdoo and his team, he added. ""I'm convinced they are not going to get carried away if they're successful,"" he said."

Goldman Sachs, the U.S. investment bank that launched a commodity futures index in 1991, for example, boasts an array of investment products that track it. **********The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, or GSCI, is composed of 20 major energy, agricultural, livestock and metals commodities that have active futures markets. Each commodity is weighted according to Goldman's assessment of its importance to the world economy. **********The J.P. Morgan Commodity Index, or JPMCI, is an example of the newer breed of more narrow indexes. Launched about five weeks ago, it does not include ""soft"" commodities such as livestock, coffee and other agricultural products. Instead, it focuses on the so-called industrial commodities - energy sources and metals. **********A broader index is the Knight-Ridder Commodity Research Bureau's Futures Price Index, or CRB.

So far this week, the Dow Jones industrial average has regained about 46 points of last week's 102-point fall. **********After rising as much as 28 points, the Dow closed at 3,878.18, up 15.14 in heavy trading. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 2.76 points, to 464.81, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 4.64 points, to 760.01. **********But yesterday's market may have little to do with any change in investor sentiment after the Fed's non-action. The rally was helped by strong demand yesterday at the $11 billion auction in five-year Treasury notes, which helped lower long-term interest rates, and by some optimism about United States-Japan trade talks, which helped lift the dollar against the Japanese yen and German mark. Both developments make stocks more valuable. **********Such support for stocks could prove temporary. Forthcoming economic data -- like unemployment, factory-use and consumer price data -- may persuade traders that the Fed will raise interest rates and prompt traders to sell stocks. **********Still, data released yesterday by the mutual-fund industry shows that equity portfolio managers have gotten even more money to invest and therefore are under pressure to buy stocks. **********During the first eight months of 1994, inflows of new cash into stock funds totaled $93.5 billion, or roughly the annual revenue of Exxon. That is up 12 percent from the 1993 period, according to the Investment Company Institute, the trade group for mutual funds. **********But redemptions, or investors cashing out of funds, were up, too, for stocks. That is especially worrisome since the redemptions occurred in a month when stock prices were up sharply and presumably meant that some investors thought prices had peaked. **********August redemptions rose 18 percent from the previous month to $11.1 billion. The Dow reached its second-highest peak of this year on Sept. 15. **********By contrast, bond fund redemptions leveled off in August, even before long-term interest rates headed decisively from 7.4 percent to 7.8 percent this month. Bond redemptions at $13.6 billion in August were little changed from $13.5 billion in July. Net cash outflow increased, however, probably because bondholders in the previous months had their principal cut sharply. **********Stock market analysts worry that as bond yields approach 8 percent, hundreds of thousands of individual investors will pull their money out of stocks and put it into bonds, sending stock prices falling. **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange at 330.3 million shares was about 15 percent above this year's average of 287 million shares. **********Roughly seven stocks rose for every four that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Cincinnati Milacron, a machine-tool maker, rose 2 1/2, to 26, for example, after a Merrill Lynch analyst raised her recommendation to intermediate ""buy"" from ""above average."" The Andrew Corporation, a supplier of telecommunications equipment, rose 3 3/4, to 48 1/4, after it got a large contract to supply television-broadcast antennas to the Fox network. **********The American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, often used by institutional investors as a proxy for the Mexican stock market, fell 1 1/8, to 63 1/4, after a top official of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was shot and killed. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.50 points, to 256.37, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,401 to 806. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.78 points, to 456.20."

No one can escape. Some huddle under the leaves of banana trees. An old man, back against the wind, sits stooped on a stump bravely holding a dilapidated umbrella as the storm whips at him. **********After surviving an exodus from Rwanda and the cholera epidemics that followed, killing more than 50,000 people, the refugees huddled in camps in eastern Zaire finally have enough food and water. But the coming of the rainy season is the latest misery to afflict the 800,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees here. **********Daily life in the sprawling camps is full of violence and extortion. There is also tension between Rwandans and Zairians, whose economy and lands have been overwhelmed by refugees. But despite looting, attacks, stonings and the sheer monotony of refugee life, only a trickle of refugees are returning to Rwanda. **********Relief workers said many refugees of the majority Hutu tribe refuse to return home because they are afraid they will be killed by Tutsi soldiers. The new Government in Kigali, formed by the Tutsi minority group, has denied any killings in retaliation for the deaths of Tutsi civilians and is urging refugees to return. **********""There are too many risks to go back to Rwanda,"" said Jean-Paul, 19, a student in a ragged red windbreaker in the Kibumba refugee camp who like others refused to give his full name. **********""Life is very bad here,"" he said. ""There are many bandits. But the Tutsis will kill us because they hate us. They want to be superior to the Hutus. We will go back home with our own army for our own protection."" **********Former government soldiers in the camps terrorize the refugees who want to return. Relief workers said that last month several who wanted to go home were stoned to death. Even the topic is taboo. **********Mugunga, about 10 miles east of Goma, is one of the roughest camps. About 300,000 Rwandans live sandwiched together under a sea of blue plastic tarpaulins. About 20,000 are former Rwandan soldiers and militia members ineligible for food aid, although they are fed by the refugees. **********The camps, more like makeshift cities with peddlers, roadside vendors and even restaurants, are still chaotic. Refugees are now taking stock of their futures, said Yvan Sturm, the field officer in charge of repatriation for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here. **********The epidemics are over, but the pneumonia, malaria and dysentery will increase with the heavy rains.  The death rate is about four per 10,000 refugees, still about four times the normal rate for African refugee populations, said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency. **********Seventy registered relief agencies remain in the Goma area. Every day 50 water tankers do as many as five trips along the nine miles from Goma to Kibumba -- the camp with the most dire water problems -- lugging more than a million gallons of purified water. Stocked in the camp warehouses are tens of thousands of tons of oil, beans and maize. **********Digging latrines is a priority, but the hard volcanic rock makes it difficult and the rain makes it worse. In Katale camp, there are 500 latrines for 300,000 people when 20,000 are needed, said Mark Richardson, spokesman for CARE International. **********The International Committee of the Red Cross is coordinating an interagency effort to locate the parents or families of more than 10,000 children who were either orphaned or separated from their parents in the flight from Rwanda. **********As anti-Americanism has flared in the camps, security has tightened for Western relief workers. They follow strict security guidelines, leaving the camps no later than 5 P.M. and rarely driving alone. **********A couple of weeks ago, a Canadian television crew was ambushed at gunpoint near Katale and robbed. On Saturday, violence broke out at the Kibumba camp and there were reports of clashes between Zairian soldiers and civilians as well. **********""Our security seems to be getting worse every day,"" said Mr. Richardson of CARE, who is in charge of Katale camp, 36 miles north of Goma. He fears warehouses holding supplies will be raided. **********Relief officials say the former Hutu Government hopes to keep the refugees in Zaire in an effort to persuade Kigali to compromise with it. In Goma and Bukavu, Zairian provincial governors unofficially support the former military, relief officials here say. In southeastern Zaire, United Nations officials say they believe troops loyal to Rwanda's ousted Hutu Government are preparing to go back to war. **********Juvenal Musubiranya, a clerk from the brewery in Gisenyi, Rwanda, and a leader in the Kibumba camp, said the refugees were angry because many Western countries had recognized the new Government in Kigali. **********""All foreigners are on the side of the enemy,"" Mr. Musubiranya said as the crowd cheered him on. ""We lost the war because of the Americans. It is mostly the Americans we hate. They bring aid to Rwanda when they know it is needed here so they can force us back. It is a trap."" **********""The Rwandans are docile people,"" Mr. Musubiranya said. ""We accept that the former Government has killed people, but the rebels also killed. The big powers have to do all they can so that there is a government according to the majority."""

Perhaps the best example, they say, is the Beneficial Corporation, a $13 billion financial services company in Wilmington, Del., that is the largest independent consumer loan company in the United States. **********""I like to think of Beneficial as an all-weather stock,"" said Richard Goleniewski, a vice president of Goldman, Sachs & Company. ""They are positioned well to consistently generate positive earnings through interest rate and economic cycles."" **********Largely because of the type of business it does -- most loans are made to individuals and families with incomes of $20,000 to $50,000 -- Beneficial has not attracted much attention in either the financial media or on Wall Street. **********""The problem with Beneficial is that it doesn't really have a lot of sex appeal,"" said Michael R. Hughes, a first vice president of Merrill Lynch & Company. ""But it is a good, long-term stock we have pretty much consistently recommended. Year in and year out, you expect it to go up 10 percent. And based on our 1995 earnings forecasts, it is a very cheap stock."" **********On Friday shares of Beneficial fell 25 cents, to $40.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********By most measures, the company has established a solid record: rising earnings in 29 of the last 30 quarters and six consecutive increases in the annual dividend. Perhaps most impressive, since 1946 the company's total receivables outstanding, the best measure of loan growth, have increased 9 to 10 percent at a compound annual rate. **********Finn M. W. Caspersen, chairman and chief executive of Beneficial, said a shift in borrowing patterns suggested that that sort of growth would continue well into the next century. **********Based on a recent study conducted in conjunction with the Credit Research Center at Purdue University's School of Management, Mr. Caspersen said that contrary to conventional wisdom, the average borrower was getting older and the debt taken on was being paid off more slowly than in the past. **********""It appears there has been a sea change,"" he said. ""At age 45 or thereabouts, people stop taking on installment debt and begin home equity borrowing, which continues until age 65."" That pattern could carry on for the next couple of decades, Mr. Caspersen said, creating more business for ""those who lend to Middle America."" **********High consumer debt levels are not a concern at Beneficial, he added, noting that the company's delinquency rates were at all-time lows. ""Our borrowers are in great shape,"" he said. **********If analysts have concerns about Beneficial's prospects, they seem to center on the company's extensive branch system. **********In an age when competitors like the Money Store Inc. and the Household Finance Corporation are increasingly turning to television as a marketing tool, Beneficial's network seems an antiquated and more costly way of doing business. **********""I still worry about the branch delivery system,"" said Gary Gordon, who follows Beneficial for the Paine Webber Group. ""Every sign says we are using electronics more and more. And I also worry they could be getting increasing competition from commercial and mortgage banks."" **********Instead of a drag, Mr. Caspersen says, the rapidly expanding branch network is a big asset to Beneficial's business. **********Because of plummeting computer costs, Beneficial can open a branch office for less than $50,000, he said, and have that office on a break-even pace within a year. Low start-up costs also give the company flexibility to expand quickly into fast-growing areas, he said. And greater efficiencies provided by computerization make Beneficial's loan officers more productive. **********""The loan offices are our insurance that growth will not go negative,"" he said. ""This is a nuts-and-bolts operation, but the thing is working like nobody's business."""

The Justice Department, for example, could consider surface and underground mining equipment not as separate markets but as a single market, he said. The Justice Department could also consider the global market for mining equipment in making its decision. **********Mr. Grade of Harnischfeger, however, said that ""there shouldn't be any regulatory problems"" getting regulatory approval.

The group would be the largest, in terms of revenues, of the company's three core businesses. The others are a paper-making machinery business, which had revenues of $600 million in the last fiscal year, and a material-handling-equipment business, which had revenues of $150 million. **********Joy was known as the Joy Manufacturing Company before going private in a leveraged buyout in 1987. The company went public again in November 1991 at $17 a share. **********In addition to making mining equipment, Joy is a supplier of air-pollution and ash-handling equipment for electric utilities and other industrial operations. **********The unit has been unprofitable in recent years and its future with Harnischfeger is uncertain.

Mustafa Tlas, said the agreements were ""a step in the right direction"" toward restoring relations to what they used to be. But in Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolokolev said Russia would only sell defensive weapons and spare parts for arms sold under previous contracts."

But when they heard that the Government planned to improve the old commuter rail line crossing the area's narrow streets with a multibillion-dollar elevated railway, they did something extraordinary: They demanded to know why. **********Traditionally, the Government bureaucracy has made such judgments in secret, and the people have simply had to endure them, with few means of taking part in the process or shaping the outcome. But faced with the destruction of their neighborhood's quiet charm, a group of Kyodo residents wanted to know why this plan had been chosen over less disruptive alternatives, like tunneling. **********Unused to such meddling, the bureaucrats refused to share their analyses, so the residents sued. Even more startling, they won. Earlier this year a court forced the Tokyo municipal government to hand over a four-inch-thick binder of documents evaluating various construction methods. **********The residents still must battle to revise the project, but their court victory was a watershed. It was the first time the bureaucrats here had been forced to disclose that kind of data, and thus it became one in a growing number of signs of the unraveling of the veil behind which one of the most secretive governments in the industrialized world has operated. **********The words are still quite foreign here, but a freedom of information revolution is bubbling in Japan. After struggling for years against the official barriers, the proponents of greater openness found their cause embraced, at least in public, by the reform-minded Government that ended four decades of conservative one-party rule last summer. This is one of the substantive, if little heralded, issues behind the calls for reform that could have a profound impact on the way Japan works. **********Few issues say more about Japanese democracy and what the people are up against in trying to revitalize it. **********""Compared with the United States and Europe, where individual rights have always been important, it has been different in Japan,"" Koshiro Ishida, the government minister responsible for creating greater public access, said in an interview. ""We felt we had to catch up with the West after the chaos left by the war and so did not pay attention to rights. But that attitude has to change now."" **********While change is in the air, few expect the new Government to move swiftly because of what is at stake. By keeping an enormous range of information secret -- from the side effects of drugs and the identity of products that have violated health laws to the contents of student transcripts and the environmental impact of big construction projects -- the bureaucracy and the corporations that work closely with the Government protect themselves from close public scrutiny and second-guessing. Driven at Grass Roots **********But even if the Government drags its feet on enacting tougher laws, the change is increasingly driven by grass-roots movements like the Kyodo residents' association, a major reason supporters of new legislation are encouraged. **********""This has the potential for creating a revolution in our bureaucracy,"" said Masao Horibe, a law professor at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo and a leading expert in one of the most recondite corners of legal scholarship in Japan, freedom of information. **********Hiroshi Miyake, a Japan Civil Liberties Union lawyer who has been fighting for tougher laws on disclosure, added: ""There is no single change that would do more to weaken the bureaucracy and protect consumers than a freedom of information law. I can't overstate how much of a difference this would make to Japan."" **********Secrecy is an ingrained aspect of nearly every important institution in Japan. Scholars, for instance, are generally refused access to records on the origins of the imperial family. Doctors rarely tell patients when they have cancer, or the nature of drugs being prescribed. **********Even the minutes of the hearings of a government advisory board that has been discussing how to pry open the lid of secrecy have not been disclosed.  Success Is Mixed **********The case of the Odakyu train line reconstruction is one of dozens that various groups have fought in recent years, so far with mixed success, but with growing vigor. Recently, in two separate Supreme Court decisions, citizens groups were in one instance denied and in another permitted access to details of the expense account records of prefectural governors. **********The focus of the current battle is passage of a national freedom of information law, patterned after the American statute. There are dozens of such laws at the local level in Japan; that is how the Kyodo residents won their suit. But the best guarantee of free access would be a national law, advocates say. **********The outgoing Government promised to promote such a bill, but it was forced out of office before it could enact the legislation. The new minority Government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is weak, and its life may be short, but it has renewed the pledge. At the least, the strong support for a more transparent government has created an atmosphere that is changing public expectations and, perhaps, judicial thinking. **********""In our case, the court was influenced, I'm sure, by the change in politics and the new flexibility of the Government,"" said Takeshi Saito, the lawyer for the Kyodo residents. ""Without the change in government and the new atmosphere, I don't think we would have gotten this far."" A Culture of Secrecy **********For civil servants, it is not so much a matter of following explicit rules as a culture of secrecy that is driven into them from the moment they join the bureaucracy. **********""As much as possible, you simply don't give out information to the public; that is the first principle,"" said Masao Miyamoto, a Health and Welfare Ministry bureaucrat who has become a gadfly by writing openly of the Government's secretive methods. **********""When I entered the government,"" said Dr. Miyamoto, an American-trained psychiatrist, ""one of the most important things I was told was: 'We control the information. When you give information to anybody, you are doing them a favor. They have no right to this information.' "" **********This was evident in a case recalled by Hatsuko Yoshioka, secretary general of the Japan Housewives' Association, a consumer group. After some complaints several years ago, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government discovered that some meat shops were spiking ground beef with a chemical that keeps the meat looking red and fresh, but can cause itching and flushed faces.  Shops Are Unidentified **********The shops were ordered to stop using the chemical and to close for a short period. When the Housewives' Association asked for the names of the shops, they were refused on the grounds that it would be unfair if consumers avoided the shops after they reopened; in fact, the shops were not ordered to disclose why they had been closed down. **********Mrs. Yoshioka said she was told by the Government that the local freedom of information law ordered only the release of documents and that there were no documents listing the names of the shops. **********As Dr. Miyamoto pointed out, ultimately the issue goes beyond such everyday frustrations to the way the Japanese see themselves and their role in society. **********""If people had access to information, they would have to control themselves rather than having the government control everything,"" he said.  ""The current government structure does not allow people to become independent. That's what this new movement is about, making people independent."" **********The movement gathered force in the early 1980's, when grass-roots groups began to push for laws on the local level. Dozens of local and prefectural governments now have such statutes. A Guerrilla Movement **********Shigeki Okutsu heads the Citizens' Movement for a Freedom of Information Law, which by Japanese standards is a kind of guerrilla group, operating out of a tiny apartment on a back street. His group has counseled groups across the country on how to use existing laws. **********He said the local laws had been successful to a surprising degree and had already begun to change some bureaucratic practices, if slowly. A large percentage of the requests, Mr. Okutsu said, come from parents seeking information about corporal punishment in schools, a practice that is generally prohibited. **********For instance, a teen-ager in Tokyo charged several years ago that her nose had been bloodied by a teacher.  Her parents sought the official report on the incident, but they have run into a wall of silence. First, the family was told that the school board could not open the documents because to do so would violate a rule prohibiting the release of a student's name. **********When the parents explained that the name would be that of their own daughter, the board asserted that opening its files would ""deeply damage the mutual trust between the education commission, the school and parents."" **********""The schools believe that even if they lie, no one will find out, and usually they are right,"" said Yukio Tsuruta, an adviser to the girl's family and the head of an association trying to halt corporal punishment. ""The parents are worried that if they protest to the schools, the teachers will retaliate against their children. So other parents never help in these cases. That is why making all this information open would change things in a very deep way."" Behind Veil, a Surprise **********When citizens do get a peek behind the veil, they are often startled. The Kyodo residents have learned, for instance, that the rail line improvement, first described as an effort to eliminate numerous traffic-snarling street crossings, is just part of the real plan. **********""We discovered that this is an urban planning project,"" said Hitoshi Takashina, a leader of the Kyodo residents group. ""There are new roads, road widenings, and a great deal of property development at the stations."" **********He added that once the group evaluates the pile of documents, it hopes to turn the case into a model for justifying a new national freedom of information law. **********""I want to stress the view that our country has its own unique attitude toward this issue and a unique administrative system,"" said Mr. Ishida, the Cabinet minister. ""But the society is changing. We have to take account of those changes and respond appropriately."""

When I was working as an analyst in Washington, our group experimented once with going directly to the S.E.C. offices for copies of corporate 10-K filings. We got a daylong runaround and did not manage to acquire the reports that we needed before the S.E.C. offices closed for the day. **********It seems that the S.E.C. wants to create a sinecure for a favored few, at the expense of the general public. These documents are supposed to be public filings, available to anyone who wishes to inspect them. Instead, they are restricted to a select few, while the rest of us have to pay them for the privilege of viewing the documents. PAUL L. SUH  Philadelphia, June 19"

But perhaps more relevantly, he said he feared that he would not be able to carry out his program if the Cabinet and Parliament remained in conservative hands. **********Mr. Delors's decision will force the Socialists to scramble to find a new candidate and will also make it much more likely that a conservative will succeed President Francois Mitterrand, himself a Socialist, after the two rounds of voting on April 23 and May 7. **********Opinion polls indicate that the front-running conservative is Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who has said he will not announce until January whether he will run for President. Former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who formally entered the race last month, is trailing him badly. **********With Mr. Delors's withdrawal, though, there is speculation that other conservatives may also now join the contest, among them former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former Prime Minister Raymond Barre. All could test their strength in the first round of the presidential election. **********Support for Mr. Delors was growing steadily among the public and inside the Socialist Party since the left's previous strongman, former Prime Minister Michel Rocard, was ousted after the party's disastrous performance in elections for the European Parliament in June. **********Suddenly, the Socialists, who were swept out of power in parliamentary elections in March 1993, saw the possibility of coming back, even though the governing conservative coalition controls 80 percent of the seats in the lower house of Parliament. **********But without Mr. Delors as their flag-bearer, the Socialists will be hard put to find another candidate who enjoys such prestige. As the French have tired of familiar faces, Mr. Delors's powerful post in Brussels kept him out of domestic politics in the last decade while earning him the image of a statesman. **********Tonight, Socialist leaders were stunned by his decision. ""I feel deep sadness,"" said Jack Lang, a former Culture Minister. ""I can hardly believe it. I had put all my hope in him. I respect his decision, but I don't fully understand his reasons."" **********Mr. Lang's name has been mentioned among possible Socialist nominees, along with former Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, former Education Minister Lionel Jospin and the current party leader, Henri Emmanuelli. Political analysts said that Bernard Tapie, a leftist businessman-turned-politician who broke with the Socialists this year, might also now decide to run for President. **********Even if a Socialist candidate were to win, though, he would face the problem that Mr. Mitterrand has known since March 1993 and that Mr. Delors said he was unwilling to accept -- a so-called ""cohabitation"" between a Socialist President and a conservative Prime Minister. **********Appearing on a weekly television interview program tonight, Mr. Delors said he felt he would be lying to the French electorate if he was elected on a program that he could not execute. ""I don't want to be President and have a Prime Minister carrying out policies opposed to mine,"" he said. **********In theory, the new President could dissolve Parliament and call new legislative elections, but Mr. Delors seemed unsure that he would have a working majority even if he did. Tonight, he acknowledged that he had disappointed his followers, but he added, ""Disappointment tomorrow would be worse than the regrets of today."""

With many investors away for the New Year's holiday and not participating in the market, there were not enough buyers available to balance these computer-driven sell orders for about 350 large stocks that poured in at the close. **********""The overall market closed well, but the blue chips were hit,"" said Robert B.

""There seemed to be a lack of trading interest on the floor to absorb the imbalance."" **********The Dow industrials lost more than 30 points in the last half-hour and ended the day down 21.79 points to 3,754.09. Some analysts said the late selling was also caused by profit-taking and last-minute portfolio adjustments. **********For the last week of the year, the Dow closed down 3.63 points. Still, the Dow industrials ended the year with a substantial gain of 13.7 percent from its close of 3,301.11 on Dec. 31, 1992. Moreover, the Dow set 33 new highs during the course of the year, including a high of 3,794.33 on Wednesday. Markets' Varying Closes **********Other market indicators were mixed yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 2.19 points to 466.45, but the broader-based Nasdaq composite index rose 5.72 points to 776.80. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 6.34 percent in this holiday-shortened session, significantly lower than its Dec. 31, 1992, yield of 7.39 percent. **********Advances exceeded declines on the New York Stock Exchange by a wide margin of 1,191 to 891. Volume on the Big Board was sluggish, with 171.4 million shares changing hands, compared with 193.7 million shares on Thursday. **********Among the day's losers, Disney tumbled 1 1/8 to 42 5/8 on reports of difficulties with its Euro Disney theme park outside Paris. Reports that the park could close unless it can be refinanced also caused the stock of Euro Disney to decline by 8 percent on the Paris Bourse.

It will likely be nearly the end of the decade before Japan, which is the biggest investor in Southeast Asia by far, hits its full stride in Vietnam. **********""As U.S.-Vietnamese relations improve, Vietnam will be drawn into the international economy, and this will improve the overall investment environment,"" said Morihito Kosuda, general manager of the Indochina office of the trading company Nissho Iwai Corp. ""The menu of investment options will expand, but the pace at which Japanese investment grows will depend on Vietnam,"" he said. **********Japanese executives see big opportunity in Vietnam. Many view the country as a dormant dragon, only a decade or so away from joining fast-growth countries like Thailand and Malaysia. Vietnam has a young population of roughly 70 million, and its workers are largely literate, hard-working and low-paid. Moreover, the country has enough food and oil to export, and it is in Southeast Asia, the most economically dynamic region in the world. **********But out of deference to the United States, its biggest trading partner and source of trade friction, Japan has maintained a low profile in Vietnam. Exercising patience and discretion, companies refrained from rushing in and shutting the door on American business prospects. Executives took their cues from the government, which coordinated closely with Washington and made sure its policies were just one step ahead. **********""The embargo has been a psychological obstacle,"" said Hiroshi Kadota, deputy director of the Asian Affairs department at Keidanren, Japan's biggest business federation. ""If it is lifted, more and more big companies will try to invest."" **********Tokyo's biggest concession to the embargo was to suspend its official development assistance to Hanoi after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978. Japan, the world's biggest aid donor, has used its money to set the stage for economic development and Japanese investment. It disburses most of its funds in Asia, with resource- rich Indonesia getting the biggest share. **********Japan resumed giving development aid to Vietnam in November 1992, just after the U.S. presidential elections. The next month Washington relaxed sanctions and allowed American companies to open offices and sign contracts in Vietnam. Further loosening the restrictions, President Bill Clinton last July gave the green light to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to extend credit to Hanoi; he also gave permission to U.S. companies to join in international projects there. **********Free to expose its hand, Japan in November pledged 60 billion yen ($557.4 million) in aid to Vietnam. The commitment included 52 billion yen in yen loans; 6 billion yen in grants; and 2 billion in technical assistance. Little of the aid has begun to flow into specific projects. But once it does, Japanese companies are expected to win a substantial percentage. **********But Japan will be playing catch- up. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia have already secured lucrative contracts and become Vietnam's biggest foreign investors, while Japan ranks number six. At the end of last September, Japan had invested a cumulative total of $335.6 million, compared with $1.44 billion by Taiwan, according to Vietnamese government statistics. **********In bilateral trade, Japan has long been Vietnam's biggest partner. The two nations' trade was worth an estimated $1.5 billion in 1993, with 80 percent of the total made up of crude oil exports to Japan. **********By the end of 1994, Japan's investment could move up several notches. Its cumulative total would nearly double with an expected $300 million investment in a Hanoi cement venture by Mitsubishi Material Corp. and Nihon Cement Co. A final decision is likely in April or May, Keidanren's Mr. Kadota said. **********In another major project, Nissho Iwai and two other Japanese companies are close to signing a contract to explore for oil off the southeast shore of Vietnam. Mobil Corp. will be the operator and biggest investor, with a 50 percent stake. The two other Japanese concerns are the semigovernmental Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. and Indonesia Petroleum Ltd. A Russian company, Zarubejineft, also has a share. **********But Hanoi is likely to be frustrated in its attempt to lure investments for higher-value added projects from the likes of Sony Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. or Nippon Steel Corp. until it improves its regulatory framework, Mr. Kadota said."

Under an executive order signed by President Clinton last spring, China must make ""overall, significant progress"" on specific issues if it does not want to be penalized. **********The outcome of Monday's meeting and later talks at the State Department will determine whether Mr. Christopher visits China when he goes to Asia in March. **********""I think that at the present time, they have not met the conditions of the executive order,"" Mr. Christopher said. But in keeping with Washington's strategy since September to accentuate the positive, Mr. Christopher added that the Chinese had not been expected to meet all the conditions by January. The Other Prisoners **********A senior Administration official later expanded on Mr. Christopher's remarks, and accused Beijing of misleading Washington. For example, the official said, China had failed to account for scholars outside Beijing when it asserted several months ago that it had released all students involved in the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. **********Although trade issues and weapons sales by China are important factors in bilateral relations, human rights is the sole issue involved in extending the trade privileges, which allow China to export goods to the United States under the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other countries. **********Because a suspension of the benefits would hurt American businesses and cost American jobs, the Administration is racing against the clock to persuade China to take concrete steps. Somewhat Softer Language **********In a conciliatory gesture today, Mr. Christopher did not repeat earlier warnings that China had to make urgent and steady progress in human rights, rather than a few isolated gestures at the last moment. And he will not raise the sharp criticism of China in the State Department's global report on human rights, which is to be sent to Congress at the end of the month. **********China recently announced the release of two Tibetan dissidents and last week agreed to allow more visits by customs inspectors to Chinese jails to make sure that prisoners are not producing goods for export to the United States. China has also begun discussions with the Red Cross about granting access to prisons. **********Finally, President Jiang Zemin himself said on Jan. 15 that China ""is going to make an effort"" to meet Mr. Clinton's concerns on human rights. Loosening the Reins **********Mr. Christopher's meeting with Foreign Minister Qian will be the latest high-level attempt to engage rather than isolate the Chinese, part of an Administration strategy to convince China's aging political leaders that Washington has no intention of punishing China where it does not have to. **********In a little-noticed move in recent weeks, the White House reversed itself and approved the launching of three commercial satellites for China. The launchings had been banned under sanctions imposed last August after United States intelligence agencies reported that China had shipped technology and components for M-11 missiles to Pakistan in violation of an international accord. **********At the time it imposed the sanctions, which halted the planned launching of seven satellites and affected about $1 billion in high-technology trade with China, the Administration said the punitive measure was required under United States law. **********In November, on the eve of Mr. Clinton's meeting with President Jiang, Mr. Clinton's national security advisers agreed to keep the sanctions in place unless China signed a formal agreement adhering to the principles of the international arms accord. **********But in recent weeks, White House lawyers argued successfully for a lenient interpretation of the law to allow the launching of three satellites. Sidestepping Iran **********In another sign that the United States will not try to pick a fight with China, Mr. Christopher may not raise Washington's concerns about China's recent agreement to provide a nuclear reactor to Iran, the senior Administration official said. **********Although Mr. Christopher has branded Iran ""an international outlaw"" and has encouraged United States allies to ban the sale of military technology and equipment to Iran, the issue of the reactor will be taken up at a lower-level meeting on Jan. 26 in Washington. **********It is not clear whether Mr. Christopher will raise other examples of China's recent worrisome behavior. **********China experts inside the Administration have concluded, for example, that an underground nuclear test last October was a military decision to improve China's strategic nuclear forces. **********Administration officials are also convinced that China intended to ship ingredients for chemical weapons to Iran last year, although an inspection of a merchant ship found no evidence."

He noted that the Chinese had signed a pledge not to export missiles or technology controlled under an international nonproliferation accord. **********He also said China had taken some positive steps on human rights, but did not mention the widespread belief within the Administration that the situation has deteriorated in recent months. **********""This broad engagement is producing progress on various fronts,"" Mr. Christopher said. **********Perhaps to reassure Mr. Qian of American constancy, Mr. Christopher brushed aside a question that the Administration might find it more difficult to execute its policy of engagement with a Republican-dominated Congress. **********When asked about the election, Mr. Qian, whose Government has accused the American Congress of meddling in China's affairs in the past, politely deferred to Mr. Christopher. ""I believe the election of the U.S. Congress is the entitlement of the United States,"" he said. ""Therefore, I consider that question directed to Mr. Christopher."" **********But in their private meeting, Mr. Qian stepped out of character. He told Mr. Christopher that he appreciated his words about continuity in foreign policy during his formal speech to the forum. ""We're interested and concerned to know how the election affects us,"" a senior State Department official quoted Mr. Qian as saying. **********In a way the remark was not surprising. The two foreign policy committees in Congress will be headed by men who are sworn enemies of Beijing: Senator Jesse Helms, who favors independence for Taiwan and demonizes the Chinese military, and Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, who considers himself a close friend of the Dalai Lama of Tibet. **********The cozy atmosphere between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Qian did not mean that there were no issues dividing them. Mr. Christopher raised the matter of China's refusal to accept revisions and updates of an international accord controlling missile exports or to disclose what missile technology it shipped abroad before it agreed to abide by the accord.  He also told Mr. Qian that the United States would like China to make more progress in improving its human rights record. **********Human rights in Indonesia was one of the themes discussed today by Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative. He announced an agreement with Indonesia on the rights of workers, a source of tension between Washington and Jakarta. Among the accord's provisions are vague pledges by Indonesia to amend its labor laws and regulations and to make the Government-run All Independent Worker Union more independent. **********Early last year, Mr. Kantor suspended a formal review of whether Indonesia deserved certain trade benefits despite its poor record on workers' rights. **********In analyzing Indonesia's human rights record at the time, Mr. Kantor noted the overwhelming role of the military and the absence of free association in the workplace. **********But neither of these issues was addressed in today's accord. Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of the human rights organizationAsia Watch, said: ""For any labor accord to be meaningful, it would have to allow truly independent labor organizations to emerge and curb the pervasive role of the military."" **********Mr. Kantor acknowledged that the agreement had its limitations, telling reporters even as he touted it that it was only ""a step in the proper direction."""

The idea of a talking computer has since insinuated itself into the popular imagination, but so far the imagination is the only place where computers have real conversational skill. **********The problem, experts in artificial intelligence say, is that efforts have focused on the building blocks and rules of language rather than on its expression. Thus, computer-generated voices sound flat and can manage only the most primitive sort of inflection, such as a rise in pitch at the end of a sentence when posing a question. **********Manfred Clynes, who holds a doc- torate in neuroscience from the University of Melbourne, has long proposed that human emotions, as expressed through words, gestures, painting, music or any other medium, have distinct, dynamic ""shapes"" that are common to all cultures. Dr. Clynes, 68, has translated emotions into shapes by hooking up people to a machine called a sentograph and plotting the horizontal and vertical components of the type of pressure the subjects applied with their forefingers to express specific emotions. **********Dr. Clynes has applied such shapes, which he calls sentograms, to computer-generated speech, and he has been notified that today he will be granted a patent for a system that can supply emotional contours to a computer's voice.  Musicianship by Algorithm **********A pianist as well as a neuroscientist, Dr. Clynes first applied his shapes theory to music, and has developed algorithms that let a computer model the musicality of a human artist. Certain computers can play a score that has been entered into their memory; they can perform, for example, a Chopin piano sonata with note-perfect precision. **********""But it would sound awful -- dead, irritating,"" Dr. Clynes said, because there would be no subtlety, no change in touch, tone or rhythm, none of the nuances that a sensitive pianist would bring to the performance. **********Dr. Clynes, whose algorithms are being developed commercially in cooperation with Hewlett-Packard, said his technology would allow a musician to instruct a computer to play a given score with certain phrasings as well as changes in volume, tempo, timbre and rhythm. **********He has now applied some of these principles to computer-generated speech. He proposes that digitally stored sentograms can be used to sculpt specific phrases by giving the computer's voice a more natural-sounding inflection -- made up of volume, pitch, timing and tremor -- that is the shape of a given emotion. **********He said that computer-generated speech could be changed in much the way a written text could be changed by putting a phrase in italics or changing the size or style of type. **********Dr. Clynes said he hoped his invention would have a wide variety of applications, from virtual reality to the teaching of rhetoric and the understanding of the nature of emotion. One application, he said, might be electronic mail that, when converted to voice from text by a computer, would convey emotion as if the author was reading it. **********Dr. Clynes, the head of Microsound International Ltd. of Sonoma, Calif., said he was currently perfecting his computer voice technology, which is scheduled to receive patent 5,305,423. A Way to Certify Telephone Calls **********JoAnn Zucker, a social worker from Tomkins Cove, in Rockland County, N.Y., last week received a patent for an idea that came to her, she said, when she and her husband were required by local zoning officials to notify all their neighbors by certified mail that they were planning a major addition to their home. **********""I've always hated those green forms at the Post Office because it takes forever to fill them out,"" she said. ""I said to my husband, 'Wouldn't it be great if you could just send a certified phone call?' "" **********Ms. Zucker's offhand suggestion has bloomed into a big project. She and her husband, Alan, a retired publisher, said they were now in licensing talks with regional phone companies. **********""The U.S. Post Office sends about 200 million pieces of certified mail a year that contain nothing more than a message,"" Mr. Zucker said. ""That's the proven minimum market for certified phone calls."" **********To make a certified phone call, the Zuckers said, one would dial an ""800"" number and be taken through an automated menu that would provide such options as whether to deliver the message to whomever answers or to a specific person. **********Upon answering, the recipient would be informed that the call was a certified message and that the ensuing conversation would be recorded, the Zuckers said. If no one answered, the caller could choose to record a message and have the phone company call periodically to try to deliver it. **********Ms. Zucker received patent 5,303,296.  Rotating Restraint For Monkey Tests **********Clarence M. Oloff was a medical technologist in the early 1980's, working on a study for the Air Force of the effects of weightlessness on the bones of rhesus monkeys. The monkeys were placed in full-body casts because the casts took pressure off their bones much as the absence of gravity reduces pressure on the bones of astronauts in outer space. **********""Nothing much but their toes and hands were sticking out -- it was not a very nice picture,"" said Mr. Oloff, who is now retired and lives in Lawrenceville, Ga. ""When the experiment was over six weeks later they had atrophied, they had decubitis ulcers; they were in bad shape."" **********Mr. Oloff developed a ""timed primate roto-positioning method for preventing trauma and for simulating weightlessness."" The Air Force was recently issued a patent for the invention that Mr. Oloff developed. **********By rotating the animal slowly in two different axes -- first, head over heels, then top over bottom -- the device minimizes the effects of gravitational pull. It thus lets researchers track the effect of virtual weightlessness on bones, Mr. Oloff said. **********The patent, applied for in 1985, was initially rejected by the Patent Office. The Air Force appealed, said Frederic L. Sinder, an Air Force patent attorney at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, because the method might have medical applications for humans. **********Patent 5,275,132 was assigned to the United States Air Force, which says it has not conducted simulated weightlessness studies on nonhuman primates since 1988."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/15/business/company-news-sprint-forms-european-alliance.html,Tom Redburn,1994-06-15,,800,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Sprint Forms European Alliance,COMPANY NEWS; Sprint Forms European Alliance," **********The Sprint Corporation announced yesterday that the state-owned telephone companies of France and Germany would spend $4.2 billion for a 20 percent stake in Sprint and form a global alliance to compete in the fast-growing international communications business. **********The deal would make Sprint the technical pacesetter in a partnership with Europe's two largest telecommunications companies, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. While each company would continue to control its operations within its own national borders, the three would combine forces for a global network and an international operating company that would each be 50 percent owned by Sprint. **********But for a separate operating group serving Europe outside France and Germany, Sprint would own only a third of the business, with the French and German companies sharing the remainder of the operation. **********The arrangement, if approved by government regulators in Washington and Europe, would pit Sprint, which is the third-largest American long-distance carrier, and its European partners against Sprint's bigger rivals, AT&T and MCI Communications. Stock Purchases Planned **********Together, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which forged their own link in December to build a European network, would buy newly issued shares in Sprint in two steps. Initially, they would pay $47.225 a share for 42.9 million shares of Sprint. Within two years of that purchase, the two European companies would pay $51 a share for another 42.9 million shares of Sprint. **********Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., said it would use the cash from the deal to pay debt and provide it with greater financial influence as it attempts to put together a more unified mobile phone network in the United States. **********A year ago, MCI set off a global scramble with its announcement of a plan to market telecommunications services worldwide with British Telecommunications, which agreed to invest $4.3 billion in MCI. That deal, which differs from the Sprint plan in several ways, has not been approved by regulators. AT&T is seeking an alliance with a consortium of smaller European carriers, but so far without success. **********In a demonstration of the kind of services they want to offer, Sprint and its European allies convened a global news conference that linked the chief executives of the companies by video to explain the partnership. William T. Esrey spoke in New York, while the chairman of France Telecom, Marcel Roulet, was in Paris, and Helmut Ricke, chairman of the management board of Deutsche Telekom, was at the headquarters of his company in Bonn. Talks With Asia **********Mr. Esrey said the partnership would be the ""first truly global enterprise"" to provide a broad array of international voice, data and image communication networks for business, consumers and local telephone companies. He said the allies were also talking to telecommunications companies in Asia to bring in another carrier from that region of the world. **********The proposed deal drew immediate criticism from AT&T, which wants to gain greater access for its equipment and services in the large European markets. **********""There's something very wrong,"" AT&T said in a statement, ""when telephone companies like the France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom monopolies can buy into the U.S. telecommunications market while keeping their home markets closed tighter than a drum."" **********Both Mr. Roulet and Mr. Ricke said the markets in France and Germany were not as closed as AT&T had contended. They also noted plans by the 12-nation European Union, which is based in Brussels, to deregulate telecommunications markets fully by 1998 as a signal that Western Europe intended to allow greater competition. Sprint Shares Fall **********While the Sprint deal was expected, the full financial details became known only yesterday. The terms call for Sprint, which said it would dilute the value of its stock only slightly, to receive an average premium of 23 percent on its shares, compared with the price of $39.875 at which the stock closed on Monday. **********Still, the announcement sent shares of Sprint down $2.75, or 6.9 percent, to $37.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Almost 2.2 million shares were traded. **********Some analysts said Sprint's delay in receiving full payment made the deal less valuable, while others said they were worried that uncertainty about whether regulators would delay or even block the alliance had raised doubts among investors. **********But Michael Ellig, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, said the market was underestimating the advantages to Sprint of access to French and German corporate businesses in the United States and the strength of the global alliance. **********Those benefits, he said, could quickly give Sprint and its partners as much as two-fifths of what is now a $10 billion market for multinational business communications. That market is growing at an estimated 20 percent a year."

The new studio will enable WPIX to expand local programming, Mr. Eigner said. **********The Tribune Company also renewed its lease for the 90,000 square feet of space it already occupied in the 37-story building. The new lease, for 125,000 square feet, is valued at about $75 million during its 15-year term, said Barbara Winter, senior vice president of LaSalle Partners. The office tower has 1.1 million square feet of space. **********The new WPIX space includes 5,000 square feet at street level for a reception area. The new studio and newsroom will be on the second floor.

Studley Inc., which represented the tenant in the transaction. The bank occupies 5,000 square feet on the 20th floor of the 22-story office building, which is owned by a group of private investors. **********Mees Pierson is scheduled to move in June to a total of 38,000 square feet, the entire fourth and fifth floors. The 5,000 square feet on the 20th floor that the bank is vacating has been subleased for the remaining five years of the lease to Sadow & Sadow, a law firm now at 3 East 54th Street. **********The bank needs more space partly because it is consolidating its three New York offices at 445 Park Avenue, Mr. Revson said. Mees Pierson also occupies 6,000 square feet at 527 Madison Avenue and 3,000 square feet at 3 East 54th Street, he said. The move will involve about 100 employees. **********Another foreign bank, Multibanco Comermex S.A. of Mexico, is moving its New York operations from lower Manhattan to Americas Tower, the 50-story office building at 1177 Avenue of the Americas, between 45th and 46th Streets. **********Multibanco Comermex, the fourth-largest bank in Mexico, is taking 14,300 square feet, the 42d floor, for 15 years, said Mark A. Jaccom, a senior managing director at Julien J. Studley, which represented the tenant. **********The bank, which expects to move by June, now occupies 11,500 square feet in One Exchange Plaza at 55 Broadway, where the lease is expiring. Jeanne Ekman, administration manager for the bank in New York, said it was moving primarily because it wanted to be in midtown, the center of international banking in New York. The bank's New York offices conduct foreign exchange trading and other international banking activities, she said. **********Americas Tower, completed in July 1992, is owned by the Kumagai Gumi Company, based in Tokyo.2 Retailers Add Stores **********In the retail sector, Prada, which makes and sells luxury leather goods and accessories, is taking 13,000 square feet, including 3,000 square feet of street-level space, at 28 East 70th Street, at Madison Avenue, for a second Manhattan store. **********Prada, based in Milan, Italy, signed a long-term lease for the site, which will be its flagship store in the United States, said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director for Edward S. Gordon Company, which helped arrange the transaction. The store will occupy space on four contiguous levels. The company's other outlet in New York, Prada Milan, is at 34 East 57th Street. **********Among the latest furniture vendors to set up shop in SoHo is Metropolitan Design Center, which is opening its second Manhattan outlet. The company is taking 2,400 square feet of street-level space for 10 years at 450 Broome Street and Mercer Street, said Carole Greene, a vice president for New Spectrum Realty Services, which represented the tenant. **********The company, which makes furniture at its Long Island City, Queens, factory, will sell furniture and home furnishings at the new shop, which is scheduled to open in June.

Union Pacific is already the largest railroad in the western states, and it competes head-to-head with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe -- the Santa Fe, for short -- on several important routes, especially from the Midwest to California. **********""The idea of a larger Union Pacific scares me,"" said Robert A. Sieffert, transportation manager of the American-Maize Products Company, a Chicago-based producer of corn syrup and starch. ""They would have a hammerlock west of the Mississippi that could improve their service but would hurt competition."" **********Such fears led Santa Fe's board to reject Union Pacific's first offer and urge shareholders to back Burlington Northern's bid. Union Pacific returned last week with a $3.7 billion offer, $500 million above the Burlington Northern bid. The Santa Fe board has not formally responded, but the directors have made clear that they do not believe the Interstate Commerce Commission would allow a deal with Union Pacific. **********Union Pacific has addressed such concerns by saying it would propose several conditions to the merger to encourage continued competition. Though it has disclosed no details, shippers assume the railroad is thinking of allowing competitors equal access to customers over some lines. **********""The problem with that is that shippers have little influence over whether the other railroads negotiate the deals,"" said the transportation manager for one of the Midwest's largest agribusiness concerns, who insisted on not being identified. ""The other railroad has to really want your business."" **********A Santa Fe merger with the Burlington Northern would involve far less overlap and would allow many customers to send products hundreds of miles farther without going through the delays, paperwork and higher tariffs that routinely come with switching from one carrier to another. But shippers worry that even that merger could lead to the closing of some lines or loss of competition in several regions. **********""We see this as the beginning of a wave toward additional consolidation, and it has galvanized our concerns,"" said Robert Voltmann, director of policy development for the National Industrial Transportation League, a Washington-based trade association of 1,200 shippers that intends to press the Interstate Commerce Commission for restrictions on any Santa Fe merger. **********One of the group's goals is to use the Santa Fe battle as a platform to lobby for changes in the rules governing challenges to rail rates. Shippers seeking relief have to prove ""market failure,"" the equivalent of winning a mini-antitrust case against their carrier in court. The hearings often go on for years and cost up to $500,000, Mr. Voltmann said. **********Santa Fe and Burlington Northern were able to provide the Interstate Commerce Commission 450 letters supporting their merger application last month. The backers included Boeing, Ford Motor, Conagra, Coors Brewing and Montgomery Ward, as well as local grain elevator operators and other smaller customers. **********The statements were solicited before Union Pacific crashed the party, and several supporters of the Burlington Northern deal say they are equally willing to back a merger with Union Pacific. Because Union Pacific has not yet submitted a merger plan to the I.C.C., it has not collected statements of support addressed to the commmission from its customers. **********Railroad experts say such statements should be taken with a grain of salt. Many shippers are quick to cooperate with requests for public statements of support, the experts say, because they fear that if they refuse they will suffer from poor service from the railroad. **********""Railroads aren't like trucks,"" Mr. Voltmann said. ""You can't just move another one in."" **********Companies that filed statements supporting the Burlington Northern deal say they have plenty of reasons to back the merger. **********Coors Brewing calculates that the shorter travel times the merged lines could offer its breweries in Memphis and Golden, Colo., would improve the efficiency with which it uses the 2,200 specialized boxcars it rents from railroads and would cut the amount of inventory in transit. It expects to save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. **********""I wouldn't believe anyone who tells you they really understand railroad pricing, but you clearly do better with single lines,"" said Terrance L. Priest, Coors's logistics manager. **********The American Cast Iron Pipe Company is hoping the combined line will allow its operations on the Burlington Northern line in Alabama to reach points served by the Santa Fe in California for 30 percent less than current prices, based on what Burlington Northern charges to travel similar distances on its track. Walter M. Boyce, the company's director of traffic and transportation, said through lines also kept shipments from being banged around in switching yards. **********""We sometimes get entire carloads brought back as salvage,"" Mr. Boyce said. Railroads pay for the damage, but that does little to mollify American Cast Iron's customers if their construction schedules are disrupted. **********The merger appeals to Ford because it should produce much better connections between the Midwest and its Mexican operations, but the auto maker also likes the idea of having its cars spend less time in yards where they are switched between railroads. **********""That's where thieves are most likely to strip things like radios, CD players and cellular phones,"" said Chuck Wilkins, Ford's director of transportation procurement, who said such vandalism was a multimillion-dollar problem. ""The railroads pay us for it, but it ends up back in their prices."" **********Many shippers support the merger with Burlington Northern because they believe the combined resources of the two companies can be managed to serve them better. Thomas Tunnell, executive vice president of the Kansas Grain and Feed Association, a Topeka-based trade group for 900 grain elevators, said the Burlington Northern's huge fleet of boxcars could add to the Santa Fe's frequently strained supply in his state during the wheat harvest. **********As the Interstate Commerce Commission begins the long process of reviewing the merger proposal, parties seeking ""protective conditions"" or simply opposing the deal have until Dec. 27 to notify the commission. **********In addition to considering customers' interests, the commission is required to weigh the effect of a merger on the financial strength of the surviving railroad and its competitors, including other forms of transportation. The commission also reviews the impact of any railroad merger on employees and the environment. The timetable calls for a decision by April. **********Should the Union Pacific ever get to the point of submitting its merger proposal to the commission, its supporters will include Charles A. Swayze, general manager of the Farmers Co-op Equity Company in Isabel, Kan., and chairman of a group of shippers that use Santa Fe lines in Kansas to get grain to market. Mr. Swayze said in a letter to Union Pacific last week that his group felt that a Union Pacific merger with the Santa Fe would result in a better supply of freight cars to farm communities and better service for smaller customers than would a deal with Burlington Northern. **********But many who would back either deal say they prefer Burlington Northern. ""It's a win-win situation for us and our customers,"" said Herbert Strong, executive vice president of the Crab Orchard and Egyptian Railroad, a short-line operation based in Marion, Ill., with connections to Burlington Northern and Union Pacific. ""But the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe would be the bigger win."""

In August, he was forced out as chairman of Walt Disney Studios after a bitter dispute with Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company. **********What roles Mr. Geffen and Mr. Spielberg would play remains unclear. But the film executives said Mr. Geffen would not only be involved in creative entertainment decisions but would also spend much of his time working with Wall Street to attract investors to the new studio's films. **********Mr. Spielberg, the most successful director in movie history, has long sought a way to own films, a move that would assure him potentially lavish profits on hits over the foreseeable future. **********There has been some speculation that Mr. Spielberg would move his entire company, Amblin Entertainment, from Universal Studios to the new studio. **********Details of the financing arrangements for the new studio were not available last night. Calls to the three men were not returned. **********The new studio is expected to start producing movies by early next year and will probably have a slate of 12 to 16 films during the year, the film executives said. Big Hollywood studios normally produce 12 to 20 films a year. **********Both Mr. Katzenberg and Mr. Spielberg have also decided to move rather quickly in setting up an animation division at the new studio, although such a move would probably take several years. **********Mr. Katzenberg's new studio will be the first major Hollywood studio to be started since 1939, when 20th Century-Fox was created. **********Since his angry departure from Walt Disney Studios, Mr. Katzenberg has made it clear that he ""wanted to run his own shop"" and was having no difficulty finding prospective suitors and investors. **********Mr. Katzenberg is a longtime friend of Mr. Spielberg, who won Academy Awards this year for his film ""Schindler's List,"" and of Mr. Geffen, the founder of Geffen Records, which he sold to MCA Inc. in a deal worth about $700 million. **********Earlier this year, Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Katzenberg started a new family-style restaurant, ""Dive,"" in Century City in Los Angeles and will probably open similar restaurants in New York, Las Vegas and Washington. **********At studio chief at Disney, Mr. Katzenberg produced such film hits such as ""The Lion King"" and ""The Little Mermaid."""

Wachner is coming between you and your Calvins. **********The Warnaco Group Inc., which Ms. Wachner runs as chairman and chief executive, announced yesterday that it had bought Calvin Klein Inc.'s highly profitable men's underwear business for $64 million plus fees that were characterized as ""ongoing."" **********Under the terms of the sale, Warnaco, based in New York City, is also buying the worldwide licensing rights for the men's accessories line of Calvin Klein, which is also based in New York, and will pick up the women's intimate apparel line next year. **********Trade publications and industry people have estimated that Mr. Klein's underwear business had revenue of $85 million last year, with men's underwear accounting for nearly 90 percent of that. **********Through the use of a controversial, suggestive and expensive advertising campaign featuring the rap artist Marky Mark and the model Kate Moss, Mr. Klein has heightened interest in his underwear line. There's Money in Underwear **********In an interview yesterday, Ms. Wachner said she intended to build on that. ""Calvin is really doing a sensational job,"" she said. ""I think it is the best underwear brand out there. And I think we can more than double the business in two years."" **********With the acquisitions, which is expected to be completed in 30 days, Warnaco continues its transformation from what Ms. Wachner said was once an apparel conglomerate into a company that this year is expected to derive roughly 75 percent of its sales from underwear. **********Warnaco manufactures underwear and intimate apparel under a variety of brand names, including Olga's, Valentino Intimo and Fruit of the Loom bras. **********""The underwear business is an annuity,"" Ms. Wachner said. ""People are always going to wear it. And we have a track record of growing the business at more than 15 percent a year."" **********Investors were unmoved by the deal. Warnaco's shares closed yesterday at $29 on the New York Stock Exchange, unchanged from Monday. **********Under the terms of the transaction, Mr. Klein will continue to both design and create advertising for the men's underwear, women's intimate apparel and men's accessories businesses. **********The sale, which has been rumored for some time, also gives Mr. Klein the opportunity to pay off an outstanding $58 million loan he received from Citibank in June.  Paying Back Debts **********Mr. Klein took out the loan to buy back $55 million worth of his company's high-yield debt securities that had been purchased by David Geffen, the billionaire entertainment executive, in 1992. **********Mr. Geffen, a close friend of Mr. Klein's, bought the bonds to help Mr. Klein weather a period when the clothing company was experiencing declining sales. **********Mr. Klein said in an interview that retiring the debt was only a ""happy byproduct"" of the Warnaco deal. **********""I feel very good about having the ability to pay down 100 percent of the debt,"" he said. ""But the excitement here is the partnership. I have a great partnership with Unilever, which licenses the Calvin Klein cosmetic line. Now I have Warnaco to help me on the underwear side."" **********Mr. Klein said that ""when I can find the right partnership to expand the business and take advantage of growth opportunities,"" he would consider more such relationships in the future. **********Ms. Wachner refused to say how much money Mr. Klein would receive as perpetual royalties. But she did say the fees would be based on a percentage of total sales, adding, 'He will have an income stream."" **********Laurence C. Leeds Jr., a managing director at Buckingham Research, an institutional research firm, said the traditional norm for most royalty fees is 5 percent of total sales."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/25/business/pharmacies-in-a-quandary-over-tobacco.html,Milt Freudenheim,1994-04-25,,1108,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Pharmacies in a Quandary Over Tobacco,Pharmacies in a Quandary Over Tobacco," **********Hundreds of independent pharmacies across the country have become so troubled by the conflict between selling medicine and selling tobacco that they have taken tobacco products off their shelves. **********In a statewide campaign by pharmacists late last year, 60 drugstores in Michigan agreed to discontinue tobacco sales. A similar campaign is planned for Rhode Island. And dozens of pharmacies in Minnesota, Utah and Washington state have pulled the plug on tobacco under pressure from county medical and pharmaceutical societies. Even in the tobacco-growing state of South Carolina, some pharmacies have taken the smoke-free stance. **********Taking the matter one step further, in Canada, the Ontario legislature is working on a bill that would ban tobacco sales in pharmacies. **********The movement appears to be one of conscience, waged by pharmacists who see an ethical quandary. Adrian Thomas, proprietor of the Thomas Drug Store in Meyersville, Pa., described how an old friend used to come in every Thursday and buy miniature cigars -- 200 at a time. Then the friend died of lung cancer, as did several other customers, Mr. Thomas said. **********""When you're treating these people pharmaceutically, and seeing them totally wreck their health,"" he said, ""you just have to stand up and say, 'I can't take it anymore.' "" **********To be sure, the movement is small and more of a symbol than a damper on tobacco sales. Although national statistics have not been collected, industry experts estimated that only a fraction of the 40,000 independent pharmacies in the United States do not sell tobacco products. As Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, said, smokers turned away at drugstores ""simply walk around the corner to the nearest convenience store, grocery store or gas station."" **********""But there's an important message in getting tobacco sales out of pharmacies,"" Dr. Ronald M. Davis, chief medical officer of the Michigan Department of Health, said. ""That is the separation between a deadly product and a store that is selling goods intended to cure disease and relieve suffering."" **********The need for such a separation is voiced by a growing number of pharmacists, who are making the decision for their customers that cigarette smoking is indeed hazardous to their health. 'Why Sell Sickness?' **********""We deal in wellness; why sell sickness?"" asked Kenneth J. Moffa, a partner in Ferrera's, an independent pharmacy in Southampton, L.I., which has stopped selling tobacco. **********Pharmacies are not the big purveyors of cigarettes they once were for reasons other than the anti-smoking movement. The corner drugstore, a principal supplier of cigarettes to generations of Americans, has been supplanted in tobacco sales by the 24-hour convenience store. Of the $25.8 billion of store sales of cigarettes last year, only 7 percent came from pharmacies, while convenience stores sold 40 percent, according to Nielsen Marketing Research in Northbrook, Ill. **********Cigarettes accounted for only 2.3 percent of the $82.38 billion in drugstore sales last year, Nielsen said, although they were more important to the large chain stores. Even at the big stores, sales of tobacco and related products like pipes and lighters declined by 10 percent last year, according to Chain Drug Review, a trade publication. **********Most of the drugstore chains say they continue to sell tobacco as a convenience for customers. The Walgreen Company, the largest chain, said tobacco sales were flat at 4 percent of revenues for the last two years, down from 5 percent in the year that ended on Aug. 31, 1991. 'Ethical Dilemma' **********Even in these stores, some pharmacists refuse to ring up cigarettes. They refer tobacco buyers to the general merchandise registers at the front of the store. Selling tobacco is ""an ethical dilemma for a lot of pharmacists,"" Jann Hinkle, a spokeswoman for the American Pharmaceutical Association, said. In a former job as pharmacy manager in an Elk View, W. Va., chain store, she said, ""my partner and I would refuse to ring it up."" She added, ""It was our way of protesting the chain selling cigarettes, which we didn't agree with."" **********The bottom line for many smaller drugstores is that the argument for selling tobacco products has weakened over the years. ""More and more pharmacies have decided on their own that it is no longer in their best interest to be selling tobacco products,"" Todd Dankmyer, a spokesman for the National Association of Retail Druggists, said. The association says its members include 40,000 independent pharmacies, about 60 percent of the nation's 65,000 pharmacies. **********Most pharmacists who have dropped cigarettes say the lost revenue has been outweighed by good will in their communities and higher sales of other products. They also say that many smokers were not big spenders anyway. 'Little or No Effect' **********""We decided to go smoke-free early last year,"" said Greg Bovee, owner of the West Side Pharmacy in a strip mall in West Lansing, Mich. ""It had little or no effect on our sales. It was very well accepted in the community."" Some anti-smokers ""who used to say, 'we don't want to buy prescriptions from you' came back as customers"" he added. **********Emanuel Goldman, a tobacco industry analyst at Paine Webber Securities, said many pharmacies found that they could put the space occupied by cigarette display racks to more profitable use. **********The anti-smoking forces have been helped by the makers of nicotine patches, a prescription product to help smokers quit. Some patch makers provide speakers who report on the latest scientific findings at pharmacists' meetings. At least one drug company, Lederle Laboratories, a unit of the American Cyanamid Company, has given money to pharmacists' anti-smoking campaigns. **********""It is hard to be there selling cigarettes and also selling patches"" Joseph Bova, owner of Cary's Pharmacy in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., said. **********The anti-smoking pressure on pharmacies grew last month after Dr. David Kessler, the Food and Drug Commissioner, testified that tobacco company records indicated that some cigarette makers had manipulated nicotine content, adding to addiction problems for millions of smokers. **********Dr. Kessler asked Congress to consider whether the nicotine in cigarettes should be classified as a drug, which would be subject to the Food and Drug Administration's health and safety standards. **********""If cigarettes are deemed drugs, we would have to review how that would fit into state and Federal drug laws,"" said Lawrence Mokhiber, executive director of the New York State Board of Pharmacy, a regulatory agency. **********And if tobacco products were held to be drugs -- by no means a sure thing -- drugstores could find themselves right back in their old role of leading marketer for cigarettes."

Burns, an analyst at CS First Boston in Chicago. ""I don't think it's that easy."" **********He suggested that the futures losses were being used as an excuse to force Mr. Ergas to step aside at a time when Pechiney, a state-owned metals company, is considered a candidate for privatization in 1995 and needs a clean balance sheet. ""They didn't mind this strategy when its was working,"" Mr. Burns said. **********Also, after several years of integrating American-French operations, American National, the world's largest maker of beverage cans and plastic-based tubes, is poised for growth and needs a manager skilled in acquisitions, he said. **********Mr. Ergas, 54, who was said to be unavailable for comment, will become a professor and trustee in residence at a Chicago university, an American National spokeswoman said. She declined to identify the university. **********He will be replaced by Jean-Louis Vinciguerra, 49, who helped negotiate American National's acquisition for $1.26 billion in 1988. Mr. Vinciquerra, who will be relocating to Chicago from Paris, has spent the last two years as a general partner of Rothschild & Company, an investment banking firm. He had previously spent 22 years with Pechiney, the last nine as its chief financial officer. **********In an interview from Paris, Mr. Vinciquerra said his role in helping devise Pechiney's strategic moves over two decades made him a logical choice for the job. He declined to comment on Mr. Ergas's departure. **********Pechiney International, which is made up of American National Can, former Pechiney packaging operations and an aluminum parts maker in Greenwich, Conn., had sales of $6.3 billion last year. **********American National was formed in 1987 in a merger of the American Can Company and the National Can Company. Its purchase a year later by Pechiney provided the setting for France's largest insider trading scandal."

Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, for example, when he called for the breakup of the Soviet Union, never imagined an independent Belarus or Ukraine. Breakup of Soviet Union **********But it was the leaders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine who together broke up the Soviet Union when they met in Minsk in December 1991 and decided on independence. **********While Ukraine and Belarus have had brief periods of sovereignty in the past, the question of independence is much sharper in Ukraine, where the more nationalist western half of the country was Sovietized only after World War II. **********Still, both Ukrainian candidates -- Leonid M. Kravchuk, the nationalist-backed incumbent and former Communist Party ideology secretary, and Leonid D. Kuchma, a former Prime Minister from eastern Ukraine -- say they will work for closer economic and political ties to Russia. **********But with weak economies and currencies, Ukraine and Belarus are looking toward friendlier, more privileged banking and trade relations with Russia, though in Ukraine especially there is much more concern about the possible political price Moscow might exact. **********Mr. Kravchuk has tried to paint Mr. Kuchma as a traitor to Ukraine who might give away sovereignty to Moscow; Mr. Kuchma calls for a realistic recognition of Russia's importance to Kiev. **********""Ukraine is 80 percent dependent upon the raw materials of Russia,"" Mr. Kuchma said in a televised debate this week. ""This is oil, this is lumber. Even beyond our 1,000-year shared history, we are obliged to our great neighbor."" **********In Belarus, both candidates are calling for economic union with Russia, while one calls for the re-creation of the Soviet Union. The conservative Prime Minister, Vyacheslav Kebich, maneuvered to create the post of President so he could fill it. But he was humiliated in the first round by the strong populist showing of Aleksandr Lukashenko, who accused the holdover Kebich Government of corruption and won 44.8 percent of the vote to Mr. Kebich's 17.3 percent. Popular Anger at Government **********Mr. Lukashenko, 39, calls for fixed prices, no privatization, a ban on private ownership of land and an end to inflation. Mr. Kebich, 59, seems stunned by the popular anger and, like Mr. Kuchma in Ukraine, has found little benefit from Moscow's open political support. **********Though Mr. Kebich denies it, he is most likely hoping that fewer than 50 percent of Belarus voters go to the polls, which would render the election invalid and require it to be run again. **********Both holdover incumbents have been blamed for their stagnant, badly mismanaged, unreformed economies. **********Both countries have been racked by high inflation and kept vulnerable by their dependence on Russia for energy, raw materials and a market for their industrial goods. Belarus is trying to find a way to abolish its deflated currency, the zaichik, and use the Russian ruble, while ethnic Russians who dominate eastern Ukraine and Crimea look with longing toward the ruble, which now is worth more than 22 Ukrainian coupons. **********Both countries are largely unchanged from Soviet times, except for sovereignty. But the failure of post-Soviet leaders -- who are the same people -- to effect real economic progress has undermined the idea of sovereignty, adding to the voter backlash. **********Mr. Kravchuk got a huge boost today from the Group of Seven industrialized nations now meeting in Naples. They offered $4 billion in aid to Ukraine over two years, plus another 200 million to help replace the Chernobyl nuclear power plants. Some Russian diplomats suggest that the West is intervening on Mr. Kravchuk's side more dramatically than Moscow on Mr. Kuchma's."

The new data will not be used in any explicit formula for determining a bank's overall community lending rating, regulators say. But the hope of community activists -- and the fear of banks -- is that the new race and gender data will show a pattern of discrimination, creating public pressure on financial institutions to change their ways. **********The new plan is subject to a 45-day public comment period. The heads of three bank regulatory agencies that are controlled or influenced by the Clinton Administration predicted that the plan would then be approved. **********But top Federal Reserve officials expressed deep misgivings about the plan at a board meeting today that was open to the public. Lawrence B. Lindsey, the Fed governor who heads the board's community lending committee, said that while the central bank would seek public comment on the plan, he believed it to be deeply flawed. **********""Ideally, a change in policy of this magnitude is best left to the Congress,"" he said. ""I don't believe a small potpourri of regulators should call the shots here."" **********Under the 17-year-old Community Reinvestment Act, banks are already required to show that their loan procedures do not discourage people in poor neighborhoods from seeking to borrow money. The goal of the new regulatory proposals has been to change the rules so as to measure whether banks actually make loans in poor neighborhoods -- instead of following procedures that make look them good on paper but not result in much lending. **********Financial institutions are already required to gather race and gender information for mortgage applicants. **********The compromise drew a mixed reaction from community groups and banks. The American Bankers Association, the Washington-based trade group representing mainly big banks, immediately criticized the extra data collection requirement as an unnecessary increase in regulatory paperwork. **********But the Independent Bankers Association of America, a trade group here that represents small banks, cheered the revised proposal because tiny banks and savings institutions with less than $250 million in assets would not have to collect the race and gender data and would face less paperwork concerning loans in poor neighborhoods. **********Community groups were also divided on the plan. Consumers Union criticized the new plan for not doing enough for poor neighborhoods. But the Greenlining Coalition, a San Francisco-based group of civil rights and minority business organizations, applauded the new draft. **********""Over all it's better than the December draft, particularly because it contains data by race and gender,"" said Robert L. Gnaizda, the coalition's general counsel. **********Banks and savings institutions generally must receive a satisfactory rating or better on overall community lending to win regulatory approval for mergers and other business transactions that require special consideration by regulators. **********The new rules define details of the Community Reinvestment Act and are distinct from the Fair Lending Act, under which the Justice Department recently won a large settlement from a Maryland bank for not opening branches in heavily black neighborhoods. To the dismay of some community activists, today's rules do not include any requirements that banks open more branches in poor or minority neighborhoods. **********The community reinvestment and fair lending laws already ban racial discrimination in lending, and today's revisions to the community reinvestment regulations do not change this. **********The banking regulators responsible for today's announcement tried to walk a fine line between the banks and community activists. Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, said in an interview today that collecting the information would make it easier for banks to determine if they were complying with other anti-discrimination laws like the Fair Lending Act. **********""Paradoxically, the race and data collection should make it easier for banks to police themselves,"" he said. **********The three agencies controlled or influenced by the Administration that joined the Federal Reserve in issuing today's regulations are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and two semiautonomous agencies of the Treasury Department: the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. **********The four agencies dropped a requirement today that banks be evaluated partly on their share of the lending market in low-income areas. **********Credit unions are not covered by any the new rules proposed today."

Hendrick 3d sounds like a hard-driving country song set to the rhythm of a souped-up car, with lyrics that celebrate life in the fast lane. **********He has owned a race car team with Paul Newman, hung out with Tom Cruise and helped found basketball's Charlotte Hornets. In the movie ""Days of Thunder,"" the car dealer and race car owner portrayed by Randy Quaid was modeled on Mr. Hendrick. **********Starting at country used-car auctions, he has built an empire of 64 car and truck dealerships across the nation that had $1.69 billion in sales last year. In the industry, such corporate-sized car marketers are called ""mega-dealers"" -- and Mr. Hendrick, who is known as Rick, is one of the biggest.  But the high-flying 44-year-old car dealer now finds himself in the limelight for a less flattering reason. Some of Mr. Hendrick's dealerships are part of an expanding Justice Department investigation into suspected payments by dealers of $10 million in bribes and kickbacks to officials of the American Honda Motor Company in return for dealerships or hard-to-get cars. It is one of the largest Federal fraud investigations ever involving the auto industry. **********Mr. Hendrick, by all accounts, is a shrewd businessman with a well-earned reputation as a tough competitor and an astute marketer. He has a knack for taking over struggling dealerships and reviving them. And he has installed professional management practices, like standardized record-keeping and inventory-handling, at his 64 dealerships, including 20 that offer Hondas or Acuras, also made by Honda. His vast network sells 27 brands of cars, from Mercedes-Benz to Volvo to Chrysler. 12 Guilty Pleas **********Mr. Hendrick may also have been helped in expanding his business by 2 top executives of American Honda, who had dealings with Mr. Hendrick that went beyond selling cars. The pair are among 15 former company officials charged since March. They have denied wrongdoing, but 12 other officials have pleaded guilty to fraud or conspiracy charges. **********Real estate records in California indicate, for example, that soon after acquiring a Honda dealership there, Mr. Hendrick lent more than $250,000 to a top Honda executive to purchase a home. The son of a second top Honda official was also employed by Mr. Hendrick for over a decade, and that official also had use of BMW owned by the car dealer. **********Seperately, in a plea agreement reached last month with Federal prosecutors, a third former Honda employee testified in court that she was paid $120,000 over a decade by Mr. Hendrick's 43-year-old brother, John L. Hendrick. In exchange, she testified, she helped increase the allotment of cars to a North Carolina dealership owned by the two men. **********Neither brother has been charged with wrongdoing and lawyers for the men emphatically denied any suggestion of wrongful behavior by them. **********In an interview here last week, Joseph Hendrick, who is about six feet tall and speaks with a slight Southern accent, complained bitterly that his own hard-won success has made him an easy target for rival dealers, disgruntled former employees and publicity-seeking prosecutors. **********He acknowledged doing what he described as ""favors"" for top American Honda officials. But he portrayed those arrangements as the kind of help he would offer to any close friend. **********Mr. Hendrick insisted that he never received anything in return for his generosity. He said he believes his actions have always been above suspicion, not even creating the appearance of a conflict of interest. **********""I have never compensated any employee of Honda or any other manufacturer for any franchise or cars,"" Mr. Hendrick said. **********The period under scrutiny in the Government's investigation, mainly the 1980's, was a time of extraordinary opportunity for everyone associated with selling Hondas in America. Starting in 1981, the number of Japanese cars imported into this country were limited by a so-called voluntary export restraint agreement between the United States and Japan. That agreement, meant to ease the competitive pressure on the Big Three auto makers, created a bonanza for Honda dealers, who could sell at a profit every car they could get on their lots. **********During that time, Honda began production in America, but a shortage of its popular models continued for years. When its more costly Acura models were introduced in the mid-1980's, they too were often scarce. Paying a Premium **********The result was that many individuals willingly paid thousands of dollars over the sticker price for a Honda. The company's television advertisements were a satire of scarcity marketing, starring ""Danny,"" a hapless Honda salesman ever frustrated by a car that sold itself. **********Behind the consumer marketplace, however, was another market, controlled by American Honda executives, who doled out cars and dealerships so lucrative that lucky dealers could become millionaires almost overnight. In return for favored treatment, American Honda officials, according to Federal prosecutors, collected $10 million or so in bribes from dealers. And while the former Honda officials have been indicted, no Honda dealers have yet been charged. **********Still, some transactions involving the Hendrick dealerships have attracted the attention of Justice Department prosecutors. A lawyer for John Hendrick, Fitzgerald Parnell, acknowledged that his client had paid money to the female Honda official involved with the North Carolina dealership but said he had only done so at the instruction of a top-level company executive. Joseph Hendrick said his brother had kept him in the dark about those payments for more than a decade. When he finally learned of the payoffs around 1991, Joseph Hendrick says he contacted American Honda to confirm that the problem existed. **********Last month, Justice Department prosecutors told a Federal judge they were investigating whether the pay-off scheme at the North Carolina dealership affected car deliveries to 17 other Honda dealerships, in eight states, owned wholly or in part by Mr. Hendrick or his brother. Prosecutors, who also told that court that they are investigating possible payoffs by Hendrick dealerships to other Honda officials, declined to elaborate. **********Other Honda dealers are also facing questions. In May, a few days before the Coca-Cola 600 stock car race here, subpoenas were served on several drivers and dealers, calling them before a grand jury in Concord, N.H., that is investigating the case. A subpoena does not indicate wrongdoing and is often used by prosecutors to gather information. **********""They are questioning anyone, everyone who owns a Honda store,"" said Cale Yarborough, the celebrated former race car driver, who was one of the Honda dealers summoned.  For Mr. Hendrick, the Federal inquiry is the first major note of discord in the story of a country boy made good. Born on a tobacco farm in North Carolina, he set speed records at age 14 at a local track in a 1931 Chevrolet he and his father had rebuilt. But after Mr. Hendrick decided he would never be one of the world's fastest drivers, he turned to car sales, said Robert Towne, the screenwriter for ""Days of Thunder."" **********Initially, Mr. Hendrick made money by selling used cars. But by age 25, he already owned a Chevrolet showroom and two years later a Honda dealership. His financial backer was George Shinn, a millionaire and motivational speaker who owned a chain of junior and business colleges and later founded the Charlotte Hornets. **********Over the next 15 years, Mr. Hendrick's business grew at a meteoric rate. He said he took a chance and decided to become a Honda dealer well before the car became popular. Impressed by his success at reviving troubled dealerships, companies like Honda, Chevrolet and Nissan asked him to take over ailing showrooms, Mr. Hendrick explained. And, he recalls, the General Motors Corporation asked him to help design the marketing and sales concepts for its Saturn line. Eventually, Mr. Hendrick become the nation's largest Saturn dealer. **********Last December, Forbes magazine ranked the Hendrick Automotive Group, which employs 3,600, as the 82nd largest privately-held company in this country, sharply up from its ranking of 234 in 1992 when it had just under $1 billion in revenues. **********With his wealth, Mr. Hendrick bought a jet airplane, a high-speed racing boat, and a large home here. He drives what he described as ""the flavor of the week,"" cars borrowed from his dealerships (the current one is a $60,000 B.M.W.) As the owner of race-car teams, he was able to attract consumer-product makers like Procter & Gamble to a sport long sponsored by tobacco companies and motor oil producers, said Bill France, the president of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. **********It was in 1977 that Mr. Hendrick became one of the first Honda dealers in the Carolinas. And soon, John W. Billmyer, a top American Honda executive whom Mr. Hendrick had first met as a teen-ager through motor sports, would apparently play a role in helping him gain more dealerships, both in the Southeast and nationwide.   As a result of a deal set in motion by Mr. Billmyer, who became Honda's top sales official in 1980, Mr. Hendrick in 1983 acquired a Honda dealership in Corona, Calif., his first in that state, which leads the nation in new-car sales. William Van Dalsem, the dealership's original owner, said his business had been doing well until his supply of cars began to dwindle after Mr. Billmyer was promoted. **********""After Billmyer took over, things started going bad,"" said Mr. Van Dalsem, who is now retired. ""I was getting 20 to 30 new cars a month, but I needed double that to make money."" **********Soon after being introduced to Mr. Hendrick by Mr. Billmyer, Mr. Van Dalsem said he sold him the dealership in Corona for $300,000. He believed it a fair price given the lackluster performance of the business. Then, three days later, he found the Corona dealership clogged with about 120 new cars, so many that they were lined up in the adjacent used-car lot. **********""I just wondered, 'Where in the hell did he get all those cars?' "" Mr. Van Dalsem recalled. Allocation Method **********Mr. Billmyer, who was among those indicted in March, has denied any wrongdoing in the Honda case. And both the former Honda executive's attorney, David Long, and Mr. Hendrick said it was widely known that the dealership in Corona was up for sale. Mr. Hendrick added that he received many cars at the location, but that this was normal Honda practice when a new owner took over a dealership, and not a matter left up to the discretion of Mr. Billmyer. **********A month after he bought the dealership, Mr. Hendrick entered into a real estate transaction with Stanley James Cardiges, a fast-rising American Honda sales executive who eventually succeeded Mr. Billmyer. Mr. Cardiges was among the highest-ranking Honda officials indicted. **********In April 1983, Mr. Cardiges purchased a $305,000 home in Irvine, Calif., using $251,800 lent to him by one of Mr. Hendrick's companies, J.R.H. Inc., according to state real estate records. Three months later, Mr. Cardiges sold the home to Mr. Hendrick for the same price, those records indicate. **********But Mr. Cardiges continued to live in the house and in May 1985 Mr. Hendrick sold the residence back to him for the original $305,000, records indicate. Mr. Cardiges eventually sold it the house 1989 for $612,000. **********While Mr. Hendrick owned the Irvine home, he also effectively subsidized the Honda executive's rent. He said that Mr. Cardiges paid him $1,100 a month in rent, the same amount he had paid to the previous owner. But Mr. Hendrick's carrying costs on the home, based on the size of his mortgage, interest rates at the time and other variables, would probably have exceeded $2,000 a month. **********For his part, Mr. Cardiges has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Federal fraud charges. Mr. Hendrick said he made the loan because the Honda official was a friend in need of money to buy the house. He said the two men had initially agreed that the house would be sold back to Mr. Cardiges at the original price when he could afford it and added that any loss he took on rent was worth it given the vagaries of the real estate market. In any event, he said, he initially believed that the loan would be short-term. **********In an interview, Mr. Hendrick likened the loan to various acts of friendship or charity he has performed for others outside the car business. While a spokesman for American Honda said it was a conflict-of-interest for Mr. Cardiges to receive the loan, Mr. Hendrick said he did not perceive any problems. **********""I considered it an arms-length deal,"" he said. ""I got nothing for it."" **********During the 1980's, the demand for Hondas always exceeded the supply, which was limited by export curbs. The size of Mr. Hendrick's large Honda business undoubtedly gave him some clout in bargaining for scarce cars. But he may have also had some assistance. **********From 1980 to 1992, Mr. Hendrick employed one of Mr. Billmyer's sons, both on racing teams he owned and as a car salesman at various dealerships. **********Larry Segrest, who worked at an Acura dealership owned by Mr. Hendrick here, said that when he needed a hard-to-get car for a customer he would tell a manager who he understood would then contact Mr. Billmyer, who was also the top sales official at the company's Acura division from 1985 to 1988. **********""Whether Jack Billmyer provided the car or not, it showed up,"" said Mr. Segrest, who stopped working for Mr. Hendrick after he sued the car dealer because of a business dispute. The suit has been settled. **********But Mr. Hendrick insisted that he had not received special favors from Mr. Billmyer. The younger Mr. Billmyer was fired by Mr. Hendrick's company in 1992 after a period of poor performance, the car dealer said. John Billmyer's son could not be reached for comment. **********While a Honda executive, Mr. Billmyer had use of a B.M.W. that Mr. Hendrick kept for a few years at the executive's California home, the car dealer said. Since Mr. Billmyer's departure from Honda in 1988, he has worked as a consultant for Mr. Hendrick at a monthly salary of $6,500. Among other things, Mr. Billmeyer helps Mr. Hendrick to develop proposals for new dealerships. Between 1988 and 1991, Mr. Billmyer was a director of American Honda.  The activities of dealerships owned by Mr. Hendrick have come under further scrutiny because of a plea agreement reached recently with Federal prosecutors by Beatrice Sikora, a former low-level employee of American Honda who helped to allocate cars. It was she who testified that beginning in 1980 she was paid $120,000 over a decade by John L. Hendrick to provide more cars to a Hendrick-owned dealership in Concord, N.C. Stated Policy **********Honda's stated policy was to allocate cars to dealers largely based on the number of warranty cards a dealer submitted to the company in a given period, with each card representing a car sold. Ms. Sikora testified that, among other things, she alerted the Concord dealership about the confidential date on which American Honda stopped counting the cards. Federal prosecutors contend in court papers that, once alerted, the Concord dealership, to increase deliveries, would send in warranty cards for unsold cars that listed names of phony buyers.  Fitzgerald Parnell, the lawyer for John L. Hendrick, acknowledged that his client had made payments to Ms. Sikora. But he said he had done so only after being told by an American Honda executive that it was the only way to insure car shipments. He said his client did not immediately recall the executive's name. **********""He didn't want to pay her,"" Mr. Parnell said. ""It came directly off the bottom line and he resented having to do it."" **********Joseph Hendrick said he only became aware of the scheme sometime around 1991 when Ms. Sikora's former husband wrote a letter to his brother and American Honda containing allegations about it. He said he had then told his brother that he should have been informed about it long ago. **********""I told him that if they had pressured you, you should have come to see me,"" Mr. Hendrick said. **********Mr. Towne, the screenwriter, said he can't imagine Mr. Hendrick breaking the rules. And Mr. Shinn says his accountants never found any irregularities in the Hendrick showrooms in which he'd invested. **********The broadening Federal investigation appears to be wearing on the usually ebullient entrepreneur. A man given to large weight swings, he gained some 70 pounds in recent months, a problem that drove him into an experimental drug treatment program, which has since helped him shed half that gain. **********""If all I have done in 15 or 20 years of business is hire the son of someone who was a friend of mine or bought a house with the understanding you would buy it back and lease it, am I a criminal?"" he said."

Strong union leaders who had the experience and authority to channel worker grievances have been drafted into Parliament and Government ministries. **********Johannesburg was unsettled last week by anarchic scenes of conflict reminiscent of past political resistance, when striking grocery clerks rampaged through Pick 'n' Pay grocery stores, and police officers routed them with snarling dogs and rubber bullets. **********""A lot of management expected that after the election of a new Government, everything would be hunky dory -- 'Now we've given them power and they can shut up,' "" said Renee Grawitsky of Andrew Levy and Associates. ""That was naive."" **********During three decades when the African National Congress was banned, unions became a bastion of political resistance, promoting majority rule and foreign disinvestment as ferociously as better wages. **********""What we got was a highly politicized trade union movement, and a militant trade union movement,"" said Duncan Innes, editor of a newsletter on labor issues. **********In addition, South African labor, while relatively expensive, is mainly poorly educated and militant. It has dampened the enthusiasm of many Americans and Europeans scouting investment opportunities here. **********Thanks to union successes, labor in South Africa costs twice as much as in Brazil or Mexico, and several times as much as in Thailand or China. Black workers are products of an apartheid education system that deliberately schooled blacks for menial work. Productivity is low. **********""The Taiwanese don't understand the South African work ethic,"" said Pierre Hugo, the lawyer for the factory owners here. ""In Taiwan, everybody is productive. In Taiwan, they work seven days a week and take off one Sunday a month to do shopping."" **********The Taiwanese are regarded by South African unions as hard cases -- secretive, low-paying and ill at ease with black workers -- but in their quest for cheap and cooperative workers they are not alone. **********While some union leaders have endorsed more business-friendly arrangements like contracts pegged to worker productivity or profit-sharing plans, ordinary workers feel little sense of a shared stake in the economy. After decades of mutual hostility, they tend to see employers as rich, white beneficiaries of apartheid. **********""They still see business as a kind of endless pot from which they can draw ever-increasing wages and there is no end to the process,"" Mr. Innes said. **********He said one major American company recently came to ask him if they could avoid the union altogether by offering premium pay and benefits. No, he replied. Because of their role in fighting apartheid, unions are ingrained in South African culture. **********""Workers see the unions as being important,"" he said. ""It's politically correct. We can't bypass the unions. The challenge is to bring them on board."" **********The new Government is now in the uneasy role of intermediary between the workers who elected it and the business it courts. **********Adding to the Government's sense of foreboding, the fastest growing and most militant unions are those representing mainly black hospital workers, teachers and other public employees. They are demanding large raises to match the pay of more privileged white civil servants. **********Mr. Mandela's Government is sympathetic, but it also faces a quandary. The more money spent raising the pay of two million public employees, the less there will be for the five million blacks who have no jobs at all."

A History in Fatah **********Mr. Wazir, who was known as Abu Jihad, directed raids and terrorist attacks on Israel, and before his assassination he guided a Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories from his headquarters in Tunis. A founder of the Fatah movement with Mr. Arafat, he remained his deputy and confidant for three decades. **********Mr. Arafat paid tribute to Mr. Wazir by appointing Mrs. Wazir minister of social affairs in his provisional government, the only woman in the Palestinian National Authority for Gaza and Jericho. She says she was the first woman to join Fatah in 1959, and in recent years she has been in charge of P.L.O. financial aid to families of Palestinians killed and wounded in the conflict with Israel. **********Back in Gaza for the first time since 1963, when she left to join her husband in Algeria, Mrs. Wazir sat in a living room with some of her children, surrounded by portraits of her husband. She spoke without rancor about Israel and its people. 'A New Leaf' **********""I hope we can live together in peace,"" she said. ""We've turned over a new leaf."" **********Mrs. Wazir, who witnessed the killing of her husband by gunmen who burst into their home in Tunis, said memories of past violence were not a barrier to reconciliation. **********""I'm looking to the future, and I don't want the tragedy to continue,"" she said. ""We need peace for both Israeli and Palestinian children, so other families won't have to go through what we did. The two peoples can build strong ties after we achieve our rights."" **********Mrs. Wazir says she still dreams of a single state shared by Israelis and Palestinians, though she adds that this can only happen by democratic means, not coercion by either side. **********She got her first glimpses of modern Israel on the drive from Jericho to Gaza, and then again a few days later on a trip to Nazareth for the funeral of an Israeli Arab member of Parliament. The Decline of Gaza **********""It's a very beautiful country,"" she said. ""Great efforts were made to raise it to such a high level of civilization. I hope we can live with each other."" **********Gaza had changed, she said, and not for the better. ""It was clean,"" she recalled. ""There were proper roads. Now I found everything destroyed. There are no roads, the city is dirty and there has been a population explosion. But the people are beautiful, and they gave us a great welcome."" **********Though she acknowledges that resources are limited, Mrs. Wazir listed ambitious social welfare plans: rehabilitation of freed prisoners and the disabled, vocational training for women, literacy campaigns and a social security program. **********Women's issues are of particular importance. ""One woman in the National Authority is not enough,"" she said. ""They have to be involved in all levels of government."" **********Returning home through Jericho was bittersweet, she said, because she had come back without her husband. After they were married in 1962, she recalled, they spent their honeymoon in Jericho, before years abroad that took them to Kuwait, Algeria, Syria, Lebanon and Tunis. **********""Now I came back without Abu Jihad, but with my children and grandchildren, who I hope can live here in peace and independence,"" she said. ""I was happy to return to my country, to find a place to rest my head. But I was sad that I was returning without him. We had always dreamed of coming back together. We never lost hope."""

The investors who own those apartments at 3 Sheridan Square owe $66,85...",843,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Real Estate,Real Estate," **********A COOPERATIVE is suing its former sponsor in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for maintenance owed -- not by the sponsor, but by the investor-owners of 5 of the 159 apartments. The investors who own those apartments at 3 Sheridan Square owe $66,857 in back maintenance, and the $8,063 maintenance due monthly on the units is not being paid. **********The case is a reflection of the pervasive problem of defaults by sponsors and investors who own large blocks of shares, which is forcing co-ops to take aggressive measures. If they do not, ""the ultimate cost of the default could be the failure of the co-op to pay its underlying mortgage and a resultant foreclosure,"" said Mark S. Rudd, a Manhattan lawyer. **********Ordinarily, a co-op board has legal remedies enabling it to seize shares in case of a delinquency and sell them. But sponsor and investor defaults usually occur when the rent-regulated apartments they own are occupied by tenants who pay far less in rent than the maintenance that is due. These units are often unsalable. Even banks holding loans on such apartments often walk away rather than take over maintenance payments. **********Edward T. Braverman of Manhattan, the lawyer who represents the Sheridan Square co-op, said this was the first time a co-op was seeking to hold a sponsor liable for maintenance defaults by so-called holders of unsold shares. **********When investors buy large blocks of shares from a sponsor they often negotiate an arrangement that designates them holders of unsold shares. That favorable position means they can, like the sponsor, resell the apartments without board approval and without incurring some fees other shareholders must pay. The sponsor, however, remains liable to the co-op for any unpaid maintenance on the investor-held units. **********In the Sheridan Square case, the co-op is suing the Parman Company of Forest Hills, Queens, and Jack Parker, a Parman principal, who were both principals of Sheridan Square Associates, the co-op's sponsor. The total monthly rent on the five apartments, which are all rent stabilized, is $4,000 less than the monthly maintenance. **********Another Manhattan co-op, the 48-unit 210 West 103d Street, is attempting to remedy its default problem by persuading tenants to buy their apartments. The 14 rent-regulated apartments, on which the sponsor, Aaron Ziegelman of Manhattan, defaulted two years ago, pay $5,400 a month less in rent than the maintenance owed. Shareholders have been paying surcharges of $72 to $99 a month in addition to their maintenance to pay for the shortfall and to keep the building solvent. **********""The bottom line is you can never deal with this problem with any finality until you get the tenant either to vacate or to buy their apartment,"" said Dru S. White of Manhattan, the lawyer for the board. ""You may have to offer them maintenance rebates or even cash, but once they buy, your problem is solved."" **********The co-op currently is offering tenants a purchase deal that it hopes will result in the sale of most of the units and an upswing in values. Under the offer, which was made on Tuesday, tenants can buy their apartments for the equivalent of two months' maintenance. They will also receive the difference between their rent and their maintenance for two and a half years, or half the difference for five years.  The offer expires Feb. 18. **********""I haven't a clue what my apartment is worth, but it's definitely worth $1,404,"" said Gale Gallione, an actress, who pays $498 a month to rent her one-bedroom apartment -- $302 less than the maintenance -- and who is one of several tenants who are interested. At one time, her insider price was $100,000, she said. **********A 75-unit Upper East Side building in which an investor has defaulted on 17 rent-stabilized units, with a total shortfall of $1,200 a month, is to auction off the apartments next month if the $48,000 owed is not paid by noon today. Some rents are higher than the maintenance, and investors looking for deals are back in the market, said Robert D. Tierman, the co-op's lawyer. He declined to identify the building while a decision by the investor was pending. He called auctions ""the most effective way"" of dealing with a maintenance default. **********Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer, said his strategy often was to ""restructure the building's finances, allowing the building to function, often with a rollback in maintenance, and increasing the value of the unsold apartments."" **********In a recent workout negotiated by Mr. Saft, the Intergon Life Insurance Company of North Carolina, which was holding a $2.46 million mortgage on a 93-unit Brooklyn co-op, 800 Cortelyou Road, agreed to split the loan into two parts. The building's mortgage was reduced to $1.84 million, but Intergon will receive an additional $624,369 as the 30 apartments on which the sponsor defaulted are sold. Meanwhile, the co-op saves $7,000 monthly on mortgage payments, which is sufficient to carry the $7,300 monthly shortfall on the 30 rent-regulated apartments. The units will be sold by the co-op as the market improves, Mr. Saft said."

Nearly one-fourth of Green Point's 53.6 million shares changed hands after the stock began trading about 1:30 P.M. The shares closed at $19, up 27 percent from the offering price. **********The trading was authorized when a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit lifted a temporary restraining order issued Wednesday by a lower court. That ruling had been in a suit brought by lawyers representing depositors who wanted the share issue blocked. **********If the offering had not been completed yesterday, Green Point would have been required to ask depositors who had subscribed for shares whether they wanted their money back, delaying the issue for weeks. **********About 10,700 depositors -- 5 percent of the total -- subscribed to buy shares. **********The offering had been oversubscribed, so depositors only were able to buy 84 percent of the shares they sought, to a maximum of $1.7 million each. **********""It was a nail-biting thing,"" said one California stock trader, who had placed a deposit in Green Point in order to participate in the offering. ""But the stock performed better than I expected today."" **********Green Point had been the nation's largest mutual savings bank, with assets of $6.44 billion. In New York, mutual savings banks have no clear legal owners, and the process of their conversion to stock ownership has been debated because of the high compensation awarded to their management. Congress held hearings this week on bills to restrict such compensation. **********On Monday, the New York State Banking Department told Green Point it could only proceed with its offering if it eliminated grants of $40 million in stock and more in options to its management and trustees. Those officials were not even allowed to buy shares in the offering yesterday. **********The state order actually hurt the price of the stock in trading yesterday, according to stock traders. When a company's management has significant share holdings, it tends to align its actions with stockholder interests, one Green Point investor said. **********More important, the state said Green Point could not buy back its own stock for three years. Other savings banks that have issued stock have found that they ended up with too much capital and chose to buy back stock. And Green Point, which was highly capitalized before the stock offering, will now have $1.4 billion in equity capital. **********Thomas S. Johnson, Green Point's chairman, said the bank was looking for acquisitions that would expand its mortgage-lending business, which specializes in lending to people who do not meet traditional credit standards, charging them higher-than-average interest rates. **********""What is unique about Green Point is the type of home mortgage lending we do, which is extremely profitable and serves a need in the community,"" Mr. Johnson said. When Mr. Johnson, the former president of Chemical Banking Corporation, joined Green Point last August, the conversion was expected to proceed with no complications. But in November, the Republic New York Corporation made an unusual hostile bid for Green Point, offering to make special interest payments to Green Point depositors. **********While the state told Republic that its bid was illegal, the move attracted attention to the transaction and especially to the compensation for the directors and trustees. Several lawsuits followed on behalf of various groups of depositors, including one financed by Republic."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/17/world/israeli-s-death-atrocity-or-act-of-war.html,Alan Cowell,1994-10-17,,822,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Israeli's Death: Atrocity or Act of War?,Israeli's Death: Atrocity or Act of War?," **********When Nahshon Waxman, the Israeli soldier killed after being abducted by Islamic militants, was buried Saturday night, thousands of Israelis poured into the darkness of the Mount Herzl military cemetery at midnight to mourn a man they considered their latest martyr. **********A Palestinian mother of four in this refugee camp near the West Bank town of Ramallah saw things in a different light today. She preferred to focus not so much on the violent outcome -- three kidnappers and another Israeli soldier also died in the rescue attempt -- as the stated aim of the hostage-taking: to force the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in return for the soldier's life. **********""We have families who have lost their sons, we have families with relatives in prison, we have families who paid the price of occupation,"" said the woman, who identified herself as Oum Ashraf, meaning mother of Ashraf. ""So people can justify that kidnapping. It was legitimate. Their sons are dear to them, and our sons are dear to us."" **********Palestinians here and elsewhere in the West Bank echoed her view.  None seemed ready to follow Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in condemning the kidnapping, which was carried out by members of the militant Islamic group Hamas. **********Their comments seemed to underscore a familiar collision of perceptions here: actions that appear as atrocities to one side are often interpreted by the other as appropriate moves in a legitimate struggle. **********""What do the occupiers expect of us?"" said Ghassan Safi, a 25-year-old sociology student at Bir Zeit University, near Ramallah. **********The kidnapping ended on Friday when Israeli forces stormed a house just north of Jerusalem in the village of Bir Nabala. The Israeli authorities say the kidnappers shot dead Nahshon Waxman, who was promoted posthumously from corporal to sergeant. **********The episode brought new strains to the settlement between the P.L.O. and Israel, which permits limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Israel at first insisted that its soldier was being held in Gaza, not Israeli-occupied territory. Under pressure from the Israelis, the Palestinian police rounded up hundreds of the Islamic militants in Gaza who oppose the agreement with Israel. **********For some Palestinians, this was a new setback to Mr. Arafat's credibility. **********""Arafat is in bad shape,"" said Ibrahim Saeed, a 30-year-old shoe-seller surrounded in his shop by banks of women's patent-leather footwear decked with gold trimmings. ""He is embarrassed because the Israelis made him their tool. He became an instrument, not a decision-maker."" **********The 60-year-old co-owner of a taxi company in Ramallah, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ""The hopes which Arafat gave us as a result of this settlement are going to disappear."" **********A woman in this refugee camp who identified herself as Oum Abed said: ""There are limits to everything, and Arafat has reached his limits because the Israelis didn't give him anything. They didn't give him the opportunity to achieve peace."" **********At the core of the frustration of many Palestinians lies Israel's refusal to release more of the thousands of prisoners it is holding. That is another reason why many Palestinians were prepared to support the abduction of Corporal Waxman, people said today. **********""They express their support for this act by Hamas because they look at it from one angle -- the angle of the prisoners,"" said Ahmed al-Deek, a senior member of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement in the West Bank. **********""Every woman wants to see her son released and if this isn't resolved, the kidnappings will continue,"" said Oum Abed, who has six sons and four daughters. She said one over her sons had died in the uprising and the other five had all been detained by Israel at one time or another. **********But there are other considerations that touch on basic ways of doing business. Where Israeli leaders insist, as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin did Friday night, that there can be no bargaining with terrorists, many Palestinians felt there was still time to talk. **********""Our understanding was that there could be an extension of the ultimatum,"" said Mr. al-Deek. **********Ibrahim Barghoutti, a lawyer in Ramallah said that ""Mr. Rabin made a very big mistake."" ""He could have tried a political way, but he chose the military way and it came to a very bad end."" **********Mr. Barghoutti also drew a distinction between the kidnapping and an attack by Hamas gunmen in central Jerusalem last Sunday night. ""People were against the shooting because it was against civilians. With a soldier, it's different. People are entitled to resist occupation."" **********Mr. Saeed, the shoe-seller, said: ""The Israelis forgot that there was a movement called Hamas, and an Islamic people. They forgot that they didn't achieve peace with all the Palestinians."""

Even with upstarts like HBO and CNN, the networks that came over on the Mayflower are still the heavies. The power of CBS, NBC and ABC has eroded, but only now does this trinity suddenly seem shaky. Last week Fox, which recently jolted the big guns by nabbing some serious television fare -- pro football -- had the audacity to take 12 stations away from them, 8 from CBS alone, by agreeing to invest $500 million in New World Communications. Of course, the old-liners can get new stations in the markets involved -- big-time places like Dallas, Detroit and Atlanta. But they could well be relegated (horrors!) to the boondocks north of channel 13. And the reaction of a bloodied CBS: ""The war is started,"" said Howard Stringer, head of the CBS Broadcast Group. **********For Gerber, a Way to Grow **********Gerber had a problem. It dominated this country's baby food market, but with a declining birth rate there were fewer little mouths -- and no way for the company to grow. But Sandoz wanted the chance to branch out from pharmaceuticals -- not to mention that Swiss companies have been rushing to make acquisitions before Jan. 1, when a change in accounting methods makes acquisitions less desirable. So last week the two found each other, as Sandoz bid $3.7 billion for Gerber -- a high price, suggesting that Nestle was also interested. (Of course it was just coincidence that Gerber stock options were very active the Friday before the deal was announced.) Simplifying With a Vengeance **********I.B.M. wants to simplify its life. That's what its new-broom chairman, Louis Gerstner, clearly thinks is needed to get this scattered giant on the right and future track. There's talk of a ""unified image,"" of offering customers ""seamless, easy solutions that tie products together."" But when I.B.M. simplifies, put on your seat belt. Last week it abruptly dismissed more than 40 ad agencies, giving the work to a single agency, Ogilvy & Mather. I.B.M. spends up to $500 million a year selling itself, making this the biggest account migration in ad history. Madison Avenue is still picking up the pieces. **********For Denny's, Bias Is Costly **********Despite all the progress, no one would pretend that racial bias has been wiped out. But the indignities that remain, both large and small, are often hard to pin down -- and even harder to punish. But according to the Justice Department, Denny's, the restaurant chain, was so blatant and consistent in its bias that a solid case could be built. Perhaps the decisive straw came when six black Secret Service agents assigned to President Clinton were refused a table. And this wasn't random bias, said one lawyer in the case, but ""an attitude that went into the management level."" Last week Denny's agreed to pay $54 million to settle lawsuits by thousands of black customers. (Those who feel they should share in this can call 800 836-0055.) They Know When You Slurp **********A fast-food restaurant would seem an ideal spot to impart state secrets or steamy gossip. It's anonymous, generic, so much a part of the landscape that it's practically invisible. Think again. Last week it turned out that Dunkin' Donuts -- along with who knows how many other businesses -- hides microphones in its stores to monitor cashiers and clerks. But of course that means everyone's on tape, customer and employee alike. It gives a whole new meaning to the concept of public dining. ""It's surprising and scary,"" said Lewis Maltby of the American Civil Liberties Union. 214 Miles for an Electric Car **********Electric cars will never make it. Everyone knows that. They just can't go far enough between meals. Then again, look at those cars guzzling unthinkable amounts of gas, and belching out unthinkable clouds of gunk, at the Indianapolis 500 today. They're lucky to go 100 miles between pit stops. Electric cars, by comparison, are becoming virtual long-distance runners. Last week at the American Tour de Sol, a race for electric and solar-powered cars, a Geo Metro converted by Solectria cruised 214.2 miles without stopping -- no doubt a world record. INTERNATIONAL Tiananmen Square: It's History **********Did President Clinton really have any choice when he renewed China's favorable trading status last week? Probably not; our trade with China has become so vast that a mere politician would be hard pressed to slow it down. Look at the numbers: $31 billion of Chinese goods come to the United States yearly; $9 billion worth take the return route. Some people wished the President had stuck to a hard line on human rights, but Mr. Clinton -- sounding eerily like George Bush -- insisted that even though China had not made the progress he'd sought, more could be accomplished by not isolating this giant nation. The message seems to be this: the statute of limitations is up on Tiananmen Square. Playing the Antitrust Card **********Washington can rattle its sabers at foreign companies whose practices hurt our exports, but it may do no good. Last week it tried a new tactic, filing an antitrust suit against the British glass maker Pilkington, saying it hoarded glass-making technology; Pilkington quickly settled. America's jurisdiction? Simple. Pil kington has big holdings here. This approach could leave a lot of global companies open, for it's nearly impossible to do business here without putting down some roots. THE ECONOMY Data for All (Except the Poor) **********Under your feet, over your head and in the wilds of cyberspace, the information highway is relentlessly taking shape. But now some concerned citizens are saying, Wait a second! You've forgotten something. As phone companies plan their fancy networks linking video, voice and computer, they're guilty of ""electronic redlining,"" bypassing poor areas and focusing on better-heeled tekkies -- that's the message of a study released last week by consumer and civil rights groups. While the industry insists that it's laying paths where the users are -- that it had to start somewhere -- critics say there have to be rules. Data highway, meet political reality.  Now, States Take On Tobacco **********""The free ride is over,"" said Mississippi's Attorney General as he announced a suit against 13 tobacco companies to recover the state's costs of treating smoking-related illnesses -- and to stop Joe Camel-type ads. ""It's time these billionaire tobacco companies start paying what they rightfully owe."" Of course, no one's ever gotten a penny from suing the tobacco industry -- it's always argued that smoking is a matter of choice -- but this is the first time a state, not an individual, has tried. And the state's assertion that tobacco companies long knew of smoking's hazards has more weight now, after the disclosure of documents backing that up. . . . And no sooner had Mississippi acted than Florida went a step further, enacting a law specifically to allow suits on behalf of Medicaid patients who smoke. Calming Words on Derivatives **********Most people still don't understand what derivatives are, but there's a gnawing sense that these speculative gadgets -- contracts ""derived"" from things like stocks or currencies -- constitute some sort of ""black hole"" that could inhale the financial universe. Well, last week scientists said there really are black holes, but on the financial front the sky-is-falling crowd got a setback. After a congressional study calling for far more scrutiny of derivatives, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, came on stage and said, in effect, Don't worry. There's ""negligible"" risk, he said, that this fast-growing market could create a monster that could rattle the Republic. The Tortoise Economy **********Slow and steady, slow and steady -- that's what the numbers keep showing. Fitting right into this last week was a report that April durable-goods orders rose just 0.1 percent, still treading water after surging in late 1993. The trend could also be seen in final G.D.P. figures showing a 3 percent first-quarter growth rate (revised upward from 2.6), after that strong 7 percent pace at the end of last year. Home resales did rise strongly in April, but an awful lot of people surely sensed that the glory days of low mortgage rates may be over."

Top performers were ""The Fox and the Hound"" in domestic home video and ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Bambi"" in foreign home video. **********Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., said its net income increased by 16 percent, to $248.5 million, or 45 cents a share, in the second quarter ended March 31, compared with $214.9 million, or 39 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues rose by 12 percent, to $2.28 billion from $2.03 billion. **********While the results were consistent with analysts' expectations, Disney said its overall operating income growth was hurt by lower attendance at its theme parks, mainly because of the California earthquake and publicity about crime against tourists in Florida, and by disappointing box office results for films like ""The Ref,"" ""Angie"" and ""Cabin Boy."""

Mount Shasta at dawn perhaps. Druids and Californians in saffron robes humming the Windham Hill backlist. Imaginative would be the person who immediately thought, ""Ah, employment policy, ah, enlightenment."" **********Yet scholarship and the Zeitgeist did converge recently in the Republican landslide and the near simultaneous publication of a proposal to overhaul workplace law, leaving two bemused policy experts unexpectedly enjoying a world-historical moment. They are Edward E. Potter and Judith A. Youngman, authors of ""Keeping America Competitive: Employment Policy for the 21st Century"" (Glenbridge Publishing, $27.95), a compendious excursion through employment law that was surely destined only for the seminar tables of policy Washington until the people spoke on Nov. 8. **********The book contains a blueprint for a Republican ""transformation"" -- to adopt the street slang of the new order -- of rules governing the workplace, though entirely without the Sparta-must-die rhetoric of the party's leaders. It seems a genuine attempt to balance the needs of employers who would be internationally competitive and of employees who would be mobile and flexible. Democrats who worry that the next few years would be nothing but bile, big hair and Barry Manilow may be relieved to know that dialogue is possible. **********Nothing seems to have surprised the two authors more than the possibility that their book, the summation of several years of experience in the relatively arcane arts of trade policy and employment law, could become someone's legislative agenda. **********""This was never intended to be a political book,"" Mr. Potter said in an interview last week, a few days after the book was presented at a Washington news conference. ""It's the coincidence of timing that allows these ideas to have a hearing."" Similarly, Dr. Youngman: ""We hope to start a discussion and debate, not just of specific proposals but on the fact that employment policy affects the competitiveness of employers and employees."" Mr. Potter is a lawyer and president of the Employment Policy Foundation in Washington. Dr. Youngman, an international trade specialist, teaches political science at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn. **********The book argues that Americans have for too long looked abroad for culprits to blame for the decline in the country's competitiveness. However much trade practices, low wages or simple technological piracy may give foreign competitors an edge, the more serious problem is domestic. The country's intricate web of laws and regulations, the authors argue, impose ""structural impediments"" on the ability of companies and employees to do their jobs efficiently and thus competitively. Contrary to the perceptions of many labor groups, the authors say that regulation is accelerating: In the first 70 years of this century, some 25 laws regulating employment were passed. Between 1970 and 1993, Congress enacted 72 more, including such thickets of complexity as the Occupational Safety and Health Act. **********THE premise of much employment law is that there's an inherently adversarial relationship between employers and employees. That partly reflects the labor-versus-capital origin of major protective measures like the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act, both Depression-era responses to employer abuses. But even more recent measures like OSHA, Mr. Potter and Dr. Youngman contend, assume the nastiest about employers' intentions. ""They were put in place because of worst-case scenarios, to snuff out the horror stories,"" Mr. Potter said. ""They ensnare companies that would like to be good corporate citizens."" **********Principally, the authors believe, employment legislation works against workplace flexibility, probably the single most critical component of competitiveness in the evolving global marketplace. **********Very high on Mr. Potter's wish list, from among the many suggestions in the book, is revision of parts of the National Labor Relations Act that he and most business lobbying groups believe put the future of the team-employee empowerment movement at risk. **********Education, including training and retraining, is the first among equals on Dr. Youngman's list. Not only are young employees turning up without basic verbal and mathematics skills, but the businesses employing them tend to train only enough to do the job, not to transfer their skills elsewhere. ""We have to have employees with personal flexibility,"" Dr. Youngman said. But even tax law undermines flexibility. ""I may deduct extra courses that promote my profession,"" she said. ""If I take courses that prepare me for a new occupation, I can't deduct them."" **********Mr. Potter, who puts education and training high on his list as well, even suggested the crypto-Democratic strategy of offering, as he said, ""a small tax credit for providing training above what is required to do the job."" The definition of ""above what's required"" would have to be carefully constructed, he said. **********These concerns barely skim the surface of ""Keeping America Competitive."" Dr. Youngman noted that what became a 434-page book -- and shame on Glenbridge for not paying for an indexer -- began as a 50-page monograph. Many of the issues, she said, are politically sensitive and subject to conflict.""It's easy to avoid them."" But, as all sides might agree by now, the country's economic future is more imperiled by denial than by debate."

Among the names are Kurt Masur, the conductor, and Walther Leisler Kiep, a widely respected Christian Democratic elder statesman who has not said whether he would run. **********Mr. Kiep, who is 68 and better known abroad than the others in the running, heads an organization called the Atlantic Bridge, which promotes trans-Atlantic understanding. **********Asked about this suggestion, Mr. Heitmann, who had unsuccessfully urged support for Richard Schroder, a politician from eastern Germany, when he withdrew, said: ""I believe the best chance to nominate an all-party candidate was when I pulled out, but Johannes Rau refused to give way to Richard Schroder then. Now all the parties are committed to candidates, and since the Free Democrats have said they would continue the coalition, I don't have much doubt that Roman Herzog will be elected."" **********""I admire Walther Leisler Kiep,"" he added, ""and in my view he would have been a fine candidate, too."" **********A member of Mr. Kohl's staff said that the suggestion of Mr. Kiep was ""a dead end"" and that there was no thought of dropping Mr. Herzog for him. Free Democratic leaders also said there was no serious support for Mr. Kiep in their party. **********The Free Democrats would play a pivotal role because the 1,324-member Presidential assembly is chosen proportionally to reflect party strengths, and because not all the Christian Democratic members of Parliament, who will also be members of the assembly, are enthusiastic about Mr. Herzog. **********In the first two ballots, when an absolute majority is required to win, the Free Democrats plan to support a candidate of their own, Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, 72, a former Government minister. But on the third ballot, the candidate who wins the largest number of votes wins. The Free Democrats could hold the balance if they all back one candidate. **********""Now that we have come out for a continuation of the coalition, we are not making a statement for or against it by our choice for the Presidency,"" Jurgen W. Mollemann, who heads the Free Democratic party in North Rhine-Westphalia, said on television recently. **********""There is a strong preference for Rau in the North Rhine-Westphalia party,"" he added, urging his colleagues in the assembly to give unanimous backing to whichever candidate a majority of them supports. **********But Wolfgang Schauble, Mr. Kohl's majority leader in Parliament, said, ""They would have to vote as a bloc for Rau for him to be elected,"" a possibility that he dismissed out of hand."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/world/macedonia-census-just-inflames-the-disputes.html,Roger Cohen,1994-07-17,,1261,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Macedonia Census Just Inflames the Disputes,Macedonia Census Just Inflames the Disputes," **********Amid the ethnic rivalries of the former Yugoslavia, a simple rule holds: the more people an ethnic group can claim, the greater its pretensions to land and power. **********So it has proved in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where everything from the first Austro-Hungarian census of the 19th century to the last Yugoslav census of 1991 has been invoked to justify Serbian, Croatian or Muslim claims to a percentage of a village or a couple of hills. And so it is in Macedonia, a place with the potential to make the Bosnian war look like a mere warm-up. **********Here in the most southern of the former Yugoslav republics, the game of ethnic numbers has been running wild. Ethnic Albanians, 21 percent of Macedonia's population in the 1991 census, now claim to represent 40 percent of an estimated two million inhabitants. **********Serbs, a mere 44,000 in the last census, say they really number 400,000, or about 20 percent of the population. Slavic Macedonians, who claim to be descended from Slavs who settled here in the seventh or eighth century, insist they account for more than 60 percent of the people -- a mathematical impossibility if other claims are even remotely accurate. The Danger of Confusion **********And that is to say nothing of the claims of Turks, Vlachs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Gypsies and others. **********""If you believed the various peoples' estimates, the population of Macedonia would be several times bigger than it really is,"" said Gerard Calot, a French statistician who has been trying to sort out the mess by helping with a new Macedonian census. ""And Bosnia has taught us that such confusion is very dangerous."" **********Danger certainly looms in Macedonia, a new, landlocked country with four hostile neighbors and a battalion of American soldiers in United Nations uniforms trying to insure that thinly veiled hostilities do not develop into war. **********Greece, to the south, disputes the new country's name, over which it claims exclusivity. Bulgaria, to the east, says Macedonians are really Bulgarians, a claim deeply irksome to the Government in Skopje. **********To the north there is no comfort, for Serbia would not be averse to absorbing Macedonia once more into what remains of the Yugoslav federation.  To the west, Albania naturally sides with the Macedonian Albanians. A Recipe for War **********To analysts, all this adds up to a recipe for a full-scale Balkan war. So Western countries came up with a simple idea for a preemptive policy to avoid the country's breakup: put some money behind finding out who really lives in Macedonia. That way, they could limit the ability of antagonistic ethnic groups to make the ambitious claims for self-rule and territory that have destroyed Bosnia and dismembered Croatia. **********But this is the Balkans, where rational solutions tend to sink quickly in a bog of prejudice. **********So it has proved with the Macedonian census, initiated on June 21 and completed this week with the help of over $2.5 million from the European Union and the Council of Europe. **********Conceived to help settle disputes, it has instead inflamed them. Albanians and Macedonians are furious with each other over the census, a Bulgarian-influenced party has said the census was flawed, and the Macedonian Government has infuriated Western experts by accusing them of meddling and bias. **********""The census is not going to achieve what it was supposed to do,"" said a weary Western diplomat. ""That is, it is not going to settle the numbers once and for all.""  Tensions High in City **********In the northwestern city of Tetovo, an ethnic Albanian stronghold, tensions are running high. The town teems with police officers and with the kind of resentment that is also characteristic of Kosovo, an area of Serbia also inhabited mainly by ethnic Albanians. **********The Albanian community says it was grossly underrepresented in the municipal committees that oversaw the census and the census takers, or ""enumerators,"" who went to people's homes to insure the proper completion of census forms. It is already convinced that the results -- expected in preliminary form next month -- will be grossly distorted. **********""The census was politicized by the Macedonian Government and has only created confusion,"" said Menduh Thaci, the vice president of a radical wing of the main ethnic Albanian political force there, the Party of Democratic Prosperity. **********""Albanian representation on census committees was just 12.8 percent, when we are about 40 percent of the population,"" he said. ""Somebody is going to be punished for this, because the West does not pay over $2 million for an act of manipulation.""  'Neither Just Nor Truthful' **********Even in the moderate wing of the Party of Democratic Prosperity, whose members are part of Macedonia's governing coalition, dissatisfaction is strong. ""We are now convinced that this census will be neither just nor truthful,"" said Mersim Pellozhani, an Albanian member of Parliament. **********Such claims are fiercely disputed by Risto Ivanov, a Government minister and the head of the State Census Commission. He said in an interview that ""although there have been some mistakes and problems, they will not affect the fairness of the census."" **********At the same time, Mr. Ivanov confidently predicted that Albanians would be found to represent no more than 20 percent of Macedonia's population, and Slavic Macedonians over 60 percent. Western diplomats believe that Albanians in fact make up at least 30 percent of the population, and that any result under that will lead to what one called ""an explosion of anger."" **********In a separate interview, Branko Crvenkovski, the Macedonian Prime Minister, said he anticipated that ""Serbs will be very disappointed with the numbers from this census."" Crucial to Albanians **********The count is certainly crucial to Macedonia's Albanians. Many of them resent being treated as a minority and demand the right to be taught in Albanian in Macedonia's two universities. They seek more representation in public administration, the army and the judiciary and want either limited self-rule or outright autonomy. **********Equally, the count is highly sensitive for the Government of President Kiro Gligorov, which is committed to a unitary Macedonian state. So sensitive, in fact, that the census law runs for 24 pages, and 59 articles and census forms were made available in five languages. **********Although the law is exhaustive it is far from perfect, in the view of Western observers. Those observers were denounced this week by Mr. Ivanov for giving advice to extremist parties -- clearly a reference to some Albanian groups -- and relations with the Government have been strained. **********Mr. Calot, the French statistician and one of about 50 experts monitoring the census, illustrated some of the problems by pointing to Article 30 of the census law. Its first sentence states that ""an enumerator shall be appointed for each enumeration district."" **********""That looks simple,"" Mr. Calot said, but in fact it turned out to mean that a Slavic Macedonian enumerator must be appointed. In certain conditions, enumerators from other nationalities were added. But there was a lack of symmetry in some places and resentment among minorities. **********Such resentment seems to have manifested itself in a refusal to register. Mr. Ivanov said 1.8 million people had registered for the census, compared with the population count of 2.1 million in 1991. That year, the ethnic Albanians boycotted the census, and their number was estimated through official records. **********This year, the Albanians insist they took part in the census. Although Mr. Ivanov said the figures are not yet final, it does seem that Macedonia has a problem common to the former Yugoslav lands: a vast number of people in this very small and vulnerable state have disappeared in the past three years."

In its case against the Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank of Chevy Chase, Md., the Government argued that simply by locating its branches only in affluent, white, and mostly suburban areas surrounding the District of Columbia, the savings and loan had discriminated against the black population of the District's inner city and poorer suburbs. **********This remedy for discrimination goes beyond Government rules that have forced banks to lend without bias in areas in which they operated and sometimes restricted them from closing branches in poor areas. In the Chevy Chase case, for the first time, the Government is forcing a lending institution to open at least one new branch in an area it had not previously served. **********""Anyone who makes credit unavailable on the basis of race is in violation of the Fair Housing Act,"" said Paul F. Hancock, chief of the housing and civil enforcement section of the Justice Department. ""That includes lenders that say they do not do business in black neighborhoods."" **********It's a stance that banking lawyers argue extends beyond the scope of the fair lending laws. Indeed, some banking regulators, especially at the Federal Reserve, have fought the Justice Department's effort to dictate where banks do business. **********Still, in recent years many big banks have stopped fighting the Government's community reinvestment and anti-discrimination initiatives and have concluded that reaching out to low-income people is a necessary cost of doing business. Now, it appears, banks will have to go further. **********But if the Justice Department insists on forcing banks to open new branches at a time when banks want to close branches, it could significantly raise the cost of complying with community reinvestment rules. **********""No regulators have required bankers to open branches,"" said Warren Traiger, a lawyer specializing in community reinvestment. ""That's something the banks have absolutely refused to do because nothing has the potential to be a bigger money-loser than a branch,"" he said. 'Monkey Is Now on Your Back' **********While all banks would be affected, this new standard is a particular challenge to the many lending institutions, such as Chevy Chase, that have grown in affluent suburban areas with little or no service in city centers. **********""If you are a suburban bank and there is a diverse population in your general service area, the monkey is now on your back to provide services to all members of your area,"" said Linda Gallagher, head of the compliance training program with KPMG Peat Marwick. **********In the New York area, for example, lending institutions such as the Bank of New York, Fleet Bank and First Fidelity have strategies that emphasize suburbs and play down large parts of New York City. **********""It's significant when a bank has penetration in Westchester and Manhattan but not here in the Bronx,"" said Matthew Lee, executive director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move, a housing group that has pushed banks to expand service in the borough. ""They need to fill in the gap."" **********Indeed, after pressure from Inner City Press, NatWest Bankcorp said on Tuesday that it would open a new branch in the Bronx at 161st Street and the Grand Concourse. **********The Chevy Chase case, however, brings even more pressure on banks to expand their lending areas. The Bronx group had relied on the Community Reinvestment Act, a law that compels banks to lend money in the communities that they serve. **********This act is enforced by the banking regulators, whose only leverage is to deny applications that banks must file to open or close branches or to make acquisitions. As banks have increasingly merged with each other, community groups have found that protesting applications on the ground of inadequate community reinvestment has been a potent tool. **********Still, the Justice Department brought its case under fair housing laws, which let the Government seek money penalties or other relief.  Legal Interpretation Debated **********Some banking lawyers argued that the department's emphasis on how Chevy Chase marketed its services was not warranted by the antidiscrimination laws. **********""The fair lending laws do not impose the obligation of being out there and establishing branches and having marketing,"" James D. McLaughlin, the director of agency relations for the American Bankers Association, said. Yet he said the banking industry had no way to challenge the Justice Department because all the banks it has accused of discrimination have reached settlements before trial. **********""Justice is developing law by consent decree,"" he said. ""There is no bank or savings and loan willing to stand up and go to court against them."" **********And even the Government is split on how far to push banks. In a recent effort by nine Federal agencies to create joint regulations on housing discrimination, the Justice Department argued for strong rules to force banks to open branches and take other actions to reach out to minority borrowers. But the Federal Reserve opposed those proposals, according to people familiar with the meeting. **********As a result, rules were published with no mention of marketing. The group agreed to keep reviewing the issue and more regulations may be developed this year. **********""The Justice Department has been more aggressive than banking regulators have,"" said Cynthia Lewis, a community-reinvestment consultant in New York. ""They are not subject to as much pressure from the banks."" **********Now that banks are being asked not only to approve loans without bias but also to seek new customers from all races and incomes, however, fights are increasingly arising over how a bank defines its home area. Since the Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to lend in the communities they serve, each bank must designate a service area. **********Many community groups have argued that banks draw those maps to deliberately exclude poor areas. ""NatWest included the whole metropolitan area except Harlem and the South Bronx,"" Mr. Lee of Inner City Press said. ""On the face of that, we said 'that is crazy.' "" **********While the largest banks have often been the targets for community-group protests in the past, the new Justice Department standard may well benefit large institutions that have maintained branches in urban areas and can afford to develop programs to reach out to minority customers."

He was taken into custody shortly after he arrived from Thailand, a major shipment point for narcotics, in transit to a flight to Athens. **********Mr. Van Damme, a resident of Nigeria since 1976, said that he had been set up by a Nigerian criminal operation that he had exposed to the Dutch intelligence agency. **********His assertion of innocence seemed to gain some credibility after the Dutch Foreign Ministry confirmed earlier this month that Mr. Van Damme had been in contact with the intelligence agency just before his arrest in Singapore. The exact nature of those contacts was not disclosed, however, and Dutch officials said they did not directly involve the drug charges in Singapore. **********Mr. Van Damme, who was married to a Nigerian, said that he had been carrying the bag for a Nigerian engineer, and that he had not known what was inside. Nigerian drug operations reportedly control much of the heroin trafficking in Southeast Asia. **********Singapore has executed scores of people, including many foreigners from other Asian countries, under a 1975 drug law that mandates capital punishment for possession of as little as a half an ounce of heroin. **********Mr. Van Damme was the first Westerner to be executed under the law, and the timing of his execution alarmed some Westerners here who worry that the Singapore Government is on a vendetta against them. **********Last May, an American teen-ager, Michael P. Fay, received four lashes with a bamboo cane after he confessed to charges of spray-painting cars. He later said he confessed under duress of nine days of police interrogation. Last month, an American businessman, Robert Freehill, was arrested for assault and abusive language, some of the charges dating to 1992. Mr. Freehill left Singapore after paying a fine. **********In a statement from the Netherlands, Mr. Van Damme's family said they were ""completely in the dark as to what actually happened and can only conclude that other people deliberately or unintentionally involved in this situation a man who was by nature guileless."" **********The family released a copy of the bluntly worded telegram that they received from Singapore prison officials last week: ""Death sentence passed on Johannes Van Damme will be carried into effect on 23.9.94.

But they differ on how strong the recovery will be, and even the most optimistic forecasts come with numerous financial health warnings. This is because the precious metals market is notoriously volatile. **********Tim Peterson, a mining analyst at James Capel & Co., the London-based brokerage, is confident that the platinum price will continue to increase throughout 1994, but admits that the market is hard to predict. **********""We're anticipating a price of $440 per ounce next year, but you have to allow a margin of error in that,"" he said. ""The momentum is upward, but it could be slower than we expect."" **********Rhona O'Connell, a partner at T. Hoare & Co., a London investment management firm, is more optimistic that the surplus will soon evaporate. **********""We're expecting a surplus this year of probably less than 200,000 ounces,"" she said. ""But when Japanese investments are included, the chances are that platinum will have to be pulled from stocks to meet demand."" **********Japan's jewelry market is extremely important for platinum producers and has helped bolster demand throughout the recession, added Miss O'Connell. **********Investors wishing to gain exposure to the platinum market can do so in several ways. One is to buy the metal directly in the form of bullion or coins. **********According to Mr. Peterson, however, this route is best suited to coin collectors rather than to those hoping to benefit from rising platinum prices. ""With coins you have to pay a premium, and they can also be difficult to trade,"" he said. ""They are not as liquid as gold bullion coins, which have a bigger market."" **********Instead, say analysts, mining shares are considered the best way for private investors to gain exposure to platinum. Well- known mining equities include Rustenburg and Impala, both South African and both owned by the JCI Group. A third major South African player, Western Platinum/Eastern Platinum is almost wholly owned by the U.K-listed Lonrho PLC. **********Unfortunately, the predicted growth in platinum prices may already have been discounted by stock markets, said Mr. Peterson. ""In February, we recommended buying across the whole platinum sector. Right now, we think the market is valued fairly."" **********Mr. Peterson suggested that those who missed the boat in February should stay out of the market for a while longer, even though there may still be some upside in platinum prices in the near term."

""£2 billion is a great deal of anyone's money to be losing in a year."" **********As disastrous as Lloyd's results were, Mr. Rowland emphasized that they still marked a slight improvement over the previous year, for which the market posted a revised loss of £2.3 billion. Lloyd's also predicted, albeit not for the first time, a return to profitability in short order. **********The company said it expected to post ""good"" profits in the 1993 year of account, the results of which are to be announced in two years. **********Mr. Rowland expressed some surprise at the resilience LLoyd's has shown in the face of huge losses and numerous pending lawsuits from Lloyd's Names, the wealthy individuals who provide the capital for policies which are sold by the plethora of underwriting groups that comprise the Lloyd's market. **********The ""remarkable"" thing, said the Lloyd's chairman, ""is that we have had terrible losses but we are still here."" **********Mr. Rowland confidently predicted that the market would pass its greatest looming regulatory hurdle, the annual August test of its solvency by British authorities. **********""I do not seriously doubt that Lloyd's will pass,"" said Christopher Stockwell, head of the umbrella group representing the myriad groups of Names suing Lloyd's and its agents. Mr. Stockwell did predict, however, that the latest losses would push many more Names into bankruptcy. **********To help the Names, Lloyd's announced this month that it would allow them to borrow 3 percent of their expected profits from this calendar year to pay for 1991's losses. Last year, Lloyd's allowed a 5 percent borrowing. **********But with some analysts predicting losses next year of £1 billion, and with claims against policies written prior to 1991 for damages from pollution and asbestosis still rising, the next two years will be no cakewalk. Those so-called old-year losses forced Lloyd's to add £961 million to its reserves in 1991. **********Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said his market's reserves against those pollution claims ""match the best in the industry."" **********But some specialists said it might be difficult for Lloyd's to post a profit even in 1993, a year of high insurance rates and one notably free of the kinds of catastrophes Lloyd's specializes in covering. **********Stephen Dias, an insurance industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co., said Lloyd's may well need every bit of profit it can get in 1993, since this year is off to a dauntingly bad start. In just the first five months of the year, losses from major catastrophes have made 1994 the fourth- costliest year on record. **********Mr. Dias said the Los Angeles earthquake would have cost Lloyd's little if anything if the original damage estimates of $3 billion to $4 billion had held up. **********""Now those estimates are 7 to 8 billion dollars, and there will certainly be some losses for Lloyds,"" predicted Mr. Dias.

The Serbian demands grow bolder with each successful use of force, and the Government's bitterness grows deeper each time it feels betrayed by the West. **********The original plan put forward by the five-nation ""contact group"" that has sought for months to negotiate an end to the war has now been turned on its head. Blandishments to the Serbs have replaced threats. A ""final"" map is open to adjustment. Bosnia's borders look less than sacrosanct. And American diplomats are scurrying to visit a Bosnian Serb leadership that was supposed to be locked in punitive isolation. **********But the Bosnian Serb leaders seem committed to eliminating all Muslim enclaves within the territory they hold, even as the Bosnian Government grows more determined to fight a long war of attrition to achieve what it calls ""the liberation of Bosnia."" **********The reversals from the original plan reflect the Clinton Administration's abrupt decision that NATO cannot help the Bosnian Government and that, as Defense Secretary William J. Perry put it, the Serbs' hold on 70 percent of Bosnia will not be reversed through fighting. **********Charles E. Redman, the man chosen to elucidate this turnabout, was pulled this weekend from the comfort of his Ambassador's residence in Bonn to trek up an icy Bosnian mountain to Pale, the Serbs' stronghold. **********Mr. Redman carried three essential messages. **********The first was his very presence, a clear signal to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, that ostracism has been abandoned as a means to persuade him to accept the peace plan, which offers 51 percent of Bosnia to a Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. **********The second was that contrary to some public statements by President Clinton and other American officials, a confederation between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia might be acceptable. **********The third message was that international mediators were prepared to help Serbs and Muslims agree on changing the map, provided that the 51-49 division was maintained. **********Considering that the Serbs were supposed to be punished for rejecting the peace plan in July, this amounted to a generous package. **********The last point -- possible changes to the map -- is the most important to the Bosnian Serbs. They dismissed the map proposed in July as leaving them with territory that was too fragmented and too poor in natural resources, and lacking industry and access to the sea. If they were to give up a third of the territory they hold, as the peace plan would require, they wanted a richer, more defensible area. **********One Western official said the ""contact group"" that had drawn up the original plan -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Germany -- now had a specific exchange of territory in mind. This would involve the Bosnian Government's surrender of the acutely vulnerable Muslim enclaves in the east -- Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica -- in exchange for Serbian-held land in and around Sarajevo. **********""The general feeling is that the eastern enclaves are probably indefensible in the long run for the Bosnian Government, and that an exchange strengthening their hold on Sarajevo and its surroundings makes sense,"" the official said. **********On purely strategic grounds, this is true. But Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica have deep moral resonance for the Bosnian Government. Their fall would consummate the Serbs' destruction of the Muslim community in eastern Bosnia, with several hundred thousand civilians driven at gunpoint from their homes. **********Thus the Bosnian Government seems certain to reject such an exchange. Indeed, it has repeatedly said it will not accept any changes to the map, which it accepted in July. And the Serbs, who have seen all credible threats of NATO force evaporate as they have pursued their counterattack on Bihac, in the northwest, now want more than the eastern enclaves. **********Mr. Karadzic wants part of Sarajevo, which he sees as the future capital of a Bosnian Serb state. He wants a wider corridor connecting Serbian-held land in eastern and western Bosnia. And he wants more of Bosnia's towns and less of its empty mountainous regions. **********A Western official who was recently in Pale said: ""Karadzic sees this as the last anti-imperialist war in Europe. He talks about having a mission to eradicate the last traces of the Ottoman Turkish empire in Europe. And we still think we can find a compromise with him."" **********Certainly any compromise has become more difficult. The bitter conflict between Mr. Karadzic and the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, that flared over the peace plan, which Mr. Milosevic deems reasonable, has made a Serbian confederation less attractive to both men. Mr. Karadzic now wants nothing less than his own state. **********But even a Serbian confederation is unacceptable to the Bosnian Government, which sees in it the seed of Bosnia's final demise. And President Alija Izetbegovic's disgust over the West's abandonment of Bihac, which the United Nations said it would protect, has put him in unyielding mood. **********Today Mr. Clinton sought to reassure Mr. Izetbegovic by saying that the United States did not support a confederation, but several other American officials have made contrary statements in the last week. **********What is clear is that the amount of time left for a diplomatic settlement is limited. **********Western officials say that a strong message is now being conveyed to the Bosnian Government and to the Serbs that the United Nations peacekeeping mission will not continue much longer in its present form. **********If there is no peace, individual countries like Britain and France will start withdrawing their United Nations troops, even if the Security Council does not immediately vote to end the mission. **********This threat, combined with an offer of vast aid for Sarajevo if a peace accord is accepted, constitutes the pressure on the Bosnian Government to give up its notions of a war of attrition to ""liberate"" Bosnia. **********The withdrawal of peacekeepers is also a threat to the Serbs. It might open the way to an outright Serbian military victory, but it could also open the way for a Western military response if the Serbs were seen once again to be terrorizing Muslim civilians."

The arms inspectors are entirely dependent on voluntary contributions by governments. **********Efforts to persuade governments to track down these funds owed to Iraq have been largely unsuccessful so far, and the Secretary General said he thought that oil companies were likely to be able to trace the funds more effectively. **********Diplomats said the Council was expected to authorize Mr. Boutros-Ghali to go ahead with this new recovery plan. **********Originally the Security Council planned to finance the compensation payments and the arms inspectors with frozen Iraqi assets and with a 30 percent levy on the revenue Iraq obtained from limited oil sales to buy food and other relief goods under United Nations supervision. **********But so far only $243 million in frozen assets has been recovered, of which $47 million went into the compensation fund, and Iraq refuses to sell oil for relief purposes, saying it objects to United Nations monitoring of the use it makes of these funds. **********The new drive to find alternative ways of financing the compensation fund and the arms inspectors comes as the Security Council prepares for another routine review of its trade embargo against Iraq next week. **********The Council will not offer Iraq any relief at this review. But it is clear that it is now divided over terms for ending the oil sales embargo. **********Russia and France favor a literal interpretation of Resolution 687, which says the oil sale embargo will have ""no further force or effect"" once the Council decides that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated. **********The United Nations is likely to certify this summer that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are gone and that long-term monitoring is under way, but the Council will probably want to test Iraq's compliance with this monitoring for six more months. **********Most members of the Council say they believe that even after Iraq is in compliance with these disarmament terms, it must also recognize Kuwait and accept the redefined border before sanctions can be eased. **********But the United States also wants President Hussein to end his blockade of Kurds in the north and his aggression against dissident Shiites of the southern marshes."

I recently retired and find my income tax bracket has dropped to 15 percent from 28 percent, thereby lessening the tax advantage of my condo mortgage interest and property taxes. Are there any other advantages I may have overlooked for continued home ownership versus renting? JOYCE A. BRUNO, Chatham, N.J. **********A. While your deductions will not provide as much of a tax savings as they did when you were in a higher tax bracket, there are some other advantages to owning a home. Ownership offers a measure of control over housing costs, since expenses tend to rise more slowly than those associated with rental housing. **********You might decide to tap into the value of your condominium through a home equity loan or a reverse mortgage. And you may enjoy intangible benefits, like a stronger sense of community. **********""This is not to say that renting makes no sense,"" said Jonathan D. Pond, author of the ""New Century Family Money Book."" ""Renting allows considerably more flexibility if you want to try out other locales before deciding where you ultimately want to live."" I.R.A.'s and Heirs  Q. Is an I.R.A. a cost-effective means of leaving assets to heirs? JOHN F. FOX, Katonah, N.Y.  A. Assets in an individual retirement account accumulate on a tax-deferred basis during your lifetime, meaning you will probably leave a larger estate this way than if you used a taxable investment vehicle. Although I.R.A. assets avoid probate, they are taxable to the estate and the beneficiary. **********""One of the options available to an I.R.A. beneficiary is the ability to leave the account intact and annually withdraw money over his or her own life expectancy,"" said Kristy Gager, director of retirement plan services at Advest Inc., a securities firm. ""Usually this method results in small annual payouts while allowing the balance of the account to grow tax-deferred."" Spouses can also roll over the assets into their own I.R.A.'s, postponing withdrawals until age 70 1/2. Inheritance and Citizenship  Q. Our son has become an Australian citizen. When he inherits from our estate, what is his tax liability in Australia? Would it be beneficial to him to avoid a lump sum distribution? NORMA SLATIN, Issaquah, Wash.  A. Taxes are no longer imposed on either gifts or inheritances in Australia, including those from citizens of the United States. **********Australia has a capital gains tax, though, with rates the same as for ordinary income, topping out at 48.4 percent. Your son may eventually have to pay such a tax if he inherits assets and then sells them. Your executor could avoid this problem by selling your assets and distributing the proceeds to your son. **********""It would not be beneficial to your son for you to avoid a lump-sum distribution,"" said Sandra A. Ciullo, director of estate and trust services for Grant Thornton, a certified public accounting firm. Anything else, like annuity payments, may be considered income and may be subject to income tax."

It is impossible for the community pharmacy, chain and independent alike, to compete with mail-order facilities, hospitals and H.M.O.'s that enjoy huge discounts. These pricing schemes drive up the cost of prescription medications as much as 1,250 percent for all of us. **********The sad fact is, despite the huge discounts, consumers see little in the way of cost relief. And prescriptions filled by community pharmacies subsidize these programs. **********The assertions made in the article by those who represent mail-order pharmacies are ludicrous. The convenience and personalized attention that community pharmacists offer are not ""luxuries."" They are necessities. Day after day, community pharmacists save lives by acting as key players in the health care delivery system. **********The intense education and training that each licensed pharmacist must receive, combined with today's sophisticated computer technology, allows pharmacists to spot drug interactions, drug allergies and conflicts with over-the-counter medications and some foods. Also, the personal, face-to-face counseling at a community pharmacy is most important. Mail order cannot do this. **********The ""theory"" put forth that larger volumes of patients should go through fewer numbers of providers threatens the very quality of health care. It would increase the incidents of prescribing errors, and thus of hospital admittances and other medical complications. **********It makes common sense: Pharmacists are not machines, and machines will never replace the interaction between patients and a practicing member of the health care delivery team. **********Then there is the concept of the ""closed panel."" We have had instances where a pharmacist was unable to provide prescriptions for his own family members because they were in a program that ""excluded"" their relative's pharmacy. **********Consumers must speak up. We cannot continue to allow our health care system to be dictated by the Medco's and PCS's of the world. JOSEPH J.

Because the Washington Post Company owns 70 percent of one of the companies, and because the company's flagship newspaper is deeply disliked by many conservative Republicans, the Administration's plan quickly backfired. **********The cellular telephone fees are buried in a four-inch-thick bill that would put the provisions of the trade pact into United States law. **********An editorial in The Washington Post today said the newspaper had consistently favored the trade pact for eight years, and the cellular telephone provision had no effect on that support. ""We continue to think, as we have all along and for the same reasons, that the trade bill ought to pass,"" the editorial said. **********The Republicans' objections forced a hearing on the issue today by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. **********Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the committee, said the F.C.C.'s assessments would have been easily overturned in court, while actual legislation would insure that the fees were collected. **********The three cellular telephone companies facing the fees are American Personal Communications, which is 70 percent owned by the Washington Post Company; Cox Enterprises Inc., another newspaper publishing company, and the Omnipoint Communications Corporation. **********All three companies were pioneers of a new high-capacity, short-range cellular telephone technology. The Bush Administration initially proposed to reward them by giving them, at no charge, the microwave frequencies on which the new telephones transmit signals. **********Instead, in August the F.C.C. ordered the companies to buy the frequencies for 90 percent of the average price that other companies will pay when similar frequencies are auctioned this winter. **********At that point the Clinton Administration disagreed, saying that technological pioneers should receive a larger reward, paying only 80 percent of the average price and calculating that average in a way that may make the payments smaller than under the F.C.C.'s plan. The Administration compromised on 85 percent in the trade legislation, but kept its formula for calculating the average."

'A Lot of Distrust' **********""There is still a lot of distrust,"" said one of the European Union officials sent to Mostar to lay the groundwork for a planned reunification of Mostar and two-year administration of the city. ""It is a difficult task and we have to take it on, but we rely on the good will and interests of the parties."" **********Bosnia's Croats and the Muslim-dominated Government in Sarajevo were originally allies against the Serbian nationalists who, within a few months of starting the war in April 1992, sent thousands of Muslims fleeing from nearby towns and into Mostar, spoiling the city's fragile ethnic balance. **********In May 1993, Croatian nationalists, saying they were trying to protect themselves from attack by Islamic fundamentalists, rousted thousands of Muslims from their homes on the western side of town and herded them into the Muslim-controlled east, across the Neretva River, or into wretched concentration camps. The Croats cut off water and food to eastern Mostar's 50,000 people, and Croatian shellfire and snipers killed about 1,500 people and wounded 6,000 more.

""If I can't come in July, they should seek another administrator."" Troops Must Leave City **********Even when the agreement is signed, Mr. Koschnik said, the planned two-year European administration of Mostar cannot start until hundreds of Croatian militiamen and Bosnian Army troops leave the city. Bosnian Army officers have already drawn up a plan to redeploy their forces to positions facing the Serbs entrenched in the mountains a few miles eastward, said the civilian chief in eastern Mostar, Safet Orucevic. **********""We could demilitarize the city in 48 hours,"" Mr. Orucevic said. But the vice president of the ruling council in Croatian-controlled western Mostar, Borislav Puljic, said Croatian military commanders opposed quick demilitarization because it might prompt the Serbs to attack. **********""The Serbs didn't sign the demilitarization agreement,"" Mr. Puljic said. ""I am a literate person. I know the mandate of the United Nations military force in Bosnia and it says nothing about protecting Mostar."" **********""We want European Union administration as soon as possible, and we have no alternative,"" Mr. Puljic said.

Moreover, since the world's capital markets must finance development in the new lands now open to trade from China to South America, no one knows how high the returns will have to rise to pull money from New York, London and Tokyo. **********All this is happening because governments have deregulated their financial markets and opened them to money from outside. **********Meanwhile the markets themselves have converted and packaged long-term investments such as mortgages and medium-term ones such as car and credit-card loans into securities that can be dumped at the keystroke of a computer with no certainty that someone will buy them.

Yeltsin's Government called for an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss ways of demilitarizing the Bosnian capital and placing it under United Nations administration instead of going along with NATO's demand that the Serbs withdraw their heavy artillery from around the city or face air strikes. **********President Clinton rejected the request, saying, ""Everything we have done with NATO is consistent with action the U.N. has already taken."" **********Russia's United Nations representative, Yuli M. Vorontsov, appeared to take a more moderate line than officials back home, saying he is no longer trying to block possible NATO air strikes by insisting that they can be authorized only by a new resolution of the Security Council over which Russia would have a veto. **********Mr. Vorontsov added that Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali is ""absolutely right"" to say that he has the authority to call for NATO air strikes. ""He has the last say in this matter,"" he added. ""That is important."" **********The United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, met with Mr. Vorontsov to explain the Western view that no futher Security Council authorization was needed for air strikes against the Serbs. Diplomats said that the meeting was cordial and that Mr. Vorontsov did not dispute the American position."

In effect, the right-wing insurgents appeared to have filled the void created by the disgrace and demise of Italy's one-time political elite. Neo-Fascists Gain **********The neo-Fascist sector of the right-wing alliance doubled its share of the vote, compared with the 1992 national election, to around 12 percent, the projections showed. **********But even as Mr. Berlusconi sensed victory, he faced predictions from his rivals that his alliance would be unable to form a government, as well as challenges from within that could hamper efforts to agree on a government program and cabinet before the new Parliament assembles on April 15. **********One of his key allies, Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, challenged Mr. Berlusconi's credentials to become Prime Minister because he controls vast business interests. Berlusconi Promises Freedom **********In what came close to a victory speech, Mr. Berlusconi declared, ""We have consigned our country to a future of democracy and freedom."" **********He promised a government based on what he called the values of ""all types of freedom: the family, the individual, business, the free market, competition, profit, solidarity, Christian traditions, respect and tolerance toward all, even our adversaries."" **********Shortly afterward, Achille Occhetto, the former Communist leader and Mr. Berlusconi's principal adversary, conceded defeat but forecast that the fractious right-wing alliance would be unable to govern. ""The right has won, but it will not be able to give the country a government,"" he said. **********The two-day election on Sunday and Monday, held three years ahead of schedule in response to the clamor for change, came after more than two years of corruption scandals that discredited the political old guard and plunged Italians into soul-searching and self-doubt. **********Until three months ago, Mr. Berlusconi had remained aloof from overt politics, preferring to make his name as the owner of television networks and supermarkets, real estate and advertising companies and the champion soccer team A.C. Milan. **********And like soccer fans after a game, supporters of his Forza Italia (roughly, Go! Italy) party took to the streets of the capital in their cars, honking horns as they careered through Rome. **********The election was a three-way contest involving the Freedom Pole, made up of Forza Italia, the separatist Northern League and the neo-Fascist National Alliance; the Center Pole, including the Pact for Italy and the Popular Party (made up of former Christian Democrats), and the left-wing Progressive Pole, composed of Mr. Occhetto's Democratic Party of the Left, the hard-line Communist Refounding, the Greens and the anti-Mafia La Rete. 46 Percent in Lower House **********By 2:30 A.M. Rome time, more than four hours after the polls closed, computer projections based on early official returns gave the following results: ***********In the 630-seat lower house, Mr. Berlusconi's alliance was said to have captured 46.4 percent of the vote, compared with the left wing's 34.5 percent. Earlier computer projections gave 329 to 338 seats to the right-wingers and 236 to 245 seats to the left, meaning a clear majority for the right. ***********In the 315-seat upper house, the rightists were reckoned to have taken between 130 and 154 seats, while the left-wing alliance had between 120 and 135. **********Forza Italia apparently took the biggest slice of the right-wing vote, though the neo-Fascist National Alliance doubled its vote. **********Though the National Alliance is a direct descendant of Mussolini's Fascists, the party and its leader, Gianfranco Fini, have often sought to disavow the anti-Semitism and extreme nationalism of the past, to cast themselves as a modern party of the European right. Demurral by Northern Leader **********Mr. Berlusconi said victory would unite his alliance, but Mr. Bossi of the Northern League immediately began setting out terms for participation in a new government. He made clear, moreover, that he had his own candidate for Prime Minister, Roberto Marroni, his No. 2 in the Northern League. **********""We do not want again the vote from the south coming to open the wallets of the north,"" Mr. Bossi said, evoking the Northern League's trademark assertion that the wealthy, industrialized north has been leeched by an unproductive, crime-ridden south. **********Throughout the campaign Mr. Bossi sniped at Mr. Berlusconi and displayed a scathing disregard as well for the insistence on Italian unity by Mr. Fini, the neo-Fascist leader. The Northern League advocates a federalist re-drawing of Italy's political map so wealthy northerners receive more benefits from the taxes they pay. **********Under new electoral law, formulated in response to an overwhelming call for political reform, 75 percent of the seats were decided on a direct vote and the rest on a proportional vote. 6,000 Implicated in Scandal **********For many of Italy's 48 million voters, the ballot reflected a search for a fundamental political renewal after the debilitating years of corruption. The investigations have implicated 6,000 politicians and businessmen in systematic billion-dollar graft. **********Possibly the most telling aspect of the vote lay in the faces that paraded before the television cameras to give sound-bites and spin. For the first time in years, familiar figures like the seven-time Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, and the former Socialist leader, Bettino Craxi -- both accused of corruption -- were nowhere to be seen. **********Instead, the limelight cast its glow on those who had never been in government before, particularly Mr. Berlusconi. **********""Forza Italia is the leading party in Italy, and we have done it in only three months,"" his party spokesman said. **********If that turns out to be true, it will mean that many Italians, particularly younger voters on a quest for change, have opted for the newest of political faces -- that of a smiling, sun-tanned and heavily indebted millionaire whose carefully packaged message of a ""new Italian miracle"" was drummed home on the private television stations that form the core of his business empire. **********But Mr. Berlusconi's very status in the business world is already proving worrisome to some Italians, even in his alliance, because of the concentration of power it would place in his hands if he were he to become Prime Minister.  ""I don't see how a big businessman can be Prime Minister because he would be facing conflicts every day,"" Mr. Bossi said. ""This is not the way to give the country change."" **********""We invested in a modern Italy and not to have a reactionary right,"" he said, referring to Mr. Fini, the neo-Fascist leader.  Neo-Fascist Is Upbeat **********Mr. Fini, for his part, was much more enthusiastic. ""The people have clearly chosen who should govern them,"" he said. **********In a footnote to the election, the once powerful Socialist Party -- the longtime ally of the Christian Democrats and the party most stricken by Italy's corruption scandal -- apparently failed to reach the 4 percent share of the vote needed under the new laws to win any seats in Parliament. **********The results also meant that most of the Parliament members who formed the Government's majority after the 1992 election lost their seats, meaning that they will no longer have immunity from arrest on the corruption charges hanging over about a fifth of them."

Morgado, the Warner Music Group's chairman and chief executive, was managing the record labels. **********""The corporate structure is getting bigger and bigger, and decisions that were once made at the label level are now being made at the corporate level, and that has many people nervous,"" said one music industry executive close to Warner Brothers. ""This is a business based on relationships with artists."" **********Mr. Morgado was not available for comment. Mr. Waronker said he would remain as president, fulfilling his contract, which expires at the end of 1995. However, some people in the company speculated that he might renegotiate his contract once Mr. Morgado chooses a successor to Mr. Ostin. **********""This job was simply not for me,"" Mr. Waronker said. ""I had to do what was in my heart, and not having it feel right was a bad sign."" He would not elaborate. **********People close to Mr. Ostin and Mr. Waronker said the executives might join Mr. Geffen as part of his new venture to form a major entertainment company with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the former Disney studio head, and the director, Steven Spielberg. **********""David reveres Mo,"" a music industry executive said, noting that Geffen Records got its start under Warner Brothers in 1980. ""And Mo and Lenny are a team. If Lenny and Mo join Geffen, they would probably take a lot of Warner Brother executives and artists with them. That could be devastating to Warner Brothers."" **********Mr. Waronker's decision is one more sign of instability at the Warner Music Group, which is the world's biggest distributor of recordings. Its Atlantic, Warner Brothers and Elektra companies have all experienced changes in their top management since July. The head of the Atlantic group, Doug Morris, was named to the newly created position of president and chief operating officer of Warner Music North America, putting him in charge of all three labels. **********The new reporting layer is said by industry executives to have rankled Robert Krasnow, the head of Elektra, who resigned within weeks, as well as Mr. Ostin, who had been accustomed to bypassing even Mr. Morgado and reporting directly to the head of Time Warner. In August, Mr. Ostin said he would step down at the end of the year to become a consultant to Time Warner. **********""Time Warner has lost some of the best talent in the industry in Mo, Bob Krasnow and now Lenny,"" said an executive at a competing label. ""You have employees and artists who are extremely devoted to these people."" **********Among Warner Brother's top artists are Tom Petty, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Paul Simon and R.E.M. Some of them might look for new homes as their contracts expire, some people speculated. None of them could be reached for comment. **********Artists and Warner executives are also troubled by the expected appointment of Seymour Stein, the head of Sire Records, another part of Warner Brothers, as president of Elektra Entertainment. Sire may be put under the Elektra umbrella to build up that group. **********""Fifty artists could be transferred with Seymour to Elektra,"" one person at Warner said. ""Artists have no say, but they will have to deal with all new people in marketing, sales, product management, and that is very unsettling."""

But some analysts said that using Advanced Micro chips was a gamble because the Intel brand was so well known. **********""A significant number of customers, especially corporate customers, may object to buying computers with A.M.D. microprocessors,"" said Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ""Compaq will have to be very careful in what products it puts them in and be very selective."" **********But Compaq officials said they did not plan to limit the use of Advanced Micro microprocessors to specific products and that the chips potentially could be used in its entire product line. Compaq, which is based in Houston, said that Intel would remain its primary supplier of microprocessors, but that also using A.M.D. chips would give it more flexibility to deliver a wider range of computer products and more combinations of features, price and performance. **********""This sort of puts Intel on notice,"" Mr. Glazer said. ""They will have to be more responsive, more price-aggressive and have a wider variety of products. This is going to be a very competitive market."" **********Despite the better-than-expected results, Compaq shares fell $2.125 to close at $81.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Intel shares fell $1.375 on the Nasdaq to close at $63.625 in heavy trading. **********Compaq's fourth-quarter earnings rose 70 percent, to $151 million, or $1.74 a share, compared with $89 million, or $1.11 a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.

That group has watched programs like ""Sesame Street"" and ""Barney and Friends"" on public television stations for years, but Nickelodeon executives say they think those shows are vulnerable. **********""The PBS orientation to kids is so different from ours,"" Geraldine Laybourne, the president of Nickelodeon, said in an interview last week. ""PBS begins by asking: 'How can we improve kids? There's something wrong with them.' "" The Nickelodeon approach, she said, is ""to celebrate being a kid.""  'We Have Them for Life' **********Ms. Laybourne acknowledged that the expansion into preschool territory was part of a larger marketing strategy for the company, which, unlike the Public Broadcasting Service, sells commercial time to advertisers. ""We recognize that if we start getting kids to watch us at this age, we have them for life,"" she said. ""That's exactly the reason why we're doing it."" **********In its 15 years, Nickelodeon has conquered the marketplace for children between 6 and 11 years old. It has seized an enormous 30 percent of the total weekly viewing of children's shows on television, despite being available in only about 60 percent of the nation's homes with television. Nickelodeon reaches more than 20 million children each month with its daily schedule of children's shows. **********By contrast, ABC and CBS, available in all the nation's homes with television, have less than 4 percent each of the viewing of children's shows, mostly from Saturday cartoon lineups, and NBC has stopped programming specifically for children. **********These statistics are based on Nielsen ratings for advertisers and do not include viewing on PBS stations. **********Michael Drexler, the president of BJK&E Media, said advertisers now recognize Nickelodeon's pre-eminent position in the children's market. ""The name Nickelodeon is now almost synonymous with kids' television,"" he said. ""They have created a very successful brand image."" **********But Nickelodeon executives concede that PBS dominates the preschool audience in the weekday morning hours. According to PBS research, ""Barney"" reaches more than three million young children a day, a figure far higher than Nickelodeon achieves for any program. A Shield to Critics **********Needless to say, PBS is not prepared to hand over this franchise to Nickelodeon. As a nonprofit organization, PBS does not gain or lose any money because of ratings. But children's programming has for years been the pride, joy, and shield of public television. When under fire from critics in Congress about Federal subsidies, PBS's defenders point time and again to how important Big Bird and other ""Sesame Street"" creatures have been to American children for more than two decades. **********As for Nickelodeon's initiative, ""I think this is absolutely a compliment to us,"" said Jacqueline Weiss, the project executive for the PBS ""Ready to Learn"" service, a $2 million campaign beginning in July to expand PBS's children's programs and give them a ""hip new image."" **********Ms. Weiss said: ""I don't feel threatened by Nick moving into preschool programming because we have had such a successful track record with children. I think we'll always be ahead because we care about kids and the quality of our programs is so great."" **********Ms. Weiss said Nickelodeon would have a long way to go to challenge PBS's hold on preschoolers. ""We have the top three rated shows with children between 2 and 5 years old,"" she said, citing ""Barney and Friends,"" ""Sesame Street"" and ""Shining Time Station."" **********But Nickelodeon sees its opportunity in a different approach to programming. ""We don't try to prove kids know their alphabet,"" Ms. Laybourne said. ""PBS has to prove that. They have to involve educational counselors in every show. They are programming by committee."" **********Alice Cahn, the director of children's programming for PBS, said it took into account the recommendations of educators and parents about the skills that children need before they enter kindergarten. **********""I don't see what we do as programming by committee,"" she said. ""I see it as knowing your audience well."" **********In a way, Nickelodeon is starting this competition with an advantage: educating children is not its primary responsibility -- entertaining them is. **********The first two programs in Nickelodeon's new preschool effort are ""Gullah Gullah Island,"" a music show, set in the South Carolina Sea Islands and featuring a husband-and-wife singing team, and ""Allegra's Window,"" a puppet show based on the everyday life of a 3-year-old girl. Both will be shown on weekdays beginning this fall. **********Ms. Laybourne said these shows were consistent with the Nickelodeon philosophy that has produced successful, widely praised programs for older children like ""Nick News,"" a program devoted to news of special interest to children, with Linda Ellerbee as host; ""Doug,"" a gentle cartoon show about a young boy who envisions himself as a superhero; ""Clarissa Explains It All,"" a sitcom about a teen-age girl with a strong independent spirit, and the Emmy Award-winning ""Rugrats,"" a cartoon that features the thoughts and dialogue of crawling infants. **********Shows like these have made Nickelodeon the most identifiable channel in the country among viewers ages 6 to 12. ""They know us; they don't really know ABC or NBC,"" Ms. Laybourne said. ""We've built a good business based on being good for kids."" **********For 1993, Nickelodeon had revenues estimated at $245 million, with profits estimated at $95 million, said Bill Marchetti, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a firm that follows the cable industry. ""Nickelodeon is without question one of the most successful channels in cable,"" he said. **********The company has moved to take advantage of its popularity with children by branching into businesses like publishing and merchandising. The bimonthly Nickelodeon magazine now reaches almost 300,000 homes. Nickelodeon licenses more than 400 toys and other items and is a partner with Mattel Inc. in developing new products. **********Nickelodeon also has home video and record departments and has begun a foreign expansion with the start-up last year of Nick U.K., a British version of the channel in partnership with B Sky B, a satellite and cable service. **********The recent merger between Nickelodeon's parent company, Viacom Inc., and Paramount Communications Inc. presents ""huge new opportunities for us,"" Ms. Laybourne said, citing areas like program production with Paramount Studios and projects in conjunction with Paramount's theme parks. A Telethon for Volunteers **********This week, Nickelodeon will also announce a national campaign to encourage volunteerism among children between the ages of 6 and 14. ""The Big Help,"" as Nick is calling the campaign, will use public service announcements leading up to an all-day telethon next fall. During the telethon, children will be encouraged to sign up for all kinds of volunteer programs to be held on a day three weeks later. **********The campaign was inspired by the success of Nickelodeon's sister channel, MTV, with its ""Choose or Lose"" campaign to encourage young adults to vote in the 1992 Presidential election. Ken Lehrer, a consultant to MTV and Nickelodeon, said ""Choose or Lose"" had ""helped redefine MTV, and 'The Big Help' can do the same thing for Nick."" **********Ms. Laybourne said the channel's research showed that children were interested in volunteer work. **********""It all fits together,"" she said. "" 'The Big Help' solidifies our foundation with advertisers and kids, and it shows we do something more than just exploit kids."" Muppets of Its Own **********The two new shows for preschoolers will join the channel's ""Nick Jr."" morning lineup. Nickelodeon also has an agreement with Jim Henson Productions to create programs and new Muppet characters for ""Nick Jr."" The original Muppets have been a fixture on ""Sesame Street"" for a quarter century. **********Even though Nickelodeon expects to make inroads on the PBS children's shows, Mr. Lehrer said the purpose of the new programs was not to put the PBS shows out of business. ""Both should be able to flourish,"" he said. ""They just do something very different from Nick."" **********Ms. Laybourne said the preschool programming would be ""a fine business for us,"" but she noted that Nickelodeon would limit the commercial time in the programs to about half of what it sells in programs aimed at older children."

If it had failed there might not have been enough fuel left on board to try again. **********""Everything depends on one man,"" said Sergei Chernov, a flight control director for the Russian Space Agency, before the docking was completed. ""If we can't deliver the food and water they need the prospects will be very bad."" **********That man, Lieut. Col. Yuri Malenchenko, executed the complicated remote-controlled maneuver without a hitch, Russian space officials announced this evening. Saving the Day **********If the docking had failed, Colonel Malenchenko and his two colleagues, Talgat Musabayev and Valery Polykov, would have had to evacuate the Mir on a Soyuz craft within days. The Mir cannot remain in space for more than a few months without personnel aboard, so Russia would have had to send replacements immediately, at great expense. Some experts said today it might not have been possible. **********But the young man who practiced the docking procedure throughout the night on Thursday saved the day. **********""He did a great job,"" said Nikolai Kryuchov of ground control. ""It was just like he was sitting in an armchair playing a computer game."" **********Well, not exactly. Colonel Malenchenko could only see what he was doing through a video display terminal, and then only a mirror image of what was happening. It was as if he were sitting in the cargo ship rather than in the Mir. **********The pressure on the 32-year-old mission commander, a former fighter pilot making his first space flight, was intense. The two previous attempts were both automated; this one was carried out manually. As the ships edged to within 100 yards of each other, all sound and video links between ground control and the space station were inexplicably severed, leading harried technicians to expect the worst. **********But the fear turned out to be unfounded. **********With no backup ship immediately available and only 10 days' worth of food and water left on Mir, Russia risked losing the space station if the mission had to be canceled. Joint missions planned with Germany next month and the United States next year would have had to be scrapped.

He is perhaps best known for the energetic Diet Coke television commercials that used elaborate special effects to bring stars like Humphrey Bogart, Louis Armstrong, Cary Grant and Groucho Marx back from the dead. **********At Levine, Huntley, which is defunct, Mr. DeGregorio teamed with a copywriter, Lee Garfinkel -- now the vice chairman and chief creative officer of Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York -- to lead one of two creative groups that produced many of that agency's best campaigns for clients like Subaru of America and Citizen Watch. **********""If there's a philosophy I adhere to, it's entertaining consumers,"" Mr. DeGregorio said in an interview yesterday, ""because if people don't remember you, it doesn't matter how marvelous your strategy is."" He will oversee a staff of 26 to 28 people at TBWA New York who create campaigns for brands like Absolut vodka, Evian water and Nivea skin care products. **********Mr. DeGregorio, who is 47, has been among several marquee-name creative talents who lately have been, as they say, between engagements; he resigned from Lintas New York, where he had been executive vice president and chief creative officer, in November, amid the widespread fallout from the loss of several important clients. These executives have been wooed by many shops, including TBWA, seeking to bolster their creative capabilities or replace departed creative executives. **********""I think creative director is the most important position in the agency,"" said Richard N. Costello, the president and chief operating officer of TBWA, who joined Mr. DeGregorio for the interview. **********""It is something that if you do right, the benefits can be enormous,"" Mr. Costello added, ""and if you do wrong, the problems can be enormous."" **********In this instance, the hiring of Mr. DeGregorio comes almost two months after Arnie Arlow, the Absolut account veteran who was executive vice president and co-creative director of the TBWA New York office, left to join Margeotes Fertitta Donaher & Weiss in New York as creative director on that agency's new Stolichnaya vodka account. **********""With Arnie's departure, we saw a chance to take things up a notch,"" Mr. Costello said, referring to the creative performance of the New York office, which handles $267 million of TBWA's total United States billings of $342 million. **********""What we're looking to do,"" he added, ""is take our good and, in some cases, very good and, in some cases, excellent creative work and raise the bar higher."" **********Mr. Costello said Richard Lubalin, 51, who has been the other executive vice president and co-creative director with Mr. Arlow, would continue as an executive vice president upon Mr. DeGregorio's arrival. **********Mr. DeGregorio has been pursuing offers since he left Lintas New York, which he joined from Levine, Huntley in early 1991. He was very close to taking a position last week with a small New York shop before accepting the offer from TBWA. **********""I got near the altar, but you're not married till you're married,"" he said, adding, ""This was the deal I wanted."" **********Among the challenges facing Mr. DeGregorio will be maintaining the high caliber of Absolut's advertising. TBWA has handled the brand since it was introduced to American drinkers almost 15 years ago. Its campaigns, using clever puns and powerful visual images, have been instrumental in helping Absolut's astonishing rise from negligible sales to the nation's No. 1 imported vodka. **********Not only was Absolut one of the first three brands that the New York chapter of the American Marketing Association inducted into its Marketing Hall of Fame, along with Coca-Cola and Nike, the TBWA campaign has also entered the popular culture. It has inspired consumers to collect and trade copies of Absolut's print advertisements as if they were baseball cards, and goaded rival agencies into producing copycat campaigns for their liquor clients. **********""Obviously, it's one of the greatest campaigns in history,"" Mr. DeGregorio said, ""and my role is to be a part of a team to keep it great."" **********Mr. Costello said the goal of the Seagram Company, which is the new distributor of Absolut in the United States, is to increase sales to four million cases a year from about three million. **********""I think it's going to happen,"" he added."

So there has been plenty of time -- and more than enough governments -- to build a political vocabulary suggesting that instability is as endemic as the common cold. **********It is not unusual, either, for them to teeter, dissolve and then re-form, like the colors in a kaleidoscope. **********But two things distinguish the crisis engulfing the Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- the self-described harbinger of renewal now shadowed by intimations of the same corruption that he campaigned against -- from many of its predecessors. **********Throughout the cold war, during which the Christian Democrats held power as Italy's political counterweight to Communism, successive coalition governments were underpinned by a basic arithmetic: With a majority of the voters on their side, the country's centrist coalitions had an interest in sharing the spoils of power. Government crises thus were little more than a rearrangement of the fonts of patronage. **********By contrast, Mr. Berlusconi's right-wing coalition has no such cohesion. As one Cabinet member, Labor Minister Clemente Mastella of the small Christian Democratic Center party, said today: ""The coalition as it stands now no longer exists. We are on the verge of a major political clash in the country."" **********The conflict that has emerged since elections transformed Mr. Berlusconi from a business magnate into Prime Minister last spring is not the old and often cozy arrangement between left and right. It is an institutional war between the country's magistrates and Mr. Berlusconi. **********""I have never corrupted anybody,"" Mr. Berlusconi said on Tuesday during a television address in which he rejected pressure to resign over the investigation. **********At the most obvious level, the issue that has set off Italy's latest crisis is this: Did Mr. Berlusconi, as head of his $7 billion-a-year Fininvest business empire, take part in bribing tax officials in return for favorable audits of two of his businesses, or were the companies a victim of extortion by corrupt tax officers, as Mr. Berlusconi insists? **********But the nub, for many Italians, is the character of the nation's future. Will Italy make its symbolic passage from a corrupt First Republic to a new Second Republic in the purging fires of the investigators' inquiries? Or will it draw some kind of line, declare that enough is enough and allow Mr. Berlusconi to proceed? **********Ezio Mauro, a commentator, said the investigation into Mr. Berlusconi shows ""how much we erred in Italy in speaking too soon of a Second Republic and in granting a license to the 'new' -- because in this country the First Republic never ends, and the 'new' is publicly split in two, with Antonio Di Pietro investigating Silvio Berlusconi."" Mr. Di Pietro is the best-known of the Milan magistrates investigating corruption cases. **********The affair has been evolving since Mr. Berlusconi took office in May with two time bombs ticking beneath him: his refusal, until Wednesday, to consider shedding ownership of his far-flung business empire, particularly his three commercial television stations; and the fact that he accumulated his wealth in the same era as the thousands of other businessmen and politicians who have since been implicated in Italy's huge kickback and bribery scandals. **********The debate has widened as Mr. Berlusconi and his supporters have cast the magistrates' investigations of him as a political vendetta. **********When he was told on Tuesday that he was under investigation -- the same day he played host to a United Nations conference in Naples on organized crime -- Mr. Berlusconi called the magistrates' action an assault on the very office he occupies. **********That in turn raises the question of what exactly the Milan investigators are up to. **********It seems clear that the political impact of the corruption inquiries that began in February 1992, and the popularity that has accrued to the magistrates, have made them a power unto themselves. Are they pursuing a political agenda, as Government officials assert? **********Twice, when Mr. Berlusconi appeared before international audiences -- at the Group of Seven economic summit meeting with President Clinton and other leaders in July, and at the United Nations conference on organized crime this week -- magistrates chose an embarrassing moment to move against him or his family. In July, the target was his brother Paolo, a Fininvest executive. **********When Mr. Berlusconi responded by issuing a decree attempting to limit the magistrates' powers of preventive detention, the Milan magistrates made a dramatic, televised threat to resign, forcing Mr. Berlusconi to back down and withdraw the decree. **********And when Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi sent Government investigators to the magistrates' offices, the judges announced that Mr. Berlusconi was under investigation. **********The magistrates respond to suggestions they are using the investigations for political ends by saying they are simply doing a tricky job.  ""Yes, waiting for a less delicate moment could have been an idea,"" Gerardo d'Ambrosio, the deputy head of the Milan judicial team, said about the timing of the investigation of Mr. Berlusconi. ""But then we said to ourselves, 'look, prime ministers are always busy, there are always delicate moments.' And so we decided."""

""He was a hero, and a great innovator"" the front-running candidate said. **********Mr. Perez Balladares then dryly dismissed the departing President, Guillermo Endara, as ""bright, but incompetent."" His harshest words were reserved, though, for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the dictator who followed General Torrijos and who was overthrown in 1989 by a United States invasion. His onetime association with General Noriega is the biggest threat to his candidacy. **********""Noriega was an opportunist, a traitor and a disgrace to the country,"" said Mr. Perez Balladares, 46, a wealthy businessman whose tall and heavy build has earned him the nickname Toro, or bull. The Man to Beat **********Mr. Perez Balladares has inherited the mantle of the political party that was controlled by Panama's last two military leaders. But while most Panamanians might agree with his views on General Torrijos and Mr. Endara, many it seems are unable to forget his links with General Noriega. **********With Mr. Perez Balladares considered the narrow favorite in a crowded field in this country's first presidential campaign since the American intervention, his rivals are honing their political knives to insure that the Noriega tag cuts. **********Roberto Eisenmann, publisher of La Prensa, Panama's largest newspaper, said Mr. Perez Balladares was the man to beat in the elections due in May. ""There are two theses out there,"" he said. ""The first says that the other parties are too divided and too late to challenge him. The other says that all of his baggage on human rights abuses, corruption and all of the other junk that the dictatorship brought with it will eventually bring him down."" **********Mr. Perez Balladares has never been accused of taking part in the Noriega era's worst abuses. But his indirect association with the dictator as campaign manager for Carlos Duque, the army-backed candidate for President in the 1989 elections, nonetheless left a bad taste for many. **********In recent political advertisements, two of Mr. Perez Balladares's opponents have broadcast pictures of him with General Noriega. The Panamanian news media, meanwhile, have begun discussing the consequences of a victory by General Noriega's party, with many expressing concern that it would mean a revival of the military as a potent force in politics. **********""I can't even remember when that picture was taken,"" Mr. Perez Balladares said of the snapshot with General Noriega that some of his opponents are using. ""Everyone here has a picture with Noriega. He was a fact of political life in Panama for quite some time. But it would be stupid after going through all that we have been through to think that I would bring back any kind of military force."" **********Mostly, though, Mr. Perez Balladares ignores the attempts to sully him, charging with gusto through an intense program of campaign appearances, many of them in the interior, where there is widespread poverty. Despite his wealth, he has sought to adopt the Torrijos image as a redeemer of the common man. **********Like Mr. Perez Balladares, most of his electoral opponents are the standard-bearers of political groupings that conjure up images of the past. **********The striking exception is Ruben Blades, the Hollywood actor and salsa singer, who returned to his native land to mount a quirky -- but for many refreshing -- campaign at the head of Papa Egoro, a name taken from the local Indian language that means Mother Earth. While English-speaking fans of the singer make his name sound like the working parts of knives, here it is pronounced BLAH-dess in Spanish style. **********Using an eclectic blend of idealistic creeds, from the environmental emphasis of Europe's Green parties to a nondoctrinaire sort of rural socialism, Mr. Blades's candidacy has caught the imagination of many with its emphasis on popular participation and decentralization of government. **********For all of his appeal though, the popular singer and longtime expatriate has been a strangely disinterested candidate. After appearing to be the popular favorite in the months-long run-up to the campaign, Mr. Blades has recently dropped out of the lead in most opinion polls. **********""I refuse to do what other politicians do, which is to barge into neighborhoods they have never been to before with TV crews and sycophants in tow to prove that they are men of the people,"" Mr. Blades said in an interview in the apartment he recently moved to on the edge of this city's colonial Casco Viejo quarter. ""This discipline and respect for Panama has confused some people."" **********But some say that the main problem is money. In stark contrast to Mr. Perez Balladares's bustling, air-conditioned campaign offices, Papa Egoro's headquarters are dusty and sparely furnished. Hand-printed fliers on the walls solicit donations for the purchase of a neon campaign sign and for trash barrels to put outside. **********Mr. Eisenmann, the publisher of La Prensa, said that Mr. Blades could be husbanding his scant resources for an intense last-minute push. **********Asked what he thought of Mr. Blades, Mr. Perez Balladares, with a chuckle that seemed to reflect the hope that his appraisal would remain accurate for some time to come, said only, ""He is a singer."""

The market's performance reflected investors' hopes that Mr. Hata, a moderate conservative, can stabilize the country's fractured political order and help pull the economy out of recession. **********Share prices bobbed nervously throughout the day today because of the political uncertainty but generally held their gains. **********Parliament is not expected to vote until early next week, but opposition to Mr. Hata has begun to die down, along with the squabbling that has wracked the governing coalition since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced on Friday that he intended to resign. **********Mr. Hata, 58, does not have Mr. Hosokawa's oratorical skills or sense of mission, and he has not yet won the support of all the political leaders and factions that he needs to wrap up the election. Pragmatism Welcomed **********Nevertheless, Mr. Hata's knack for getting things done and his experience in the back rooms of Parliament, where legislative battles here are settled, were welcomed by a country seemingly eager for pragmatism over flair. In addition, he appears likely to hold the ruling coalition together, forestalling at least for now a more sweeping and tumultuous reorganization of the political order. **********The 225-stock Nikkei index rocketed up Wednesday by 412.08 points, or 2.1 percent, and closed the day at 20,060.41. At the close today, the market was down 73.21 points, or 0.36 percent, to 19,987.20. The market is now back to its level of three weeks ago, when nasty political infighting and a personal financial scandal began to push Mr. Hosokawa out of office. **********""The market breathed a sigh of relief,"" said Kathy Matsui, stock market strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. ""The political question mark has been set aside. And as far as the market is concerned, any step toward the right politically is a good thing."" **********Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, reflected what appears to be a certainty among many analysts that Mr. Hata will be installed. **********""The choice of Hata means there won't be an election for a new parliament right away, which is what many people were afraid of,"" he said. ""We'll probably have a little better direction for the economy."" **********If chosen for the job, Mr. Hata's first order of business is expected to be enactment of a long-delayed budget for the fiscal year that began April 1. That budget includes big increases in public works spending and a tax reduction to stimulate the economy. **********He is also seen as likely to develop an economic deregulation program in an effort to mend Japan's tattered trade relations with the United States. These goals hearten most Japanese, even though Mr. Hosokawa made little progress with them. **********""Mr. Hata is a very pragmatic person,"" Satsuki Eda, a member of the coalition and the current head of the Science and Technology Agency, said in an interview. 'Probably the Best Person' **********""He is a pure politician,"" Mr. Eda said. ""That may be regarded by some people as old-fashioned, and he is typically Japanese in that he doesn't say things clearly and so on. But he's quite good at managing things. As for United States-Japan relations, be's probably the best person in this situation."" **********Mr. Eda, who heads a small party, added, ""Mr. Hosokawa paved a very rough road. That means Mr. Hata will be able to push forward a little more easily."" **********Of course, no one expects instant solutions to the country's deep economic and political maladies, just greater effectivness than Mr. Hosokawa displayed. And Mr. Hata's innate conservatism suggests he would not work for bold or dramatic changes, as Mr. Hosokawa had. **********The first problem is the coalition, an odd combination of Socialists and conservatives who defected last year from the Liberal Democratic Party. Bitter personal feuds almost split the party after Mr. Hosokawa said he was quitting last Friday because of financial scandals. **********It is unlikely that, even if most coalition members throw their support behind Mr. Hata, the deep differences will heal quickly. Thus, any difficult issue that comes up, particularly the sensitive question of how far Japan would be willing to go to halt North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program, could provoke a return of the paralyzing divisions. **********In addition, Mr. Hata would have only until July, when the Group of Seven industrialized nations summit takes place in Naples, to come up with a satisfactory program of deregulation and market opening measures to cut Japan's trade surpluses. **********Mr. Hata has never proven himself overly pliant in the hands of American trade negotiators. Indeed, he is the one who argued several years ago that Japan could not import American beef because it did not suit the unique Japanese digestive system. **********But he generally favors strong relations with Washington and has demonstrated before his ability to come up with compromise agreements."

Even as he was on the phone discussing the problem with his boss, Andrew S. Grove, the president and chief executive of Intel, a message was coming out of Mr. Otellini's home facsimile machine, his computer was receiving electronic mail and his cellular phone was ringing. It was at that moment, he said, that his wife threw up her hands and walked out of the room. **********""I thought to myself, 'Thank God, I don't have another phone line,' "" he said. **********As plugged in as they were, Intel officials were out of touch with the new consumer market they had cultivated. They had based a big advertising campaign on the ""Intel Inside"" theme, seeking to make their chips a household name. **********Inside Intel, however, the officials had not prepared themselves for the new obligations and responsibilities that came with being a consumer-products company. The story of the last month at Intel is one of the re-education of a high-technology company. **********One immediate result of the teleconferencing after Thanksgiving was that Mr. Grove composed an apology to be posted on a computer bulletin board on the Internet. On that web, Intel was under broad attack for not having disclosed the Pentium's problems when the company discovered them last summer. **********Because he was at home and had no direct Internet access, Mr. Grove asked an Intel scientist, Richard Wirt to post his message from Mr. Wirt's home computer network account. But because it bore Mr. Wirt's electronic address, the note's authenticity was challenged, which only added to the fury of the Internet attacks on Intel. **********At 8 A.M. the following Monday, inside the company's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Intel officials set to work on the crisis the way they attacked all large problems -- like an engineering problem, Mr. Otellini recalled. **********""It was a classic Intellian approach to solving any big problem,"" he said. ""We broke it down into smaller parts; that was comforting."" **********During the following days the committee grew to several dozen Intel employees, drawn from all parts of the company. Each day there would be an hourlong meeting beginning at 8 A.M. During those sessions, participants received stacks of photocopies of the day's newspaper articles about the Pentium problem, and company officials were briefed from reports culled from Intel's sales representatives and from the customer hotline that had been set up. **********The executives would then adjourn, devoting the rest of the workday to Intel's regular business. But each afternoon at 5 o'clock, another meeting would be convened and those went much longer -- sometimes well into the night. **********Throughout the next two weeks, the company continued to believe that its customers were listening to its explanation that the Pentium's computational errors were so infrequent that ordinary users did not need to worry. **********Mr. Grove was struck by the way some of his best customers -- large computer retailers and manufacturers -- formed ranks and expressed their solidarity with the embattled company. **********""I don't normally talk with managers of retail chains as a matter of course,"" he said in an interview today. ""But several of them called me to offer reassurance and advice and give me pep talks."" **********By the end of the second week it looked to the officials as if they had turned a corner on the crisis. The number of phone calls to the hot line was falling. **********Then disaster struck again. On Monday, Nov. 12, the International Business Machines Corporation abruptly announced that its own researchers had determined that the Pentium flaw would lead to division errors much more frequently than Intel had indicated. I.B.M. said it was suspending shipments of its personal computers containing the Pentium chip. **********Mr. Grove was stunned. The head of I.B.M.'s PC division, Richard Thoman, had given him no advance warning. A facsimile from Mr. Thoman arrived at Intel's headquarters on Monday morning after the I.B.M. announcement, saying that he had not been able to find Mr. Grove's phone number during the weekend. **********Mr. Grove, whose telephone number is listed, was so upset that he called directory assistance twice to ask for his own number to make sure that he was reachable. **********With the I.B.M. announcement, the tide turned. A deluge of phone calls into Santa Clara from concerned Pentium customers overwhelmed the capacity of AT&T's West Coast long-distance telephone switching centers, blocking calls. **********Only then, Mr. Grove said, did he begin to realize that an engineer's approach was inappropriate for a consumer problem. **********And then, during this last weekend Mr. Grove read an opinion piece in The San Francisco Examiner, written by Thomas R. Nicely, the mathematics professor at Lynchburg College in Virginia who had first reported the Pentium problem in an Internet message on Oct. 30. In the newspaper essay, Professor Nicely concluded that he would have to tell his young students that the Pentium machines they were using were not perfect. The thought had a profound impact on Mr. Grove, an engineer trained to pursue perfection. **********""I didn't know the scope of the problem,"" Mr. Grove said. ""I didn't know until the end what the real objection was."" **********On Monday, the Intel crisis team met all day. During the meeting, marked not by yelling or screaming but by passionate discussion, the decision to change the policy on the Pentium replacements was adopted and rescinded several times. **********""Finally we decided, 'This is the right thing to do, both morally and ethically,' "" he said. The decision was announced publicly today, and will be explained, with an apology, in newspaper ads that will begin running on Wednesday. **********For Mr. Otellini, Intel's decision came as a huge relief. ""I wanted the headline of our ads to read 'Merry Christmas,' "" he said. ""But I was overruled."""

But Mr. Mai, one of the principal architects of Vietnamese-American reconciliation, took pains not to jubilate. Asked about his personal feelings about the end of the embargo, he replied: ""I think that Vietnamese matters have created many emotional issues in the United States. We, the Vietnamese, are less emotional."" **********""I think the lifting of the trade embargo may bring about many new things, or maybe very few new things, or maybe nothing new,"" the Deputy Foreign Minister said, and he indicated Vietnam's irritation at Mr. Clinton's remark, in announcing the end of the ban, that his action was ""reversible."" **********""No nation in the world,"" Mr. Mai said, ""has the right to impose a trade embargo on another nation or to threaten to reimpose an embargo."" Pledged Cooperation **********But in comments obviously designed for concord with Mr. Clinton's emphasis -- that he lifted the embargo for the sake of advancing the search for evidence of the 2,238 Americans still officially listed as missing in action -- Mr. Mai pledged Vietnam's full cooperation. **********""We will continue to cooperate fully with the United States under any political circumstances,"" he said. ""The Vietnamese people have themselves suffered sorrow and grief and share the concern of American families whose loved ones are still listed as missing from the war."" **********In a conversation before the lifting of the embargo was announced, Mr. Mai said on Thursday that many Vietnamese held unrealistic hopes for quick economic changes once trade with America became possible. Fear of Inflation **********Indeed, a staff member at the History Museum voiced caution today that the end of the embargo might bring such an inflationary economic boom that the low wages of civil servants might not keep up with a rise in prices. Most Government employees earn no more than $30 a month. **********But she also saw the value of the broadening of Vietnam's relations to include the world's leading power. ""It will protect us against invasion from the north,"" said the woman, a combat veteran of the war in South Vietnam. Her fear of China is widely shared throughout this nation. **********Tu Giay, founder and former chief of the National Institute of Nutrition, a 73-year-old veteran of the war against France and a longtime Communist, was philosophically Buddhist in welcoming the end of the embargo. **********""We come into the world only once,"" he said.

The accord calls for Hebron to be patrolled by a force of 160 lightly armed observers from Norway, Italy and Denmark. Western diplomats said the observers would start arriving in a week to 10 days. **********The pact also commits Israel to speed up the withdrawal of its troops from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, the first areas scheduled for self-rule under the agreement signed in September by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The acceptance of an international presence for Hebron was a difficult step for Israel, which has not allowed foreign observers in the occupied West Bank or Gaza since it captured those lands in the 1967 war. **********The 160 foreign observers will have no police or military duties and will not have the authority to intervene in a disturbance. It was unclear, in fact, exactly what steps the observers would take in the event of such disturbances. But the decision to deploy them drew an immediate protest from Israel's political right wing. **********""It created a precedent for international presence in Judea, Samaria and Gaza and, mainly, Jerusalem,"" said former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon of the opposition Likud party, who used the biblical names for the West Bank. ""This will worsen the security situation and will undermine our grip on Jerusalem and our ability to hold other places."" **********Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, also a member of Likud, said, ""The whole world knows that international observers mock a country's independence and sovereignty."" 'Hypocrisy and Lies' **********Hebron is not part of the territory initially scheduled for Palestinian self-rule under the settlement signed last September. The accord calls for Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho while a broader peace agreement for the occupied territories is negotiated during the next three years. **********Responding to the criticism, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called on his opponents to ""stop their hypocrisy and lies"" and said that the force of foreign observers in Hebron was an ""exceptional case."" He said that Israel had agreed to it only because of the massacre in Hebron on Feb. 25, when a Jewish settler opened fire in a mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs shrine and shot to death at least 29 Muslim worshipers. At least 90 were wounded. Talks on carrying out the self-rule agreement were suspended by the Palestinians after the massacre. **********Mr. Rabin said ""Israel is paying the price"" because the killer, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, used an assault rifle provided by the Israeli Army while wearing an army uniform. 'Making Up for Lost Time' **********The text of the five-page agreement on Hebron's security commits both sides to reviving the talks on autonomy ""with an agreed agenda"" and ""the objective of making up for lost time."" **********The September accord, signed by Mr. Rabin and the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho during a four-month period beginning Dec. 13. The pullout, delayed by negotiations over details, now appears to be just weeks away. **********The document signed today said the talks on carrying out self-rule would be ""guided by the target dates"" of the accord signed in Washington, which called for the Israeli withdrawal to be completed by April 13. It also called for the gradual establishment of a Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho, beginning next week. **********Israeli Army officials said they have moved 70 percent of their equipment from Gaza. Some officials said the troops could withdraw in a few weeks or even days. **********""Nothing will be done until we sign something,"" said the chief Israeli negotiator, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak. ""The withdrawal can begin immediately after that. We don't need much time. It will all happen in a relatively short period. It could be in three weeks. It could be next week."" **********The presence of foreign observers was raised as a possibility in the September agreement, although Mr. Rabin had long opposed the idea. Until now Mr. Rabin had refused to consider any armed foreign presence in the occupied territories. **********The agreement also called for ""a temporary international or foreign presence, as agreed upon,"" for Gaza and Jericho. Seeking to capitalize on the Hebron agreement, the top Palestinian negotiator, Dr. Nabil Shaath, told reporters today that Israel should reconsider deploying foreign observers in other areas. Urgent Negotiations **********""Up until this minute the Israelis had not addressed what is an international temporary presence,"" the Palestinian negotiator said. ""Now, with the example of Hebron, it should be very easy to do the same for Gaza and Jericho."" **********Negotiators on both sides said they were working with a sense of urgency to carry out the principles on self-rule after a series of violent clashes in the occupied territories, including the killing of six P.L.O. campaigners in Gaza on Monday. **********""We will be coming and going and consulting,"" General Shahak said, ""but we will do it in a marathon session until we finish."" **********Dr. Shaath said 300 Palestinian police are to enter Gaza on Thursday to take control of at least three military installations and several police stations. The force is to be equipped with automatic rifles and eventually operate helicopters and a few armored personnel carriers. Dispute on Numbers **********Palestinian negotiators said the overall Palestinian force for the West Bank and Gaza would probably consist of 10,000 men, but Israeli delegates said the number was still under negotiation. **********The Palestinian police ""will be moving in gradually,"" said Uri Savir, an Israeli delegate to the talks. ""It is a symbol that slowly things are changing."" **********The Palestinian police will come from armed Palestinian units in countries including Egypt, Jordan and Yemen. Palestinian officials said Israeli troops are to begin to pull out from certain pockets of the West Bank to allow the police to operate. **********But P.L.O. officials said they had refused to deploy a force in Hebron, despite a tentative agreement last week to do so, because Israel had insisted on supervising it.  Force Called 'Temporary' **********The document on Hebron's security describes the 160-member international force as ""temporary"" and subject to renewal every three months.  The foreigners will wear distinctive uniforms and their vehicles will be marked. The unit will be allocated a building in Hebron and be composed of ""field observers, office staff and support personnel."" **********The observers will report to a committee in the Hebron district made up of Palestinians and Israelis. Roughly 80,000 Palestinians and 450 Israelis live in and around the town. **********The Israelis have promised the force freedom of movement except in cases of ""imperative military necessity, and then only as an exceptional and temporary measure."""

""knew that it could not initiate a price rise unless De Beers followed,"" said Max Gillam, an anti-trust lawyer in the Department of Justice who is the lead prosecutor. **********With demand for industrial diamonds depressed in 1991, G.E. and De Beers raised their prices, at times dollar for dollar, Mr. Gillam said. The price increases, he said, ""could only be done through collusion between the two companies."" **********G.E. Superabrasives, which makes synthetic industrial diamonds used in oil drilling bits and tool cutting machines, wanted to raise prices to improve profits, Mr. Gillam contended, adding that G.E. Plastics, its parent unit, was having a ""tough time making budget."" **********Daniel K. Webb, G.E.'s leading defense lawyer, maintained that G.E. Superabrasives, which has its headquarters in the Columbus suburb of Worthington, raised prices independently of De Beers. **********Any price increases were ""parallel,"" he said, a situation that he characterized as common in industries dominated by a handful of companies. G.E. and De Beers control about 90 percent of the world's $1 billion industrial diamond market. **********Mr. Webb, a former Federal lawyer involved in the Iran-contra prosecutions, will conclude his opening arguments on Wednesday. The trial could last four to six weeks. **********But Peter Frenz, labeled by both the prosecution and the defense as the most significant witness, will not testify in person. Mr. Frenz is G.E. Superabrasives' manager of industrial diamonds sales in Europe. The Government contends that Mr. Frenz passed information of G.E.'s price increases to Phillipe Liotier, who was then chief executive of Diamant Boart S.A., a Belgium tool-making company and G.E. Superabrasives' largest client. **********The Government argues that Mr. Liotier passed the information to De Beers. Diamant's parent is Sibeka, a company partly owned by De Beers. **********Mr. Webb said that Mr. Frenz considered Mr. Liotier a client and that Mr. Frenz routinely informed major customers of future price rises. **********Mr. Frenz, a German citizen, would not come to the United States to answer charges, for fear of being arrested.

Tries to Redefine Itself for a New World","After Half a Century, the U.N. Tries to Redefine Itself for a New World"," **********The United Nations, which opens its 49th General Assembly session on Tuesday, is heading into a year of unusual scrutiny as diplomats, bureaucrats, scholars and a throng of increasingly powerful nongovernmental pressure groups are prodding the vast organization to reinvent itself for a world very different than the one it has known in its first half-century of life. **********The task lurks behind the celebratory hoopla planned for the coming months, when symphony orchestras and rock groups will play, thinkers will think aloud at countless seminars, dancers will dance, and children all over the world will collectively write and illustrate a book about how the United Nations looks to them. A roster of special events that have already begun and will continue into 1996 is already nine pages long. **********By contrast, the coming General Assembly session is expected to be subdued, with few explosive issues on the agenda. **********Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali calls this ""a time to rekindle the ideals of the Charter."" The aim of the United Nations Charter -- to be commemorated in San Francisco in June, 50 years after the document's signing -- was to cement a lasting peace and international well-being after devastation of World War II. **********Now, after the cold war has ended, and with it the superpower standoff that often paralyzed United Nations debate, there are more calls for the world body to turn its attention to safeguarding the planet's resources, starting with its environment and its poorest people, who are the majority and are the source of its migrant populations. **********Others suggest that the organization could move more aggressively into controlling the spread of nuclear weapons or intervening in human rights disputes before they become new ethnic wars. **********The Secretary General has said he would like to see the organization become more active in building democratic institutions, from parliaments to a free press -- as it tried to do in Cambodia -- though this would certainly lead to a dispute over national sovereignty and the limitations of the United Nations rights to interfere in domestic politics. **********There are also renewed proposals for reform and reduction in the huge international civil service the United Nations has spawned in New York, Washington, Geneva, Rome, Vienna, Bangkok, Nairobi and other cities. **********But these demands come at a time when regional conflicts preoccupy the United Nations -- causing even more appointments to be made and staffs created -- and when peacekeeping operations tax the organization's finances. **********""The developing countries say that the agenda for peace is consuming too much time,"" said Stanley Kalpage, Sri Lanka's chief delegate. ""They want an agenda for development."" **********Small nations also fear the precedent of military intervention by bigger powers acting under United Nations sanction. **********There seems to be broad agreement that the support of the United States is critical if the United Nations is to become more than an international police agency carrying out punitive expeditions against rogue governments. **********""Peacekeeping, which has all the financing -- and all the heartaches -- will take up all the attention,"" said Shirin Tahir-Kheli, a fellow with the Woodrow Wilson School of International Affairs at Princeton University. ""But I do think that the nuclear issue, for example, should be taken up by the United Nations, and with a fraction of the cost."" **********Ms. Tahir-Kheli, who has been director of political-military affairs and head of Near East and South Asian affairs on the National Security Council, said only the United States has ""the clout, the stakes and the relationships"" to force this issue in places like India and Pakistan, where local conciliation has always failed and the fear of nuclear war is always present. **********""From the 1950's, the United States has been vibrantly active in the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, and at least in part the success of the I.A.E.A. is very much a testament to our staying the course,"" she said in an interview from Islamabad, Pakistan, during a visit to South Asia. ""But that's a technical agency. We have been very reluctant to become involved politically."" New Attitude  High Marks For Clinton **********As the new General Assembly approaches, a variety of diplomats at the United Nations say they like what they have seen of the Clinton Administration. **********""We are not always sure whether Clinton will move this way or that way, or whether he will move at all, but the feeling is that the Clinton Administration is much better than its predecessors at the U.N.,"" an Asian delegate said. He added that this change in the American attitude could not have come at a more propitious time. **********President Clinton, who is to address the General Assembly on Sept. 26, can point to a series of policy changes. Congress has released about $1.2 billion to pay some of Washington's peacekeeping bills. **********American officials, led by Timothy E. Wirth, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, have made a point of listening to the concerns of developing nations and working to build consensus on issues of importance to them and to the Islamic world. This was demonstrated at the recent conference on population in Cairo, where American delegates won praise from former critics on many issues. **********Steven A. Dimoff, editor of Washington Weekly Report, which monitors Congressional action affecting international organizations, said there were indications that Mr. Clinton might formally announce that the United States would return to to Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency from which it withdrew under President Reagan. **********The agency, which was widely accused of mismanagement, corruption and undermining the free flow of news and information, has since been reformed under a new Director General, Federico Mayor of Spain. But returning to Unesco, which is based in Paris, could cost Washington more than $50 million a year. **********""Everybody in the Administration loves Unesco, but nobody can find the money to get us back in,"" said Mr. Dimoff, whose newsletter is published by the United Nations Association. Old Mistrust  United Nations Still a Hard Sell **********Points of friction remain, among them concerns among American diplomats that Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has thrust himself to the forefront of too much United Nations activity, not always consulting the Security Council, which has assumed a major role in world affairs since the collapse of the Soviet Union. **********Some American officials argue that it is harder to sell the idea of more American participation in the United Nations if a single figure is perceived to be towering over the President. Mr. Boutros-Ghali has announced that he will seek another five-year term in office after 1996. **********Mr. Dimoff agrees that if the Clinton Administration is friendlier to the United Nations, the same can still not be said of many members of Congress and the American public. **********""The legacy of the 1970's still haunts the policymakers' views,"" he said. ""They define the U.N. by the experiences of the 70's, when contentious debates led to polarization."" **********He said teaching about the United Nations appears to have fallen off in American schools; he recently found only one reference to the organization in an 11th-grade history textbook. The United Nations Association is directing its special publicity efforts toward children in the anniversary year. The Future  New Alliances Are Forming **********As the United Nations moves into its next half-century, old alliances are in flux and new ones are forming within the organization. **********""I think the emergence of the European Union is very important to this process,"" said Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, United States delegate to the United Nations in the Reagan Administration and who now teaches French politics at Georgetown University. ""It is more important than I think Americans have generally understood it to be, and I think it has big consequences for us in multilateral institutions like the U.N. **********""The European Union has developed institutions for reaching agreed consensus positions on issues before they come to a discussion of those issues with the United States, or before they come to discussion in U.N. arenas,"" she said in a recent interview. In effect, she added, this will mean a solid bloc of votes not subject to division by American persuasion on issues where in the past a few European nations might have sided with Washington. **********""It's going to be a shock to Americans to find that our best friends, the countries with whom we have been most closely associated in all these arenas, will be committed to positions almost written in stone,"" Dr. Kirkpatrick said. **********Diplomats and nongovernmental organizations working with United Nations agencies echo those conclusions. At the population conference in Cairo, some groups bemoaned the loss of independent Scandinavian voices that could have been counted on to take more liberal positions than nations of southern Europe. **********But if Europe is coalescing, the developing nations are in disarray, having lost the support of Moscow in confrontations with the richer industrialized countries. **********""The unity of the Nonaligned Movement, the unity of the G-77 is not there,"" said Dr. Kalpage, Sri Lanka's chief delegate. ""These countries are building their policies on bilateral ties with more powerful nations or with the international lending organizations -- the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund."" **********Sri Lanka was a founding member of both the Nonaligned Movement, which often sided with the Soviet bloc, and the Group of 77 (now with 134 members), which concentrated on economic and social problems in the third world, often demanding compensation from the West. **********Third world organizations are not only weaker after the cold war, Dr. Kalpage said, but are also threatened by the economic demands of Eastern Europe and the new countries created by the breakup of the Soviet Union. **********""The countries that call themselves economies in transition are vying for funds in every agency,"" he said. ""On any issue they want to be mentioned. This is causing problems for developing countries."" **********The United Nations is going to try to address the problems of world poverty and the development of human resources at a conference that is to be attended by heads of state in March in Copenhagen. **********Diplomats from developing nations say that the Russians have all but disappeared from view after decades of courting third world support with a variety of enticements. **********""Now Moscow goes out of its way to support the United States,"" Dr. Kalpage said. ""Or they speak for the economies in transition. They don't come around to us. They are not heard much. Their presence is diminished."""

""I came here to make contacts."" **********Almost every week, there is some kind of business seminar going on in Moscow. And on any day, the finer hotels like the Metropole are filled with Western consultants who flock to the former Soviet Union, many on all-expenses-paid ego trips, courtesy of any number of well-meaning foundations. There are as many missionaries roaming across Russia; some 1,000 have come seeking to make converts over the last three years. **********But it is less common to find Western businessmen in Russia trying to serve God and mammon at once. **********""This is a mission for us,"" explained Randy Troyer, a Mennonite businessman who manages the Amish Kitchen Restaurant in Wilmot, Ohio. He, like the six other Canadians and Americans, and unlike so many Western consultants, paid his own way to the sober, frills-free seminar, which was held in a vast, gloomy ballroom of the 10,000-room Ismailovo Hotel in northeast Moscow. There are slot machines in the lobby and no Gideon Bibles in the rooms. **********The Mennonites, like the Amish, are a branch of the Anabaptists, and they have a 200-year history in Russia. Long persecuted by the Communists, fewer than 15,000 remain, scattered in remote farming settlements in Siberia and Kazakhstan. Many North American Mennonites have Russian ancestors. ""We don't expect to receive anything,"" Mr. Troyer said. ""We want to help these people by sharing our knowledge."" **********THE Russians, who paid $90 to participate, were owners or managers of small new businesses, mostly in Moscow. But Tatyana A. Khramova, managing director of the Kanikuly travel agency in Tomsk, rode a train for three days from Siberia to attend. **********And while many practical sessions were scheduled on subjects like how to run a bed and breakfast and the dos and don'ts of franchising, one lesson all of the panelists were determined to share was that money alone cannot buy happiness. **********""How many friends did you lose after you gained your first million?"" is how Dr. Aleksandr S. Zaichenko put it. Dr. Zaichenko is president of the Moscow-based Association of Christians in Business in Russia, co-sponsor of the seminar. **********A former economics adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev during perestroika (he was secretly baptized in his bathtub in the 1970's), Dr. Zaichenko is also the founder of Moscow's Club for Fair and Ethical Business. He conceded that membership there was select, given the sometimes fast and loose ethics ruling Russian business today. ""We try to find a moral approach to business,"" he explained wryly. ""But that is not the way it is working here actually."" **********Most Moscow restaurants, for example, do not exactly live up to the principles set by Mr. Troyer's Amish Kitchen. Mr. Troyer had planned to speak on how to run a restaurant effectively at the Friday session, but didn't bring notes on protection money, cash skimming and bribes. **********Restaurants here are the absolute symbol of corruption in our society,"" Dr. Zaichenko said, adding that criminal gangs controlled most restaurants in urban Russia. ""They are horrible, evil, full of nouveaux riches,"" he said. ""I try to avoid going to them."" **********There were other areas of confusion. Thrainn Kristjansson of Winnipeg, Manitoba, runs three theme restaurants. The fluent, BBC-accented Russian translator ran into difficulty explaining the mock-medieval theme of Mr. Kristjansson's Round Table restaurant, pronouncing it to be a ""seminar-oriented"" eatery. When Mr. Roth said he offered his motel guests free papers, meaning newspapers, the translator said he gave them free toilet paper. **********And when Mr. Roth was asked about how he rebuked bad employees, he recommended a positive approach. ""We talk to them discreetly in private, then we try to find something they excel at, like maybe they smile real good."" The translator rendered that as, ""Maybe the employee smiles too much, and the guests don't like it."" **********The power of positive thinking did not inspire all of the participants. **********""Yes, of course: be polite to customers,"" Olga V. Kartashova, president of Visit, a tourism agency in Yaroslavl, said. ""That is obvious. But for us today, there are so many more important issues -- like obtaining visas, or transport when there is none."" **********Vernon Wiebe, owner of the Prudent Travel and Tours company in Hillsboro, Kan., swapped shop talk with Russian tour operators over a lunch of meatballs and rice. **********Russia, he learned, is not quite like Kansas. ""It is hard to know how to talk to them,"" Mr. Wiebe said. ""It's easy for me to say that I started with just a shoebox and built a business."" He paused, and added gamely, ""It must be possible here too, but they will have to be awfully ingenious and creative."" **********The Dale Carnegie spirit did not filter down to the staff of the Ismailovo Hotel. Instead, Christopher Shore, the young, fresh-faced Moscow-based representative of the Mennonite organization, received a lesson in how paid hospitality can sometimes falter even in the new Russia. ""I just can't believe they don't have a sound system,"" he exclaimed after politely reasoning with a coolly indifferent hotel manager. ""Somebody is not asking the right people."" Dr. Zaichenko delicately tried to explain the Russian system. ""They just don't care,"" he said. **********But Mr. Shore, a determined young man, went home during the lunch break to fetch his own stereo system. He returned dejected after an unsuccessful search of 10 stores for a microphone. ""I was willing to spend $500,"" he said incredulously. ""You'd think someone around here would want to make some money."""

(He's Ready, of Course)","Profile; Utility Competition Is Coming! (He's Ready, of Course)"," **********AS the 45-story stacks of the giant Gibson generating station loomed into view amid the cornfields and woods here in southwestern Indiana, James E. Rogers looked down from the helicopter and said, ""Thank God I've got smart people running this."" **********Mr. Rogers, at 47, is vice chairman and president of the Cinergy Corporation, a holding company for two Midwest utilities. But he makes no pretense of being a technical expert, having spent most his career as a lawyer, at one time fighting the utility industry on behalf of consumers. **********What he lacks in knowledge of generators and transmission lines, though, he more than makes up in strategic savvy. And he is not content merely to transform his own utility to keep up with the times. He is out to lead the charge as the industry changes -- and simultaneously jockey for position in the new world he is sure is coming. **********""This is really an exciting time in our industry,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""We're going to be forced to reinvent ourselves."" **********Utilities have lived in a sheltered world, safe from competitive pressures. Each has its own captive customers, its rates dictated by local regulators, rarely by the market. **********But state regulators and Federal agencies are starting to chip away at the walls between these cozy domains, hoping to spur competition and bring rates down. And as Mr. Rogers sees it, other utilities are just sitting and waiting for those walls to crumble, but he has started swinging the wrecking ball himself. **********He has a solid base. Cinergy, created by the recent merger of Cincinnati Gas and Electric and PSI Energy, is now the nation's 13th-largest utility, serving 1.3 million electric customers. **********In 1990, as chairman of PSI, he did something unheard of, throwing open his transmission system to any utility that wanted to sell wholesale power over it -- enabling customers like towns and cities that had bought most of their power from PSI to shop around for electricity when their contracts ran out. **********That would seem a no-win gamble, for PSI could only lose customers, with no way to replace them. But Mr. Rogers took a longer view. In fact, he is now taking an even bigger gamble, having just offered industrial customers -- which rarely have contracts -- the same competitive freedom. **********When the walls do come down, he insists, he will be ready. The steps he has taken already give him access to a wider market -- and put pressure on other utilities to open themselves to competition, too, or be left behind. **********Mr. Rogers hopes to extend his reach to the East Coast eventually, positioning himself to raid utilities in states like New York, where customers are fed up with high rates. **********""We are going to be able to take advantage when the market cracks open because of our low cost position,"" he said with quiet assurance, in a drawl left over from his small-town Kentucky upbringing. He leaned back in his chair, dressed in khakis and a denim shirt -- a style he favors since he put in an informal dress code in the spring of 1993 to ease some office pressure during a bitter takeover battle. **********Mr. Rogers, tall with graying hair, likes to take long bicycle rides seeking out the hilly parts of the mostly flat terrain around Plainfield, Ind., where PSI is based. **********HE spoke with relish of the challenge as he flew over some of the 25,000 square miles in Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio covered by the two utilities. **********He may not be familiar with the nuts and bolts of Gibson station, one of the nation's largest coal-fired plants, but he has spent time as an executive in the gas industry and as a lawyer in Washington coping with deregulation. **********""He's a catalyst for change within the industry,"" said Vicki Bailey, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who had dealings with Mr. Rogers when she served on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. ""He likes to take the lead in front of the parade,"" she said. ""He definitely does not seem to be afraid of the new competitive era that we're going into."" **********He was recruited in 1988 by PSI, which serves a large part of Indiana, with a mandate to shore up the severely weakened utility, and the steps he and his staff have taken since then are regarded as heretical for an industry that grew up under strict regulation and regional monopolies. **********""There is fertile ground in the Midwest for a competitive model that may be ultimately adopted both on the East and West coasts,"" he said. **********Opening his system was a risk he was willing to take to get a vital break from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which shares jurisdiction over utilities with state agencies. **********The commission enabled his utility to be the first to break free from its tight regulatory grip and negotiate long-term contracts to sell power. **********While PSI has not yet used that right, because a surplus has enabled customers to get cheap power under short-term deals, Mr. Rogers is looking ahead to the days when the surpluses dry up. **********By then, he said, his staff will have the experience to enable them to move quickly and know the needs of customers, which he predicts will be eager for long-term contracts. **********And then, he said, the two utilities will be able to sell their low-cost power at a greater profit than by allowing prices to be set through regulation. **********While regulators in California and other states have proposed putting in a system in the future to allow industrial customers to shop for power, no utility except Cinergy is doing it voluntarily. **********Mr. Rogers's reasoning: the industry is bound to change, so why keep them captive? Why not learn now to cope with competition? ""How do you convince a customer that you are the best choice for their electric supplier,"" he asks, ""if you fought until the last dog was dead to keep out competitors?"" **********He has won some admirers among his colleagues. ""Rather than resist the approaching change, or try to stuff the genie back in the bottle, Jim is using his energy to dramatically reshape the way his company will do business,"" said Stanley T. Skinner, president and chief executive of Pacific Gas and Electric, the nation's largest utility. ""The customer is going to be relentless in pushing open markets,"" he said, which will force regulators to act. **********Compared with utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric, Con Edison and others with high rates, Cinergy has been dealt a strong hand that enables Mr. Rogers to gamble more than others. **********Before completing the merger this month, PSI was already a strong utility with some of the lowest rates in the country. **********Because it uses mainly local coal and burns it efficiently in older plants that are basically paid for, PSI's average generating cost, for example, is 2.1 cents a kilowatt hour, compared with a Midwest average of 3.1 cents -- and 6.2 cents in the Northeast. **********""There is little chance that someone can come here and take away a significant customer,"" said Randle L. Smith, a utility analyst for Duff & Phelps Investment Research. **********The big uncertainty is whether the industry will deregulate fast enough. ""What's hard to figure out is how to create the most value when it cracks open,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""I want to be fast and agile, and I'm thinking of going in a number of directions."" **********There are no sacred cows. Just because Cinergy is a low-cost producer, it may not always make sense to hold onto its generating plants, which could be spun off, leaving the utility as a distributor. **********WHEN Mr. Rogers came to PSI in October 1988 from the Enron Corporation, where he was an executive vice president, he could not be so free-wheeling. PSI was tottering and faced the possibility of having to file for bankruptcy protection. **********The previous management had poured $2.7 billion into building a nuclear plant that was later abandoned because of huge cost overruns. This burdened PSI with a huge debt, with interest payments only partially recoverable through higher rates. **********Mr. Rogers spent his first couple of years working on the turnaround. He worked out a compromise with state regulators under which the utility was guaranteed that it could pass through to customers most of the huge costs in meeting the stricter standards of the Clean Air Act. **********Since PSI has mostly coal-fired plants, it faced one of the nation's most expensive clean-up programs -- but those costs are mainly behind it. **********While he can banter with workers and has an easy manner, Mr. Rogers can also be steely, as when he battled back a hostile bid made last year for PSI by Indianapolis Power and Light. **********Mr. Rogers had his first taste at entrepreneurship in the small town of Danville, Ky., where his father was a laborer for the Southern Railroad. When he was 12, his father set him to work sticking labels on barrels of a solvent he had put together to plug leaks in car radiators. At 16, he was selling the solvent to local gasoline stations. **********The experience, he recalled, taught him to be fast on his feet and persistent -- qualities that came in handy when he was in law school at the University of Kentucky. By then, at 23, he was married and had three children. ""I got a fast start,"" he said. **********He now lives with his second wife, Mary Anne, who is active as a volunteer in the local museum and ballet, in a suburb of Indianapolis. **********He recalled that while in law school he was desperate for a job. After working in a funeral home he got up enough courage to see an editor at The Lexington Herald Leader to ask to become a rewrite man. **********When the editor told him he had no experience, he countered, ""Look, you can train me the way you want."" He got the job. James E. Rogers   Born: Sept. 20, 1947; Birmingham, Ala.  Education: B.S. and law degree, University of Kentucky.  Drives: Jeep Wagoneer.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/15/business/company-reports-food-giant-will-split-operations.html,Barnaby Feder,1994-12-15,,806,,The New York Times,Business Day,Statistics,article,Food Giant Will Split Operations,COMPANY REPORTS; Food Giant Will Split Operations," **********General Mills Inc., the cereal company that during the 1980's became one of the nation's leading restaurateurs, said late today that it would split into two companies when its chairman and chief executive, H. Brewster Atwater Jr., retires next June. **********The General Mills name and its food products, including Cheerios, Hamburger Helper, Betty Crocker cake mixes, Gorton's seafoods and Yoplait yogurt, will remain in the company's headquarters in Minneapolis and be run by Stephen W. Sanger, who is currently president. **********The restaurant group, which includes the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and China Coast chains, will take on a new name and a new listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Its headquarters will be at the current base in Orlando, Fla., under the leadership of Joe R. Lee, who is now vice chairman of the company. **********""This is a continuation of what we have done since I took over"" in 1981, said Mr. Atwater, who is 63 and has spent much of his time reversing the company's wild acquisition binge of the 1970's. He noted that General Mills at one time had been in diverse businesses like chemicals, toys, stamp collecting and fashion clothing retailing. **********""Our growth rates have expanded every time we tightened our focus,"" Mr. Atwater said. **********General Mills also reported an increase of 6 percent in earnings for its fiscal second quarter, to $149.2 million, or 95 cents a share, from $140.7 million, or 88 cents, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales gained about 1 percent, to $2.2 billion. The results were in line with analysts' expectations. **********The General Mills food company is expected to have sales of $5.5 billion in the fiscal year ending on May 28. The new restaurant enterprise, which will be the world's largest sit-down service, is projected to have revenues of $3.2 billion. General Mills began operating the two businesses as if they were independent today, Mr. Atwater said. **********Shareholders of General Mills will receive one share in the restaurant company for each General Mills share they hold when the legal split occurs. The transaction is expected to be tax-free. **********""One important reason for doing this now is that the restaurant group, for the first time, is big enough and is generating enough cash to fund its own growth,"" Mr. Atwater said. He said he would join the restaurant company's board of directors, but would retire completely from General Mills next summer. **********Wall Street was enthusiastic about the plan, which was announced after trading had closed on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of General Mills rose $2.50, to $58. Many analysts had suggested for years that the businesses should be separated. **********The move also provides a way to harness the talents of both Mr. Sanger, who is 48, and Mr. Lee, who is 53. Mr. Lee is respected in the restaurant business, but had lost out to Mr. Sanger in the race to succeed Mr. Atwater. **********""It's the best news in a long time for this company,"" said Robert J. Cummins, who follows General Mills for Wertheim Schroder. Mr. Cummins said the stock of General Mills, which now trades at less than 14 times projected earnings, should climb closer to that of its archrival, the Kellogg Company, which trades at about 17 times projected earnings. Moreover, he said, good restaurant chains trade at higher multiples than food companies. **********But others said the restaurant business might not be warmly received early on. China Coast, a Chinese food chain, has stumbled so badly that General Mills recently announced plans to put an expansion plan on hold next year until service problems were ironed out. And Olive Garden, the Italian food chain, failed to meet profit expectations in the last year. **********In announcing its second-quarter earnings, General Mills said that operating earnings for its 1,189 restaurants were down 3 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. The food businesses reported a gain of 8 percent, with Cheerios regaining market share lost earlier in the year. **********""Valuations for restaurants in general are low at the moment,"" said John McMillan, who follows General Mills for Prudential Securities. ""It's not a great time for launching the business from that perspective, but it's good for shareholders in the long term."" **********Mr. Atwater said that splitting the company into two businesses would allow General Mills to link executive compensation more closely with stock performance. The company's traditional businesses will have a goal of 12 percent in earnings per share growth; the restaurant business will have a 15 percent target. Both groups fell well short in the fiscal year that ended in May, and during the first half of the current year."

But he departed from his prepared text to say in Arabic that the violence ""strikes at the heart of the peace process"" he has embarked upon with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. **********""These actions are unfortunately directed only against innocent people,"" he said. ""And these innocent people are on both sides, Palestinians and Israelis."" **********Mr. Arafat, however, also blamed Israel for contributing to a thickening air of violence by what he called a ""policy of mass killings, detention, imposing curfews and isolating towns."" **********Israeli officials did not comment directly on the P.L.O. leader's statements; many were so incensed by his silence last week that whatever he said today was of little consequence to them. **********But as expected, Mr. Rabin insisted that terrorism would not deflect him from the course he has charted with the P.L.O., despite renewed demands from the opposition that he call off talks with Palestinians immediately. **********""This latest abomination is a reminder that we're not engaged in a peace process but a terror process,"" Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party, said. **********Similar anti-Government cries echoed through the steamy streets of Hadera, where dozens of protesters denounced the Prime Minister, calling him a ""traitor,"" describing him with obscenities and in a few instances singing, ""Baruch, King of Israel."" The reference was to Dr. Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler whose massacre of 29 Muslims in Hebron on Feb. 25 was the seminal event in the latest cycle of Palestinian-Israeli violence. **********Still, Mr. Rabin held his ground and said negotiations with the P.L.O. would go on, even as they passed what was supposed to have been an important milestone -- the full withdrawal today of Israeli forces and a transfer of self-rule to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. But negotiators have several more weeks of hammering out details before them, and so today came and went without significant political change, except perhaps for deepened Palestinian frustration and Israeli anger. **********""Even today, Israelis have paid with their lives, taken by despicable murderers, enemies of peace,"" Mr. Rabin said at annual Memorial Day ceremonies in Jerusalem. ""They are trying to torpedo the peace. Beyond the bloodshed, the booby-trapped cars and the bombs, we continue to hold out our hands for peace in order to put an end to the suffering. In spite of the difficulties, we will continue on our way to peace."" Several Soldiers Killed **********Those killed today were not immediately identified, but they included several soldiers, a fact that increased the shock for Israelis as they paused to remember their war dead. **********The somberness of the day gave way to ceremonies tonight marking the 46th anniversary of the country's founding. But the celebrations were muted for many, not only because of the latest attack but also because of warnings from the Hamas group of Islamic militants that more horror was on the way in one of the worst terrorist waves inside Israel in years.  Hamas took responsibility for both the Afula and Hadera bombings. **********To forestall attacks, the Government has banned Palestinians' entry into Israel for the last week, a sealing-off of the occupied territories that officials say could continue for weeks and perhaps even months. The fact that the attack took place nonetheless in Hadera, which is near the Mediterranean coast about 30 miles north of Tel Aviv, was an embarrassment for Mr. Rabin, although he cautioned that no territorial closing was ""foolproof"" against committed terrorists. **********Tonight, he said he would transfer some forces guarding Jewish settlements to reinforce the line separating Israel and the West Bank. **********Hamas, an acronym in Arabic for the Islamic Resistance Movement, has threatened a total of five reprisal attacks for the Hebron massacre, including one that supposedly will turn Israel's Independence Day celebrations on Thursday ""into hell."" An armed wing of Hamas said in Amman, Jordan, that there would be three more attacks. **********""We decided that our response would be in five stages, every one making the Zionists and settlers cry blood on their dead,"" it said in a statement. **********There certainly were tears in Hadera, where, according to the police, an unidentified Hamas man boarded a crowded bus with explosives strapped to his body. **********Survivors from the bus, which had come from Afula and was bound for Tel Aviv, say that as it sat in the station someone spotted a black bag on a nearby bench -- cause for alarm in security-conscious Israel. As the driver went to examine the bag, the explosion occurred on the bus, mostly affecting those in the back part. **********Rachel Mualem, who works in a Hadera tour agency, heard the explosion from her seat in the middle of the bus, and turned to the man next to her, only to see him ""mangled and covered with blood."" **********""You're talking to somebody,"" said Mrs. Mualem, who suffered relatively mild wounds, ""and then you hear a boom, and they're not there."" Second Bomb Explodes **********More than an hour later, a second bomb exploded on the nearby bench, apparently in the bag that people had seen, but no was hurt. **********""I've gone through all the wars, but I've never seen anything like this,"" said Natan Itach, a man in his 50's who owns a taxi service at the bus depot and was about 10 yards from the blast. ""There was a head on one side, a hand on the other. A soldier had a big hole in his stomach. There was nothing more to do for them."" **********At 11 A.M., sirens wailed for a minute of Memorial Day remembrance. As the sirens faded, a voice called out, ""Death to Arabs!,"" and soon after Maimon Turjeman of Hadera asked, ""What kind of peace is this?"" **********""All the time we're hearing about people killed,"" he said. ""That's not peace. Why do we have to be afraid everywhere when we travel? Why don't they have this fear?"""

Stay Tuned," **********One of Britain's most familiar holiday rituals -- the annual Christmas Day television broadcast by Queen Elizabeth II -- will run up against some unexpected and, in some quarters, unwanted foreign competition next Sunday: a pre-recorded, nationwide lecture by the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the sorry state of British race relations. **********At the same time the Queen is scheduled to appear delivering her Christmas Day homily, at 3 P.M. on Channel One and Channel Three, the American civil rights campaigner will be making his own 15-minute appearance on Channel Four, one of Britain's four nationwide broadcast television networks. **********Billed by the station as an ""alternative Queen's speech,"" Mr. Jackson is appearing at the invitation of station officials, who are promoting his appearance as part of a weeklong schedule of holiday programming devoted to minority affairs and entertainment, built around the theme of celebrating a ""Black Christmas."" **********In The Times of London this morning, Mr. Jackson was quoted as saying he did not mean to undermine the Queen's annual Christmas message, nor did he intend her any disrespect, by agreeing to present his own holiday address. **********But some British politicians are already steaming over the timing of the broadcast, and accounts in British newspapers in the last two days quoting excerpts from Mr. Jackson's remarks, including an appeal to blacks and other disadvantaged groups in Britain to engage in what was described as mass political action to bring about change. **********""The lives of too many of our young people are going to waste,"" Mr. Jackson is quoted as saying.  ""The oppressed must engage in sane, sober, sensitive and disciplined resistance to their oppression."" **********Among other things, Mr. Jackson blames economic insecurity in Britain for breeding fear, which he says has contributed, in turn, to growing intolerance and racial violence, including several racially motivated killings. **********Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, was quoted as dismissing Mr.  Jackson's remarks, in an account in The Sunday Times. ""We have nothing to learn from Mr. Jesse Jackson on these issues,"" he said. Sir Ivan Lawrence, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, was even sharper. **********""It will be a broadcast surpassing impertinence by someone who doesn't have the faintest idea what he's talking about,"" Sir Ivan was quoted, in The Times. ""He should look to his own country, where racial attacks occur far more frequently than they do in this country."" **********Earlier this year, Sir Ivan's committee issued a report on race relations in Britain, concluding that ""racial attacks and harassment, and the spread of literature which preaches racial hatred, are increasing, and must be stopped."" **********A week later, Britain's Commission for Racial Equality issued another report saying that the number of racial incidents officially reported to the police have doubled in the last five years to 9,000, with a 20 percent increase last year alone. **********Like the Queen's annual message, Mr. Jackson's remarks are also pre-recorded. A spokesman for Channel Four said he taped his remarks in Washington within the last two weeks. **********This is the second year that Channel Four has promoted its own alternative to the Queen's speech.

Mr. Gault, 68, who has led Goodyear since June 1991 and presided over its resurgence in recent years, previously announced plans to retire on Dec. 31, 1994. Separately, Goodyear appointed Robert Tieken, 55, a longtime executive at the General Electric Company, as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/23/business/credit-markets-bonds-fall-as-demand-is-weak-for-new-notes.html,Robert Hurtado,1994-12-23,,798,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Bonds Fall as Demand Is Weak for New Notes,CREDIT MARKETS; Bonds Fall as Demand Is Weak for New Notes," **********Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday for the first time this week following weak demand at an auction of five-year notes. **********The price of the 30-year bond fell 3/32 of a percentage point, to 95 31/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.85 percent from 7.84 percent on Wednesday. The new yields on the two-year note, which was auctioned on Wednesday, rose 14 basis points, to 7.71 percent. The spread between the long end and the short end is now just 14 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********The narrow spread between the 2-year note and the 30-year bonds suggests increasing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again to keep inflation from accelerating as some investors accept less compensation for riskier longer-term securities. The spread was 36 basis points two weeks ago and 85 basis points a month ago.' **********Traders said the auction of the five-year issue drew a high yield of 7.85 percent, or about three basis points more than had been expected. The higher yield served as a reminder that not everybody was willing buy longer maturities with the Fed seemingly poised to raise rates again in January. **********The yield at auction was four basis points higher than last month and the highest since July 1991 when it was 7.89 percent. **********Analysts noted that some of the market's weakness could be traced in part to the continuing turmoil in the Mexican market following the devaluation of the peso on Tuesday. There was speculation that the Mexican Government was actively selling some of its United States Treasury securities to raise cash to support the peso. Such a selloff, however, could be offset by foreign investors if enough swap their holdings of Mexican debt in favor of United States notes and bills, a more liquid investment. **********James P. Fields, a vice president and portfolio manager at Wright Investors in Bridgeport, Conn., said bond yields had come down steadily since Nov. 7, when they reached a high of 8.16 percent. ""More and more, it seems like people are getting more bullish on about bonds,"" he said. **********He said that even if bond yields rose again because there were investors still concerned about inflation, the yields would still fall to about 7 percent by the end of next year. ""There are going to be some rough seas during the next couple of months, but in the longer term the rates will come back down."" **********Asked about the market performance, Mr. Fields replied, ""Today, it's not going in the direction we want."" He said he thought the problem stemmed from people who still expected a bigger premium for taking a risk on inflation, something he believes has been overblown. And then, he noted, there are always the day-to-day worries over outside events or fundamentals. ""But my guess is that the Fed will not move after its meeting next month."" **********Yesterday's only economic reports included the Government's estimate of third-quarter growth and weekly unemployment report for the week ended December 17. The Government nudged its estimate for the fourth quarter's gross domestic product up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent, in line with market expectations. The Labor Department reported unemployment up by 3,000, to 326,000. Economists had expected the number of claims to drop by 1,000. **********In the municipal market, prices were little changed for the third consecutive day amid a drop in demand from mutual funds and selling buy investors to realize year-end tax losses. **********The average yield to maturity in the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal issues remained unchanged yesterday for a third day at 6.94 percent. **********Traders in the corporate bond market said the decline in the Mexican currency made Mexico's Tepic Toll Road Trust an early casualty. The trust shelved a $300 million offering that was to fund construction of a key link in Mexico's highway system. **********While the proposed issue of notes and cash flow securities were denominated in dollars, payments on the bonds were to have come from peso-denominated toll revenues. The deal has been shelved until January at least. **********The following are the results of yesterday's five-year note auction: (000 omitted in dollar figures) High Yield . . . 7.85%  Low Yield . . . 7.76%  Median Yield . . . 7.80%  Accepted at low price . . . 42%  Total applied for . . . $24,439 098  Accepted . . . $11,011,326  Noncompetitive . . . $918,000  Interest set at . . . 7.75%  The five-year notes mature on Dec. 31, 1999."

But a bitter rivalry and a costly lawsuithave infected the two main American medical centers that cater to Moscow's growing community of expatriate Americans and newly rich Russians. **********In a competition as fierce as any against its archrival Coca-Cola, Pepsico opened a clinic in Moscow this month that is intended to compete with the services of the American Medical Center, an outpatient clinic opened in 1991. **********Its partner in the joint venture is Columbia-Presbyterian Health Services Inc., a for-profit arm of Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. American Medical contends that the Pepsico clinic committed industrial espionage trying to steal its patients. **********Until this year, American Medical held a virtual monopoly on the market. Now it faces competition not just from the Pepsico clinic but also from Mediclub, a Canadian clinic, and the International Medical Center, owned by a Swiss company that also has clinics in China and Cambodia. **********It is a battle of corporations, pitting Pepsico, which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, against the Hospital Corporation International Ltd., which is based in Stamford, Conn., and owns and operates medical centers and hospitals all over the world.  The spoils are larger than just the Moscow market. **********American Medical recently opened a branch in St. Petersburg, Russia, and plans to open similar clinics in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the Czech Republic and Poland. Pepsico and Columbia Presbyterian hope to open their U.S. Global Health clinics in Eastern Europe and Asia. **********Before Communism collapsed, the Western community in Russia was small, and mostly covered by embassy doctors or by Soviet clinics reserved for foreigners. Most Westerners needing treatment for serious illness -- or even just dental work -- left the country, mostly for Helsinki, Finland. **********Now, with hundreds of thousands of Americans, Europeans and other foreigners living and working all over the former Soviet Union, several clinics have recently opened to meet the demand. **********There are also several high-priced Russian private clinics, but many rich Russian bankers, diplomats and politicians prefer to pay the even higher rates of Western clinics. **********The American Medical Center and U.S. Global Health/Columbia-Presbyterian-Moscow are now competing ferociously for such clients. **********Charging that its challenger stole its membership list, business plan, and other confidential trade secrets, American Medical filed a lawsuit earlier this year, in Craven County Superior Court in New Bern, N.C., where Pepsico is incorporated. In July a judge issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Global from signing up any American Medical clients until the case goes to trial. **********Dr. Bruce A. Barron, president of Columbia-Presbyterian Health Services Inc., and a gynecological surgeon at the hospital, dismissed American Medical's accusations, and said firmly, ""I know the material was not stolen."" He described Dennis A. Sokol, president of Hospital Corporation International, as ""kind of a buccaneer."" **********Mr. Sokol retorted, ""We don't want to eliminate competition; we just don't want people to cheat."" **********Afterward, American Medical triumphantly issued a news release referring to Global as the ""Pepsi clinic"" and stating that its tactics ""may be suitable in the competitive world of soft drinks and potato chips but violate the basic atmosphere of trust and ethical behavior that is the foundation of medicine."" **********The court order did not prevent Columbia-Presbyterian-Moscow, as Dr. Barron called the clinic -- it is known locally as Global -- from opening its doors this month. **********On the fourth floor of a Government medical building that has long catered to foreign diplomats, Global's freshly painted offices look more like a slick Los Angeles law firm than a Moscow medical center. The floors are carpeted, the corridor walls are covered with mauve fabric and softly lit with sconces, and examining rooms are equipped with computer terminals atop gleaming, polished oak desks. **********Global's prices are twice as high as American Medical's. Global charges $1,500 for a family membership, $750 for an individual, while its rival charges $750 for families and $350 for an individual, and $1,500 for corporations, which covers all employees. In addition to the membership fees, patients pay for medical services, lab work and medications, with a routine examination averaging about $150. **********Global bills American insurance companies directly, while American Medical does not. But American medical will bill the Russian insurance company, Ingastrakh, on behalf of Russian patients. **********Global boasts seven board-certified doctors, 24-hour access and promises it will make house calls. **********Columbia-Presbyterian's reputation is a strong selling point. ""This is a quality, state-of-the-art Western facility,"" said Nina Hultz, Global's marketing director. ""And Columbia-Presbyterian is a great help in marketing this facility."" **********American Medical has responded by saying it plans to hire a full-time pediatrician and offer 24-hour access. ""Competition is better for us,"" said Dr. Myles Druckman, the clinic's director since 1991. ""When we were the only one in town, it was too much pressure."" **********American Medical also plans to move to more modern, newly renovated quarters in central Moscow. It would have already moved, Mr. Sokol said, but had been delayed by Global's ""interference"" in its negotiations with building owners. Global denied interfering. **********Some American Medical customers say they are ready for a switch. **********""At the A.M.C. I sometimes had to wait more than an hour to see a doctor,"" said the wife of an American businessman who spoke on the condition that she be identified only as Ellen. When her contract with American Medical expires, she said she intended to go elsewhere. **********""With no competition, I feel they didn't try very hard -- though I was always pleased that they were there,"" she said. She also said she would not necessarily select Global. ""I like the Canadian clinic, and they only charge $60 for a routine visit,"" she said, referring to Mediclub, a joint venture between Mediclub Montreal and the hospital of Glavmosstroy, Moscow's lrgest construction company. **********Like the rival car rental companies, there are more similarities than differences between Global and the American Medical. Both are outpatient clinics, and in case of serious emergencies requiring surgery or hospitalization, both must refer patients to Moscow's best hospitals -- or, if necessary, arrange for their evacuation. **********But while American Medical has gradually sought to expand its roots into the Russian medical community, including training Russian doctors to work at the A.M.C. clinic, Global plans to remain more insular, pampering Western and Russian clients in a American-style cocoon. **********Global, for example, selected offices in a medical building reserved for foreigners. American Medical will share a building with ""Medecina,"" Russia's first for-profit private clinic. **********Dr. Barron said Global's physicians teach and lecture at Russian medical schools but that the clinic would not employ Russian doctors. **********""I have respect for the Russian system, but we have no intention of training Russian doctors for our clinic,"" he said. ""We will have collegial interaction within their facilities."""

Now, without fanfare, it will become a variety of Maxwell House coffee, which, like Sanka, is produced by the General Foods U.S.A. subsidiary of Kraft General Foods Inc. **********Sanka is being renamed Maxwell House Sanka and will be sold as part of the larger, more popular line of Maxwell House coffees that include Colombian, French roast and cappuccino products. It will remain available in ground and instant versions, and the formula will not be changed. **********""Maxwell House has a huge, positive image,"" Nan Redmond, a spokeswoman for General Foods in White Plains, said yesterday, adding that in research conducted by the company, ""Sanka users have indicated they consider the fact Sanka is made by Maxwell House to be a positive."" **********In turning Sanka into a variety of Maxwell House, Sanka joins a brand family even older than its own; Maxwell House, with its familiar ""Always . . . good to the last drop"" imagery, traces its roots to a coffee blend served in 1892 to guests of the Maxwell House hotel in Nashville. **********Sanka also joins a lengthening list of brands being merged with bigger siblings, as marketers respond to complaints from shoppers and grocers that brand proliferation has transformed simple buying decisions into agonizing choices. **********""It's all a function of there being too many, and too many undifferentiated, brands,"" said William M. Weilbacher, president at the Bismark Corporation, an advertising and marketing consulting company in Dennis, Mass. ""We'll see more of this."" **********Among other pantry staples losing their independence are White Cloud bathroom tissue, absorbed by the Charmin brand, and Top Job liquid cleaner, combined with Mr. Clean. **********Some also-ran brands are disappearing altogether; Procter & Gamble discontinued Solo liquid detergent by merging it with another detergent, Bold, and eliminated an instant decaffeinated coffee, High Point, in favor of focusing efforts on its far larger Folgers coffee brand. **********""From a marketing point of view, putting a brand under an overall label sometimes helps,"" said John Maxwell Jr., an analyst at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond who follows consumer product industries. **********As recently as the 1970's, Sanka advertised itself with a snappy jingle as ""the third-largest coffee in America,"" behind only Maxwell House and Folgers. But Sanka's share of the instant coffee market, according to data supplied by Mr. Maxwell, tumbled to an estimated 8.3 percent in 1993, from 12.1 percent in 1978. In ground coffee, the erosion was even more pronounced, as market share declined to an estimated 1.1 percent from 2.7 percent. **********In supermarket sales, according to data from Nielsen Marketing Research, Sanka ranked fifth among instant coffees in the 52 weeks ended on March 12, at $44.8 million, down 6.8 percent from the corresponding period a year ago. Among ground coffees, again Sanka's decline was deeper; it ranked 13th with sales of $21.4 million, down 13.4 percent from the period a year earlier. **********Sanka was introduced in the United States 11 years after Ludwig Roselius, who developed a process for decaffeinating coffee in 1900, began selling it in Europe. The name was derived from the French words ""sans caffeine."" General Foods started distributing Sanka in America in 1928, then bought the product and its patent four years later. **********Just as Kleenex is virtually synonymous with tissue, Sanka, long sold as ""97 percent caffeine-free,"" has entered the vernacular as a generic term for decaffeinated coffee. A request at a restaurant for ""a decaf"" usually resulted in a cup of Sanka -- poured from a pot with an orange handle like the Sanka label -- or a cup of hot water and an orange foil packet of instant Sanka. **********But in the last 10 years, even though interest in decaffeinated coffee surged among younger consumers, Sanka was still perceived as a brand for older coffee drinkers. **********The company tried to aim the brand at a younger market. In 1982, the actor Robert Young, who praised Sanka in the avuncular tones he used in his television role as ""Marcus Welby, M.D.,"" gave up his pitchman's role after six years. He was replaced by real people with careers like underwater welding, and later by more active celebrities like the dancer Gregory Hines. **********But those efforts all failed. The most recent Sanka campaign, which ended last year, featured gray-haired actors. In an attempt to appeal to younger coffee drinkers, General Foods introduced decaffeinated versions of Maxwell House and another brand, Yuban. **********Jeff Tolvin, a spokesman at Young & Rubicam New York, which has handled the Sanka account since 1930, said his agency was ""in the final phases of development of new work."" Ms. Redmond at General Foods said the Sanka account would continue at Y.& R. New York; Ogilvy & Mather New York handles the Maxwell House product line. **********Competitive Media Reporting, a New York company that tracks advertising spending, said that during 1993, Sanka spending nationally totaled $6.2 million, adding that there was no national spending through the first six months of 1994. Mr. Tolvin said Sanka's ad spending had been concentrated in local markets, primarily aimed at consumers aged 50 and over."

Tisch, chairman of CBS, and Mr. Diller, QVC's chairman, confirmed that they had reached a tentative agreement to merge the two companies. **********The deal would mark the end of the powerful Tisch family's dominance of CBS, reducing both the family's stock holdings and Mr. Tisch's management role. **********But in Mr. Diller and QVC, Mr. Tisch has found an heir apparent and created a combined cable and broadcast television operation. **********Shares of CBS Up $50 **********The pending alliance was applauded on Wall Street. CBS's stock jumped $50 a  share, or 19 percent, to close at $313, regaining almost all the value it had shed in the last six weeks since it lost eight television affiliates to the Fox  Television Network. **********Stock in QVC, the home shopping channel company, rose $5.625, or 18.8 percent, to $38 a share. **********""It is a win for CBS shareholders to take cash out of the company, yet they get to invest in a new entity that is run by arguably the best programmer in the business,"" said John Tinker, who follows media for Furman Selz & Company. ""You combine both network and cable assets. The new company has a low level of debt,  and the flexibility to experiment with new businesses.""    CBS and QVC have agreed to a complex stock and cash merger in which each CBS  shareholder will get $175 in cash and about four-tenths of a share of stock in a newly formed company. QVC shareholders will get roughly one-twentieth of a share of common stock and roughly one-fifth share of nonvoting preferred stock in the  new company. When the dust settles, CBS holders will own 53.6 percent of the new company and QVC holders will own the balance. **********Using yesterday's closing stock prices, Jeffrey Lodgson, a media analyst at the Seidler Company, put the value of the deal to CBS shareholders at $344 a share, and the value to QVC shareholders at about $40 a share. But he noted that the final value to shareholders depended on the price of CBS stock when the deal closed, as well as on subjective valuations of QVC's preferred stock. **********The 71-year-old Mr. Tisch said that he had been motivated to merge CBS with QVC because he liked the idea that ""Barry could be part of this company"" because of Mr. Diller's track record as a programming executive. Mr. Tisch added: ""I had no intention of trying to stay forever. The question was how could you insure that your constituencies are served well?"" **********Mr. Diller described CBS as ""being in damn good shape, terrific shape,"" but was careful to shy away from saying anything about specific changes he might make at the network after the completion of the deal, which is planned for the fall. Mr. Diller seemed to relish the chance to get back in the business he likes best -- network programming -- where he had his biggest successes, first at ABC and then in building the Fox network. **********Mr. Tisch's well-known fascination with trading was evident even during yesterday's interview. He took frequent phone calls and reported enthusiastically on Wall Street's reaction to the merger as CBS's stock climbed. . **********But even as Mr. Tisch tracked his stock, some media experts began to wonder whether the Walt Disney Company or other bidders might not attempt to make a competing offer for CBS. A spokesman for the Disney company declined to comment  on rumors. **********Both Mr. Tisch and Mr. Diller dismissed a rival bid as unlikely. They said it would be difficult because transferring ownership of a network has a number of regulatory hurdles and is a difficult and lengthy process. **********A Vindication **********If the deal goes through, it would represent a vindication for Mr. Diller, whose company lost a bitter and protracted battle earlier this year with Viacom  Inc. for Paramount Communications Inc. **********As the deal is currently structured, there would be roughly 12.6 million shares of the new company outstanding. The result would be that the Loews Corporation, the Tisch-controlled conglomerate that holds the family's CBS stock, would find its stake reduced from 20 percent of CBS to 9.4 percent of the new company, which would keep the CBS name. Mr. Diller would take over the positions as chief executive and head of the executive committee from Mr. Tisch, who would remain chairman. **********Mr. Tisch has four sons, and his brother Robert Tisch has two sons and a daughter. Though the family is extremely close knit, Laurence Tisch denied that  he had ever encouraged his sons to go into the network business and said that none of them had ever indicated to him an interest in doing so. **********Nor was he disappointed at not being able to bring his children into the television business. ""I only care that they are happy in what they are doing."" **********Indeed, one of his sons, Daniel Tisch, who heads Mentor Partners, a risk arbitrage investment firm, apparently played a role in the merger of CBS and QVC, along with Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the law firm that represents both QVC and Loews. **********'Lot of Sense' **********""At the time of the Paramount transaction when they were both -- QVC and Viacom -- going after Paramount, I said to Marty that a CBS transaction makes a  lot of sense,"" Daniel Tisch said in a telephone interview yesterday. ""If Paramount does not succeed, it makes a lot of sense to look at CBS as a transaction."" **********Mr. Lipton did not return telephone calls yesterday. However, Herbert Allen of Allen & Company, the investment bankers representing QVC, described Mr. Lipton as the architect of the deal. Apparently Mr. Lipton spoke to both Mr. Diller and Laurence Tisch, suggesting an alliance. **********Mr. Diller said yesterday that he had called Laurence Tisch about a month ago and the two men had met alone at CBS's headquarters. **********The talks took off from there. **********James Tisch, another of Laurence Tisch's sons and an executive vice president at Loews, recalled that the talks had come unraveled once, but that Mr. Lipton put them back on track. He added that he was too busy at Loews to want to give that up. **********When Laurence Tisch was asked whether he might have been more receptive to the idea of stepping aside because of the challenges raised by CBS's loss of affiliates to Fox, he said it was not an issue. **********Daniel Tisch said that his father had never had either ""an entry or an exit plan at CBS."" **********'Catching the Winds' **********""Larry is very good at catching the winds,"" he said. ""He likes to take advantage of opportunities. There was no thought that he would go in and run the company."" **********Daniel Tisch added: ""He got involved at age 63 or 64. CBS has never had his signature on it. The board has never changed significantly. Larry never viewed it as his company."" **********Of course, Daniel Tisch initially suggested buying CBS stock in 1985. As a trader, he views the deal as a long one: ""Eight years is longer than I usually trade for,"" he said. **********Laurence Tisch was quick to emphasize yesterday that he was not selling the company, and that Loews would own 9.4 percent after the deal was completed. **********Mr. Diller will own less than 2 percent of CBS, although he has options that  would let him acquire as much as 5 percent Clearly, his role as chief executive  of the new entity was critical to the agreement. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Diller will not have as much voting control of the stock as he had at QVC. After he left Fox, Mr. Diller said that he was seeking more autonomy. When he joined QVC, he insisted on voting parity with his leading partners, the Comcast Corporation and Liberty Media, a cable company controlled  by the cable entrepreneur John Malone. Mr. Tisch was quick to note that ""Barry will be the boss."" And Mr. Diller said he was very excited about his new position. **********But there are already obvious tensions among the new shareholders. **********Mr. Tisch has been a bitter rival of Mr. Malone's in various cable and broadcast battles. Yesterday, however, he sought to smooth that friction, referring to his adversary as ""brilliant,"" but adding, ""That is not a sentiment; it is a fact."" **********The proposed CBS-QVC deal is not likely to face significant regulatory obstacles, according to communication lawyers in Washington. CBS is prohibited under current Federal regulations from owning newspapers or cable television systems in markets where it also owns a television station, but QVC is merely a  provider of programming and not a system operator. And although QVC is owned in  part by two cable companies, Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast, those companies are not expected to own more than 5 percent of CBS, and are therefore  not expected to constitute a problem. **********In the event that another bidder sought control of CBS, the Federal Communications Commission would have to approve the transfer of television and radio licenses. That could prove complicated, because CBS was granted special ""grandfather"" exemptions to rules that bar a company from owning a television and radio station in the same market."

The Standard & Poor's Index of 500 stocks rose 3.85 points, to 477.05, also a record. **********Prices were also strong in the broader market, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 4.08 points, to 792.88, less than two points below its all-time high set on Jan. 21. **********Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 346.5 million shares, with 1,329 stocks rising and 784 falling. **********""The stock market is making a case for the 'best of all possible worlds' forecast,"" said Kevin Bannon, chief investment officer at the Bank of New York. There is, he said, ""a growing belief that the economy will grow enough to produce decent growth in corporate profits, but not so much that you have to worry about rising inflation and rising interest rates."" **********Fresh evidence of the economy's health is expected today, when the Commerce Department reports on economic activity in the fourth quarter. Predictions that gross domestic product -- the sum of all the goods and services produced in the country -- would exceed 5 percent after inflation were widespread. **********""It will be an unpleasant surprise to the market if the gain is below 3 percent,"" said Mark Kimsey, manager of global equity research at Lehman Brothers. **********Mr. Kimsey noted that demand from foreign investors had been strong. Many who earned large profits last year in Asian markets, where prices rose 50 percent or more, now see greater opportunity in the United States, where the S.& P. 500 index rose less than 10 percent last year.  Expectations of Growth **********Expectations of sustained economic growth helped lift a variety of stocks labeled as ""cyclicals"" because their performance is often tied to the ups and downs of the business cycle. Procter & Gamble's report yesterday of record earnings was not enough to lift its price above the previous day's close of 58 5/8, but it did help convince investors that strong profits are likely at other companies whose sales are closely tied to the general health of the economy and consumer spending. **********General Motors, up 1 1/4, to 59 7/8, and Ford Motor, up 1 7/8, to 66 3/4, both benefited from expectations of a healthy economy, as did many other manufacturing companies. Housing-related stocks were also strong, with the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, rising 3 1/8, to 87 3/4. Among retailers, J. C. Penney rose 2 5/8, to 53 1/4. **********The other catalyst for yesterday's gains was the performance of the bond market, where prices rose modestly despite reports of a large rise in durable goods orders and a decline in initial claims for unemployment. Because both reports were signs of a strong economy that on other days might have led to lower bond prices and fears of higher inflation, the fact that the bond market improved was especially significant, according to some traders. **********Timothy Heekin, a managing director in charge of equity block trading at Salomon Brothers, the giant bond-trading firm, noted that the improvement in the bond market was the catalyst for strong gains among ""interest-sensitive stocks like banks, insurance companies and utilities which were lagging the market until recently."" **********Banking and insurance company stocks have been weak until the last few days because of worries that rising interest rates would reduce the value of bonds they hold as investments. Electric utility stocks, because of their high dividends, tend to trade in the same general direction as bond prices. **********Although there is an expectation among some instititonal investores that bond yields will fall below 6 percent once again, Mr. Heekin noted that bond traders were attributing much of yesterday's gains to the short-term trading strategy of a large securities firm that had been a heavy seller of bonds recently, but yesterday was a buyer as it sought to cover its short positions. **********Among other issues, McDonnell Douglas rose 2 5/8, to 111 1/2. Israel decided to spend $1.8 billion on its F-15I jet fighters, instead of Lockheed's F-16's. Lockheed was unchanged at 63 3/4. **********Telefonos de Mexico gained 2 1/2, to 71 3/8, on signs that political tensions were easing in Mexico. Intel was the most active Nasdaq issue and it gained 5/8, to 64 1/4."

The judges, focused more on security concerns than civil-rights claims, said no. **********Other religious Jews have asked that the authorities at least allow a small group to enter during the holiday, a token gesture but an important nationalist statement for them, to affirm Israeli control. **********They, too, have been rebuffed, with the army saying that it does not plan to reopen the cave until October, and then on an experimental basis to test new security measures. For now, worshipers, whether Jewish or Muslim, must settle for praying outside the walls of a compound that Jews also call the Cave of Machpela and that Muslims know as the Ibrahimi Mosque. It is venerated by both religions as the burial place of Abraham, or Ibrahim in Arabic. **********Critics on the Israeli right accuse the Government of foot-dragging to placate the Palestinians. But the army insists that it needs more time to complete security arrangements, including a partition of prayer halls, that it hopes will prevent another catastrophe like the massacre last February, in which an Israeli settler fired on worshiping Palestinians, killing 29 and wounding about 125. **********""If they really wanted to open it, they could have done it in a week or two,"" said Israel Zeira, general manager of the Shavei Hebron Yeshiva, a few dozen yards from the shrine. ""But this Government doesn't understand the importance of the Cave of Machpela to the Jewish people. It has no Jewish soul. To have no prayers there on Rosh ha-Shanah is a disgrace for the entire Jewish people."" **********Palestinian religious and secular leaders have their own grievances. **********To them, the shrine is a mosque, and Jews have no right to pray there, let alone to install security barriers that a senior Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, described on a visit to Hebron as ""mutilating this place of God."" The new Gaza-based Palestinian Authority has lodged a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, and some militant Islamic groups accuse Israel of trying to turn the shrine into a synagogue. **********""The Ibrahimi Mosque has been a Muslim holy place for 14 centuries,"" said Sheik Abdelazim Salhab, head of the Waqf, a council that oversees Islamic sites in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. **********""Jews never used it as a synagogue,"" he said. ""We are in charge of that place."" **********But the Israeli authorities are not about to stop making changes in Hebron, an ever-turbulent city of roughly 100,000 Muslims who surround half a dozen enclaves of 450 Jews. **********The Government dismisses the idea that Jews may be barred from praying at a site where tradition holds that not only the patriarch Abraham and his wife, Sarah, are buried but also Isaac and his wife, Rebecca, and Jacob and his first wife, Leah. Their tombs are in three halls inside the shrine, each named after a patriarch. **********But Israeli officials say that if Jews and Muslims are to worship in the same place -- no simple matter -- then more must be done to keep the groups apart. **********No civilians, the army says, will be allowed to carry weapons into the shrine when it reopens under the supervision of a new, specially trained unit of the Border Police. **********The ban is aimed mainly at Jews living in Hebron and the nearby settlement of Qiryat Arba, home of Baruch Goldstein, who carried out the massacre in February. Settlers routinely walk the streets carrying submachine guns, which they say they need for security but which Palestinians call a provocation. **********Waqf officials who recently visited the mosque report, and army officers confirm, that video cameras, metal detectors and lights are in place, and that sliding doors are being put in to create separate praying areas for the two religions. **********On a few specified Jewish and Muslim holidays, no one from the other group will be allowed anywhere inside the complex. Otherwise, the Isaac Hall, where the massacre took place, will be reserved for Muslims, officials say. The Abraham and Jacob halls are to be set aside for Jews, a decision that produces charges from Muslims that they have been given less space. **********Even if these procedures keep people from killing each other, few in Hebron expect animosities to end. Among some Jews, disputes extend to how important the cave really is, divisions evident in a debate between two rabbis on the Israeli radio the other day. **********According to Rabbi Macy Gordon, director of the Council of Young Israel Rabbis, some sites are ""more befitting prayer than other places,"" and one of them is the cave in Hebron -- ""the first part of the Land of Israel that was possessed by Jews."" **********But Rabbi Ben-Chorin, of the Har-El Progressive Congregation in Jerusalem, spoke out against ""turning graves into holy sites."" On whether the cave must be opened at once, he said, ""Whatever can bring peace is more important for me than a grave of one or another person."""

Shares of Commerzbank posted a 59 percent gain last year compared to a 42 percent rise in Frankfurt's DAX index while Deutsche Bank rose 37 percent and Dresdner Bank climbed 31 percent. **********Among European banking industry analysts, there is no consensus at all on where the share prices are headed from here. Some analysts recommend the German banking sector as a whole while others expect it to underperform. Some analysts see Dresdner bank alone as a ""buy,"" while others favor just about every other big bank. Opinion is also sharply divided on Commerzbank. And while Deutsche Bank provokes less controversy then the other members of the big three, there is no unanimity on its fate either. **********Bankhaus Julius Baer in Frankfurt currently has ""buys"" on Deutsche, Commerz, Bankgesellschaft Berlin and DePfa Bank, a situation banking analyst Manfred Piontka describes as ""exceptional."" Normally, it only recommends one German bank at a time for purchase, but because it is ""very optimistic in the middle to long term"" about the sector, it is in the unusual position of recommending four. **********Many investors in German stocks have moved into chemicals, steel and now autos, hoping to benefit from an imminent turnaround after the years of shrinking profits and, in some cases, losses. Mr. Piontka noted that for banks, whose profits have continued to grow throughout the recession, the turnaround will make itself felt in reduced loan loss provisions that should boost earnings even higher. **********The banks, which will report their 1993 results in March, have released 10-month results in which the respective provisions against loans losses for Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerz were, respectively, 2.46 billion DM ($1.43 billion), 1.25 billion DM and 1.37 billion DM. A Salomon Brothers' report on German banks estimated Deutsche Bank's provisions rose to 3 billion DM for all of 1993 and then will drop off to 2.8 billion DM in 1994 and 2.3 billion DM in 1995. Salomon sees both Dresdner and Commerz following a similar pattern. **********""As the German economy stabilizes in 1994, we expect the pace of domestic credit deterioration to be slower than in 1993,"" a European banking analyst, John Leonard, wrote in the report. ""This already appears to be happening in Eastern Germany, where all three banks are now profitable after provisions and taxes. **********Salomon has a ""buy"" recommendation on Dresdner and ""holds"" on Deutsche and Commerz. Dresdner Bank ""remains our top choice based on its balance between banking and nonbanking investments and the relatively modest share valuation,"" the report says. ""Our stance on the other two banks is also positive, but we lack sufficient near-term conviction that the shares will outperform the market to support a 'buy' rating."" **********In 1993, German banks were able to more than make up for the hefty amounts allocated to loan loss provisions with the commissions and trading profits derived from surging securities markets. ""This is one of the advantages of Germany's universal banks,"" Mr. Piontka said. **********But the universal banks also have their disadvantages, as has recently been illustrated by the problems of the mining and metals giant Metallgesellschaft AG. As well as combining the functions of commercial banks, merchant banks and brokerage houses, German banks are major shareholders in many of the country's biggest and best-known companies, creating a concentration of financial power. **********Both Deutsche and Dresdner not only hold major stakes in Metallgesellschaft, but they are also among its most important creditors and have seats of its supervisory board. When Metallgesellschaft announced that its losses for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, could total 3.3 billion DM, holders of bank shares were predictably upset. While the company has now agreed to a restructuring program approved by both its German and foreign bankers, more bad news could have a negative impact on the banks' share prices. **********How quickly the Bundesbank allows interest rates to continue to drop and when economic recovery actually begins are two other key questions for the banks. Salomon Brothers, which is predicting a short-term discount rate of 4.5 percent or less by the end of 1994, down from the current 5.5 percent, said in its report: ""This monetary trend, in turn, should provide a liquidity driven boost to German stock and bond markets and lead to strong commission and trading revenues in 1994."" **********Michael Wheelhouse, financial analyst at Nomura Research Institute, believes that analysts basing their predictions for recovery and improved loan loss provisions on the pattern established in the 1980s recession may be too optimistic. **********""For me the decisive thing is that the recession in Germany is more serious this time around. I think the asset quality problem is more serious,"" he said. ""I'm sitting on the negative side of the fence."""

The situation was not helped by the Bundesbank's announcement last week that the German money supply, a predictor of inflation, had increased at a far higher level than expected, although the central bank explained the jump away as a result of one-time technical factors. **********But economists are nearly unanimous in their assessment that rates will continue to decline in Germany, Europe's biggest and most influential economy, and eventually throughout the major western European nations. Inflation, they said, remains quiescent. In other words, the same economic assumptions that underpinned a strong rally in most markets over the previous several months remain in place. **********The most immediate question facing investors seems to be how quickly the European markets will shrug off what is happening in the United States, where stronger-than-expected growth and signs of incipient inflation are almost certain to bring further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. **********Investors, particularly in the European bond markets, appear to have been operating in recent weeks as if the rising rates in the United States would inevitably bring the same in Europe, and as if falling share prices in New York would mean the onset of a bear market on this side of the Atlantic. The selloff was reportedly exacerbated by heavy selling among large hedge funds seeking to cover losses both on bond and currency trading.  After enduring some violent swings during the week, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed on Friday in London at 3,278, down just 3.2 points on the week. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index ended the week down 14.83 points, at 2,060.09. The CAC-40 index in Paris closed down 20.23 points on the week, at 2,178.69. **********""We maintain our view that the real economies of Europe and the United States are on very different cycles,"" said Joe Rooney, the European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London. **********""The question is whether, when things settle down, the European bond markets will be able to decouple themselves from those in the U.S.,"" Mr. Rooney said. ""We're increasingly of the belief that that will be the case."" **********Mr. Rooney said Lehman Brothers had studied the 11 periods since the 1950's when rising short-term rates led to a sharp fall in American stock markets. The study then looked at the extent to which the market declines in the United States were accompanied by falls in European markets, and concluded that there was not necessarily a direct relationship between the two. **********The average market decline in the 11 corrections in the United States was 13.8 percent, excluding the 1987 market crash, Mr. Rooney said. Yet in Germany, for example, the market rose or was unchanged during 8 of those 11 periods. **********Some analysts said the selloffs in Europe over the past several weeks were actually positive for the markets by ending an almost mindless rush into both stocks and bonds. **********""In general we view the falling markets over the past couple of weeks as healthy signs,"" said Kenneth Anderson, the investment manager for Scottish Widows, a large pension fund in Edinburgh. ""The liquidity flow into equities was indiscriminate and valuations had been pushed up too high."" **********There is some danger that rising rates in the United States will dry up or even reverse the heavy flow of funds from American investors into the European markets, analysts said. That flow has driven much of the upward surge in prices in the markets, especially in smaller markets like Madrid. **********Richard Davidson, the European investment strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said that the liquidity-driven phase of the European bull market is more or less over. Although European equities have generally held up better over recent weeks than European bonds, he said, economic fundamentals and market valuations suggest the opposite should be true. As a result, Morgan Stanley is advising a very cautious approach to picking European stocks, he said. **********""We really can't say that the European equity markets deserve to be on the valuations they're on,"" Mr. Davidson said. **********He said the best opportunities are in three categories: consumer stocks such as Nestle, Sandoz and Unilever that are likely to deliver solid earnings growth and are still priced relatively cheaply; restructuring and recovery stocks such as Philips, the Dutch electronics company, which showed a strong earnings turnaround last week; and stocks that benefit from high levels of dollar earnings, like Hanson, the British-American conglomerate. **********Mr. Anderson of Scottish Widows said the markets, having put historically high valuations on so many companies, would harshly punish those stocks that failed to live up to expectations. ""There's no scope for any earnings disappointment,"" he said. **********But he said careful investors can still find good buys. **********""Stock selection is going to be much more important than last year, when you could buy anything and everything,"" Mr. Anderson said."

It suggests whether the concern can generate enough cash to meet its obligations when due and is particularly important for gauging the value of certain businesses, like real estate and financial services. **********To get the cash flow of a corporation, start with its net income and add noncash items like depreciation and amortization. You should also add the proceeds from any loans or from the issuance of any stock. **********Then subtract items like purchases of machinery or equipment, redemptions of bonds or acquisitions of other companies. **********""The net effect is to determine the total amount of cash receipts and cash expenditures and to see the amount of cash left over at the end of the year,"" said Harry J.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in Haiti would succeed easily. But they warn that it would not bring a quick end to the turmoil and violence that have swept the country, and that an international force to maintain order could be needed there for years. **********The view, which represents a broad consensus among intelligence agencies and some of Father Aristide's staunchest supporters, comes as the Clinton Administration is struggling to develop a plan both to return the deposed President and to create conditions so he can govern peacefully. **********While President Clinton is relying on economic sanctions to persuade Haiti's military leaders to leave, he has pointedly refused to rule out military force if sanctions fail. **********Pentagon officials are confident that Haiti's minimally equipped 7,500-man armed forces could easily be swept aside. And a force of 650 marines -- the kind of force officials said might serve as an invasion vanguard -- was sent for training to Guantanamo Bay last week. **********Whether Mr. Clinton uses diplomacy or force to return the Haitian President to power, he faces the difficult task of trying to rebuild Haiti's military and political institutions while avoiding an open-ended commitment of American troops. Determined not to repeat the mistakes of Somalia, Administration officials say Washington will not launch any military operation in Haiti without a firm plan for disengagement. **********""The view of the intelligence community is unambiguous that restoring Aristide through military force would be a simple proposition, but withdrawing international forces quickly after that step would be extremely unlikely,"" a senior intelligence official said. Even in the case of a diplomatic solution, he said, ""maintaining order represents a long-term proposition."" **********So far, the Administration's plan for keeping the peace in Haiti after Father Aristide's return is sketchy. **********Senior Administration officials said Washington saw a need for a peacekeeping force of several thousand to help protect Father Aristide, retrain the Haitian military and keep order through December 1995, the end of Father Aristide's term. **********But the United States and its allies have not yet agreed on the exact size and duties of the peacekeeping force, on the extent of the American role or how long the force would need to stay. **********Since allies are being told that the peacekeeping force would be sent in after a diplomatic solution, it is unclear which countries, if any, would be willing to send troops if Father Aristide were returned through military action. **********In addition, the United States and its allies are struggling to define some of the fundamental tasks they would face after Father Aristide's return. **********At a recent meeting in Ottawa, for example, Defense Secretary William J. Perry told his Canadian counterpart that deep-seated opposition to Father Aristide extends into the lower ranks of the Haitian military. But the Canadians said the depth of the problem might not be so bad, suggesting more intelligence on the Haitian military might be needed. **********Struggling to devise a way to turn the daunting task of maintaining security over to the Haitians, the two sides discussed a plan to train and equip Haitian expatriates from Montreal and New York to form the nucleus of a new Haitian police force. **********""he problem is not getting in,"" one Pentagon-based general said. ""It is getting out."" Restoring Aristide: An Urgent Situation **********In interviews and speeches in recent weeks, President Clinton and his top aides have described the situation in Haiti as a serious threat to American security, implying that Father Aristide, who was elected in December 1990 with two-thirds of the vote, needed to be restored to power in a matter of months. Mr. Clinton has cited the threat of a surge in refugees trying to come here, and has said Haiti is used as a staging area for drug shipments to the United States. **********Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, said in an interview: ""It is our intention to send a very clear signal to the military and police leadership in Port-au-Prince that this situation is urgent, and at the end of the day, they'e going to be gone, and that the end of the day is not that far off."" To that end, the Administration has pushed for tougher and more rigorously enforced economic sanctions. **********William H. Gray 3d, the Administration's new special envoy for Haiti, said it was far too soon to conclude that sanctions would not be effective since they had only recently been put into effect and the United States was pressing the Dominican Republic to seal its border with Haiti. **********""The sanctions are at a level totally different than in the past,"" Mr. Gray said. ""What we've really got to do is restore democracy. Along with that, we have to insure that the military and police are compatible with democratic values. And we've got to bring economic growth and the prospect of hope. All three have to be done together."" **********But top Bush Administration officials contend that the economic sanctions will backfire by raising the general level of misery in Haiti, the poorest county in the hemisphere, unleashing a new flood of refugees and putting pressure on the Administration to take military action. **********Even some Administration officials are skeptical that sanctions will work in the months that Washington seems to have alloted for the military rulers to be removed. **********""We have less of a chance of achieving a negotiated outcome than at any time since Aristide was overthrown,"" said a State Department official. ""It's by a process of subtraction that we're getting to the military option."" **********By this view, a solution will be found only when it is clear to Haiti's military that the United States is on the verge of an invasion, or through military intervention itself. **********Senior Administration officials said invading Haiti would be one of the easier American military operations in years. **********Haiti's military is ill equipped and poorly trained, they say, armed with sufficient firepower to terrorize the civilian population but not enough to pose serious resistance to an American invasion. **********""The system that runs Haiti now runs it through what they're pleased to call the Haitian military, but it is not a military in the normal sense of the word,"" a senior Administration official said. ""It's more like a combination of an old-fashioned political machine and the Mafia."" **********According to Administration officials, the Haitian armed forces consist of about 7,500 to 7,700 men. About half of the force, including about 1,300 police officers, are stationed in the capital, Port-au-Prince. The military's 925-member officer corps offers only broad guidance to the enlisted ranks, which have an unusual degree of autonomy to decide what operations they will join. **********The military is equipped with six American-made lightly armored vehicles, which are rolled out occasionally for effect, but not all are in working order. **********The army has four or five 105-millimeter artillery pieces and a similar number of 75-millimeter guns. But the Haitian troops do not train with them and they were last seen fired this month at the inauguration of the military-backed ""provisional president,"" Emil Jonassaint. ""They are the kind of things you would see on the lawn of an American Legion post,"" a Pentagon official said. **********The Haitian air force consists of two Italian training aircraft and some cargo planes, and the navy consists of four patrol boats. ""On a good day, two work,"" the Pentagon official said. **********To hold down American casualties, an invasion would probably involve a division's worth of troops -- some 15,000 soldiers -- and could feature special operations forces, Army Rangers, Army airborne units and marines. **********Military experts said American forces would seize the airport and ports and take over Government buildings and communications centers. **********Unlike Somalia, which was awash in arms and run by violent, closely-knit clans, the Haitian military is not expected to offer much resistance. One Administration official said its response would be ""surrender and dispersal."" **********But if Haiti is not Somalia, neither is it Panama or Grenada, where the United States mounted lightning invasions, installed friendly governments and then quickly withdrew. Long-Term Problem: And After Aristide? **********The real problem, officials say, would be what to do after Father Aristide was installed. It is not that maintaining order and trying to build Haiti's institutions are impossible, intelligence officials say, but that the United States and its allies must go in with their eyes open and be prepared for the long haul. **********To build a peacekeeping force, the Administration is engaged in high-level consultations. **********Some options under consideration would keep the American role to transport and logistics, while drawing on Canadian, Argentine and French-speaking forces from African nations like Senegal and the Ivory Coast. Among the 1.7 million members of the American military, there are only 124 troops who speak Creole, the language most Haitians speak. **********Administration officials tick off several potentially vexing scenarios if Father Aristide is returned: If he and the Haitian Parliament renew their confrontation, who should peacekeepers support? If crowds loyal to Father Aristide try to retaliate against military or police officials, should the peacekeepers prevent it?  What if Father Aristide tells the force to leave after a few weeks? Can the force prevent foes from trying to kill the Haitian leader? **********Much, officials say, will depend on Father Aristide's political skills. **********Pentagon officials, in particular, worry about what they see as deep-seated resistance within the Haitian military to Father Aristide. **********""Both sides would be afraid of each other,"" a Pentagon official said. ""There are no viable institutions that make this work. There's the potential for mob violence, chaos and disorder."" **********Representative James L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee and is a strong supporter of Father Aristide, disputed the Pentagon's view of the depth of the opposition. **********Mr. Oberstar, who taught Enlish to Haitian troops from 1959 to 1962, said many of the enlisted force and most of the public would welcome the restoration of Father Aristide and the intervention of American troops. **********But even Mr. Oberstar said that the Haitian military would have to be rebuilt and that peacekeeping troops would need to stay three to five years. **********And if the Administration is ambivalent about the military option, so is the man they want to return to power.  ""If I ask for military intervention, I will be impeached by my Constitution,"" Father Aristide said in an interview with the Rev.

More haircuts on the runway? More sports tickets for high officials, courtesy of the Tyson chicken barons? No: the Rivlin memo. **********In a confidential note to President Clinton dated Oct. 3, Alice M. Rivlin, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, provided specific options for coping with the Federal budget deficit. Not surprisingly, they discussed what Ms. Rivlin called ""big choices"" about raising taxes and slashing spending. **********Congressional Republicans, who purloined the memo and faxed it to anybody who asked, were shocked to discover that the White House would actually consider taking caviar from the mouths of rich pensioners. Taking no chances, William Kristol, head of the Project for the Republican Future -- affectionately dubbed ""Dan Quayle's brain"" in an earlier incarnation as the former vice president's chief of staff -- called the options ""Yikes!"" and ""Yikes again!,"" lest anyone miss their nefarious import. **********But not everyone is upset. Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts and Democratic Presidential candidate who is now co-chairman of the Concord Coalition, denounced the ""unmitigated cynicism of a partisan opposition that won't talk about taxes or entitlement reform."" And Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, added that the ""O.M.B. would be derelict in its duty if it did not lay out the options for reducing the deficit."" **********The Contract with America, the Republican's pre-election wish list constructed by the House minority whip Newt Gingrich, was seized by the White House earlier this month as evidence that Republicans still believed in the free lunch. ""They can run, but they can't hide the fact that they have to pay for a trillion dollars in promises,"" said Gene Sperling, a senior aide to the President. ""They don't have a clue how to do it without deep Social Security or Medicare cuts."" **********But what does the Budget Director's memo really say? ""Our attacks on the Republicans for evasiveness about how they would pay for their 'contract' have been effective,"" Ms. Rivlin wrote, ""but they make it imperative that we continue our established policy of explicit and paid-for proposals."" **********It seems the budget deficit, which fell after the economy started growing in 1992 and the Clinton Administration rammed through a deficit reduction package in 1993, is set to rise again in the near future. White House numbers show it creeping back up, starting next year, and then taking off as Medicaid and Medicare outpace revenues. When the baby boomers retire, Social Security will also slip into the red. That will lead to an estimated $4.1 trillion budget deficit in 2030, if nothing is done to reverse the trend. **********And what could be done? Ms. Rivlin offered an ""illustrative range of packages,"" which run from eschewing new programs that would add to the deficit to an overhaul of the tax system to phasing out the most generous Social Security benefits. They also included an all-out attempt to balance the budget by 2000. **********When the memo was leaked by a person Mr. Kristol referred to as ""a public-spirited senior Administration official,"" President Clinton moved quickly to contain the political damage. ""I do not support cuts in Social Security,"" he told reporters, ""and I believe any savings we achieve in the Medicare program should be used in health care."" **********That, however, does not leave many options for coping with deficits. Closing what used to be called tax loopholes -- from mortgage deductions on second homes to the failure to tax capital gains at death -- is a possibility. But there are good political reasons those loopholes survived the last rounds of tax reform. And besides, the Administration seems inclined to ease the sting of any tax increase by spending the proceeds on social investment or a middle-class tax cut. **********It is also conceivable that the deficit will fade as a policy concern. From economists' perspective, the real issue is the overall level of savings in the economy, and increases in private savings could more than offset increases in public deficits. But don't count on it: There is not a hint that private saving rates are on the rise. **********Arguably, the Republicans won the give and take. In this political climate, pretending that deficits will vanish into a Reaganite ether presumably beats sacrifice of any sort. **********But deficit reduction is a game in which those most affected by the outcome -- the young -- have no direct say. And Mr. Tsongas, for one, is angry that the Republicans passed up ""a golden opportunity"" to become the party of fiscal prudence and that President Clinton is ""willing to do what is necessary"" to hold the allegiance of myopic voters. **********Mr. Tsongas hopes you are, too."

And this afternoon, after final passage of a long-overdue national budget that all parties agreed must take priority, the free-for-all scramble for power resumed. **********The crucial question was which side the Socialist Party would join: Mr. Hata's Government, which is trying to lure the Socialists back two months after they bolted from a loose coalition, or the Liberal Democrats, who are clearly willing to ally with their long-time enemies in order to get back into power. Redefining the Coalition **********The Socialists seemed to be leaning toward a return to the coalition, but they are chiefly interested in cutting the best deal, demanding cabinet posts and perhaps Mr. Hata's head in return for their votes. **********Mr. Hata said at a news conference today that he would be willing to resign if it was necessary to regain a parliamentary majority for the coalition. But that may have just been a negotiating ploy, to help the Socialists return to the coalition without losing face. Under one scenario, Mr. Hata might quit and then be immediately reappointed to his post. **********Tonight Mr. Hata met with the chairman of the Socialist Party, Tomiichi Murayama, but the talks ended without an agreement for the Socialists to return to the ruling coalition. Mr. Murayama is a long-shot candidate to succeed Mr. Hata -- he would be the first Socialist Prime Minister in modern Japanese political history -- and he said after the meeting that he expected a decision about what the party would do ""in a day or two."" **********The Socialists differ from the majority of the coalition on a wide range of issues, from the need to raise income taxes to the role of Japan's military in United Nations peacekeeping activities. They left the coalition two months ago as it became clear that other parties in the coalition were preparing to organize themselves in a bloc that would freeze out the Socialists from the mainstream of power.  Obstacle to Reform **********Mr. Hata complained today that without a majority in Parliament, it was impossible to continue political reform, handle trade talks with the United States, take a strong stance on the North Korean nuclear standoff, or even prepare for the meeting in Naples of the seven largest industrial countries. ""Unless there is a government with stability,"" he said, ""coping with these things is very difficult."" **********No matter which side wins, few expect any real change in the status quo until the next elections, which will be the first to be held under a new electoral reform system. **********But that system, intended to reduce corruption and end the dominance of rural voters in the Japanese system, will not be ready until the end of this year at the earliest. The Government is still struggling over the highly political task of redrawing every parliamentary district in the country."

While there are no good measures of how much ""fat"" still remains in corporate America, the pressures are such that cuts seem likely to continue for months, or even years. **********This is an unusual moment. Although many American companies have become as efficient and modern as those in Japan and Germany, several forces have arisen that continue to push them to shed workers. Advances in technology are allowing companies to produce much more with fewer employees. With price increases hard to get, companies increasingly maintain profits by slicing labor costs. And job shedding has become fashionable -- the mark of a good manager. A whole industry of consultants has arisen to preach it. No End in Sight **********""It is going to be a permanent condition, that companies are constantly reorganizing and reshaping themselves,"" said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist and consultant, referring to the job cutbacks that have become a regular event among prosperous as well as hard-pressed companies. **********For a while last year, a dip in the number of announced job cutbacks raised hopes that the trend might be tapering off, that corporate America had finally eliminated most of its fat. But that turned out to be illusory. **********In January, the announcements of staff cutbacks surged again, to 108,946, a record for a single month, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago consulting firm that tallies job cuts. While there was a dip in February, the total of 143,564 for the first two months exceeded the record January-February level of last year. And the tally for this month already exceeds that for March of last year. Rotating Impact **********The ebb and flow is a reflection of how the job-shedding process works -- affecting one industry (aerospace was hit hard last year) and then moving to another (telecommunications has been affected most recently). **********For the aerospace industry, the common impetus was continuing military cutbacks as well as reductions in orders from the troubled commercial airlines. For telecommunications companies, the pressure has been sharper competition for market share that has resulted in significant discounting; labor cuts have helped the companies maintain profits. **********But even as one industry finishes, another seems always to be there to take its turn. ""A.T.& T. and the other phone companies can't lay off people indefinitely,"" said Paul Ostermann of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""But when the phone companies stop, then the banks start in and then the retailers do it. The staff cuts migrate from industry to industry, and that is why the layoff announcements feel to the public like they are going on indefinitely."" **********The endless modernization has given corporate America the capacity to produce substantially more than people can buy. Consumers would have to increase their spending sharply to absorb all that the nation's industries can now produce, and such spending would require an economy much stronger than it is likely to be in 1994 or 1995, economists say. Only in those circumstances might there be an easing in the layoffs and cutbacks. **********The sharp drop in the inflation rate since the 1980's is also driving the process. A decade ago, most companies could raise prices to cover rising labor costs. Now, in this inflation-conscious era, many companies cannot raise prices so easily, so they are quicker to cut labor costs to try to maintain profitability. The fear is that if they do not, then competitors will, here and abroad, and gain room to under-price them. **********""It is not that foreigners are stealing our jobs, it is that we are all facing one another's competition, and we are doing so in a panic,"" said William Baumol, a Princeton University economist and expert on labor efficiency. Not Just Blue-Collar Jobs **********During the last era of job shedding, in the 1980's, Rust Belt factories, mostly in the Midwest, were closed or modernized, so the same quantities of cars, steel, appliances, machinery and many other products could be made with a fraction of the old work force. American factories, in effect, became as efficient as those in Japan and Europe. **********Now the process is sweeping well beyond factories, into almost every sector of the economy, into the ranks of white-collar workers as well as those on the assembly lines. Sears, Roebuck; BankAmerica; A.T.& T., and Aetna have joined General Electric, Xerox, Procter & Gamble and other manufacturers in shedding jobs. **********""We are finally finding many new ways to use computers, and they are replacing people in many industries,"" said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and consultant. **********Economists predict that the number of job cuts announced this year could well exceed the 615,000 announced cuts last year as tallied by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Each year in this decade, the total has been higher than in the previous year. **********Adding to the numbers is the pressure companies feel to keep paring. A.T.&. T., for example, has been shrinking its staff since it was broken up more than a decade ago, bringing stiff competition to an industry that had been an A.T.& T. monopoly. Last month it announced 15,000 new job cuts, bringing its total announced layoffs since early 1993 to more than 33,000. **********Its latest job cuts involve many managerial people in the long-distance operation -- what the company describes as a one-time attempt to reduce the bureaucracy. But in the manufacturing division, which makes phones and switching equipment, the layoffs are ongoing. **********""Manufacturing employment is primarily governed by technology, and new technology requires half the number of people in product assembly every six years,"" said Laurence C. Siefert, A.T.& T.'s vice president for manufacturing. A.T.& T.'s factory jobs in the United States, as a result, have fallen by 50,000 since the breakup, and they are likely to keep falling unless sales of A.T.& T. equipment more than double. Excess Production **********That is because a worker in an A.T.& T. factory who assembled, say, 100 phones in an hour in 1992, increased that output to 110 phones last year. To offset this gain in productivity and keep employment steady, sales would have to rise by the extra 10 phones, or 10 percent. That has not happened. A.T.& T.'s equipment sales are rising 5 percent a year -- respectable, but not enough. **********A.T.& T.'s productivity gains have been running at 10 percent a year since the mid-1980's, Mr. Siefert said. The company once used 126 parts in each of its phones; now they are based on a single computer chip, which itself has become too microscopic to be made by humans. ""We have gone beyond that,"" Mr. Siefert said. **********While a handful of companies find orders growing fast enough to require additional workers, the hurdle to be cleared before hiring begins -- particularly in manufacturing -- seems to be an annual sales increase of at least 10 percent.  Historical Parallel **********""What is happening in manufacturing today is precisely what happened in agriculture earlier in this century,"" Mr. Baumol said. With tractors, combines and other machinery replacing horses and people, food production shot up on American farms, while millions of Americans moved off the land to urban areas. Similarly, nearly three million people have been pushed out of manufacturing and mining since 1980, and they continue to migrate. **********Until about 1950, the migration was from the farms to the new ""job multiplier"" industries, as Paul Kennedy, the Yale historian, calls them: railroads, automobiles, highway construction, aircraft manufacturing and airlines. Now, the migration is to retailing, health care, restaurants, finance, security and other jobs in the service sector. **********These are the job-multiplier industries in late 20th-century America and they have, in fact, created enough jobs during the last decade or so to more than offset the job cutbacks. Last year, despite the cutbacks, two million people were added to the nation's total employment. Noting such figures, some economists describe the layoffs and downsizing not as job cutbacks, but as job ""dislocation"" -- the dislocation being the time it takes a worker laid off from A.T.& T., for example, to find a new job, quite likely at lower pay. **********But the service sector in this decade might turn out to be far less of a job generator than it has been until now, for there, too, technology and ""re-engineering"" are enabling companies to cut employment. **********Few companies illustrate this process more vividly than Sears, Roebuck, where 50,000 jobs eliminated from the merchandising division last year reduced the division's employment by 14 percent. And the cutbacks came while Sears was having a good year, with sales revenue rising at an annual rate of more than 10 percent. **********""We are asking a fundamental question: Are our workers adding value?"" said Anthony Rucci, executive vice president of merchandising for Sears. ""When you wade into this area of what can we do to add value, a whole world opens up."" **********Many of the cutbacks were suggested by the employees, and Mr. Rucci noted the example of the clerk who spent an hour at a copying machine every morning making 20 copies of a thick daily sales report for 20 managers. **********""The clerk noticed that the managers usually read only the report's summary,"" Mr. Rucci said, ""and he thought, 'What if I copied only the summary, and then if the managers asked for additional information, I could copy those pages.' And that is what he does now."" Possible Drawback **********Do people lose their jobs if they suggest ways to eliminate their tasks? ""That is a very complex question, a dynamic one,"" Mr. Rucci said, noting that while 50,000 jobs were eliminated last year, only 30,000 people left the company through layoffs, attrition and early retirement -- the rest being transferred to other Sears operations. **********""The bulk of the cutbacks were in administration and we are now down to where we think we want to be,"" Mr. Rucci said. ""We might even add salespeople on the floor at our stores, if revenue continues to show double-digit increases. But one thing I can tell you: There is a very strong commitment to get rid of needless staff work, tasks that don't add value, and that will continue."""

Jaffe, president of Paramount Communications Inc., will be out of a job when Viacom Inc. completes its acquisition of Paramount in the coming weeks, Viacom executives said today, confirming recent speculation of a shake-up at the Hollywood film studio. **********The Viacom executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today that Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman, told Mr. Jaffe the bad news on Monday, after attending a meeting with Viacom executives in Vail, Colo., where it was decided that Mr. Jaffe would no longer have a role in the company. **********Mr. Jaffe, whom Mr. Davis hired in 1991 to oversee Paramount's day-to-day operations, has been a big disappointment, industry analysts said, mainly because he had failed to turn around the company's studio, which has been a drain on earnings, after producing a stream of movies that flopped at the box office. **********Jerry Sherman, a spokesman for Paramount, said today that the company would not comment on rumors and that Mr. Jaffe remained the president and chief operating officer of Paramount. Telephone calls made to Mr. Jaffe's office in New York were not returned. **********The Viacom officials said they were considering several executives to replace Mr. Jaffe, but they would not divulge any names. But the officials said Mr. Jaffe's replacement would be based in Los Angeles, instead of New York, where Mr. Jaffe works. **********""There was a very strong feeling that running the studio from New York was not a good thing,"" a Viacom official said. ""Whoever heads the studio now will have to be based on the West Coast, that's for sure."" **********People close to Mr. Jaffe, 52, said it was unclear exactly what he would do next. His contract calls for Paramount to pay him an annual salary of $760,000 through February 1997, and Hollywood insiders have valued his stock and stock options at about $60 million. **********Mr. Jaffe, a hockey enthusiast, has said in recent months that he would be interested in buying the New York Rangers, and perhaps the New York Knicks basketball team, leading to speculation that Mr. Jaffe might assemble an investor group and make Viacom an offer for the two teams, their home base of Madison Square Garden, and the MSG cable network, which carries the teams' games and other sports events.  No Plans to Sell Main Assets **********But Viacom executives said there would be no main assets sold. And if they put these operations on the block, other would-be buyers would bid on the properties. **********While Viacom executives are still determining how to restructure the Paramount studio, Viacom officials said that big changes were in the works and that other top executives could be let go. **********Despite speculation in Hollywood that Sherry Lansing, chairwoman of Paramount's motion picture group and Mr. Jaffe's one-time producing partner, would follow Mr. Jaffe out the door, the Viacom officials said that she would be kept. Ms. Lansing and Mr. Jaffe were business partners for years, producing films like ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""Black Rain"" and ""The Accused."" **********The Viacom officials said a big change at the studio would be an increase in its output. In the past, Paramount has not come close to the 25 pictures that Mr. Jaffe had promised it would produce each year, but the Viacom officials said they planned for the studio to release 25 to 40 films a year.  Tighter Fiscal Restraints **********The increase in films will be accompanied by tighter fiscal restraints, the Viacom officials said. ""In the past, pictures have been very highly budgeted, which requires in our view some discipline,"" a Viacom executive said. ""We think that one of the things we bring to Paramount is our own creative abilities in the form of increasing product line with pictures that do not have the budgets of a ' Beverly Hills Cop 3.' "" **********Asked to evaluate Mr. Jaffe's performance at Paramount, Jessica Reif, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said: ""It's difficult to be positive. Each year, I have started with the assumption that Paramount would do better than the previous year, and I have been consistently disappointed and had to lower my estimates."" **********Ms. Reif said the film studio had continued to perform poorly, despite hits like ""The Firm,"" which grossed about $160 million in the United States, and ""Indecent Proposal,"" which made more than $110 million. She noted ""Sliver,"" ""Coneheads"" and ""A Thing Called Love"" as failures.                     --------------------       Bid for Hearing Rejected **********WILMINGTON, Del., March 1 (AP) -- The Delaware Chancery Court today rejected a request by Blockbuster Entertainment shareholders for a hearing to try to block the company's $1.25 billion purchase of Viacom Inc. stock. **********The decision came on the same day that Viacom's tender offer for Paramount Communications Inc. was to expire. It was important because Viacom planned to use the money from the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation to help pay for Paramount."

Dr. Thagard, a physician, was to have performed biomedical experiments with American equipment while aboard the Russian space station, which is known as Mir. **********But delays in the delivery of almost a ton of American gear has caused the launching date of its carrier, a large new Russian module for Mir, to fall months behind schedule. In response, NASA is struggling to find other ways for the physician to do productive work during his orbital stay. **********The mission is the first stage of space cooperation that is to culminate in the building of a giant $60 billion space station for astronauts of East and West.

His mission on the 110-foot-long, 90-ton Mir station is scheduled to begin March 14 and to end in June after the space shuttle Atlantis docks with the Russian outpost to pick him up and to rotate Russian crew members. **********The Russian module at the center of the storm is known as Spectr, which is Russian for spectrum. It is 40 feet long and weighs 20 tons and is to be the third large add-on module to the Mir station, the core of which was lofted by Moscow in 1986. **********Originally, Spectr was to have been launched into space next February, so its load of American equipment would be ready and waiting for Dr. Thagard. But problems cropped up in integrating the American gear on the ground, the biggest being customs delays. **********""There's nothing wrong with Russian customs, but we don't know how to work with them,"" the NASA Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, recently told the American Astronautical Society in announcing the delay. **********He added that developing a customs protocol was above his and his Russian counterpart's ""pay grade"" and that he had asked for help from Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who are to meet next month. **********""We may have to have some joint agreement that will not just be for the space station but because we are going to do things on Mars and other places,"" said Mr. Goldin, whose remarks were reported in Defense Daily. **********The launching of Spectr is being delayed until May 10, and after that its docking and integration into the Mir station will take some time. So Dr. Thagard will probably have only brief access during his stay to its 1,660 pounds of American biomedical research gear, which includes a centrifuge, a laptop computer, a freezer, a bicycle exerciser, a metabolic gas analyzer and various types of electronic recording gear. **********As a partial solution, NASA has made arrangements to have about 300 pounds of American equipment shipped up to Mir on a Russian supply ship that is scheduled to blast off on Feb. 15. The gear includes devices for cardiovascular monitoring. On April 5, after Dr. Thagard's March arrival, another shipment of equipment weighing 190 pounds is to be launched to the Mir outpost. **********The research to be done with such gear is considered vital to understanding Russian biomedical data on long-duration space flight. During the cold war, Moscow excelled in building astronaut outposts around the Earth. **********NASA sees the series of current cooperative missions as creating a reliable American yardstick by which to gauge the vast amount of Russian space research. **********James E. Oberg, an American expert on the Russian space program, said the Spectr delay was ""embarrassing"" because it arose so late and suddenly in the planning process. **********""This is a learning experience,"" he said. ""We've finding the pitfalls that have to be jumped over next time."" **********Mr. Clarke of NASA headquarters emphasized that the Spectr module would be available for further joint research. So far, at least four stays by American astronauts are scheduled for Mir. NASA astronauts John E. Blaha and Dr. Shannon W. Lucid were recently selected for the second visit, and will begin training in Star City, Russia, next February. **********""Spectr's going to be up there for rest of the lifetime of Mir, at least until 1997, so there'll be plenty of time for us to shake the stuff out and get into it,"" Mr. Clarke said. ""People who see this as the beginning of a collapse are looking at one small piece of a tree rather than the forest. We've made massive strides."""

There will be numbered bank accounts, and cows will still graze on mountain slopes and donate milk for cheese and chocolate. **********But an exhibition in the Historical Museum of this city on Lake Geneva casts scorn on many other fundamentals, shared by most Swiss, that give this prosperous nation a sense of righteous self-assurance. **********The theme of the exhibition is that the heroic history of the founding of Switzerland, whose 700th anniversary was celebrated with pomp throughout 1991, has almost no foundation in truth. Switzerland is not the world's oldest democracy, it contends, and it was not founded by Alpine peasants who gathered on a meadow in 1291 to defy the mighty Hapsburgs. **********In perhaps the unkindest cut of all, the exhibition relegates William Tell, the national hero, to the realm of folklore. **********""They invented all the great events and then put the invented figure of Tell into this landscape,"" Prof. Werner Meyer, who holds the chair of medieval history at Basel University, said in an interview in his cluttered office. **********Professor Meyer, aided by his assistants and students, is the creator of the exhibition. His role as chief proponent of the debunking school has earned him a loose-leaf binder full of angry letters, including a death threat, and abusive phone calls. Similar reactions were reported by Olivier Pavillon, curator of the Lausanne museum. **********Professor Meyer, 56, could easily play the protagonist in the many Tell folk dramas that enliven the tourist season. Burly and bearded, he wore a sleeveless, sheepskin-lined leather jacket and a silver bull's head on a chain around his tieless neck. His firm hands might easily have held the crossbow with which the hero of legend was forced to shoot the apple from his son's head after refusing to kowtow to an Austrian official. **********Professor Meyer and Mr. Pavillon see the Swiss who blocked this country's joining the process of European integration in a 1992 referendum as heirs of those who perpetuated the legend of Switzerland, officially known as the Helvetic Confederation, as a porcupine, suspicious of and armed against its neighbors. **********At the entrance to the exposition, visitors are greeted by a plywood caricature of Tell, offering a basket of real apples, and a statement by Mr. Pavillon noting that the opponents of European integration had used ""the most worn-out cliches on the founding of the Confederation and the porcupine spirit, as if historical research had produced nothing new."" **********The exhibit's life-size mannekins in period dress, mockups of houses and facsimiles of documents provoked keen attention and appreciative giggles from a class of high-school students. **********Sandra Crottaz and Julie Wicky, two of the students, said teachers had always presented the classical version of Switzerland's story but had suggested that some of it might be legend. ""This makes it clear,"" Miss Crottaz said. **********The standard version of history, as summarized by Professor Meyer, is that, incensed over brutal repression by the Hapsburg emperor's envoys, the peasants of three cantons in central Switzerland stormed and destroyed the mighty castles of the Hapsburg satraps and, on Aug. 1, 1291, gathered on Rutli Meadow in Uri Canton and took a solemn oath to unite against foreign oppression and form a free and democratic, egalitarian and independent state. **********""That is false,"" Professor Meyer said. ""It is not a question of interpretation but demonstrably false."" He said few historians would dispute the mythical character of the founding history. But he said there was ""a certain lag"" in transmitting the results of historical research to school administrators, textbooks, and above all politicians, who dispense ""edifying speeches"" on patriotic occasions. **********In the version accepted by most historians, no Hapsburg oppressors lived in central Switzerland in the 13th century, nor was there an uprising. What patriotic writers described as foreigners' castles were manor houses owned by Swiss. They were not attacked but gradually abandoned for the same reason that made the Hapsburgs attach little importance to their Swiss holdings -- the poverty and unproductivity of central Switzerland. **********The alliance of 1291 was merely an agreement after the death of a Hapsburg emperor to unite for self-defense because the Hapsburgs had so little interest in protecting the region. **********Professor Meyer said no evidence has been unearthed that the Tell figure existed. He became linked to the founding of Switzerland through his mythical assassination of the nonexistent Austrian envoy in the 15th century. In later centuries, the professor said, Tell was put through many other guises, was made to die a martyr's death and achieved near-saintly status in the Roman Catholic Church. **********The professor said he knew he was treading on even more delicate ground in demythifying the Rutli meadow saga. So sacred is the meadow that when World War II began, the commanding general of the Swiss Army gathered all officers there to pledge them to defend the homeland. **********""Nothing happened on Rutli in 1291 except some cows grazing,"" Professor Meyer said."

Using per-screen prices as a benchmark, the MGM cinemas could fetch $88 million to $125 million. **********Mr. Dixon said possible buyers of the MGM theaters included some of the leading circuit operators in the United States -- National Amusements, United Artists Theater Circuits Inc. and AMC Entertainment. **********AMC intends to look at the properties, said Peter C. Brown, the company's chief financial officer. Executives from National Amusements did not return telephone calls seeking comment. A United Artists spokesman declined to comment. **********""All have suggested they are looking for opportunities outside the U.S.,"" Mr. Dixon said. ""The American multiplex is highly exportable."" **********Europeans have been slower than Americans to consolidate movie theaters into complexes, which generate more revenue and more profit than theaters with one or two screens, he said. **********In October 1993, as part of an effort to revive Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the bank transferred most assets of the studio to a new bank- controlled holding company. The cinemas were sold to the subsidiary for $211 million. Even then, they needed refurbishing, a person familiar with the transaction said. **********Credit Lyonnais has hired the S. G. Warburg Group, the British investment house, to organize the sale, a bank spokesman said. An offering book describing the property is to be available next month. The spokesman declined to disclose the chain's revenue and debts. **********The proposed sale is the latest in a series of assets put up for auction this year by Credit Lyonnais, which recorded a loss of $1.2 billion last year. It plans to sell $3.5 billion worth of assets by the end of 1995; the studio is not currently among those assets. The bank must sell MGM by 1997 to comply with United States banking laws. **********The $3.5 billion in asset sales is aimed at preparing Credit Lyonnais for privatization by the French Government. Last week, the bank announced the sale of a 19 percent stake in Adidas International Holding, which controls the German shoe and sportswear maker."

Much more than the silverware and the checking account was at stake: after 19 years of marriage, the Johnsons has a prosperous business, ample retirement plans and real estate valued at millions of dollars. **********He got the business, a medical supply company he started in 1974, and she took most of the real estate. And both came away feeling the deal was fair. ""Revenge or vindictiveness never pay,"" said Ms. Johnson, who went on to form a real estate company. ""I felt it was our decision to work through this, and I have never regretted any part of my agreement."" **********It was ""a great divorce,"" said Violet Woodhouse, a certified financial planner who reviewed the settlement that Ms. Johnson and her lawyer drew up. His legal bills were $2,200, hers $5,000. Had the couple fought, Ms. Woodhouse said, attorneys' fees easily could have been $300,000. ""It was a $10 million deal,"" she said. **********Even if far less is at stake, the principle is the same. Full disclosure and cooperation can maximize each person's share of a divorce settlement, while minimizing taxes and legal fees. And even if the parting is less than friendly, divorce can yield a long-term financial plan for each spouse, lawyers and financial advisers say. **********The basic tasks are identifying all assets subject to division, determining their value and negotiating a split. **********None of that is easy. Increasingly, couples have hard-to-value assets like professional licenses and contingent retirement benefits, said Sam Margulies, the author of ""Getting Divorced Without Ruining Your Life"" (Fireside 1992) and a lawyer with a divorce mediation practice in Manhattan and Montclair, N.J. **********Is a law or medical practice the property of both spouses? (That depends on the state.) If it belongs to both, what percentage goes to each? (That's not the same in any two cases.) And what is it worth anyway? **********The first step is an inventory of property and income. Ms. Woodhouse, who is now a lawyer and co-author of ""Divorce and Money"" (Nolo 1993), recommends looking at the last five years of tax returns. These papers list many investments and assets sold, as well as income. She also recommends consulting every financial professional used over the years -- accountants, brokers, bankers, insurance agents. **********In a marriage of 10 years or more, a partner might be entitled to some retirement benefits, or other benefits, accrued by a spouse. Employers can provide copies of a spouse's retirement plan, although the request may have to be made by a lawyer. The Social Security Administration can supply information on its benefits (800 772-1213). **********The truly contested divorce might require a financial detective, often called a forensic accountant, to track hidden assets. Alan Dunninger, a forensic accountant in West Caldwell, N.J., said he looked for municipal bonds or investments in closely held corporations, which are not reported on tax returns, among other items. **********In a letter to spouses of clients, Mr. Dunninger asks for canceled checks, bank statements, insurance policies, closing statements from property sales and correspondence pertaining to passive investments. **********Not all assets are marital property, subject to division by a court at divorce. (Generally, gifts and inheritances directed to one spouse are excluded, as is property acquired before marriage and kept separate from marital assets.) **********Nor is all property subject to equal division, except in the handful of ""community property"" states. Most states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, use ""equitable distribution,"" awarding a greater share to the bigger contributor. **********But gathering the information is essential, Ms. Woodhouse said. ""We are talking about the complete resolution and distribution of literally a lifetime of gathering wealth and debt,"" she said. ""People don't want to deal with it. I recommend that they work on one thing at a time."" **********The next step is valuing assets. This requires appraisals, not just of real estate and businesses, but of antiques, cars, boats and jewelry. Determining the current value of a pension might require an actuary. **********Typically, each side hires its own appraiser. If the wife is likely to keep the house, she seeks a conservative estimate -- perhaps from an appraiser who works for mortgage lenders -- while the husband might go to a real estate broker. **********A better choice, Mr. Margulies said, is for one spouse to make a list of appraisers and to have the other choose from it. (It's even easier, of course, if the couple can agree at the outset on a disinterested appraiser.) **********In any event, certain businesses do not lend themselves to appraisals. ""Take a law or medical practice,"" he said. ""For all intents and purposes, you can't sell it. It's not like the hardware store."" **********Even more conventional family businesses are subject to widely disparate valuations, and valuators are expensive. Charges of $20,000 to $50,000 are not unusual. The single largest expense in the Johnsons' divorce was the appraisal of their company by Peat Marwick. The bill came to about $100,000. **********Finally, many people overlook tax liabilities in valuing assets. To take a common example, compare $10,000 in stock and $10,000 in a certificate of deposit. If the stock was bought five years ago and followed the general drift of the market, capital gains taxes would be owed on $3,000 or $4,000 if sold. The C.D. carries next to no tax liability, because tax has been paid each year on the interest earned. **********Similarly, the spouse who gets the house may well be taxed on its eventual sale if the proceeds are plowed into a less expensive home. In that case, Federal capital gains tax of 28 percent will be owed on the difference between the sale proceeds (adjusted for house improvements and other costs) and the cost of the new home.  In the typical case where the wife keeps the house, the problem arises when she can no longer afford to keep it up, said Cicily Carson Maton, a certified financial planner in Chicago who specializes in divorce.  ""Courts tend to want to see women stay in their homes,"" she said. ""I tell women that's fine, but run the numbers first."" It's worth noting that people over 55 are allowed a one-time exclusion of $125,000 from capital gains tax. **********With such information in hand -- or, more likely, two sets of information -- the spouses can negotiate. Mr. Margulies suggests that each make a list of assets, assigning values and proposed percentage dispositions, and then look at the total. The margin of difference on the whole estate may be surprisingly small. **********""The adversary system exaggerates the divergence,"" he said. ""Typically people are very close, often within 5 or 10 percent."" **********The Johnsons went further. After considering the tax hit on the sale of two commercial buildings they owned, Ms. Johnson suggested they keep them in a business partnership. **********""She saw no reason to sell,"" Mr. Johnson recalled. ""I said, 'Excuse me? We're getting a divorce.' "" Then what? He accepted the offer."

But while most nursing homes are following this trend to what the industry calls subacute care, the shift has been especially profitable for a handful of relatively small companies. **********Integrated Health Services, based in Owings Mills, Md., expects to get more than half its profits from subacute care this year. Analysts project 24 percent earnings growth in 1994 following a spectacular 54 percent jump in 1993. Integrated hit a record high Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and surpassed it yesterday, closing at $36.75, up 25 cents. **********Dr. Robert N. Elkins, founder and chairman of Integrated, is going after contracts with health maintenance organizations and other managed care companies that cover large numbers of subscribers in California, Florida and other Southern states. **********Joel M. Ray, a health care analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said Integrated was also offering deals to take over subacute patients of big hospital chains. ""They want to see if they can get on both sides of the action,"" he said. **********Robert M. Mains at the First Albany Corporation recommends both Integrated Health Services and the Mariner Health Group, a start-up that turned its first profit last year. Mariner, based in Mystic, Conn., rose $1.125, to a year's high of $25.625 yesterday in Nasdaq trading. **********Other subacute care companies include Arbor Health Care, based in Lima, Ohio, the Mediplex Group, which is being acquired by the Sun Healthcare Group, a nursing home chain, and Vencor, based in Louisville, Ky., which operates intensive care hospitals for long-term patients. **********""Mariner is almost a subacute care pure play,"" Mr. Mains said. It seeks patients recovering from hip and knee surgery or strokes who can go home after 20 to 45 days. Such patients use more expensive therapy and medications in the first days, he noted. Mariner recently announced a stock-swap merger with the Pinnacle Care Corporation, based in Nashville, a private company specializing in rehabilitation therapy. **********By pursuing managed care business, Mr. Mains added, the subacute care companies avoid the errors of a number of companies that provide home care. Some shunned managed care customers, who typically demand price concessions. When most large employers embraced managed care, home care profits shrank. **********But some analysts are shifting their recommendations as subacute care shares soar. And two key insiders have taken advantage of the run-up recently to cash in on their investments. Dr. Elkins of Integrated Health Services sold 75,000 shares in December. He announced plans to sell 225,000 more shares this year, or 13 percent of his stake, including stock options. At Mariner Health, Arthur W. Stratton, the chairman, sold 56,500 shares in December. He said it was the first chance for officers to sell stock since Mariner went public last June. The money, about $920,000, went to an education fund for his four young sons, he said. **********Deborah J. Lawson at Alex. Brown rates Integrated as ""neutral,"" noting that prices were about 20 times projected 1994 earnings, a jump from 14.5 in November. Ms. Lawson recommends two less specialized nursing home chains: Regency Health Services, based in Newport Beach, Calif., and Genesis Health Ventures, based in Kennett Square, Pa. **********Larry Feinberg, head of Oracle Partners, a New York firm specializing in health care investments, owns ""a lot of Mariner shares and a little Integrated,"" he said.

For people at either end of the conversation to be able to speak at the same time, one need only have bought a ""full-duplex"" conference telephone. There are good ones available at prices ranging down from $1,000 to $150, rather than up from $10,000 to $30,000, as the article suggests. The ""rainbarrel effect"" is an unrelated problem that can generally be overcome at no cost. It occurs because a speaker is too far from the microphone. A good rule of thumb is that a user should be close enough to touch a speakerphone with an outstretched arm. These days, there is no need at all to experience a speakerphone as an ""odious contraption."" It may be harder to fix its users. MARTIN C. J.

They amount to a bet that the dollar will strengthen against the yen, something it has not done very much in the last year. **********The warrants were issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings and by International Finance Corp., and each series will have a two- year trading period, expiring in March of 1996. The intrinsic value of each increases roughly by a dollar whenever the dollar rises by one yen above an initial floor level called the strike price. The Lehman warrants' strike price is 104.2 yen; that of the IFC variety 105.25. **********As with other highly leveraged derivative products, the actual trading price of the warrants will likely be higher than their intrinsic worth, with the premium diminishing toward expiration. Should the dollar be trading below the strike price at expiration, the warrants will expire worthless and anyone who bought and held them would lose the entire investment. **********The warrants opened at $6.50 to $6.75 but were trading earlier this week in the $7 to $8 range, reflecting a modest rise in the dollar against the yen."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/21/business/polish-investors-rush-in-as-others-fear-to-tread.html,,1994-02-21,,876,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Polish Investors Rush In As Others Fear to Tread,Polish Investors Rush In As Others Fear to Tread," **********For most first-time investors in Poland, price-to-earnings ratios are an abstract concept. All they know is that their neighbor or friend just bought a new Japanese car with profits from the stock market. **********The rush of small investors can easily be seen in the lines waiting outside brokers' offices. Such demand has created jobs ranging from paid stand-ins to line-busters, who take advantage of staged diversions to cut in front of people who have been waiting. In one case, a near-riot resulted when 60 people forced their way to the front of a line on the opening day of an initial public offering and snapped up all the available shares. **********But there is growing concern among knowledgeable Poles and Westerners in Warsaw that too many of the investors are inexperienced first-time buyers who have put all their savings into the market. The worry among professionals is that small investors will suffer the most when the market begins to fall. Buyers Who Can't Afford Risk **********Rzeczpospolita, a Warsaw daily, said last week that 19 percent of the 800,000 subscribers to the public offering of Bank Slaski in December were unemployed and a significant number were students or retired people. A report earlier this month by Poland's 39 brokerage houses said the number of accounts increased to 400,000 from 300,000 the month before. **********""Investors here never ask fundamental questions,"" said a Polish broker who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Many investors buying shares don't even know what the company produces, and some even place orders for the index, thinking it's a listed company,"" the broker added jokingly. **********But the lines outside stockbrokers' offices are seen by some investors as a more accurate barometer of performance than the composite index of the stocks that are trading. **********In January, the young Polish index -- the Warszawski Indeks Geldowy, or WIG -- rose from 12,439.0 to 16,808.6, and appeared well on track to defending its 1993 performance title, when it soared 717 percent in dollar terms and was rated as the world's best-performing market by the International Finance Corporation. **********But this month, a statement by former Finance Minister Jerzy Osiatynski that the market was a ""seriously overvalued bubble,"" prompted a selloff that drove down the index nearly 19 percent in three trading sessions. The exchange has gained steam since the correction, with the index rebounding 25 percent, to just above 19,000. Average daily volume has increased fourfold, to $133 million this year from $33 million in 1993. **********The rush to invest in the Warsaw market's 23 offerings is fueled not just by the sharp rise of the last year but also by Poland's lack of alternative investments. Interest paid on treasury bills and Government bonds, the only other liquid nonbank investment vehicles, have barely kept pace with Polish inflation, recently 37 percent. Adding to the market excitement was a decision last year by the nation's central bank to lower interest rates on deposits. **********But tales of overnight riches are the real driving force behind the market's continued activity. For example, the price of Bank Slaski rose to $310 a share from $24 in the five weeks after its initial offering in December. Another stock, Vistula Clothing, has increased sixteenfold in six months. Three other stocks have doubled in value so far this year. **********One warning sign for Polish investors is that despite the startling performance of the Warsaw market, it has failed to capture the imagination of international fund managers. **********Its combined price-to-earnings multiple is 33, the highest in Europe, and some offerings trade at 180 times earnings. ""Clearly some stocks are grossly overvalued,"" said Maciej Radziwill, head of research at Creditstat Securities S.A., Poland's only foreign-owned licensed broker. **********But Mr. Radziwill remarked that with this country's enormous growth potential, it would be unfair to compare these ratios with those, for example, of mature American companies. **********Fund managers in the West are further deterred by the young market's gyrations. ""The market lost 19 percent in three days of panic selling earlier this month,"" Mr. Radziwill said. ""In New York, that would have sent half of Wall Street out the window. Here it was business as usual."" **********Since the Polish exchange began trading three years ago in a hall at the former Communist Party headquarters, it has stood in the shadow of other emerging markets. China, Turkey and Malaysia, despite lesser gains, have all attracted greater attention from institutional investors. **********Even by the standards of emerging markets, the Warsaw exchange is small and illiquid. Only 23 listings, with a total capitalization of less than $6 billion, are traded on the floor. More than half the shares of the companies listed are not available for trading because of numerous agreements reached between investors and the Ministry of Privatization, under which shares were purchased on the stipulation that they not be traded for a certain period of time. **********Prof. Grzegorz Domanski, president of the Exchange Supervisory Board, said that only 60 percent of the companies applying to trade their shares on the exchange fulfilled his board's strict listing requirements and received permission to trade."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/26/world/last-us-troops-leave-somalia-what-began-mission-mercy-closes-with-little.html,Donatella Lorch,1994-03-26,,1814,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Last of the U.S. Troops Leave Somalia; What Began as a Mission of Mercy Closes With Little Ceremony,Last of the U.S. Troops Leave Somalia; What Began as a Mission of Mercy Closes With Little Ceremony," **********There was no official flag-lowering today, just a brief handshake between an American Marine officer and an Egyptian captain at the airport. Then, shortly before noon, after a dozen Marine helicopters lifted off in a blizzard of sand, the remaining amphibious vehicles were driven single file into the ocean to waiting ships, and the American expedition in Somalia came to a close. **********With the 1,100 marines went the frustrations and contradictions of a mission that the Government called Operation Restore Hope, which for a time lived up to its name. When the first American troops waded ashore into the glare of television lights 15 months ago, they carried with them the hopes of a world appalled by anarchy and famine. Initially they succeeded in restoring order and helping to end the widespread starvation brought on by civil war. On that first day, Dec. 9, 1992, troops were greeted by cheering Somali crowds.  Scavenging What Remains **********Today there were none. Instead, there was scavenging and even looting at the American camps even as troops were packing. Men, women and children sifted through mounds of garbage and searched empty huts, carrying away brooms, mattresses, prepackaged military meals. **********""We accomplished our mission, the safe withdrawal of all troops,"" Lieut. David Wolcott of Newtown, Conn., who was in the last amphibious vehicle to leave, said to reporters. ""I suggest you get out of here while you can."" **********The city remained calm, almost oblivious to the American departure. At the airport gates, however, scores of Somalis pushed and shoved to get in, and several got into fistfights with soldiers. Armed Somalis brazenly walked the streets.  Packing Up Regrets **********In recent months, banditry and looting have increased in the cities and countryside. Although 19,000 United Nations troops remain, the American physical presence, with tanks and helicopters and a force as large as 26,000, acted as a psychological deterrent. United States and United Nations officials say they fear that unless Somali efforts for a political solution succeed, conditions will deteriorate. **********""The Americans and the U.N. came in with a kind of arrogance,"" said a senior United Nations official. ""Their psychological operations were naive, their intelligence very poor. They didn't speak the language. They met with few Somalis. This has damaged the credibility of the U.N. "" **********The atmosphere now is one of anxiety about the future and regrets over shattered illusions and mistakes, both military and political, in an operation that cost hundreds of American casualties. Anarchy has not yet yielded to stability. And the United States may never again be so eager to embark on such a complex mission of mercy. **********Its military commanders learned the cost of turning a relief mission into a political fight, of becoming involved in a foreign expedition without first clearly defining its scope and of allying themselves with a multinational force that was at times poorly coordinated. **********Ultimately, what might have become a blueprint for future missions evolved into an unsuccessful manhunt for a Somali faction leader, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, with heavy casualties for both sides. **********It ended with an acknowledgement by the Clinton Administration and the United Nations that their military policies had been wrong and that a solution to the fighting in Somalia could only be achieved by the Somalis themselves. **********Yet there were successes acknowledged by both the Somalis and relief officials. The famine has ended, and in much of the countryside life is returning to normal. Hundreds of thousands of children were vaccinated, wells were dug, roads were built and farmers returned to their fields under military protection. **********And there are positive political signs. After repeated delays, all 15 warring Somali factions represented by General Aidid and his chief rival, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, signed a reconciliation pact in Nairobi on Thursday that calls for a cease-fire, repudiates violence and sets a date for a future reconciliation conference. **********""Everybody seems to be tired of the stalemate, insecurity and chaos that is happening in Somalia,"" said Salimatu Khan, a United Nations spokeswoman. ""We hope this time the leaders are well-meaning."" **********But for the military, it is a bittersweet finale. Manhunt Makes the Man **********Of the 100,000 Americans who served here since December 1992, 30 were killed and 175 wounded, many of them in the search for General Aidid. Eventually, the United States stopped pursuing him, but military officials say the hunt transformed General Aidid into one of the most powerful politicians in Somalia, and gave him a seat once again at the international bargaining table. **********The departure of the American troops will not be noticed on the streets of Mogadishu. Since the end of July, American and United Nations troops, unwilling to risk casualties, pulled back into their encampments and compounds, dispatching few patrols. Even after October, when thousands of additional American soldiers arrived with heavy armor and repeatedly said they planned to retake the streets, they rarely ventured out of their compounds. They even built a new road for tanks to avoid areas of Mogadishu loyal to General Aidid. **********The mission's expansion and development plans throughout Somalia promoted in the early months have been pared down considerably. The operation was handicapped in part by United Nations bureaucracy, lack of manpower and money, but the last year was also filled with misjudgments and miscalculations, by both the United States and the United Nations. **********""There's no such thing as immaculate intervention,"" said Maj. Gen.  Thomas Montgomery, who was both deputy commander of United Nations forces and commander of the separate United States contingent. ""The U.N. provided a mandate assuming everything was in place. Things weren't in place at all. Frankly the U.S. found itself doing a lot more."" Bureaucratic Disarray **********The United Nations contingent suffered at times from a lack of internal cooperation. Units from its multinational force often waited for orders from their own country, an arrangement that fueled instability in Mogadishu, United Nations and United States military officials say. **********As a relief effort, the American intervention was a success even if a somewhat fragile one, United Nations and relief agency officials say. When the first troops landed, their task was limited to restoring order and insuring that food reached the hungry. An estimated 300,000 Somalis had already died of starvation during more than a year of civil war that followed the ouster of President Mohammed Siad Barre in 1991. **********Within a month the Americans had moved into the famine-destroyed towns of Baidoa, Bardera and Kismayu and had begun escorting food convoys. **********""Was it necessary and was it needed?"" said Staffan de Mistura, the Unicef director in Somalia. ""Definitely yes. It all began with the images of tens of thousands of dying children."" **********By May, the famine was largely over and reconstruction had begun in a country with no existing infrastructure. Since the beginning of 1993, the world food program brought in $62 million worth of food, or 132,000 metric tons that were then distributed by aid agencies, in particular C.A.R.E. **********The largest relief organization in Somalia, Unicef, vaccinated 753,000 children, built 3,700 wells and brought 62,000 children back to school. **********But the work is not complete. About 60,000 displaced people in Mogadishu still need food aid, and malnutrition rates are rising, Unicef officials say, and there are about 150,000 refugees in neighboring Kenya. As the United States leaves, one of the worst outbreaks of cholera in two decades is sweeping through Somalia. Social Problems, Military Force **********But if it began as a relief mission, it evolved and was run as a military operation, with the specific political objective of rebuilding a Government on a nonexistent model. There was no consistent policy maker and today there is still no Somali government. **********""You can't solve social problems with a military force,"" said Lieut. Col. Raoul Archambault, the executive officer of the Falcon Brigade, 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum, N.Y., in a recent interview. His men were involved in some of the heaviest fighting. ""Most people don't understand what total anarchy is. This was the Wild West or pretty close to it. Disarmament was an impossibility."" **********In May, plans were made to expand militarily into the north as well as to gain full control over the streets of Mogadishu. Little materialized. Troops basically stayed in a handful of towns, and in Mogadishu, snipers and ambushes forced the peacekeeping troops to hunker down in their compounds. **********""The mistake was building from scratch after the mission started, "" said General Montgomery. ""We had only 25 percent of the staff on the ground -- 16,000 out of 28,000 troops. The Indians for example just arrived four months ago. There was no logistics structure in place."" **********Within several months of their arrival, the United Nations and the United States began attempting to limit General Aidid's power, in large part because they considered him too independent and anti-United Nations, officials say. These decisions proved shortsighted. The Somali general, still well armed, fought back. **********In June, after General Aidid's militias ambushed and killed 24 Pakistani peacekeeping forces, the United Nations, led by American forces, attacked him in turn, bombing his strong points. The decision to bomb was in large part an American one with United States diplomats in Mogadishu pressuring the United Nations special representative, Adm. Jonathan Howe, a retired American naval officer, to take action, officials said. **********The search for General Aidid became a yardstick for American operations. In an effort to neutralize the faction leader's power base, Admiral Howe branded General Aidid a terrorist and posted a $25,000 reward for his arrest. United States Army rangers were brought in to capture the general. **********There were serious miscalculations. United Nations officials now say that General Aidid's military strength and his willingness to fight were significantly underestimated and that the intelligence network set up by the United Nations and the United States was not only inefficient but rife with double agents. Changes in Command **********From June to October, the United Nations and the United States continued to insist that their military operations were successfully undercutting the general's power base. On Oct. 3, General Aidid's militia killed 18 Americans and wounded more than 70. More than 300 Somalis were killed. **********These misjudgments had a political toll. In October, Robert Gosende, the American envoy to Somalia, was unexpectedly replaced when he was in Washington for consultations with the State Department. And in February Admiral Howe heard about his own dismissal on the BBC. **********""It is easy to criticize the Americans, "" said Mohammed Jirdeh, a prominent Somali businessman. ""But you have to look at the desperate situation here before they came. They did a lot of good and they gave it a good try. But the Americans should have known better. They set deadlines. In our society we have no deadlines. The Americans kept on shifting their commitments. They never incorporated the Somalis in their decisions. There was a misperception of cultures."""

Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin are also to decide whether Palestinians will be stationed on the Allenby Bridge, which connects the West Bank and Jordan. 'Geared to Top Speed' **********Israeli forces are scheduled to begin withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho within 24 hours of the signing, and hundreds of Palestinian police officers will enter Gaza and Jericho in the coming days to take control of security, negotiators said. **********""Everything is geared to top speed towards the implementation of this agreement immediately after the signing on Wednesday,"" Dr. Shaath said. ""The police are going to be ready. We have received now the detailed news about Israeli withdrawal."" The new Palestinian civil administrators will begin to arrive in Gaza and Jericho this week, he added. **********The accord would end 27 years of Israeli occupation in Gaza and Jericho. The two sides have agreed to negotiate a final peace plan covering the rest of the West Bank once the self-rule agreement is completed. **********Jibril al-Rujoub, an adviser to Mr. Arafat, told reporters that Israel had agreed to free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners and allow 40 to 50 deportees into the occupied territories on the day of the signing. The prisoners will be the first of some 5,000 whom the Israelis have promised to release in the two-week period after the signing. **********But the two sides have yet to agree on the fate of some 3,500 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom follow the Islamic militant movement Hamas. **********Dr. Shaath said a legal deadlock of several weeks had been settled. The dispute was over who would have jurisdiction over people arrested in Gaza and Jericho."

Only two agencies, Stein Robaire Helm and Livingston & Company, won more awards. **********Mr. Mongkolkasetarin won four Belding bowls for his offbeat work for the Pacific Snax Corporation. One of his newspaper advertisements for a Pacific Snax product, Jurassic Snax, included this line: ""Don't be squeamish about eating dinosaurs. They'd eat you if they could."" **********Mr. Mongkolkasetarin said: ""I know people who have been working 10 years and never get a Belding. To this day, I'm still in disbelief."" **********His next assignment, due by the end of the month, is to design packaging for another Pacific Snax product under a licensing deal with Turner Broadcasting System. The item is tied to the film version of ""The Flintstones,"" scheduled for release on May 27; the name is still a toss-up, he said, between Yabba Dabba Doos and Yabba Dabba Snax. **********In the meantime, Mr. Mongkolkasetarin has been deluged with queries from prospective clients, including four other regional packaged-goods marketers. He has also been offered a part-time job with DGWB, an agency in Irvine, Calif. **********""I don't know how I'm going to handle all this,"" he said, adding that he also has a part-time teaching post in advertising at Long Beach State University, from which he graduated in 1990. **********The current situation of Mr. Mongkolkasetarin is a stark contrast to his fate in 1991, when, as an assistant art director, he was among 33 employees who lost jobs when Saatchi & Saatchi closed the Irvine agency, once known as Cochrane Chase, Livingston & Company. The agency at one point had $100 million in billings and clients like the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain and Lucky supermarkets. **********Carolyn A. Johnson, an ex-Cochrane employee who initially hired Mr. Mongkolkasetarin, remembered his video resume for its unprofessional yet wacky quality. **********""He has a sweet, innocent personality,"" she said, ""but in his work, he's a wild man."" **********Jim Real, a copywriter, also praised Mr. Mongkolkasetarin. ""He'll take ideas that are just headlines and create a visual image that is just stunning,"" said Mr. Real, one of three DGWB employees who moonlight for Acme Advertising, the monicker Mr. Mongkolkasetarin has given his small agency. **********""Cochrane Chase's going under is the greatest thing that has happened to him,"" Mr. Real added. **********Mr. Mongkolkasetarin named his agency Acme, a public domain name remembered for its use in the Warner Brothers ""Roadrunner"" cartoons, to capture the frenetic fun that he wants his work to embody. The company had billings of $60,000 last year. **********At the outset, Acme was a family business with Mr. Mongkolkasetarin, tapping his three younger brothers for help. Acme's first client was their mother, Am, a dressmaker. She and their father, Steve, an architect, immigrated from Thailand in 1968. **********Fortunately, after Cochrane's demise, Pacific Snax, an agency client on whose account Mr. Mongkolkasetarin had worked, retained him. **********""Sakol's work has absolutely been beneficial to our company,"" said Richard R. Damion, the snack maker's chairman and chief executive. ""He's very insightful for a young man.' **********Even as Cochrane was closing, Mr. Damion, along with other investors, acquired the unprofitable Pacific Snax from private owners. The company had sales of $500,000; its primary line was Kettle Klassics, a premium potato chip distributed in Southern California. **********Now based in Newport Beach, Calif., Pacific Snax sold 20 percent of its shares to the public last year, when the company reported income of $200,000 and revenue of $2 million. Jurassic Snax are being sold in seven countries. They were on sale in the United States at the end of the theatrical release of ""Jurassic Park"" and will be reintroduced in October, when ""Jurassic Park"" is scheduled to be released on videocassette. **********""With our technology and his design, we think revenue should exceed $15 million,"" Mr. Damion said."

From the muddy villages to the capital's slums and middle class neighborhoods, candidates are beating the turf in a fevered final campaign pitch. **********On Monday, March 28, Ugandans will vote in the first national election in 14 years. But diplomats and many Ugandans say it is the first opportunity for free and fair elections in three decades and a critical turning point for the country. **********After two decades of civil war, death and terror, the election is offering a welcome change. Enthusiastic crowds gather to listen to the campaign debates, often peppered with mudslinging. **********Many Ugandans are visibly elated by the prospect of voting, and an estimated 70 to 80 percent of those eligible have registered. Yet many say they are not quite sure what they will be voting for.

Most critical for the future, the assembly will also decide whether the country will finally adopt a multiparty system. **********""This election will determine Uganda's future and who will be on top,"" said a Western diplomat in Kampala.

""These are very significant elections. For the first time we will have a national document that will incorporate everyone's opinions and ideas. That is not the case in many countries in Africa."" **********Yet constitution-making is confusing. ""The majority of Ugandans don't understand what they're voting for,"" said Mr. Oguttu. ""Some think they are voting for maintaining Museveni in power. Very few understand they're going to make a constitution because they don't know what a constitution is."" **********The draft constitution has been painstakingly put together. About 100 pages long, it took four years to write and was completed only after the Government reviewed 6,000 written opinions from around the country. It provides for pluralism, proportional representation, citizenship, federalism and the future of Uganda's former kingdoms. More ThanOver 1,000 Candidates **********The more than 1,000 candidates -- including several Government ministers -- are running as individuals. But their affiliations are well known, either with the President's National Resistance Movement or the two other major parties that existed prior to 1986, the Uganda People's Congress and the Democratic Party. **********In a country where nationality and citizenship is a sensitive issue, several opposition members have been charged with sedition after accusing unidentified Government officials, and indirectly the President, of being Rwandan rather than Ugandan. **********Mr. Museveni has forbidden his ministerial candidates from arriving at political meetings in Government cars and he has allowed the opposition to appear on Government-run television. **********In rural Uganda the biggest hurdle has been voter education. Opposition members and Western diplomats say the Government's effort did little to explain the complexities of a constituent assembly, limiting its scope to urging Ugandans to vote and explaining secret balloting. Most of the candidates are running on populist platforms, promising everything from jobs to clinics to wells, none of which are issues in the constitution. **********But even if they are not clear on the issues, many Ugandans are excited just to have a chance to vote. **********""My vote is my secret,"" said Gaster Kirigwajjo, 34, a restaurant owner who had come to listen to a local candidate meeting. ""Voting shows we are freeing our country. I want democracy. I want the restoration of the monarchy with political powers. But of course I would vote for Museveni. He brought us out of chaos."""

In the process, it has jumped well ahead of rivals and chastened those who had dismissed its plan as pie-in-the-sky. **********Iridium Inc., the company formed by Motorola four years ago, intends to launch 66 small satellites and build a $3.4 billion global wireless phone network to allow people to talk over pocket-sized telephones anywhere in the world. **********On Tuesday, Iridium announced in Japan that it had obtained $733.5 million in fresh equity capital, supplementing $840 million that Iridium raised in 1993 and completing its effort to raise money. With satellite construction already under way, company executives now say that they can finance the rest of the cost through debt offerings. **********To be sure, things have not gone exactly according to plan. Motorola had to chip in more of its own money than it planned; instead of reducing its stake in Iridium to 15 percent, as it had hoped, Motorola will end up with 28 percent. The current goal, to begin service in 1998, is about two years behind the plan as originally outlined in 1990. **********Still, many industry analysts express amazement that Motorola has gotten so far, given the size of the project and doubts about the market opportunity. **********""I'm in awe of Motorola's power,"" said Herschel Shosteck, a consultant in Silver Spring, Md., who specializes in wireless communications and has been a longtime skeptic about Iridium. ""We gave about 0.6 percent probability of this happening. This demonstrates the enormous power of Motorola in the world."" **********In addition to being expensive, the Iridium system is more ambitious technologically than any rival system. Each satellite would be loaded with computerized switching equipment to relay signals to companion satellites around the world. In theory, a call made by a person using a pocket phone in the Antarctic could travel directly to another phone in Calcutta without ever going through a land-based telephone network. **********Rival companies are proposing much simpler systems with price tags that range from less than $1 billion to $2.6 billion. But the closest competitor -- Globalstar, a joint venture between the Loral Corporation and Qualcomm Inc. -- has raised only $271 million of the $1.8 billion it will need. The others have yet to line up any substantial outside commitments. **********""The financing speaks for itself,"" said John Windolph, an Iridium spokesman. ""Any skeptic that did exist would certainly have to bow to our success."" **********If anything, the competition is becoming more intense. Inmarsat, a London-based consortium that provides maritime satellite communications, announced last week that it would try to raise $1 billion for a global wireless system that uses 12 large satellites. Inmarsat is backed strongly by Comsat, the company that represents the United States Government in world satellite organizations. **********""We looked at all the possible approaches, and we concluded that this was the best one,"" said Ramin Khadem, chief financial officer of Inmarsat, in an interview today. **********Motorola has searched the world for investors, and it has been rebuffed by some seemingly natural partners. Giant telephone companies like AT&T, British Telecommunications and France Telecom have all refrained from getting involved. The same is true for the seven regional Bell companies, which together have more than $80 billion in revenue. **********Iridium's biggest investors are from Japan. The DDI Corporation, Japan's second-largest telephone company, is the dominant partner in a consortium of 17 Japanese companies that invested about $235 million. Other Japanese investors include Sony, Mitsubishi and Mitsui. **********In Germany, Motorola signed up Veba A.G., which owns electric utilities and local telephone services and invested $140 million. In South America, it has signed up a consortium led by a huge Brazilian construction company, Inepar. Korean Mobile Telecommunications will put up $70 million. **********In the United States, Sprint has decided to invest $70 million. Raytheon, which is building the satellite antenna assemblies, and Lockheed, which is building the satellite chassis, are investing about $35 million apiece. **********Motorola will be paid by Iridium to build the system, and its primary goal is to be a supplier of equipment. **********But the partners could be left holding the bag. Cellular-telephone systems are being built even in some of the most remote areas of the world, and ordinary phone systems are being modernized as well. That may reduce the demand for special satellite telephones, which at $2 or $3 a minute would be expensive to use. **********Iridium executives say their system offers something more: a single telephone that can be used anywhere and can switch from cellular operation to satellite modes, as needed. Aiming at serving an elite group of business travelers, Iridium is banking that customers will pay as much as $3 a minute for the freedom to roam at will without changing either phones or phone numbers."

In contrast, the Nasdaq composite index, which is less often used in arbitrage, has had deeper losses. The other stock indexes are bound to drop eventually, these analysts say, because of overpriced and under-yielding stocks. **********Yesterday the Dow industrials rose 4.03 points, to 3,745.95, while the broader S.& P. 500 fell 0.22 point, to 453.11. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.48 points, to 741.23. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, four stocks dropped for every three that rose, with 1,282 declining stocks and 943 advancing stocks. **********On the New York Stock Exchange 300.2 million shares changed hands, about 4 percent higher than this year's average of 288 million shares. **********Despite the small movements in the main indexes, ""there was quite a reaction to the day's news,"" especially to investors' speculation that Orange County might declare bankruptcy, said Todd Clark, senior director of equity trading at Mabon Securities. **********But the reaction was mostly in the bond market, Mr. Clark said. Yesterday traders were selling stocks to buy shorter-term fixed-income securities, he added, and ""you can see that in the flattening of the yield curve, where people don't want to be at risk in the 30-years when you've got this uncertainty in Orange County."" **********For example, less than 1 percentage point of interest separates a Government security that matures in one year (7.12 percent yield) and one that matures in 2024 (7.84 percent). That lowers the cost of corporate borrowing and helps stocks. **********The news that Fidelity Magellan was canceling its year-end distribution because of a mistake in calculation, was eventually shrugged off by market professionals as having little consequence for money flows into stock funds. **********""When the average I.R.A. holder looks at his mutual fund statement next month and sees a minus sign, he'll say 'whoa,' "" said David D. Holt, vice president, research and strategy, for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. ""But people are slow to change. They won't let one year stampede them out of equities."" **********Conmed rose 3 1/2, to 26 1/4, on news that it would buy a rival medical products company, Birtcher Medical Systems, for $16.4 million in stock. **********Checkmate Electronics, which makes equipment that electronically reads checks and other documents, fell 2, to 7 1/2, after an analyst at Raymond James & Associates lowered his assessment to ""hold,"" from ""buy."" Intelligent Electronics Inc. fell 3 1/8, to 9 3/8, after an article in The Wall Street Journal questioned the company's marketing practices. The company disputed the article. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.23 point, to 247.85, and the American Stock Exchange market-value index fell 1.24 points, to 431.01."

Miles resigned as the company's chairman and chief executive in June. **********Mr. Miles's departure followed a decision by the board in May not to split the company into two or more entities, isolating its tobacco holdings and their attendant legal and regulatory difficulties from its food and brewing properties. Shares Had Declined **********At that time company officials spoke of considering steps -- including a larger dividend and a stock repurchase -- to placate investors who had seen their value of their shares decline. Concerns over Philip Morris's potential liability for the health problems of smokers, as well as fears of increased regulations and excise taxes, have weighed heavily on the stock in recent years. **********""People were looking for a dividend increase but not one of this size,"" Emanuel Goldman, who follows Philip Morris for Paine Webber, said. ""That, along with the share repurchase announcement, sends a message that the new management is keenly interested in their investors. **********""The split-up is on the back burner,"" he added. Indeed, the company made no mention of a possible split. **********""Today's actions demonstrate our steadfast commitment to enhancing stockholder value,"" R. William Murray, the company's new chairman, said in a statement. ""Our continuing strong business results and cash flows allow us the financial flexibility to deliver superior returns."" Trading Heavy **********The stock traded heavily this morning, before being halted at $58.875 for about an hour pending company news. Philip Morris shares closed at $61, up $2.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company last raised its dividend in February, from $2.60 to $2.76 a year, and did not raise it at all in 1993. **********In July, the company announced its first quarterly earnings increase since it cut cigarette prices in April 1993 to become more competitive against discount brands taking a growing share of the market. **********Philip Morris has been under pressure from its major investors to improve its stock price. Fund Manager Applauds **********""I think Philip Morris is putting the company's money where the management's mouth has been for some time,"" said David King, co-manager of the Putnam Fund for Growth and Income, a Boston-based equity fund that is among the company's top 10 shareholders with 6.5 million shares. **********""Our reaction is positive,"" Mr. King added. ""They made a big but prudent move. But the stock is still extremely depressed."" **********Geoffrey C. Bible, Philip Morris's president and chief executive, said in a statement, ""Our decision today to raise the dividend and repurchase additional shares of our common stock reflects our confidence in the future of Philip Morris."" **********To date this year, Philip Morris has bought back 16.7 million shares in the open market for $877 million under a previous program authorized by the board. The balance from that program, $290.3 million, will be expended during the fourth quarter, a company spokesman said, before the authority to buy $6 billion worth of additional shares takes effect. **********""Although the dividend increase is a large one, Philip Morris can well afford it,"" Mr. Goldman said. He estimated that after capital expenses and dividend payouts the company had more than $2 billion in excess cash flow. **********Mr. Goldman estimated that the company would have repurchased 25 million shares by the end of the year, about 3 percent of the outstanding shares of Philip Morris."

""I do hope to be able to comment,"" he said. Until yesterday, Mr. Jett had offered no public response to the charges by Kidder, and its parent company, General Electric. **********He and his lawyers were in court to ask Judge Martin B. Stecher to direct that the dispute over Mr. Jett's frozen money be decided immediately through arbitration with the National Association of Securities Dealers. Arbitration Complaint **********Kidder argued that the matter should be decided by the New York Stock Exchange, where the firm filed an arbitration complaint seeking Mr. Jett's money last month after dismissing him. **********In papers filed with the court yesterday, Gary G. Lynch, a lawyer hired by Kidder to investigate the allegations against Mr. Jett, said his preliminary inquiry had found that Mr. Jett defrauded the firm by creating phantom profits in trading Government bonds. It was the first time that Kidder had formally accused Mr. Jett of fraud, although company officials have privately used the term for some time in described the allegations against him. **********Judge Stecher is not expected to rule on the request by Mr. Jett's lawyers for several days. In the meantime, Kidder has offered to release some money to Mr. Jett so he can meet living expenses and pay what the firm has called ""reasonable expense of counsel."" Mr. Jett's lawyers have demanded the release of all the money. **********""Every penny in that account belongs to my client,"" Kenneth E. Warner, one of Mr. Jett's lawyers, said. ""He is virtually unable to pay the rent."" **********In a courtroom with 25-foot ceilings, even a $10 million bond trader and Kung Fu disciple can seem small, and in a sea of glib, gray-suited lawyers, the star of any proceeding can seem alone. Yesterday, Mr. Jett, a slender man with unusually large eyes, was poker-faced and ramrod straight as the proceedings went on about him. Only lawyers, not family or friends, were at his side. **********Beautifully dressed in a deep brown suit, creamy white shirt and golden cuff links, he looked anything but brash or confident. Rather, as he described himself after the hearing, he looked like a man who had ""the whole world coming down"" on him. **********He only occasionally cracked a smile -- for example, when the judge expressed momentary annoyance with a long-winded Kidder lawyer -- or muttered under his breath. When he spoke, which was rarely, it was with feeling. When asked by a reporter if he planned to proclaim his innocence, Mr. Jett said, emphatically, ""Ye-e-e-s!"". 'Extremely Unfair' **********Mr. Jett also complained about his former employer, saying, ""It's extremely unfair for Kidder to use its limitless resources against me and to prevent me from having access to my own funds so I can defend myself and clear my name."" **********Mr. Jett has hired Gustave H. Newman, a prominent criminal defense lawyer, in addition to Mr. Warner. Mr. Newman most recently won the acquittal of a Washington lawyer, Robert A. Altman, on charges of conspiring with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International to secretly acquire United States banks. **********Mr. Jett has not been accused of wrongdoing by any Government agency, but the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan are investigating the allegations made by Kidder against him, according to people familiar with the inquiries. **********While the issue of who handles the arbitration appeared to be a technical one, Mr. Warner said his client wanted the N.A.S.D. to decide because two members of the general public would be included on its three-member arbitration panel. The Stock Exchange panel would be composed of industry officials. **********Mr. Jett earned $10 million at Kidder in 1993, with $9 million coming as a performance-based bonus. Under Kidder's compensation rules, a portion of that money -- about $4 million -- may not be touched by an employee until it is either vested or the employee has been gone from the firm at least 30 days. Another $5 million or so has been paid to him and is in two Kidder accounts. Mr. Jett's lawyers are arguing that he has the right to that money immediately. **********Kidder's lawyers said Mr. Jett had obtained the money through fraudulent trading activities and therefore they had a claim against the money and the right to prevent him from withdrawing it. **********""The money Mr. Jett took is the very money we are holding,"" said Ogden N. Lewis, a partner with Davis Polk & Wardwell, which represents Kidder. ""This is the fruit of fraud if we are right."" **********Kidder accused Mr. Jett, who headed its Government bond trading desk for about a year until he was dismissed on April 17, of creating $350 million in phantom profits from phony trades to conceal $100 million in real losses. 'Preliminary Findings' **********Mr. Lynch, a former S.E.C. enforcement director hired by Kidder, was also in court yesterday. He filed an affidavit that included what he called ""preliminary findings"" of his investigation into Mr. Jett's activities. **********Outside the courtroom, Mr. Lynch said he had not made a determination about whether others at Kidder might have been involved or known of Mr. Jett's reported scheme. ""It has nothing to say about other individuals,"" Mr. Lynch said, referring to his affidavit. **********Mr. Lynch said he had not had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Jett, who, Mr. Lynch said, had not responded to repeated requests for an interview after Mr. Lynch and his team had been called to Kidder the day before Mr. Jett was dismissed -- by letter. **********""We very much would like to talk to Mr. Jett,"" Mr. Lynch said outside the courtroom yesterday. ""All current employees have cooperated."" **********He added that Kidder was prepared to have money released for living and legal expenses. Likely Defense **********On several occasions during the otherwise dry procedural arguments, Mr. Warner sounded a populist note that gave the flavor of a likely defense for Mr. Jett. He accused Kidder and General Electric of ""unleashing a blitz of negative press commentary about my client the likes of which I have not seen for a long time."" **********And he contrasted Mr. Jett's situation with that of Mr. Jett's supervisor at Kidder, Edward A. Cerullo, executive managing director and head of fixed income, who ""made $20 million last year, is still employed and is having his defense paid for by the shareholders of G.E."" **********Mr. Cerullo has not been accused of any wrongdoing and his conduct as Mr. Jett's supervisor has been supported by Kidder executives. But lawyers familiar with the case have suggested that Mr. Jett's defense would be that he acted on instructions from Mr. Cerullo."

Stores Inc., two of the nation's largest consumer software specialty retailers, said today that they had agreed to merge in an almost even exchange of stock. **********The merger would create the nation's largest specialty retailer for video-game and home personal-computer software, analysts said, and it would better position the companies to take advantage of the booming market for CD-ROM personal-computer software and next-generation video games. A combined operation would have greater buying power when dealing with vendors, giving it more pricing flexibility to compete against mass marketers, they said. **********The new company, which has not yet been named, would have more than $500 million in sales and more than 700 stores in 47 states by the end of the year. Most of Babbage's and Software Etc.'s stores are in shopping malls. Investors React Favorably **********In Nasdaq trading, Babbage's shares rose $1.25, to $13, and Software Etc. shares jumped $1, to $10. **********Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Babbage's would receive 1.3 shares of stock of the new holding company, which will likely be based here, where Babbage's is based. Software Etc. shareholders would receive one share of the new company for each share they currently hold. **********Babbage's has about 5.4 million shares outstanding, while Software Etc. has about 8.1 million shares outstanding. The combined company will have about 15 million shares outstanding. **********After the merger, Software Etc. shareholders would own about 54 percent of the stock in the new company, while Babbage holders would own about 46 percent.  Equals Combined **********Analysts said they viewed the merger as a combination of equals. Senior management of both companies will remain. James McCurry, who is chairman of Babbage's, will be chairman of the new company. Software Etc.'s chairman, Leonard Riggio, will be chairman of the executive committee of the new company and a member of the board. **********""This is one of those rare instances where neither company is taking over the other one,"" said Keith E. Benjamin, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Company in San Francisco. ""This is about as even as it gets."" **********Mr. McCurry said in an interview that Babbage's and Software Etc. stores would continue to operate and expand under their own names. Less than 10 percent of the stores overlap in the same markets, he said, and have slightly different marketing concepts, so no store closings are planned. **********Babbage's is more focused on the video-game software market, while Software Etc., which is based in Edina, Minn., is more focused on personal-computer software. **********Babbage's has 321 stores nationwide, including concentrations in Florida and Texas, and plans to have 337 by the end of the year. Software Etc., which has 357 stores and plans to have 382 by the end of the year, is strong on the West Coast."

Dunlap, who joined Scott in April when the stock was at its yearly low of $37.25. **********""More and more companies are going to be doing this,"" said Robert Stobaugh, professor at Harvard Business School, who has studied the all-stock compensation plan. ""The idea is that when directors have a substantial financial stake in the company, they go beyond what is legally required to help the company prosper."" Travelers Has Similar Plan **********Professor Stobaugh said that the Travelers was the only big company that had previously adopted the arrangement. **********Under the plan, which is subject to stockholder approval at the annual meeting next April 18, directors will receive 1,000 shares of stock apiece, in lieu of the customary cornucopia of annual fees, committee bonuses, meeting fees, stock option arrangements, retirement benefits and other board-room perks. **********The 11-member board has nine outside directors; Mr. Dunlap and J. Richard Leaman Jr., the president of Scott's S. D. Warren coated-paper products unit are also directors. Until the plan is approved, the stock will be valued for the nine directors at $53.25 a share, the price on July 19, when the board of directors approved the new compensation arrangement. **********Mr. Dunlap, a 57-year-old turnaround specialist, recently announced the biggest revamping in history of Scott, the world's largest producer of tissue products. **********""I went to our board, and I gave an impassioned speech, saying, 'I would like you to think like shareholders,' "" Mr. Dunlap said in an interview. ""I asked them for help in changing the corporate culture, and they said, 'We'll support you.' "" Unanimous Agreement **********Gary L. Roubos, a Scott Paper board member since 1987 who is chairman of the five-member compensation committee, said agreement was unanimous among the directors at the meeting. **********Mr. Roubos, who is chairman of the Dover Corporation, a New York-based $2 billion manufacturing consortium, said, ""Some of the members had been given their checks, and they turned them in, saying that they would take their payment in stock as agreed, starting now."" **********The new arrangement, Mr. Dunlap said, changes the tradition that ""directors come and get a big fee, and get every perk known to man, and then they want to protect their benefits instead of the shareholders."" **********Mr. Roubos said that compensation for board members had previously ranged from $50,000 to more than $100,000. With the 1,000 shares valued at $53,250, he said, ""I'm about breaking even,"" under the new plan. **********When he came aboard at Scott little more than four months ago, Mr. Dunlap bought $2 million worth of stock at the prevailing price of $38 a share without exercising his lower-cost stock option. When the stock price rose above $50 in June, he bought another $2 million on the open market because, he said, he wanted to ""show the world that I believed in the company."" In August he announced that 10,500 jobs -- nearly a third of the company's work force -- would be eliminated by the end of the year. **********Yesterday the stock traded as high as $66.375, before closing at $65.875, up $2.125 from the Monday close. **********The 15 outside members of Travelers' 21-member board receive $75,000 worth of stock each year and no other compensation. The plan was adopted in 1986 by the corporate predecessor of Traveler's, the Commercial Credit Group, according to Mary McDermott, Travelers' senior vice president of corporate communications. **********Professor Stobaugh cited several studies, including one of his own, showing that companies in which directors have sizable stock holdings perform better than companies where they do not. ""Directors are more independent when they have a good amount of stock,"" he said. **********The compensation decision at Scott was part of a broader trend affecting other companies, Professor Stobaugh said, ""where they have been paying part of the compensation in the form of stock, but few have reached the 100 percent level yet."" **********Critics of the stock-compensation practice say that directors who own a lot of stock might have a vested interest in making higher dividend payments when corporate resources were needed for other purposes. ""But I don't think that much money is involved,"" Professor Stobaugh said."

General Opposes More Bosnia Force," **********Stung by criticism from the Clinton Administration, the commander of United Nations troops in Bosnia has said that the increased use of force advocated by the United States would only lead the West toward war and a disaster like the one in Somalia. **********""Patience, persistence and pressure is how you conduct a peacekeeping mission,"" the commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, said in an interview on Tuesday. ""Bombing is a last resort because then you cross the Mogadishu line."" He referred to the Somalian capital where American peacekeeping troops became involved in a shooting war that led to their departure. **********The 54-year-old general added: ""If someone wants to fight a war here on moral or political grounds, fine, great, but count us out. Hitting one tank is peacekeeping. Hitting infrastructure, command and control, logistics, that is war, and I'm not going to fight a war in white-painted tanks."" **********The general was responding to thinly veiled criticism from President Clinton, who, in a speech on Monday at the United Nations, called for a new toughness in saving Sarajevo from strangulation. United States officials have been quietly pointing the finger at General Rose, saying he has been too timid in his response to the presence of Bosnian Serb tanks and artillery around Sarajevo and other Serbian pressure on the Bosnian capital. **********The difference in views between General Rose and the Clinton Administration mirrors the conflicts that have bedeviled international attempts to bring peace to Bosnia since the war, which has already taken more than 200,000 lives, began 30 months ago. **********Seen from Sarajevo, where General Rose wrestles with the mediation of a bitter conflict, the United States approach to Bosnia lacks coherence because it involves periodic calls for wider NATO air strikes without addressing the question of what happens to tens of thousands of British, French and other United Nations troops in the aftermath. **********The Clinton Administration, like the Bush Administration before it, has refused to involve American ground troops in Bosnia, effectively leaving day-to-day management of the first major post-cold-war conflict to the Europeans. **********""If the decision is to go up to another level of enforcement, then we would have to leave,"" General Rose said. ""NATO sometimes suggests a level of targeting or use of air power that cannot be squared with my position. We have debates, of course, but not major rows."" **********Recently, NATO, prodded by the United States, has called for wide air strikes in response to a Bosnian Serb attack on the western Muslim pocket of Bihac and to the presence of Serbian tanks within a 12.5-mile weapon-exclusion zone around Sarajevo. But the United Nations command here has resisted. **********On the wall of his office, General Rose has a photograph of a hospital vehicle with a red cross on it that was destroyed in NATO bombing during the Serbian assault on the eastern Muslim enclave of Gorazde earlier this year. The caption underneath it reads: ""Nice one, NATO."" **********The general said the photograph reflected the amicable ribbing that goes on between NATO and the United Nations over Bosnia. But it also seems suggestive of the different -- and often irreconcilable -- viewpoints from which the two organizations see the conflict. **********Asked about his nonconfrontational approach to recent decisions by the Bosnian Serbs to cut electricity and gas to Sarajevo, close the one road out of the city and threaten flights to the airport, General Rose said the only protection for his troops comes from the consent of all warring parties to the United Nations mission here. **********Since General Rose arrived in January, conditions in Sarajevo and parts of Bosnia have improved. An American-brokered agreement stopped fighting between Muslims and Croats. Serbian shelling of Sarajevo has virtually stopped. **********. But Sarajevo's vulnerability was underscored by a two-week interruption of the city's utilities that ended this week with the gradual return of electricity, gas and a tram service. **********Asked if he felt greater sympathy for the Serbs after eight months here -- an allegation frequently made by Bosnian Government officials -- General Rose said he tried to maintain strict neutrality. **********""I disconnect myself personally,"" he said. ""Of course I am not insensitive to the victimization of people or the dismemberment of a country recognized by the United Nations. But I must maintain dialogue with both sides because the alternative is a worse war. If we succeed, the world will be a safer place for decades. But if we fail, the consequences will be horrendous."""

Passengers used the charters to stock up on cheap goods which they brought home and sold. **********These days, Flyaway, Poland's largest private travel agency, focuses on luxury vacations and employs 44 staffers in six offices. ""The Mediterranean is very popular,"" said Robert Grzybowski, one of Flyaway's owners. ""This summer we sent 2000 people on packages to the Cyprus, the Greek Islands."" **********Mr. Grzybowski is busy, but he is not alone. Across Eastern Europe, an unprecedented number of tourists are booking vacations in exotic locales - places that were politically unimaginable before 1989, and economically unreachable immediately afterwards. **********Travel is booming because the region's burgeoning private sector is boosting incomes, even as travel prices are being driven lower by a proliferation of private agencies and tour operators. **********Indeed, by official tally, the Hungarian economy has shrunk by nearly 20 percent over the last three years, but the country's board of tourism says Hungarians made 573,000 flights abroad in the first 11 months of 1993, up from only 392,000 in all of 1991. **********At least a dozen travel agencies and airlines flank Vorosmarty Square at Budapest's center. On one corner, Chemol-Travel's front window is plastered with promotional stickers that translate roughly as ""Malta on Target"" and ""Bounty in Israel."" **********The company sent 9,000 Hungarians abroad on packages in 1993, up from 3,500 the previous year. Israel sells well; more than 1,000 Chemol clients vacationed at a Red Sea resort in the last four months of 1993, said Mr. Hoka. ""A lot of people go for the $1,000 [one-week] package that includes stay at a four-star hotel and half board,"" he says. **********This, as Mr. Hoka noted, is a significant multiple of the average Hungarian's monthly after tax pay of $200. **********""Almost all of our customers come from the private sector, not the state enterprises,"" he said. If, under communism, customers arranged their vacations months in advance, they now book just days before a tour leaves. This is not a reflection of caprice, but the uncertainties of an entrepreneurial life, Mr. Hoka speculated. **********Although the free market has generated new clients for Eastern Europe's travel agents and tour operators, it has also cut into their margins. Chemol's revenues have tripled in the last two years, but its profit margin has fallen from 25 percent to 5 percent, said Mr. Hoka. **********Like driving a taxi - another popular starter business in the region - little training or seed capital is needed to charter a bus to Greece or set up a travel agency. Fledgling entrepreneurs have flocked to the travel industry. **********In Hungary, the number of travel agents accredited by the Geneva-based International Air Transport Association is up four times from its level January 1990. In Poland, the number of IATA- accredited agencies has doubled, and in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, their numbers are up 22 percent during the same period. **********Even Hungary's national airline, Malev, has been rattled by the fierce new environment. Although total air traffic to or from Budapest swelled by 20 percent from 1992 to 1993, Malev's share fell by 4 percent. **********In December, battling to keep frequent flyers from defecting to competitors like KLM and Delta, Malev cut the number of flights needed to earn a free ticket by 40 percent. The airline also installed a computer to track frequent flyers, even tallying their newspaper preferences. **********""It's a buyer's market,"" said Robert Toth, manager of Tradesco Tours in Budapest. He noted that, in real terms, prices have halved on many flights and tours. **********In the package tour market, Tradesco has done its share of undercutting the competition. In 1991, Tradesco halved the price charged by Ibusz, Hungary's biggest state-owned travel company, for tours to the United States. Tradesco's traffic to the United States grew from 2,500 passengers in 1992 to 4,000 last year, and Mr. Toth projects 6500 in 1994. **********To sustain such growth, Tradesco has held prices on its basic 9-day New York package to 69,000 forints ($690) since the beginning of 1993, even as consumer prices rose 23 percent, and devaluation cut 15 percent off the company's margin. ""I'm a victim of my success,"" Mr. Toth says. ""Now everybody is trying to undercut me."""

To no one's surprise, the blunt, poised politician -- once the manager of the Soviet Union's premier nuclear missile factory -- argued that Ukrainians were finally ready to take the plunge to free markets. **********""We have no other choice,"" Mr. Kuchma said. **********What may be surprising is that a lot of analysts jaded by the unfulfilled promises of post-Soviet reformers take his words seriously. Indeed, among Western advocates of a rapid conversion to a market economy in the ex-Soviet nations, enthusiasm for President Kuchma's plan borders on the unbridled. **********""Ukraine,"" says John Mroz, director of the Institute for East-West Studies in New York, ""could be the economic success story of 1995."" **********Before 1991 all lines of authority ran directly from Ukraine's bloated state enterprises to ministries in Moscow. That left the newly independent country of 52 million people without experience in managing the government budget or the economy. Even worse, says David Snelbacker, associate director of the Project on Economic Reform in Ukraine at the Kennedy School at Harvard, the long-Sovietized nation could not draw on the ""collective memory of capitalism"" enjoyed by Poles and Czechs. **********Still, when the empire collapsed, Ukraine seemed to have a reasonable shot at economic success. Like Russia, the country was well endowed with natural resources and an educated work force. Unlike Russia, it had a decent transportation system and did not need to resort to police-state tactics to maintain ethnic peace. **********Anything that could have gone wrong, though, did. The first nationalist government, led by Leonid Kravchuk, ""was more interested in politics than policy,"" Mr. Snelbacker says. President Kravchuk refused to make unpleasant choices. He propped up obsolete industries, ran gigantic budget deficits to support social spending and financed imports -- notably, natural gas -- with loans from the other former Soviet republics. **********The result was hyperinflation and a collapse in production. The World Bank estimates that prices doubled in 1991, rose fifteenfold in 1992 and another 41-fold in 1993. Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and an adviser to the new Government, says he believes national output is down by half since 1991. **********As Mr. Mroz baldly puts it: ""Ukraine was desperate for change, on the verge of economic and political collapse."" **********And change is what it is about to get. At first, Mr. Kuchma hardly seemed the sort to break the crucible. He was, after all, a man, in Mr. Mroz's words, from ""the pinnacle of the military-industrial complex."" But Westerners underestimated his pragmatism and political skill. **********Apparently with little direct knowledge of economics, Mr. Kuchma surrounded himself with competent technocrats. Equally important, he alternately bullied and flattered the parliamentary opposition into submission. **********President Kuchma's economic policies look like an amalgam of the shock therapy imposed in Poland in 1990 and the rapid privatization under way in Russia. Prices have been decontrolled. And thanks to the quiet resistance of the central bank in the waning months of the Kravchek administration, inflation is down to a level that is almost tolerable. **********The next steps are more ambitious. One goal is to curb industrial credit, allowing nonmonopoly enterprises to profit from deregulation so that markets are used to determine the survivors. Another is to phase out the budget deficit, largely by eliminating subsidies. Still another is to raise domestic energy prices and eliminate barriers to exports. All these measures are to be buttressed by privatization financed by vouchers. **********Mr. Aslund, who has seen equally grand plans scaled back in Russia, is nonetheless optimistic about Ukraine's dash for capitalism. For one thing, he argues, the collapse of obsolete industry has virtually run its course. For another, Ukraine's ""social fabric is pretty much intact."" **********The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- chastened by criticism of their bureaucratic inertia elsewhere in the former Soviet empire -- stand prepared to finance a good portion of the stabilization effort. What is unclear, however, is whether the rich industrialized countries will do their part: Neither the United States nor the European Union seems inclined to lend more than token sums for the effort. **********Mr. Kuchma, who recently rammed through legislation confirming a promise to dismantle strategic nuclear weapons, makes no secret of his frustration. This may be the last chance for a long time, he suggests, to create a prosperous Ukraine to anchor stability in eastern Europe. **********""It is a lot better to have visits from President Kuchma,"" explains the ex-missile maker, ""than from the products he formerly produced."""

Now most of those leaders are dead, victims of ethnic militancy or intense political rivalries that turned lethal in unsettled times. **********The latest politician to die, in an explosion so powerful that it took the lives of at least 52 people, was Gamini Dissanayake, leader of the parliamentary opposition and a presidential candidate in an election scheduled for Nov. 9. Mr. Dissanayake, his campaign manager and several other major figures in his United National Party were killed early yesterday morning as the candidate began to walk away from the stage where he had addressed a political rally. More than 200 people were wounded. **********Mr. Dissanayake will be given a state funeral on Saturday. Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga, who took office in August, said yesterday that the death of her political rival was particularly regrettable, since her Government was committed to ""wiping out all forms of political violence and introducing democracy and decency to Sri Lankan politics."" **********Raja Gunesekere, a human rights lawyer who is in New York as a member of Sri Lanka's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, reflected the view of others familiar with the Sri Lankan situation yesterday when he said that while the news was ""a deep shock"" to those who knew Mr. Dissanayake, the killing also raised the troubling thought that ""this type of political assassination doesn't come as a complete surprise."" **********""The important questions would be, 'Why now?' and 'What next?' "" said Mr. Gunesekere, the former head of Sri Lanka's oldest law school. **********Yesterday, the Sri Lankan police said they thought that Mr. Dissanayake's assassin may have been a woman with a bomb packed with metal pellets strapped to her body. They found a woman's head on a nearby rooftop. **********Early reports said the attack occurred on Sunday night but the Government broadcasting service later said Mr. Dissanayake was killed a few minutes after midnight. **********The circumstances were similar to those surrounding the assassination of India's former Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in May 1991, as he was about to begin a political rally. After that explosion, the partial head of a woman whom police believe was the killer was found nearby on the grass. That case is now in court, where Indian officials are trying to prove that Mr. Gandhi was killed by ethnic minority Tamils associated with or working for a ruthless Sri Lankan guerrilla army, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has been at war with the Sri Lankan Government since the late 1970's. **********Prime Minister Kumaratunga had just begun a new round of talks with the Tigers, an organization once supported by India, where it was based through most of the 1980's. After training and helping to equip the Tigers in order to destabilize Sri Lanka, India had a change of heart under Mr. Gandhi, who sent an Indian force to Sri Lanka in 1987 to try to disarm them. **********Sri Lankan officials said Mr. Dissanayake, who opposed the new talks with the Tigers, had been warned that he was under a Tiger death threat. Discussions were to have resumed yesterday in the northern town of Jaffna, the Tiger stronghold, but these talks have now been postponed. The Tigers have denied that they killed him. **********Sri Lankan human rights organizations say that the army -- dominated by the Sinhalese ethnic majority -- was also strongly opposed to negotiating with the guerrillas, and that the assassination may play into the military's hands. Emergency laws and a curfew were imposed yesterday for the first time since being lifted in August, after Prime Minister Kumaratunga took office. **********Mr. Dissanayake was also associated in the 1980's with the Mahaweli Project, an ambitious irrigation and agricultural development program in a formerly arid region of north-central Sri Lanka claimed by Tamils. The Colombo Government began resettling Sinhala-speaking people there from the more densely populated south. **********Sri Lanka's election commission said yesterday that presidential elections should take place as planned, although the Cabinet of Prime Minister Kumaratunga, who was also a candidate for President, has asked for a postponement. **********Prime Minister Kumaratunga, the daughter and widow of two other assassinated politicians, led the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the larger electoral coalition, the Peoples Alliance, to victory in legislative elections in the summer. **********Beginning in 1983, when Tamil rebels demanding independence for the Sri Lankan northeast ambushed and killed a group of soldiers, setting off a retaliatory pogrom of arson and murder against Tamils in the capital, Colombo, Sri Lanka has lurched from assassination to insurgency to death-squad revenge and back to assassination. **********On an island populated by fewer than 20 million people, both the Sinhalese and the Tamils, divided by language, culture, geography and only incidentally religion -- Buddhist Sinhalese and Hindu Tamils, with Christians in both groups -- have been accused of extraordinary abuses by human rights groups. **********Last year, President Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed at a public gathering by a man the police called a suicide bomber on a bicycle, possibly also a Tamil militant. Only a week before that, an assassin killed one of Mr. Premadasa's most outspoken critics, Lalith Athulathmudali. Mr. Athulathmudali had barely survived an attempt in 1987 to blow up the Cabinet of President Junius R. Jayewardene, of which he was a member. **********In 1989, Appapillai Amirthalingam, who had returned from exile in India to be elected to Parliament in an effort to reconcile Tamils and Sinhalese, was gunned down with other leading members of the Tamil United Liberation Front, a political party that urged conciliation."

The winners were the big national flag-carriers and the losers were the small, privately owned airlines trying to break into the business. **********The biggest losers, perhaps, were the passengers who were compelled to pay some of the highest ticket prices in the world. **********But all that is changing. The European Union's open skies program, which is gradually opening up international and domestic routes to competition, has forced the state-run airlines to slash costs in preparation for privatization. But analysts say that difficulties in negotiating with their employees and continued reliance on state subsidies mean that these airlines face turbulent times ahead. **********For example, Iberia Air Lines of Spain is currently seeking a 130 billion peseta ($1 billion) state bailout that must be authorized by the European Union. Other state-owned air carriers in Europe, meanwhile, are slated to receive a total of $7 billion in government aid approved this year by the European Commission. **********""These companies need more money just to keep going,"" said Edith Thouin, an airline analyst at Kemper Investment Management in London. ""It would be nice to see some of them drop out instead. Iberia, Olympic, Alitalia, Air France and maybe Sabena will collapse during the next downturn without further state aid."" **********But even the open-skies policy shouldn't hurt European airlines as badly as deregulation has crippled many carriers in the United States, say other industry observers. The reason, add many, is that in Europe airlines will be forced to decrease capacity. **********""People think that state subsidies will have the same effect as Chapter 11 did in the U.S. and allow 'uneconomic' airlines to keep flying,"" said Mike Powell, an airline analyst at NatWest Markets in London, referring to U.S. debt-protection laws. ""But the conditions likely to be placed on any further subsidies will really restrict capacity."" **********Chris Tarry, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, agreed. ""What happened in the States is simply not going to happen in Europe because there is a completely different infrastructure here that won't allow the same scope for regional traffic growth,"" he said. **********There is apparently ample room for growth in the European airline industry as a whole, however. The International Air Transport Association forecasts average international traffic growth of 5.9 percent annually for European carriers over the next five years. But in contrast to the United States, there is still only a handful of small, independent airlines in Europe trying to compete with the national behemoths. Most of these, including Virgin and British Midland, remain in private hands and therefore offer little scope for investors. **********Only three European airlines - British Airways PLC, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Lufthansa AG of Germany - are consistently cited as attractive investments by industry analysts. These, many say, have been the most successful at cutting costs and developing the cross shareholdings and marketing alliances that will allow them to compete with giant American and Asian Pacific carriers. **********British Airways' $400 million stake in USAir Group Inc. has caused the company some problems in recent months, but analysts argue that the damage to the share price - which is down almost 25 percent since USAir issued a profits warning at the beginning of this year - has been overdone. **********""BA's globalization program has been marred by USAir's poor financial performance, but the market has possibly overreacted to this news,"" said Guy Kekwick, an aviation analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. **********KLM has had better success to date with its U.S. alliance. The company, which is 38 percent state-owned, paid $400 million for a 20 percent stake in Northwest Airlines in 1989. Despite Northwest's brush with bankruptcy last year, the two airlines are working well together, analysts say, helping to make KLM perhaps the most attractive airline in Europe. **********""KLM is conservatively financed, well-managed, has a sound expansion strategy and has one of the industry's youngest fleets,"" said Candace Browning at Merrill Lynch in New York. ""Its long-term prospects are excellent."" **********Lufthansa, still 36 percent owned by the German government but slated for complete privatization by the end of next year, has also negotiated a successful U.S. alliance, with UAL Corp., which runs United Airlines. ""Lufthansa has done absolutely everything right and the momentum in the company for change is phenomenal,"" said Mr. Tarry. ""We will see the benefits continuing for some time."" **********Mr. Tarry expects Lufthansa to make a profit of 330 million Deutsche marks ($210 million) this year, compared with a loss of 110 million DM in 1993. **********Smaller European airlines, including Swissair and Finnair, are cited as attractive by some analysts."

The company said it would merge with the Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation in an $8.4 billion deal and raise the cash portion of its offer to gain control of Paramount by 23.5 percent, to $105 a share from $85 a share. **********But the analysts quickly pointed out that the bid, when examined in its totality, actually represented a package of cash and securities valued at about $78 a share. **********Several analysts said late yesterday that they had not yet had an opportunity to carefully study the latest bid. But one Wall Street veteran suggested that such a detailed look might not be necessary. ""The original cash portion of the bid by Sumner Redstone was for 51 percent of the company,"" noted William LeFevre, an analyst at Ehrenkrantz, King & Nussbaum, referring to Viacom's chairman. ""But the cash portion of this bid is for 50.1 percent."" The reduction of nine-tenths of a percentage point suggests ""that Redstone is only going to buy what he legally needs to control it,"" Mr. LeFevre said. **********""I don't know what the real value is,"" he added. ""And I don't know what the fit is with Blockbuster other than giving Redstone another pocket to dig into."" Questioning the Price **********From the start of the bidding war for Paramount last fall, Wall Street analysts questioned how either Viacom or its competing bidder, QVC Network Inc., could justify the prices they were offering for Paramount. **********In November, when Paramount's suitors were willing to cough up $80 a share, Jessica Reif, an analyst at Oppenheimer, valued Paramount's assets at $7.1 billion, or $60.18 a share. But those who have argued that the bids for Paramount are not outlandishly high contend that its combination with the eventual winner will ultimately justify the prices. **********A big problem with the Viacom bid, said several participants in a conference call that Viacom and Blockbuster had yesterday for Wall Street analysts, centers on Blockbuster's value as a business to Viacom and how the two companies might fit together. While Blockbuster's participation is clearly key in terms of Viacom's ability to outbid QVC, it is not clear that Blockbuster offers what analysts refer to as ""value added."" **********""Paramount shareholders are getting Blockbuster, but do you want Blockbuster?"" said one analyst about the possibility of Viacom and Blockbuster winning the bidding for Paramount. The analyst asked not to be identified. ""If you're buying into this thing for the brave new world of convergence in the entertainment world, it looks like these guys are gonna get kind of converged out."" **********Using the term ""convergence,"" the analyst was referring to the fact that Blockbuster's business of retail video rental may become obsolete as consumers may one day be able to order movies through interactive links via cable television in their homes. **********The analyst added that he was puzzled by the package of securities that make up the second part of the deal. He said he could not place a value on this part of the bid, known as the back end of the deal."

The selloff in bonds pushed interest rates to the highest level since June. **********Follow-through strength from overseas bond markets and comments by a Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, in a Baltimore speech to the Commercial Finance Association Monday night provided the market with an early lift. But the selling began to pick up steam by midsession after Mr. Lindsey's comments were put in context. **********The 30-year Treasury declined by 26/32 of a percentage point, to 9210/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.86 percent, from 6.79 percent on Monday. Rates on short-term maturities were also higher, with the three-month bill at 3.54 percent, up from 3.50 percent, and the six-month bill at 3.77 percent, up from 3.73 percent. **********Intermediate maturities like 3-year and 10-year notes also felt the brunt of selling. The yield on a 3-year note rose seven basis points, to 5.31 percent, and the 10-year rose eight basis points to 6.39 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. 'Three Something' **********According to traders, the reports on their computer screens in the morning said that Mr. Lindsey of the Fed indicated that short-term interest rates would be ""three something."" **********""Not many people took it serious,"" David A. Ader, managing analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said. ""But apparently some took it as a sign that the Fed would not tighten again."" **********Soon after the market moved on reports of Mr. Lindsey's remarks, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington said that the comment was not intended as a forecast. It was meant to be humorous, the spokesman said. **********According to a text of Mr. Lindsey's speech, it does appear that he meant the comment as a joke. In opening his speech, he said: ""As economic and investment professionals, you've all come to appreciate how easy it is to make a forecast these days. Whatever the question, the answer is three. What will real growth be? About three. What will inflation be? About three. What about short rates? Three something. **********""Tonight, however, I am going to resist the temptation of just uttering the number three and sitting down."" **********Analysts said the confusion in the market did not help Fed credibility yesterday. 'Some Traders Saw Otherwise' **********Mr. Ader noted that people who own a lot of Treasury securities had no patience with the attempted clarification by the Fed spokesman. ""The market's retreat appeared to coincide with the spokesman's comments and the release of fourth-quarter nonfarm productivity, which should have been good for the market,"" Mr. Ader said. ""But unbelievably, some traders saw otherwise."" **********Mr. Ader believes the strong revision by the Labor Department of the fourth-quarter productivity gain to an annualized 6.1 percent, the largest increase in more than seven years, and the drop in unit labor costs at an annual rate of 3.1 percent should have provided further evidence to the market that inflation was not a problem. **********""The gain in productivity is good for the market, and to be taken as inflationary is a counter-read by the market,"" Mr. Ader said. ""People just look for excuses in a bearish market."" **********Productivity measures the time, effort and cost of producing goods. Rising productivity suggests businesses are improving their efficiency and delivering goods at competitive prices and lower costs, analysts say. **********With the selling under way and people's impatience running out, the market ""just gave up the constructive optimism that it had started the session with,"" Mr. Ader said. The weekly Johnson Redbook report on United States department store sales, which was somewhat strong, had little impact, he said. **********""This suggests that we're going to see some more weakness"" in bond prices and higher interest rates over the near term, Mr. Ader said. He expects trading will be choppy, with the market in a narrow range as prices approach those of last week, but do not fall much lower."

Micom, a maker of communications networking products based in Simi Valley, Calif., said it expected earnings of 8 cents to 10 cents a share, down from 12 cents a share in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenues are expected to be between $20 million and $20.5 million for the quarter, down slightly from $21 million, the company said. Micom attributed the decline to inventory reductions by distributors in advance of the company's new products scheduled for release in the next two quarters. Shares of Micom fell $5, to $9.25, in Nasdaq trading."

In New York trading, the dollar plunged to 99.90 Japanese yen, the lowest level since World War II, before rebounding to close at 100.30 yen, the lowest postwar close. The dollar also fell against the German mark. Fed officials have said that a sharp drop in the dollar's value might prompt them to strongly consider an increase in interest rates. **********There was also market concern that the apprehension about another rise in short-term rates would affect the outcome of the two-year note auction. The two-year note was awarded at a high yield of 6.04 percent in solid but not aggressive bidding. Some Buyers Stay Away **********Some traders said the results were a little weaker than expected, considering that the when-issued yield had risen to an attractive 6 percent return before the auction. But some large buyers, not knowing whether the Fed would raise short-term rates after they had bought notes with a lower rate, stayed away. **********The Government will auction $11 billion of new five-year notes today and $16.5 billion of one-year bills tomorrow. In late when-issued trading yesterday, the five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.81 percent, while the rate on a one-year issue rose 8 basis points, to 4.98 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********Mark Grant, managing director and head of fixed income at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, called yesterday a watershed in the tenure of the Clinton Administration. The dollar's fall to 99.90 yen in New York, he said, ""will cause a number of reactions."" Mr. Grant said a lack of Wall Street confidence in the Clinton Administration, combined with concern in other world markets about the health of the American economy, would have far-reaching effects. **********Mr. Grant said the turmoil in the currency markets might require the Fed to raise short-term rates, and maybe even the discount rate, to stabilize the dollar. ""I think these events will be coming shortly,"" he said. **********He added: ""For the Fed not to respond to the declining dollar is incomprehensible. The costs of goods in the world are to a very large degree pegged in dollars.""  Another recent source of market irritation, the Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of futures contract prices and a harbinger of inflationary price pressures, slipped again yesterday. But the prices of some precious metals rose, with the contract for June delivery of gold settling up $5.40, to $394.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange. **********In late trading in the Treasury market, the 30-year bond fell 12/32 , to 8511/32 , for a yield of 7.49 percent, up from 7.46 percent on Monday. Treasury bills and notes rose the most because their value is tied to changes in interest rates set by the Fed. The yield on the 5.50 percent note due in April 2000 rose 7 basis points, to 6.85 percent, and a 6.50 percent three-year note due in May 1997 rose 9 basis points, to 6.32 percent. **********Some analysts say the market will continue to hold its negative bias as it comes to grips with the potential for another Fed tightening, which would be the fifth of the year. **********The Treasury said yesterday that the Federal budget deficit was $32.05 billion in May, in line with expectations. Analysts said it represented a solid narrowing from the $37 billion posted in the period a year earlier. **********The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new two-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) High Yield . . . 6.04%  Low Yield . . . 5.97%  Median Yield . . . 6.01%  Accepted at low price . . . 43%  Total applied for . . . $44,868 970  Accepted . . . $17,006,817  Noncompetitive . . . $1,438,000  Interest set at . . . 6%  The two-year notes mature on June 30, 1996."

The reorganization is intended to give investors more flexibility in deciding which Tele-Communications businesses show the most promise. **********Moreover, the move is apparently aimed at showing that the sum of Tele-Communications' parts are worth more than the company as a whole. **********""The advantage of this type of stock -- known as 'tracking stock' -- is that it retains the existing relationships between the operators, and yet investors have more opportunity to pick where they want to play the game,"" Robert Thomson, a Tele-Communications spokesman, said yesterday. **********In essence, Tele-Communications would create separate securities that would rise and fall on the performance of each unit. Not only would such a plan allow investors to choose more specific operations, but it would also give them the flexibility to switch to securities of the other units. **********There are at least three means of enacting the plan: a tax-free stock dividend, a rights offering or an exchange offer to current shareholders. Mr. Thomson said the company has not yet decided which strategy it would use. **********Wall Street responded positively to the news. Shares of Tele-Communications jumped 75 cents to close at $24.125 in Nasdaq trading, where it was the day's most actively traded stock. **********Dennis Leibowitz, an analyst who follows Tele-Communications for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the company's plan was a good one because it would enable investors to recognize Tele-Communications's underlying value. **********Under the planned restructuring, Tele-Communications would create a cable television and communications division that would include the domestic cable satellite and telephone business. The division would be headed by Tele-Communications' chief operating officer, Brendan Clousten. **********Liberty Media, the company's programming operation, would be run by Peter Barton, Liberty's president. Liberty owns stakes in a host of programming networks and also owns information services and computer-based companies. **********The other two divisions would be international investments and operations and a venture capital unit that would invest in new businesses. **********""T.C.I. remains an entrepreneurial company,"" John C.

Douglas Lee, chief economist for NatWest Markets in Washington. Selling in Bond Market **********The Labor Department's report prompted some selling in the bond market, pushing interest rates modestly higher, as traders and other operators seemed to be unnerved more by the rise in so-called core, or underlying, inflation than reassured by another slight easing in the overall index.  [ Page 46. ] **********Separately, a panel of 52 forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators trimmed its estimate of inflation at the consumer level this year by one-tenth of a point, to 2.7 percent, the same as last year, while maintaining its prediction of 3.3 percent for 1995. Blue Chip, based in Sedona, Ariz., reports its findings on the 10th day of each month. **********Analysts said the producer price figures did not seem likely to hasten any additional tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. **********The increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in the core rate -- exceeded only in January and matched only in November during the last year -- was concentrated mainly in tobacco and motor vehicles, the department found. **********But tobacco prices were unchanged before the department adjusted them statistically to account for seasonal factors. **********""I don't think volatile tobacco prices are enough to fire up the Fed to raise rates again,"" said Jay Goldinger, investment strategist at Capital Insight in Los Angeles. **********The higher prices for light trucks and passenger cars -- up 2 percent and eight-tenths of 1 percent, respectively -- reflected the recent weakness of the dollar against the Japanese yen that has made Japanese cars relatively more expensive and thereby has given American producers an umbrella under which to raise prices. **********The Producer Price Index, unlike the Consumer Price Index, which is scheduled to be issued on Tuesday, excludes imported goods and most services. **********Without the inclusion of tobacco and motor vehicles, Merrill Lynch calculated, the core Producer Price Index would have moved up just one-tenth of 1 percent, and the overall index would have fallen three-tenths of 1 percent. **********A main source of unease today seemed to involve prices at the intermediate stage of production, just before finished goods. The overall intermediate index rose two-tenths of 1 percent, but a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent for the intermediate core was slightly faster than the January-April period that was itself slightly faster than the average in 1993. **********""There are signs of incipient inflation pressure,"" said Carl J. Palash, economist at MCM MoneyWatch, a New York advisory firm. **********Crude materials, on the other hand, dropped 1.4 percent over all last month, and 1.1 percent without food and energy, the report also showed. **********The finished-goods index, in which energy was down 1 percent, reflected a drop of 2.8 percent in gasoline prices and declines for residential gas and electricity that were larger than in April. But home heating oil turned up. **********Food prices fell nine-tenths of 1 percent as declines accelerated for red meats, fresh and dry vegetables, eggs and processed chickens while dairy products and processed turkeys turned down. Fresh fruits and melons jumped 5.6 percent, reversing a decline in April. **********Capital equipment rose four-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month, with increases for motor vehicles and commercial furniture more than offsetting a decline for civilian aircraft. **********In intermediate goods, like a bolt of cloth, the main upward pressure was from materials used in manufacturing. **********Durable materials jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent as prices for copper and brass mill shapes surged 6.9 percent, after falling about 1 percent in April, while indexes also turned up last month for hot and cold rolled steel sheet and strip, plywood, copper cathode, flat glass and aluminum mill shapes. Partly offsetting those were declines for building paper and building board and smaller increases for aluminum ingots and cement. **********Nondurable manufacturing materials rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, a bit less than in April, as primary and intermediate basic organic chemicals, fertilizer materials, woodpulp, paperboard, paper and plastic resins and materials all advanced. Basic organic chemicals declined. **********Construction materials rose two-tenths of 1 percent after falling twice that much in April, the Labor Department also found in its survey, which is conducted by mail questionnaire to cover prices for the Tuesday of the week containing the 13th of the month. **********Consumer prices, by contrast, are surveyed throughout the month. **********Crude prices in today's report showed energy up 1 percent -- in contrast to declines at later stages."

Working together. Solidarity. Cooperation. Partnership. These are our words. This is my socialism. It is not the Socialism of Marx or state control."" **********Suggesting just how far he had in mind when he asked the party to ""break out of the past,"" Mr. Blair indicated that the new leadership would submit proposals to bring the party's constitution up to date with its policies. **********This was read as a sign that he was prepared to jettison the Labor Party's famed ""Clause 4,"" which commits the part to ""common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange."" The clause has often been cited by Conservatives in attacking the party. **********Talk of changing the clause has angered some longtime Labor Party stalwarts, like Arthur Scargill, leader of the miners union. ""He has said he is going to ditch Clause 4, which is deplorable,"" Mr. Scargill said. **********""The speech could have been made by a Liberal Democrat or even a Tory 'wet,' "" he added, an expression used by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to describe colleagues who were shaky in supporting her brand of Conservatism. **********But for the most part Mr. Blair's speech was well received and widely applauded by the delegates. Mr. Blair, who was only 26 when Mrs. Thatcher took office and ushered in 15 years of uninterrupted Tory rule in 1979, said that the policy changes he advocates are principled, but also necessary to beat the Conservatives in the next general election, which must be held by mid-1997. **********Under Prime Minister John Major, the Conservatives have sunk to a record low in public opinion polls. The most recent, published in the current issue of The Economist, indicates that Labor would win by 27percentage points if the election were held today. **********Since assuming the party leadership in July upon the death of his predecessor, John Smith, Mr. Blair has moved quickly to put his stamp on the party. He has shifted the party's position on Northern Ireland closer to that of the Conservatives and, perhaps most alarming, refused to endorse striking signal workers when he addressed the Trade Union Congress here three weeks ago. **********In his speech today, Mr Blair affirmed the traditional Labor commitment to full employment, but as a goal that would take time to accomplish. He also said he favored closer cooperation with the rest of Europe, a bill of rights and a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/10/world/playing-poker-clinton-says-economy-is-all-aces.html,Thomas Friedman,1994-07-10,,1093,,The New York Times,World,An Analysis; News Analysis,article,Playing Poker: Clinton Says Economy Is All Aces,Playing Poker: Clinton Says Economy Is All Aces," **********President Clinton has often been accused of timidity in foreign policy, but the policy on the dollar that he articulated here at this year's economic summit meeting is about as gutsy as anything he could do these days short of invading Haiti. **********When all the oratory is stripped away, the President has essentially looked the world's currency traders in the eye and said to them, ""I dare you."" **********That dare is embodied in Mr. Clinton's argument that the United States economy is as healthy as ever, that inflation is well under control and that the currency markets have to some degree undervalued the dollar. **********For those reasons, the President said, if at all possible he is not going to prop up the dollar.  What Clinton Doesn't Want **********He said he does not want to see the Federal Reserve Board raise interest rates to support the dollar because that would needlessly damp domestic growth, and he is counting on the markets to eventually recognize the fundamentals and stabilize the dollar at a reasonably strong value. **********He is also betting that this process will take place without any serious long-term negative effects on the American economy. **********As bets go, they don't get much bigger. If Mr. Clinton and his advisers are right, some speculators who have been dumping dollars by the bushel are going to lose money. If he is wrong, the dollar, and maybe stocks and bonds, are in for a very interesting ride. **********The last world leader to take on the currency markets in such a brazen way was Prime Minister John Major, who declared in 1992 that the British pound would be devalued only ""over my dead body."" Currency traders took up the bet, hammered the pound down by 15 percent and left Mr. Major's body as roadkill on the global investment highway. The Parallels That Aren't **********In fairness to Mr. Clinton, the pound was overvalued and the American economy today is in much better health than Britain's was then. **********But how much better? Americans will soon find out as currency traders and the President engage in a fundamental test of wills over whose assessment is correct. **********Many speculators have argued that a lot of fundamentals point to a weaker dollar: Japan and Germany are coming out of recession, which means interest rates there are likely to rise, making investments there more attractive and increasing demand for their currencies. **********In the United States, strong employment numbers from the Labor Department suggest that inflation might soon rise. The trade deficit with Japan is heading for another record this year. And maybe most important, there is no sign of a Japanese Government that is ready or able to deal with the endemic trade surplus. Good News and Bad News **********Most Clinton aides walked away from the President's meeting on Friday with Japan's new Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, saying there was good news and bad news. **********The good news, they said, was that the first Socialist Prime Minister of Japan in more than four decades seemed just like every other Japanese Prime Minister, despite his reputation as a radical pacifist with almost no foreign experience. **********The bad news, the officials said, was that the first Socialist Prime Minister of Japan in more than four decades seemed just like every other Japanese Prime Minister -- with lots of vague promises about opening Japanese markets and deregulating Japan's economy but without any specifics that might make these happen. **********In citing economic fundamentals that support the dollar, the President and his advisers say that $500 billion in budget cuts have finally brought the deficit under control, and that the United States economy has generated 3.8 million jobs in the last 17 months without any real sign of serious inflation. **********With Japan coming out of recession, they add, demand for American products there should increase (presuming the markets open up), and the dollar should therefore strengthen against the yen. Moreover, while the dollar is losing ground against the yen and the mark, it is holding steady against other currencies. And if Clinton Is Wrong? **********As Mr. Clinton said Friday: ""Over the long run, the economic fundamentals will have to work themselves out. And I think that the best thing to do to stabilize the dollar and other currencies is to send a signal to the markets that we are working on the economic fundamentals. These things, it seems to me, together offer the promise of strengthening the dollar over the long run in a realistic way."" **********Anyway, the President hinted, if he is wrong and the fundamentals are not as strong as he thinks, no amount of intervention in the markets will be sufficient to hold up the currency. **********Not surprisingly, many speculators interpreted these remarks as a definitive signal that there would be no market intervention or interest-rate increases unless markets really started gyrating. That is why the dollar fell again on Friday against the yen and the mark. **********Over the long term, if the President is right, the economic fundamentals -- employment, inflation, interest rates -- will remain sound and the markets will stabilize the dollar at or above its current level. **********If the traders are right, the dollar will continue to fall, foreign investors will pull more money out of United States stock and bond markets and things could get increasingly disorderly. The Specter of Greenspan **********""The Administration is betting that they are right about the economic fundamentals, that the markets will adjust, and that this adjustment will be relatively painless for the American economy,"" said John P. Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers. ""The risk, which we have seen in dollar weaknesses in the past, is that market adjustments can involve overshooting and overselling, which produces undesirable economic effects."" **********The key unknown element is the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan. The Administration can think whatever it wants about the fundamentals, but if Mr. Greenspan thinks they are eroding, he can raise interest rates himself, independent of the Admnistration. **********So that is the poker game: Bill Clinton at the table with the currency traders. Each has chips in the pot. The traders have a pretty good idea what the President has in his hand, since he is not a very good bluffer. But the wild card is that fellow Greenspan standing at the President's shoulder. He has the ultimate poker face and no one knows when he might put his chips into the game."

Gordon Company, which represented the tenant. **********American Express Bank is relocating 300 employees, about half its New York staff, to 7 World Trade Center in a move that is expected to be completed by the end of the month, according to a company executive who declined to be named. The American Express Bank would maintain its headquarters in the American Express Tower at the World Financial Center, he said. **********The move is part of a shuffling of corporate office space prompted by American Express's sale a year ago of the Shearson unit of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. to the Primerica Corporation. Lehman Brothers remains a subsidiary of American Express. **********The 95,000 square feet that American Express Bank is vacating in the World Financial Center would be used by the Lehman Brothers administrative staff now at 388 Greenwich Street and the World Trade Center, the executive said. In July, Lehman Brothers plans to move its back office operations now at 388 and 390 Greenwich Street to 340,000 square feet at 101 Hudson Street, an office tower on the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City. American Express sold the Greenwich Street buildings to Primerica. **********American Express and its subsidiaries own the 2.2 million square feet they occupy at 3 World Financial Center. **********Seven World Trade Center, across Vesey Street from the main World Trade Center complex, was one of the largest speculative office projects of the 1980's; the main tenant was scheduled to be Drexel Burnham Lambert, the defunct brokerage firm. **********The 2-million-square-foot office tower was developed in the 1980's by Larry Silverstein, its owner, on property belonging to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The building is now is 93 percent leased, up from 75 percent three years ago, and its largest tenant is Salomon Brothers, which occupies 1.1 million square feet for its corporate headquarters.Network Office Expansion **********USA Networks, a growing cable television network, is taking 50,000 square feet of additional office space at Rockefeller Center in a sizable expansion of its corporate headquarters. **********The company, owned jointly by Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc., now occupies 79,000 square feet on part of the 8th and the entire 18th, 19th and 20th floors of 1230 Avenue of the Americas. The 20-story office building is known as the Paramount Publishing Building. After the move, scheduled for April, the company will also occupy the entire third floor and the rest of the eighth floor. **********The lease term is 11 years and three months, including a renegotiation of USA Networks' present lease, which expires next year, said Danielle DeCrette, a spokeswoman for Rockefeller Center. **********Dan Martinsen, a spokesman for USA Networks, said the company needed more space to accommodate growth. The company plans to start a Spanish-language channel in April in Latin America and has operated the Sci-Fi channel since September 1992. **********In January, USA Networks opened a 46,000 square foot area for broadcast and post-production operations at Newport Tower, a 36-story office building on the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City. The cable TV company has a 15-year lease at Newport Tower, Mr. Martinsen said.Group to Double Space **********In a move that will almost double its space, the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit group that aids refugees in 23 countries, has leased 33,124 square feet of office space at 122 East 42d Street and Lexington Avenue. **********The organization will occupy part of the 11th floor and the entire 12th floor of the 54-story office tower known as the Chanin Building. The group has an option to take an additional 24,000 square feet of space over the 16.5 years of the lease, said Howard Tenenbaum, a vice president at Helmsley-Spear Inc., which represented the tenant. The building is owned by a group of investors led by Stanley Stahl, who owns several office buildings in Manhattan. **********Stephen Richards, executive vice-president at the International Rescue Committee, said his group, which planned to move in April, needed more room to accommodate rapid growth during the last year. The group has stepped up relief efforts around the world because of the expanding number of refugees caused by escalating ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. **********The International Rescue Committee's revenues, largely from public donations and grants from the United Nations and United States Government agencies, increased to $78 million in 1993 from $54 million in 1992, Mr. Richards said. **********The International Rescue Committee, which was founded by Albert Einstein to aid people fleeing Nazi Germany, now occupies 17,000 square feet at 386 Park Avenue South, where its lease is expiring."

The new company may assume the pension obligations, or it may leave them with the previous company. **********Any benefits already earned will remain intact. But any benefits that workers would have earned by continuing to work for the same company may change. **********Longtime workers anticipating early retirement may have the most to lose. That's because special early retirement benefits ""can be changed or diminished,"" said Martin Slate, executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. **********""The difference can amount to tens of thousands of dollars,"" said Karen Ferguson of the Pension Rights Center. She described what happened to a 51-year-old who had worked for a company almost 30 years and would have soon been eligible for its generous early-retirement program.

Investors would like nothing more than to postpone sales until next year and reap the benefits promised by Republicans in Congress. But what if the value of their securities plunges in the meantime? **********In this choppy market, waiting until next year to sell winners is anything but risk free. In the last few months, the Dow Jones industrial average has ranged from striking distance of 4,000 to below 3,700. And swift declines, like the 91-point drop on Nov. 22, can quickly erase gains. **********For the uneasy, there is a safer route. A technique called shorting against the box lets investors defer taxes while protecting their portfolios from market declines. The practice involves borrowing additional shares from a broker and selling them immediately, thereby setting the sales price. Later, the borrowed shares are replaced with those already in the investor's portfolio. By beginning the transaction this year and waiting until next year to close it, the investor can lock in capital gains and postpone tax payments. **********The strategy will be even more lucrative if, as expected, Congress lowers long-term capital gains taxes next year, said Robert Willens, a tax analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York. **********""You get a double benefit,"" he said. ""You're deferring the gain and hopefully going to be able to have that gain taxed at a lower rate."" **********Say an investor bought 100 shares of Philip Morris in October 1993 at $46. That investor might want to sell now that the stock is trading at $59.625. But a sale would result in a long-term taxable gain for 1994 of $1,362.50 less commissions. **********To short against the box and defer taxes, the investor would borrow 100 more shares of Philip Morris and sell them at $59.625, incurring regular sales commissions. Some time next year, the transaction could be closed by replacing the borrowed shares with the ones already in the investor's portfolio or safe-deposit box (hence the term ""shorting against the box""). The gain would be realized at that point, meaning taxes might not be due until April 1996. **********By closing out the short position in January, ""you actually have full use of the proceeds of your sale for 15 months versus having the funds for less than four months if you sell in December 1994,"" said Dennis J. Drescher, a senior vice president in the Chicago offices of Smith Barney. **********The investor may incur interest expenses if the share price rises before the borrowed shares are replaced. Dividends on a borrowed stock are owed to the broker and are therefore treated as an investment expense. **********Shorting against the box is not the only way to lock in a gain. Because an investor cannot sell a stock short when it is declining in price, options may be better alternatives when a stock enters a free fall. Options may also work for investors who want to establish a minimum price but still benefit if the share price rises. **********If you are still moderately bullish on the stock it would make sense to buy a put, which gives you the right to sell the shares later at a set price, Mr. Willens said. If there is no sale, there are no taxes."

On Monday, Kodak's stock rose $3.25 a share on rumors that Sterling would be sold. **********The reaction among financial analysts was that Kodak was finally leaving businesses that it never should have entered in the first place. **********""He had to do it, and he did it,"" said Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with the investment firm Morgan Stanley. ""Those businesses were not making any money if you subtracted debt from operating earnings. So any earnings growth in the next 24 months will have to come from cost cutting."" **********Many on Wall Street sounded a sharp note of skepticism about whether the company would find much profitability in conventional film. ""The big question beyond the disposition of assets is what is going to happen to the core business,"" said B. Alex Henderson, with Prudential Securities Research. ""How are they going to offset tremendously negative factors in film and paper and demonstrate they can make money in electronic imaging?"" **********Among its health businesses, the company said it planned to retain only its medical and dental imaging businesses, which use both X-ray film and electronics. Kodak said that the French pharmaceuticals company Elf Sanofi, which has several joint programs with Sterling, had the right of first refusal to buy the pharmaceutical portion of Sterling Winthrop. **********No buyers have yet been found for the other, smaller pieces of Sterling, which include over-the-counter remedies, or for the other Kodak units that have been put up for sale. **********Kodak officials declined to say how much money they expected to realize from the sales, saying they were in preliminary negotiations with potential buyers. However, they conceded the company might have an unspecified ""book loss"" for the year, once all the details, including tax treatment, were worked out. **********This is the second major divestiture for Kodak, which last year spun off its Eastman Chemical Company, which had $3.9 billion in sales. In addition, the company has sold several smaller operations. Company Will Shrink **********As a result of the sales and divestitures, the company will be much smaller, with about $13 billion in sales compared with $20.2 billion at the end of 1992. But it will shortly have less debt as well because the company has said it will use the proceeds of the sales ""to achieve significant debt reduction."" At the end of the year, Kodak had $7.2 billion in long-term debt. **********Mr. Fisher said the divestitures would permit the company's managers to concentrate on the core imaging business. And he continued to resist calls from Wall Street to sharply reduce staffing levels. ""Rather than simply take an ax to budgets and manpower, we are trying to change, in significant ways, how this company operates,"" Mr. Fisher said. **********Mr. Fisher said the company would ""focus on profitable participation in the five links of the imaging chain: image capture, processing, storage, output, and delivery of images for people and machines anywhere in Kodak's worldwide market."" **********He said Kodak would press its traditional sale of consumer products, like film and photographic paper, and would move into electronic imaging in areas where ""Kodak can profitably compete."" **********Mr. Fisher said he had established 10 special teams to improve return on net assets by increasing revenues and cutting costs. The program includes growth of market, asset management, span-of-control, cost of quality, research and development productivity, marketing opportunities, portfolio review, process re-engineering, cycle-time improvement and policy opportunities. Fisher to Lead Groups **********Mr. Fisher said he would personally lead the growth of market and cycle-time improvement groups. **********The biggest piece of the divestitures will be Sterling Winthrop, which Kodak acquired in 1988 for $5.1 billion. But analysts say Sterling has never become an integral part of Kodak's business and has been a drain on the company's capital budget and a distraction for management. **********Although Elf Sanofi has first rights to bid on Sterling's pharmaceutical operations, there may be at least one competitor. A spokesman for the German drug company Bayer A.G. said yesterday that the company was interested in buying Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business in the United States. **********Sterling markets a number of drugs under the Bayer name and the German pharmaceutical company has long wanted to reclaim its name in the United States. It lost control of the name in this country after World War I."

That figure peaked at $216 billion last fall, not long after the bond market itself peaked. Then, as bond market losses grew and speculators fled for cover, it fell to $125 billion in April. **********But it has been rising since then, and last week the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that the lending was back to $206 billion as of Aug. 17. To be sure, the figures are volatile from week to week, but even looking at them on a five-week moving average the figure has risen from a low of less than $150 billion to $189 billion now. **********""These numbers show there is no fear"" among bond investors, said James A. Bianco, the director of research at Arbor Trading Group, a brokerage firm in Barrington, Ill. ""People are still comfortable doing this even after a year in which the market has not rewarded them for doing this."" **********Much of that borrowing -- as well as borrowing from other lenders such as banks -- is for a strategy of borrowing at short-term rates and buying longer-term securities. That produces a clear profit -- it is called a ""carry"" in the business -- if rates remain level. But if short-term rates rise, the cost of financing the position goes up, eroding or even wiping out the profits. And higher rates for longer-term securities can drive down the value of the longer-term securities that were purchased. **********The sheer amount of speculation earlier this year was widely held responsible for the rapidity with which interest rates rose. Many speculators, ranging from huge hedge funds to small investors who thought they had found an easy way to make money, unwound their positions quickly, driving interest rates higher. But many analysts had thought the speculative tide in the bond markets had eased. **********There is no clear measure of the total amount of bond market speculation. The figures on borrowing from the leading bond dealers -- called primary dealers -- is only a small part of the speculation. But the fact that it is headed up has caught attention as a sign that many investors believe the worst is over for bonds, and that the big profits of the past three years are the norm. **********""There has been a great speculative mania in bonds, conditioned by these three years in which you could do no wrong if you were long,"" said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a New York financial newsletter. ""The reflex in the bond market is to be long and levered,"" he added, using market slang for owning bonds purchased with borrowed money. **********The data on lending by primary dealers cover the period only up to the last increase in short-term interest rates by the Fed in August, and reflect a widespread confidence at that time that the Fed's move would be the last one for a while and that bond prices were likely to rally. **********They did for a time but recently fell back and the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 7.77 percent, the highest since June 1992. Yesterday, bond prices rallied a bit, pushing the yield on 30-year bonds down to 7.75 percent. **********The optimism of investors shows that many think the worst is over in the bond market and reflects the fact that they have not grown concerned about the poor returns of the Treasury market. According to figures compiled by Ryan Labs of New York, the worst 12 months ever for investors in 30-year Treasuries was from April 1979 through March 1980, when an investor lost 17.2 percent of the value of such bonds, even after considering the income from the bond's coupon. **********But, Mr. Bianco said, a buyer of 30-year bonds at last October's high for bond prices, when the 30-year bond yield fell to 5.78 percent, has seen a loss of 18.3 percent since then through Friday. **********Most bond market investors own bonds with maturities far shorter than 30 years, and as a result suffer less when interest rates rise. But even so, this has been an unusually bad year for bonds. Ryan Labs computes a total return index for the entire market of Treasury notes and bonds, and calculates that from the start of the year through Friday the market had taken a loss of 3.54 percent. That is, the capital losses on longer-term bonds have offset the interest income by that amount. **********Given the nature of the Treasury markets, such losses are highly unusual. The last full year in which Treasury investors incurred a loss was in 1969, when the deficit came to seven-tenths of 1 percent. Ryan Labs has computed its index back to 1950, and reports that the worst calendar year was in 1959, when the loss came to 2.34 percent. **********To Mr. Bianco, the fact that speculation in the bond market has come roaring back, even amid such losses, is proof that investors remain overconfident. When the market really bottoms, and interest rates top out, he believes that there will be far fewer investors willing to speculate on bonds. For now, he says, the current wave of speculators is unlikely to make money."

Baeza, a Wall Street lawyer with short-lived diplomatic aspirations, switched careers yesterday and joined the Wasserstein Perella Group as a senior executive who will concentrate on building Latin American business for the New York investment bank. **********""Every so often the spirit of adventure calls,"" said Mr. Baeza, who is leaving the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, where he started 20 years ago after graduating from Harvard Law School. **********Mr. Baeza, 43, who had been a partner and founder of the firm's 30-member Latin America group, will be president of Wasserstein Perella International, chief executive of the company's Latin American operations and co-head of its operations in Spain and Portugal. More Direct Role in Deals **********In many ways, Mr. Baeza said, his new job will be like his old one, concentrating on developing new business opportunities in Latin America. But, as an investment banker, he said, he will have a more direct role in putting deals together and in following them to conclusion. **********""There is a one-step-removed quality to being a lawyer, where your success and what you get paid"" are not necessarily functions of whether deals actually close, Mr. Baeza said. ""This is going to be different."" **********One place where Mr. Baeza said he hoped to do a lot of business eventually is Cuba, which is now under an American trade embargo. Mr. Baeza's parents were born in Cuba, and, although he was born in Montclair, N.J., the family moved back to Havana for four years when he was a child. It was his longtime interest in seeing Cuba opened eventually for business opportunities that scuttled his diplomatic dreams last year. Opposition From Anti-Castroites **********Mr. Baeza was scheduled to become Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, the State Department's top Latin American post, in the spring of 1993. At the last minute, the Clinton Administration scratched his name from a list of nominees sent to the Senate after Cuban-American groups and their supporters in Congress protested that Mr. Baeza would not be tough enough toward Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro. **********""The whole experience made me take a step back and think about what I was doing,"" Mr. Baeza said. ""I decided maybe it was time for career No. 2."" **********Barry R. Bryan, Debevoise & Plimpton's presiding partner, said of Mr. Baeza, ""His new job is really a perfect fit for his deal-making talents, which he exhibited as a lawyer, and his interests in Latin America."" Role in Telmex Deal **********While at the law firm, Mr. Baeza worked on deals that involved Wasserstein Perella. One was the Mexican Government's 1990 sale of control of its national telephone company to an international consortium. **********When Mr. Baeza was still a youngster, his family returned to New Jersey, where his father became chairman of the economics, marketing and research department at Seton Hall University. Mr. Baeza was good enough on his high school baseball team to be offered a tryout with an Atlanta Braves farm team but chose instead to go to Cornell University and then Harvard Law School. **********He and his wife, Della, also a lawyer, have two daughters and a son."

(It's Not Performance),INVESTMENT CLUBS; What Splits Up Groups? (It's Not Performance)," **********INVESTMENT clubs are forming at a rate of just under a hundred a week despite a troubled investment climate. But not all will survive, much less prosper. **********The National Association of Investment Investors Corporation, which tracks and represents the clubs, said one in four will disintegrate during their first 18 months. Surprisingly, poor investment performance is rarely the reason for failure. **********The demise usually occurs because of a weakness in leadership, a lack of commitment by members or a muddled investment approach, said Barry Murphy, the director of marketing for the investors association, which recently moved its headquarters to Madison Heights, Mich., from Royal Oak. **********""We found that the clubs that survived all followed a formal agenda at each meeting,"" Mr. Murphy said, drawing on surveys of members. **********Hallmarks of the surviving groups were making specific assignments so that everyone contributed (even if just keeping the books or taking the minutes), forging close links among members and maintaining an egalitarian approach.  A club that leaves most of the work to one or two members, no matter how skilled and willing they are, is asking for trouble. ""Those who do the work quickly get tired of doing it all,"" Mr. Murphy said. **********Thus, a club might want to make it part of the president's role right from the start to take aside any member who is not contributing and encourage that person to take on a task or resign. ""Don't wait until everyone's complaining,"" Mr. Murphy advised. **********Neil Sternberg, a dentist in Grand Prairie, Tex., discovered this pitfall when he tried to start an investment club with a few of his dental pals last spring. **********""They were looking for someone else to do it all,"" he said. When it became clear that this wasn't going to happen, the group felt apart, he said. **********New clubs should be equally alert, Mr. Murphy said, to the ""dictator"" syndrome -- relying too heavily on the opinion of one know-it-all member. Lively debate and a sense of joint ownership will rapidly fade, Mr. Murphy warned. So will the strength of performance that comes from the combined wisdom of many people. **********Richard Maturi, a business writer in Cheyenne, Wyo., argues in ""Main Street Beats Wall Street"" (Probus, $22.95) that the melding of many minds is what allows many investment clubs to outperform professional money managers. **********""In a club there are more people analyzing a company and more people who must be convinced before a decision can be made,"" he said in a recent telephone interview. **********Clubs can also run into trouble because members' lives are just too harried to do the group justice. Dean Pownall, a loan officer at U.S. Bank in Portland, Ore., helped start a club recently that suffered from repeated scheduling conflicts. **********""We couldn't even find a time when we could all meet on a consistent basis,"" Mr. Pownall said. Furthermore, research assignments were never completed. The club fizzled, and the $25 monthly contributions, still uninvested, were returned. **********Personality conflicts that can threaten a club often erupt when a decision to buy a stock is based on a tip that a member picked up at a cocktail party or the barber, Mr. Murphy said. **********Limiting discussion to recommendations based on solid research and acting only with consensus often smooths the path. **********Other arguments, he said, may begin if a club fails to regularly review each stock in its portfolio. Just leaving stocks there, untended, may be viewed as someone's mistake down the road, he said. **********Even though camaraderie among members is important, it can be taken too far. Mr. Murphy's organization concluded that too much social chit-chat could also be hazardous to a club's health."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/business/investing-municipals-beckon-but-beware-rate-rise.html,Francis Flaherty,1994-02-12,,781,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"Municipals Beckon, But Beware Rate Rise","INVESTING; Municipals Beckon, But Beware Rate Rise"," **********FOR bond investors who are at sea over the improving economy, municipals may be an inviting port of call. But, like all who may be affected by rising interest rates, buyers of tax-exempts should consider ways to batten down the hatches. **********Last August, the Clinton tax increases made municipals much more lucrative. Last year's low interest rates also produced a record $290 billion in new municipals, making them relatively cheap. Indeed, long-term municipals are now earning 83 percent of what comparable, federally taxable Treasuries earn. **********At this high ratio, ""The tax-free feature is almost gravy,"" said James Lebenthal, a New York dealer. **********This year added another attraction to municipals: the belief that new ones will soon be much rarer. ""1993 was a flood; 1994 will be a drought,"" said Ian A. MacKinnon, the bond chief at Vanguard Group. This January saw only $14.7 billion in new issues, while January 1993 saw $18.4 billion. **********If the dearth continues, it will put upward pressure on the price of municipals. This means get-'em-now-while-they're-cheap, of course, but it also means a blunting of today's big bond bugaboo -- rising interest rates. **********Should long rates rise half a percentage point this year, ""the price of Treasuries will decline 5 percent and municipals by only 3 or 4 percent,"" said Paul Williams, research director at John Nuveen & Company. **********Finally, as tax revenues grow with the economy, dealers are offering many confident buy recommendations. James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory newsletter ($250, 212 663-5552), likes a $13 million Cambridge, Mass., bond because the city's major industries -- schools and health -- are looking up. He likes a $400 million North Carolina bond, too, since the state ""has put its financial house in order."" **********Mr. MacKinnon of Vanguard likes bonds from New York -- city and state. ""Wall Street is on a roll,"" he explained, ""and the state's economy is diversified."" Specifically, Mr. Lebenthal recommends the state's Dormitory Authority bonds. **********All in all, municipals sound good -- but they are still bonds. How can an investor profit safely if the economy is entering a period of rising rates? **********""Buy and hold"" is the customary answer. By holding, an investor receives the stated interest during the life of the bond and, at maturity, its face, or par, value. The strategy shields investors from notoriously unpredictable interest rates. **********Unfortunately, while mutual funds have many virtues -- expert managers, diversification -- they lack the ability to buy and hold. **********""A fund is forever -- it never matures,"" said Wayne F. Nelson, a broker at Merrill Lynch. Fund managers must buy and sell bonds to put new money to use, to pay redemptions and to plump up yields undercut by management fees. If rates rise, this unavoidable activity will spell trouble. **********""You may be the world's best health-stock picker,"" Mr. Nelson reasoned. ""But if the health sector goes down, so does your fund."" And fund trades can create taxable capital gains -- something municipal investors presumably want to avoid. **********Those who think this defect outweighs funds' virtues should consider individual bonds -- if they have $50,000 to diversify adequately. **********Generally traded over the counter in blocks of five $1,000 bonds, municipals are always sold net, ""so you don't know the commission,"" Mr. Nelson said. Thus, he advises comparison-shopping -- asking three brokers for prices on, say, $25,000 of New York City A bonds. Or buy new issues, whose prices are known. **********Merrill charges commissions of 0.125 percent to 2 percent on bonds, Mr. Nelson said, though 4 percent fees are not unknown in the industry. **********Be mindful of bonds' terms of call, or early redemption. Calls expose investors to the very interest rate risk that the ""buy and hold"" method neutralizes. But wary investors can avoid the danger. ""There are noncallables all over,"" Mr. Lynch said. **********Investors can also ""buy and hold"" municipals through unit investment trusts, available through bankers and brokers. Like funds, trusts are professionally assembled, diversified portfolios, with modest minimum investments and monthly dividend checks. But, unlike funds, trusts are passive. The bonds are held to maturity. **********Nuveen, a big packager of these trusts along with Merrill Lynch and Van Kampen Merritt, has ""3,000 outstanding trusts with $20 billion,"" Mr. Williams said. Nuveen Short Intermediate Insured Trust 27 is typical. It has 14 issues, a five-year average maturity and a $5,000 minimum investment. And a sales fee. A $20,000 purchase carries a 3 percent charge; a $150,000 one, 2.6 percent."

But, in order to enrich the superhighway's offerings and to be faithful to our traditions, this resistance must be overcome. **********There are many ways to help noncommercial services onto the superhighway, and two pending Congressional bills display the variety. The Antitrust and Communications Reform Act, which just passed the House of Representatives, allows nonprofits to pay less than others for certain superhighway services. The second bill, pending in the Senate, is the National Public Telecommunications Infrastructure Act. Sponsored by Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, the measure reserves up to 20 percent of the superhighway for free use by certain Government agencies and nonprofit groups, and also levies a fee on telecommunications networks for the support of noncommercial information services. **********But, whatever the approach, the large telephone and cable companies are usually against it. All these initiatives mean less money in the corporate pocket from home shopping, pay-per-view videos and other superhighway offerings. **********Nevertheless, these aid plans make sense. Market forces can deliver to us certain types of entertainment and information programs and services, and some will be good. But much will also be missing. The next generation of noncommercial information services -- the counterparts to today's ""All Things Considered"" on radio, ""The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour"" on television and the corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available free on  the Internet -- will not flourish on the superhighway without Congressional action. **********Such action is hardly untried. Americans have long supported and promoted noncommercial use of their vital communications systems. **********Many people know the Federal Communications Commission reserves licenses for  public television stations, for example, and that Congress gives money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nation's public television network. But Congress also furnishes matching grants for the construction of local noncommercial television stations. And the F.C.C. also reserves a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 87.9 and 91.9 on the FM dial, for noncommercial radio. **********Nor is that all. For bulk mailings, the United States Postal Service charges  low ""preferred rates"" to certain nonprofit groups. Also, many state and local governments require cable companies to offer channels for public, educational and governmental uses, and some towns require them to finance local video productions. **********These programs' purposes are varied. Preferred mailing rates aid nonprofits'  fund-raising and communication with members. Reserved licenses for public television stations enrich the mix of information on a communication medium. But they all enforce a national commitment to noncommercial communication. This tradition should not lightly be abandoned. **********Of course, it is not easy to apply this longstanding principle to an emerging technology like the superhighway. There are many other thorny problems as well.  Which institutions, for example, will receive these noncommercial preferences? **********However the issues are resolved, Congress must now offer support for such preferences. Unless the nation wants to overturn its long tradition of supporting noncommercial uses of radio, television and the mails -- and to shuck all the values underpinning that tradition -- it must necessarily do the same on the superhighway."

The boat people will be given an opportunity to rest and receive medical attention before their interviews. **********Concerned that many applicants would be rejected without thorough consideration of their claims, the High Commissioner pressed the Administration to grant an appeal process. The appeal will be a limited one in which Haitians can add information to their files after the interviewer informs them that their claims will be rejected. **********Then a ""quality assurance officer"" from the Immigration and Naturalization Service will review the file and decide whether further discussion with the applicant is appropriate. Representatives of the High Commissioner can review applications and counsel Haitians to add information. The quality assurance officer will then make a final determination. **********Haitians who are rejected will be sent back to Haiti within a few days. If accepted, they will be resettled in the United States or in other countries. **********Advocates of Haitian refugees attacked the planned screening procedures today, especially the limited appeal process. 'A Very Meager Process' **********""It's probably a misnomer to call it an appeal,"" said Arthur Helton, director of migration programs for the Open Society Institute. ""There is an effort to portray this as an extraordinarily generous arrangement. In my view, it's a very meager process in terms of procedural safeguards."" **********Many lawyers for Haitian refugees complain that the procedures neither allow the Haitians to have counsel nor give them time to assemble documents or witnesses. **********In a letter to State Department officials, Kosi Asomani, the High Commissioner's special envoy for Haiti, did not hide his ambivalence about the agreement, saying he hoped that the procedures would be reviewed once land-based processing began. **********The Administration plans in several weeks to begin land-based processing of Haitians in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. **********One signal that worries lawyers for Haitian refugees is that some Administration officials predict that the percentage of Haitian boat people who are granted refugee status will not be much higher than the 5 percent who have been accepted in the last year."

""I think Rockwell's background as a major defense contractor and systems integrator puts them in the catbird seat as one of the potential major forces behind this movement,"" said Tim Archdeacon, research director for Allied Business Intelligence, a high-tech market research company in Oyster Bay, N.Y. **********Mr. Archdeacon said that as one of the four companies chosen by the Transportation Department to develop common Federal standards and architecture for the new market, Rockwell has gained recognition as a company with a long-term commitment to the reinvestment initiative in the nation's transportation system. **********""From what I have seen, Rockwell has made I.V.H.S. a major undertaking and has produced a car navigation system that is an excellent piece of work,"" said James Costantino, executive director the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Society of America, a trade group financed by the Government and industry to promote the development of such technology. **********Mr. Costantino said a recent study by the trade group estimates that the market for I.V.H.S. products will be $209 billion over the next 20 years, which would make I.V.H.S. the largest public works program in United States history. About 80 percent of the market is expected to come from products purchased by consumers for their cars. The remaining 20 percent is expected to come from the public sector to upgrade infrastructure. Currently, the market is about $1 billion a year, Mr. Costantino said, split between the Federal Government, state governments and the private sector. **********In addition to Rockwell, BDM International, Calspan, Honeywell, G.M. Hughes, I.B.M., Lockheed, Martin Marietta, Motorola, Northrop, Raytheon, Science Applications International and TRW are involved in I.V.H.S. studies and ventures. **********Kent Black, Rockwell's executive vice president and chief operating officer, said the company's experience in electronics, automotive parts, low-cost manufacturing and systems integration has positioned it well to develop technologies for the smart car-highway market. ""It's a small business for Rockwell today, but we think it will grow very quickly,"" he said. **********Among Rockwell's most promising products is a navigation system for passenger cars that means motorists won't ever have to stop to ask for directions. To use the system, the motorist types the address of a desired destination onto a small keypad, and the system provides directions -- the name of the street at the next turn and a graphic arrow showing the direction to turn -- on a small screen attached to the dashboard. **********During the ride to the destination, the on-board computer regularly updates directions on the display. About two-tenths of a mile from a turn, a voice tells the motorist when to ""turn right or turn left,"" and a chime sounds as the turn is executed. **********The system, which will be available later this year initially on one Oldsmobile model, relies on a small computer in the trunk and a series of satellites that calculate the position of the car in relation to its destination. The satellites are known as a global positioning system, which was developed for the military to help troops find their way in remote places. **********Similar navigation systems offered by Japanese car makers cost about $4,500. Rockwell has reduced the price of its system to $2,000 through semiconductor miniaturization and cheaper manufacturing techniques. The price is expected to drop to less than $500 within five years, company officials said. **********THE Zexel Corporation developed the software for the system, and Rockwell supplied the commercial electronics manufacturing, global positioning system and relationship with automobile makers. **********Rockwell has also introduced a traffic sensor called Trafficam that allows transportation agencies to monitor traffic flow and vehicle speed in real time. The sensor, which uses machine-vision technology, can, for example, perform freeway surveillance and control ramp meters and traffic signals based on flow and congestion. Currently, traffic monitoring is done by using wire loops buried in the pavement, and installation and repair of these loops are expensive and tie up traffic. The Rockwell sensors, which are priced at about $2,000 each, can be mounted on posts or traffic lights. **********For trucking companies that need to keep in constant communication with their fleets, Rockwell has developed a mobile communications system called Pro2000 that gives drivers real-time, two-way communications with their dispatchers anywhere in North America. Using the global positioning system, Pro2000 tells the dispatcher the location of every truck at any given time."

Some analysts said they were concerned that the rate increase could signal the end of rate reductions throughout Europe, especially in Germany. **********Italy raised its discount rate to 7.5 percent, from 7 percent, its first increase since September 1992. The Italian central bank said in a statement that the rate increase was aimed at allowing ""economic recovery to continue without reigniting inflation."" **********The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, lifted its money market rate, the securities repurchase rate, to 7.20 percent, from 6.92 percent. It raised its key lending rate -- what it charges banks for loans -- to 8 percent, from 7.5 percent. **********""With Italy and Sweden raising rates, Germany can't be far behind,"" said Paul Kasriel, an economist at Northern Trust Company in Chicago.

Even so, Mr. Vitner said he thought the dollar's slump today was overdone because Germany was still likely to cut interest rates at least once more this year. **********The interest rate increases also hurt stocks because of concern that they would jeopardize the fragile economic recovery on the Continent. **********Urban Baeckstron, governor of the Riksbank, said the central bank was moving at ""an early stage to counter a tendency to increased inflation."" **********In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange index fell 28.80 points, to 3,138.2.

""The voice of the land is in the language,"" she said, adding that a ""new awareness of our language, our culture, who we are"" all flowed from the 1990 crisis. **********There is no better illustration of this new search for Mohawk identity than the school itself, called Rotiwennenkehte (roughly translated as people have the responsibility for carrying on the language), with its Mohawk study books and bright drawings of hunting scenes on the walls. A sign at the entrance reads, ""Watkwanonwe:ron,"" or ""We Welcome You"" (the colon represents an accent). Police Officer Killed **********The Oka crisis began on July 11, 1990, when the police tried to dismantle a roadblock Mohawks had put up to prevent the municipal authorities of the resort town on the Ottawa River 20 miles west of Montreal from expanding a golf course on land the 1,500 Kanesatake Indians regard as their own. In the confrontation, a police corporal, Marcel Lemay, was killed. **********The 78-day standoff that followed gripped the country and galvanized Indian politics. The current confrontation between the Mexican authorities and Indian peasants in the southern state of Chiapas has brought back vivid memories of that period. **********""Their treaties, like our treaties, are being broken time and time again,"" said Deborah Etienne, who was at the barricade in 1990. Mrs.  Etienne, whose Mohawk name, Karonhianoron, means precious cloud, is a craftswoman whose specialty is beadwork. **********""There is still great anger here,"" she said in an interview in her modest frame home about a mile from the school. ""The land is our identity, our life, and they wanted to take it away from us. Now they treat us like criminals. They call us murderers and thieves. Our land claims are not settled. Nothing is resolved."" Daughter at the Barricade **********Her daughter Shawna, 13 at the time, was also at the barricade. At one point, Shawna said, she found herself looking into the barrel of an M-16 rifle. **********Shawna Etienne is now completing her last year in high school and hopes to be admitted to the University of Massachusetts as a pre-med student.  She is bused every day to what is officially known as the Mohawk Survival School, a high school offering Mohawk language and culture as well as traditional subjects, in the Mohawk reserve at Kahnawake, about 20 miles away. **********Like the Indians in Mexico, the Mohawks and other native peoples in Canada want more programs for economic development, better housing grants, speedier progress on their land claims. **********Negotiations with the Canadian authorities continue in all these areas, but as Robert Gabriel, a 28-year-old chief on the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake, put it, ""I believe their mandate is never to settle with us; it's always to keep us up in the air."" **********Also like the Indians of Mexico, many of Canada's 400,000 tribal people as well as those of mixed ancestry who identify as Indians live on the fringes of society. Testimony taken by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, a group created in reaction to Oka, show high rates of suicide and crime, alcoholism and drug addition and economic despair. **********Although no complete agreement exists even among Indian leaders about remedial action, the commission's report, to be published next winter, is expected to call for self-government similar to that on American reservations as a way of increasing self-esteem and economic self-reliance. **********While the Mohawks still hotly condemn the police intervention, the authorities responsible for the raid on the roadblock insist they were fully justified. 'A Criminal Situation' **********""We had a criminal situation going on,"" said Robert Lavigne, director general of the Quebec provincial police. ""There was the fact the injunctions"" -- to dismantle the barricade -- ""weren't being obeyed, there was the increasing crime and there was the possibility of a confrontation between whites and Mohawks."" **********In the end the authorities had to back down. The barricade was dismantled only after the troops withdrew. No one was ever arrested for the death of Corporal Lemay. The golf course was never built. **********In fact, young Mohawk warriors have built wooden huts and wigwams where they might be watching golfers putt if they had not built the barricades. They are doing a land office business there, openly selling cheap smuggled cigarettes. **********But in the sitting room of Deborah Etienne, the anger still resonates. ""The whole point of government is to keep the natives down,"" said John Cree, 48, who drives the school bus to Kahnawake and who was among Mohawks she invited to join a discussion. **********And a young warrior who would only give his name as Rain said he did not think the battle with the Government was over yet. ""We can get mad at any time,"" he said."

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in September 1991. **********Diplomats said the split at the O.A.S. occurred after the United States, Argentina and Antigua sought to introduce language that would have closely echoed Mr. Clinton's own recent statements, saying that the use of force should not be ruled out in Haiti. **********In the end, because of the breadth of the opposition, the proposed reference to force was dropped from a resolution condemning Haiti's military for appointing an interim president to replace Father Aristide. **********""The Secretary General is a man who feels very strongly that we should not resort to the use of force,"" said Hugo de Zela, spokesman for Joao Baena Soares, the head of the organization. ""There is a lot of margin for political pressure and diplomacy, which he feels can still work. But under no circumstances does he feel we should use military force."" **********American officials who have alluded to the possibility that force might be necessary to restore democracy to Haiti have usually said that any such force should be constituted from a variety of nations and operate under a mandate from the United Nations or the Organization of American States. **********But diplomats at both international organizations said that strong sentiment against armed intervention in Haiti would complicate and possibly block forming a multilateral force. **********At the United Nations, officials said that current plans called for bringing in a small force of military trainers, whose mission would be to separate Haiti's police from its army and begin retraining each. But this would only begin once Haiti's present military leadership left office. **********A similar mission empowered by the Security Council was aborted last October, only two weeks before the negotiated date for Father Aristide's return, when a mob of army sympathizers firing small arms rioted near the piers where the American troopship Harlan County, carrying about 200 Canadian and American military trainers, was scheduled to dock. A 'Dissuasive Force' **********Officials said that any foreign trainers would have to be accompanied by a ""dissuasive force."" Asked what this meant, one diplomat said: a smaller number of soldiers equipped with ""larger means and bigger weapons."" **********Under the original training mission, only selected foreign officers were to be allowed to carry sidearms. The other trainers would have been unarmed. **********If the Haitian Army continued to refuse to relinquish power, a diplomat said, an ""enforcement mechanism"" would be required to clear the country's docks and perhaps round up the Haitian military's top echelon. **********""This is a plan with three scenarios,"" said one diplomat who has been closely involved in high-level discussions on Haiti's crisis. ""Each time we go to a higher level, that would require a new resolution and a new debate in the Security Council. I don't know how difficult that would be, but it has to be faced."" Opposition From Aristide **********A final obstacle to the use of force comes from Father Aristide himself. Last May, during the original planning for the United Nations supervision of Haiti's transition toward democratic rule, diplomats said Father Aristide's own strong opposition to the presence of armed foreign personnel in the country led them to conceive the lightly equipped force of trainers. **********More recently, Father Aristide, stating that Haitian law bars him from requesting foreign intervention, has said that the Haitian people will welcome any effort to rescue them from military rule. ""He has come as close as one can get within the bounds of respect for the Constitution,"" said Robert White, an American adviser to the Haitian leader. **********If approval for an intervention is to come from the United Nations, many feel that the exiled President will have to invite the action more directly. ""This question is going to have to be faced more squarely by Father Aristide,"" one diplomat said."

Widens Partnership Investigation,S.E.C. Widens Partnership Investigation," **********After years of investigating Prudential Securities' improper sales of limited partnerships, Government regulators are turning their attention to the rest of Wall Street. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission's inquiry focuses on partnership sales by several of the country's biggest brokerage firms, including the Paine Webber Group, Merrill Lynch & Company, Dean Witter Reynolds and Lehman Brothers, people with knowledge of the investigation said yesterday. **********The investigation, which is being handled out of several S.E.C. offices, is examining whether the brokerage firms misled investors about the safety and potential returns from a series of limited partnerships, which invest in assets like real estate and oil wells. **********The S.E.C.'s enforcement division began the investigation last spring, following several months of informally studying partnership sales materials from about 10 Wall Street firms. The formal order of investigation, captioned ""In the Matter of Certain Limited Partnership Sales,"" whittled down that number to just four firms. It does not specify any individual partnerships that are being examined. **********As a result, the enforcement staff from the agency's offices in Washington and Chicago is not limited in terms of which partnership sales it can examine in the investigation. The agency has subpoenaed sales material and other records from a number of the firms pertaining to partnership sales dating back to 1980. **********The formal order of investigation incorrectly names Smith Barney as one of the firms under investigation, people with knowledge of the situation said. But the investigation actually pertains to partnership sales made by Shearson Lehman Hutton, whose assets were purchased by Smith Barney last year. Lehman Brothers is the successor brokerage to Shearson. **********Officials at Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter and Lehman declined comment. In a statement, Paine Webber confirmed that it was cooperating with the S.E.C. inquiry. **********Paine Webber added that it believed the majority of the partnerships were sold properly, but that in instances where it had found ""that inappropriate sales materials were used to influence client investment decisions, or that limited partnerships were sold to investors for whom they were unsuitable"" the firm had promptly resolved client claims. **********The S.E.C. as a matter of policy does not comment on investigations in progress. **********The broad S.E.C. inquiry comes after almost four years of investigation of fraudulent partnership sales practices at Prudential, one of the leaders in the business in that decade. The Prudential investigation, in which the Government developed evidence of widespread deception at the firm in its sale of partnerships, sparked the interest in the practices of the other firms. **********Last month, Prudential admitted criminal wrongdoing in its partnership sales as part of an agreement that allowed the firm to sidestep criminal indictment. Also, the firm has paid $660 million into a settlement fund to compensate defrauded investors. The firm has spent close to $1.2 billion in all settlements and fees. **********People with knowledge of the investigation said that at this point the problems at the other firms did not appear to be of the same magnitude as Prudential's, and that customer losses from the investments were far lower. But they said that many documents, including internal sales material used by the firm, were similar to the misleading material used by Prudential. **********The billions of dollars in partnerships sold in the 1980's have proved to be among the worst investments ever peddled by Wall Street. With the firms taking large commissions and other fees off the top, only a fraction of investor's capital was put to work. **********But, unlike investments in stocks or bonds, that money was often used to buy depleting assets, like an oil well, making it impossible for investors to see good returns without significant increases in oil prices. **********The investments proved extremely vulnerable when, in the late 1980's, the market for many hard assets, including real estate, simply collapsed, leaving clients who thought they had invested their money safely with billions in losses."

Will appetites still be so keen after a flurry of new issues in the Euromarkets, including a $1 billion equity offering expected within six weeks? **********After talking to about 15 international institutions, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd., a state-owned company with a monopoly on international telephone calls in and out of India, settled on two investment houses, Salomon Brothers Inc. and Kleinwort Benson Securities, to place about 20 percent of the company with international investors through a global depositary receipt program. The receipts are certificates representing stocks that trade on bourses in other countries. **********The Videsh Sanchar deal, dwarfing anything else in the relatively young market for Indian international equities and convertible bonds, is being seen by many analysts as a test of market depth and as a proxy for overall India investment. **********""It will be a flagship funding exercise,"" said Pradip Shah, managing director of Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd. ""It will make an impact in international capital markets that everyone will be watching."" **********Judging from the $1 billion in net foreign investment that entered India's domestic stockmarkets this year, investors appear convinced India's three- year-old economic reform program has staying power. This is despite a trinity of interests fearful of the future in an open economy: a massive public sector, strong unions, and long-protected industrialists. **********Investors are, if not re-rating India, at least re- weighting their Asian portfolios in that populous nation's favor while analysts descend on India en masse to build up often scant research for a host of new clients among country-specific India funds. **********However, many of the foreign investors who have government approval to buy Indian shares directly have been reluctant to do so. Wariness of opaque trading procedures and antiquated clearing systems steers them back to the Euromarkets - the international offshore financing arenas that do not fall under national regulations - which are expanding rapidly as Indian companies scramble to obtain low-cost capital. **********The combination of investor enthusiasm and Indian corporations' desire to raise money to prepare for the increased competition featuring in national reforms has spawned a rush of convertibles, global depositary receipts and private placements to approved foreign investors. **********Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, and Chakravarty Rangarajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, indicated that while foreign investment flows were causing the rupee to appreciate, their greatest concerns were about the impact of financing on India's overall indebtedness. **********Not every industrialist is joining the rush. Some believe their companies's shares are undervalued and are loath to sell down their stakes, despite a five-month, 60-percent rise in the Bombay Stock Exchange's key index. **********""Indian companies are now priced too long in the stock market considering their future potential growth,"" said K.K. Modi, the eldest of five brothers who control a group of family businesses. ""Some people are giving away their companies these days."" **********However, dozens of convertible issues have been approved, and financial advisers camped in the grand Taj Mahal hotel on Bombay's waterside say many more global depositary receipts are coming as well. ""Given the demand we've seen in the past few months, I would say the VSNL deal would go well,"" said Ayaz Ebrahim, who manages Indosuez's Himalaya Fund. ""But if the amount of issues continue at their current pace, we will see their premiums slide back to par over the next six months."" **********The Videsh Sanchar deal, which is expected to value the company at about 100 times year-to- March 1993 earnings, might seem ambitious, but the company is apparently counting on three strong sales stories: telecommunications, India, and the concern's ability to manage fast growth."

They can do so by making annual gifts of up to $10,000, or $20,000 a couple, to family members or others. **********They can even give away a percentage of the house as an annual gift, as long as they obey the rule that limits them to $10,000 annually. **********""If the estate is large enough, then you can use a qualified personal residence trust, one of the last remaining home runs in estate planning,"" said Martin M.

""Now the boss comes here first when he's looking for someone."" **********Mr. Miller -- whose door once sported a sign, attached by some secretaries, that said: ""Your Mother Doesn't Work Here"" -- was hardly surprised some weeks later when he won. ""I'm just messy by nature,"" he said. **********Mr. Miller's prize in the contest which included more than 1,000 entrants, was a floor-to-ceiling and wall-to-wall make over. On May 16, Jeffrey J. Mayer, a self-styled clutter-buster whose auto license plates read ""Mr. Neat,"" arrived to help him clean up. Mr. Miller's desk, surrounded by stacks of old papers, was laden with tipsy piles of legal documents, Mr. Mayer reported. **********As the cleaning progressed over the next four hours, Mr. Mayer discovered an old candy bar, a packet of crumbling Girl Scout cookies and a bowl of stale popcorn. Asked to describe Mr. Miller's office, Mr. Mayer replied simply: ""Aaarrrggh!"" **********A former insurance agent and clothing store owner, Mr. Mayer has earned his living for the last decade by cleaning the desks of business executives -- at $1,000 a pop.

""They hire me because they want to accomplish more in less time."" **********To preach his gospel of neatness, Mr. Mayer not only works individually with clients, but he has written several books, including ""Winning the Fight Between You and Your Desk"" (HarperBusiness, 1993), and has produced audio tapes -- a video is in the works -- that exhort the converted to keep the faith. **********Mr. Mayer does have his converts. One is Ben Nelson, a retired executive vice president of the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, who went through his first session with Mr. Mayer six years ago. ""The session forced me to make decisions about papers rather than putting them off,"" Mr. Nelson said. ""It helped me free my mind."" **********James Paglia, president of Tassani & Paglia, a $50 million marketing communications firm in Chicago, is another fan.

Jim Edgar and says he has ""made significant improvements in personal productivity because of the clean-desk principle."" **********As companies move toward the paperless office, Mr. Mayer has begun encouraging executives to supplement clean desks with efficient computer usage. He recommends using software for everything from maintaining calendars to writing checks. Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers magazine, a trade publication in Longmeadow, Mass., for the talk-radio business, has found Mr. Mayer's contributions here most useful. ""He has helped us simplify and systematize things,"" Mr. Harrison said. **********While Mr. Mayer's persistent marketing style has won him many clients, some business people say that success need not belong only to the tidy. A case in point: Platinum Technology, a $100 million software developer outside Chicago, has a grand office whose internal clutter, one executive says, makes it look like a garage. Particularly chaotic is the office of Andrew Filipowski, the chief executive. Despite the seeming chaos, however, Mr. Filipowski said his office reflected ""an underlying order."" **********""It doesn't take me more than a few seconds to find what I need,"" he said. Would it be easier to work in a neater office? Mr. Filipowski thinks not. ""For many people, the more organized they are, the more successful they are going to be,"" he said. ""But for those who can deal with a complicated universe, even a cluttered office is relatively organized."" **********Donald Eisen, who heads the New Jersey office of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate brokerage, said some of the most successful people he knows have messy desks. ""A disorganized desk could show a disorganized mind,"" he said, ""but it could also reflect a highly creative one."" **********Mr. Eisen said he kept his own desk tidy by asking his secretary to sit in front of him, like a teacher, while he deals with papers one by one. ""The system has worked for me,"" he said, ""and I don't have to pay $1,000 for it."" **********Some who had Mr. Mayer's help, meanwhile, have not really kicked their messy habits. A Chicago businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had hired Mr. Mayer to help his partner, but the neatness was short-lived. ""His office was soon filled once again with paper, cigar boxes, phone messages and half-eaten bagels,"" he said. ""I suppose some people are impossible."" **********Mr. Miller, of the ""Messiest Office"" contest, has also found it hard to keep religion. He left his law practice this summer and is now working toward opening a restaurant, but his desk, he acknowledged, again looks like it has been bombed. **********""Jeff did an excellent job getting my law office organized, but now my home office is a mess,"" he said. ""I can't find my restaurant permits. I need him again."""

It closed today at 855 pesetas, or $6.05. **********The drop in price reflected a provision of the Government bailout plan -- reduction of the stock's value. **********The closing price today lowered the share price to about twice the nominal value envisioned in the bailout plan. The nominal value in Spain includes the total of par value, retained earnings and additional capital. **********A record of 3.8 million Banesto shares were exchanged today, compared with roughly 400,000 a day just before trading was suspended. Nearly four million shares had been bought and sold off the market during the suspension. **********""Investors evidently feel confident that Banesto's future with the new rescue plan will be assured,"" said Alejandro Ruyra, an analyst at AB Asesores Bursatiles.  Possible Purchasers **********Dealers believe that investors may also be speculating that either of two big financial institutions, the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya or Banco de Santander, the nation's No. 2 and No.  4 banks, respectively, might in time acquire Banesto. **********Under the bailout plan, the Government's Deposit Guarantee Fund will hold a controlling stake in Banesto that it will auction within a year. **********There has been a growing impression ""that 400 pesetas is cheap, considering the rescue plan,"" an official at the Madrid exchange said. ""The rescue plan is positive,"" said Jose Sevilla of FG Inversiones Bursatiles. who added that anything more than 750 pesetas a share -- $5.31 -- was considered high by most analysts. **********Banesto shares have been trading off the floor of the stock exchange over the last few weeks at an average price between $4.25 and $5.31. **********Last Thursday, Alfredo Saenz Abad, the new Banesto chairman installed by the Government, provided the National Stock Market Commission with preliminary plans to rescue the bank, and he fixed its deficit at 605 billion pesetas -- a little under $4.3 billion. Spanish bankers use the deficit not as a measure of the bank's insolvency but a way to estimate the write-down of its assets and bad loans. Specialized Arithmetic **********After the plans were presented, the market commission authorized resumption of exchange trading today. **********The bailout plan calls for reducing the size of Banesto's assets and generating a total of 320 billion pesetas -- $2.27 billion -- in loan-loss provisions, shareholder equity and deferred bad-loan provisions. One result will be to reduce the par value of the stock from 700 pesetas a share -- $4.96 -- to 400 pesetas, or $2.83. **********Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund, which is half-financed by premiums from banks and the central bank, will assume a little more than $2 billion worth of bad loans and assets. **********To raise capital for Banesto, the Deposit Guarantee Fund will subscribe to a rights issue of slightly more than $1.25 billion, which it will auction within a year. Financial specialists here generally believe that Banco Bilbao Vizcaya or Santander would be likely to acquire a controlling interest in the bank. **********In New York, a spokesman for J. P. Morgan & Company, which owns a stake in an investment fund that holds about 8 percent of Banesto shares, declined to comment on the plan today. He said Morgan was awaiting all the plan's details."

W. de Klerk that he rejected South Africa's new Constitution, would not abide by the results of the country's first free elections in April, and intended to secede with all territory the British conquered from his forebears. **********There is almost no chance the King's demand will be accommodated, but it has cast an unexpected new shadow over the country's hopes for peaceful, all-inclusive elections in April. Threat of Civil War **********While some Government officials suspect a Machiavellian bargaining maneuver, those in the King's political circle insist that he is serious, and that unless he is satisfied the Zulu areas of South Africa face civil war. **********""The King has told President de Klerk that he wants the Zulu kingdom back as it was in 1838,"" said a senior official of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which is led by the King's Chief Minister, Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi. ""Everything is much more difficult than it was."" **********Talks aimed at persuading Inkatha and right-wing white parties to take part in the elections seemed almost hopelessly deadlocked tonight. **********The holdouts said that barring major, unexpected concessions from the Government and the African National Congress in the next few days, they would boycott the election. Deadline for Entry **********Parties have until Saturday to enter the elections, which will select a national Parliament and provincial legislatures. **********Mr. Buthelezi and the right-wing parties, united by their fear of a domineering central government run by the African National Congress, have demanded that powers of provincial governments be guaranteed against intervention by the central Government. **********The two major parties have offered an array of compromises, but Mr. Buthelezi and his allies said tonight that the proposals failed to protect provincial autonomy. **********Within the Government and the African National Congress, which have already begun full-scale election campaigns, the prevailing view is that the King has long been little more than a pawn of Mr. Buthelezi. **********Mr. Buthelezi controls the royal budget. The King, in turn, delivers the support of traditional Zulus for Inkatha. Effort to Court the King **********The Government has been courting the King with promises to protect his budget and symbolic status, hoping to woo the monarch away from Mr. Buthelezi and thus force the Inkatha leader to be more compromising. **********According to some Government officials, the King's abrupt demand for a real kingdom is a sign that he is still in league with Mr. Buthelezi. The demand, these officials say, is a bluff contrived to make Mr. Buthelezi's position seem more moderate. **********Three Inkatha officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said this is a drastic misreading of Zulu politics. **********According to these officials, Mr. Buthelezi had stiffened his position in the talks after being rebuked by the newly assertive King for not doing enough to defend royal interests. Princes Are Worried **********One Inkatha official said Mr. Buthelezi's influence over the King had been supplanted by that of several strongly nationalist Zulu princes who see their power and prestige endangered. **********The Inkatha officials say the rift is a resurfacing of tensions buried since an open clash between the King and Mr. Buthelezi in the 1970's. At the time the King, egged on by ambitious Zulu princes and a white Government that found Mr. Buthelezi too independent, set out to assume many of his Chief Minister's powers. Mr. Buthelezi threatened to cut off his allowance. **********Since then the King and Mr. Buthelezi have settled into a comfortable mutual dependency. **********But now, the Inkatha officials said, the King senses a chance to assert himself. **********""Is the King playing a bad cop so as to put Buthelezi in a good light?"" an Inkatha official mused. ""Possible. But there is a real tension that has always been there. From my own knowledge, I think Buthelezi was genuinely shocked by the King's position. He has never favored an absolute monarchy or secession."""

With clear signs that India is serious about continuing reforms, 1994's totals will be higher still. **********Heavily influenced by international products and life-styles beamed in by satellite television, many of India's 870 million people, half of whom are under 25, now aspire to more than thrift and self-reliance, virtues espoused by Gandhi, the country's founding father. **********The change is affecting shoppers - and voters. **********""For years, the Indian consumer was told, 'Save, don't spend. If you suffer in this life, it will be better in the next,'"" said Alyque Padamsee, who heads the South Asia operations for the Lintas advertising agency. ""But now people are saying, 'I'm not handcuffed to my karma. I want to enjoy things now, not in my next life.'"" **********Mr. Padamsee added: ""People want quality and they are ready to pay for it. They are demanding better standards in everything. It affects the entire society. They also know they can be the agents for change."" **********With broad economic reforms first introduced in June 1991 have come a greater openness to the rest of the world, and less reliance on, and tolerance for, interference from the state. **********Lalit Modi, whose large family-held company is a partner with Walt Disney Co. in India, said: ""Satellite television has brought a cultural shock to this country. We are going through a total revolution."" **********He added: ""The younger generations have become 'me' generations. Around the country, people have become more outspoken about what they want."" **********Traditionally, Indians have been among Asia's staunchest savers. Gold is often their investment of choice; an estimated 7,000 metric tons is in private hands. **********But, in a changing economic climate, Indians are favoring more sophisticated investments. Over 50 percent of car buyers now automatically take out a loan, something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. According to Visa International, the consumer finance industry has grown into a $1 billion a year business from nothing in three years. **********Citibank studies have predicted that India would become the world's second-largest credit card issuer after the United States. A few years ago, according to Mr. Modi, ""No one wanted to borrow or to owe."" **********Business executives and government officials said that Indians, comparing their lot to those of their neighbors and trading partners, were pushing for changes. **********""We have total public support for reforms in the banking system now,"" said Ravi Vira Gupta, a career civil servant trying to make India's state-owned banking sector more profitable and customer friendly. ""The public is fed up with substandard service. It wants to see things change quickly. It supports overall economic liberalization."" **********Poverty and a lack of the most basic government services characterize the lives of millions of Indians. But with increasing prosperity in the upper and middle classes, in which at least 40 million people earn more than $40,000 a year and 60 million speak fluent English, India promises to become an important consumer market for international companies. **********Advertising agencies, many now expanding foreign brands in India, have enjoyed 100 percent growth over the past three years. **********Such targeting worries domestic manufacturers and merchants emerging from decades under a system where government planners often dictated which products companies could make, where they could sell them and at what price. **********""The Indian consumer now wants the best of both worlds,"" said Krishnan K. Modi, Lalit Modi's father and head of tobacco, tea and chemical operations in the family group. ""He wants higher quality and will pay for it."

""I looked around and thought, 'What can I disinfect my equipment with?' The answer was, nothing."" **********When conducting a mammography, essentially a soft-tissue X-ray, a technologist fits the patient's breast onto a ""bucky,"" which holds the X-ray film, and then clamps a ""compression paddle"" onto the breast. **********""The discharge can get on both those surfaces,"" Ms. Sherman said. Because the bucky has an electrical component it is impossible to clean it with steam heat or to immerse it in a disinfectant, she said. Because of its size, the compression paddle is difficult to sterilize in an autoclave, a container used to steam-heat medical equipment, and chemical disinfectants would pit and ruin the special plastic from which the compression paddle and the bucky are made, she said. **********Ms. Sherman said that in 1991 she alerted two large makers of mammography equipment to the potential problem and filed complaints with the Food and Drug Administration. **********""The F.D.A. never followed through and manufacturers said, 'Unless we're forced to by the Government, we're not going to address the problem,' "" Ms. Sherman said. **********About a year later, Ms. Sherman said, she came up with a solution. ""I woke up at 3 in the morning and said to myself, 'Cover it.' "" The United States Patent Office has informed Ms. Sherman that tomorrow she will be issued a patent for her ""sanitary shield for dedicated mammography apparatus,"" and last week the F.D.A. gave her permission to begin marketing the device. **********The disposable shields, which snap into place, are made of a very thin layer of the same special plastic from which the bucky and compression paddle are made and therefore will not distort the X-ray image, Ms. Sherman said. **********The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said it knew of no documented case of hepatitis B or H.I.V. being transmitted by mammography equipment. **********""It would be theoretically possible, but no one here could really assess the risk,"" Charles P. Fallis, a spokesman for the centers, said. Mr. Fallis said the AIDS virus was ""very sensitive and can't survive very long,"" while hepatitis B could survive up to a week in a dried state. **********Either virus would have to enter a new host through an open sore or severely broken skin, said Mr. Fallis, adding that the centers did not have any disinfection recommendations specific to mammography equipment. **********""I don't want to scare women because the benefit of getting a mammogram far outweighs the risk,"" Ms. Sherman said. ""However, there should be zero risk. Women should not have to worry about who perspired or who had a discharge on the equipment before them."" **********Ms. Sherman, who hopes to license her technology through her company, Technowipe Inc. in Larchmont, N.Y., has been notified that she will receive patent 5,311,883. Infringement Case Against Nintendo **********A lawsuit charging the Nintendo Company and the Nintendo Corporation of America with infringing a patent that is to expire this month went to trial last week before Judge Kimba Wood in Federal District Court in Manhattan. **********A spokesman for the plaintiff, the bankrupt estate of the Alpex Computer Corporation, said last week that the company was seeking $300 million in damages, although John Strouch, chief litigator for Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, who represents Alpex, said he could not comment on potential damages. **********In his opening remarks, Mr. Strouch said the patent covered a ""pioneering invention which led to the modern home video-game system and an invention which is being used by Nintendo."" **********Mr. Strouch contended that since 1985 Nintendo had infringed on claims 12 and 13 of patent 4,026,555, which he said covered a home-video apparatus that is controlled by a microprocessor and connected to a television set and which stores electronic information on read-only-memory in cartridge form. **********John Kirby, of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon, in his opening statement on behalf of Nintendo, argued that ""there is a fundamental difference"" between Nintendo's system and the Alpex system and that the two Alpex inventors, Wallace Kirschner and Lawrence Haskel, ""really didn't know anything about electronic games."""

Investors had been hoping that the merger would provoke other combinations in the media business. **********For now, ""the outlook for cable stocks is bleak,"" Jessica Reif, who follows cable for Oppenheimer & Company, said. ""There is increasing competition and reregulation likely to push cash flows down."" **********As the market further squeezed the takeover premiums out of cable stocks and concerns over reregulation increased, stock prices slid. Since the end of last week, Tele-Communications' stock has fallen to $22.375 from $25.25. Comcast's stock has dropped to $19.50 from $20.375, and shares of the Cablevision Systems Corporation have declined to $62.25 from $66.375. 'The World Has Changed' **********Lisbeth Barron, who follows cable issues for S. G. Warburg, said she would not recommend cable stocks for now, in part because of the new Government rollback in cable rates announced this week that could reduce the income of companies like Tele-Communications. ""The world has changed. Cable stocks now have lower takeout value and stalled growth for a while,"" she said. **********Indeed, John C. Malone, president and chief executive of Tele-Communications, said yesterday that he would not attempt another merger with a telephone company, although he did not rule out seeking joint ventures. He contended that Tele-Communications itself might be a buyer of more cable systems. Executives from both Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications blamed the breakup of their talks on the F.C.C.'s rollback of rates by 7 percent -- an action they estimated would reduce Tele-Communications' cash flow for 1994 to about $1.85 billion from $2 billion. **********While Bell Atlantic tried to revise the price of the deal to account for that decline, Mr. Malone, who is notorious for renegotiating deals, refused to budge. That led one person close to the deal to conclude that Mr. Malone had actually made up his mind to walk out last week or earlier. **********""We still thought our company had all the values it had started with,"" Mr. Malone maintained yesterday, explaining why he was unwilling to revise the price in the face of new cable regulation. 'Degree of Impact' **********Predictably, Mr. Malone railed against the F.C.C. for its failure to understand how severe the debt situation is at most cable companies, arguing that the new regulation makes growth difficult. ""I don't think the F.C.C. understands the degree to which the industry is leveraged and the degree of impact they will have on capital spending."" **********Some of his frustration with the merger and the regulatory process was evident when asked whether he would continue to seek a merger between Home Shopping Network and QVC Network Inc., companies in which Liberty Media is the largest shareholder. Liberty, a cable programming company of which Mr. Malone is chairman, would have been included in the merger between Tele-Communications and Bell Atlantic. **********""That is a tough one,"" he said. ""When we went to Washington to get the merger done, they said there would be no problem. On the other hand, it has proven to be an elusive task. I am a little tired of elusive tasks. My Don Quixote suit is in the closet."" **********But some media investment bankers were less bearish on future marriages in the overlapping communications business. Steven Rattner, an investment banker at Lazard Freres & Company who specializes in media deals, said yesterday that ""in the immediate future, the new regulation means uncertainty,"" adding, ""that makes deals very difficult."" **********But he went on: ""The business logic behind this deal has not changed. All that has changed is some pricing elements. Once there is greater certainty, deals will resume."" **********And other traders agreed that the inherent sense in telephone companies and cable companies working together was inescapable."

Inc. **********The Brooks stores, combined with 22 Douglas Maxi drugstores in Rhode Island that Jean Coutu already owns, make the Montreal-based company the owner of one of the largest drugstore chains in New England. ""It's a marketplace we know and one that holds considerable growth opportunities down the road,"" said Francois Jean Coutu, president and chief operating officer. **********Jean Coutu also operates 249 drugstores in the eastern Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick. The drugstore chain in 1987 pegged its future growth to the New England states, Mr. Coutu said.Distribution Center **********The Brooks stores in Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island had combined sales of $425.8 million for the year ended May 28. The purchase includes inventories, furniture and fixtures, and 16 commercial buildings. A lease on a 300,000-square-foot distribution center in Dayville, Conn., will also be taken over by Jean Coutu. **********Revco will continue to operate 96 Brooks stores in New York and 31 in Pennsylvania. **********Revco, based in Twinsburg, Ohio, acquired Brooks through its July 15 acquisition of Hook-Superx, Inc., a drugstore chain that operated 1,150 stores. **********But Revco put the Brooks stores in New England, 16 Hook-Superx stores in the Chicago area and 31 in Michigan on the selling block. Revco continues to seek a buyer for the Chicago and Michigan stores. **********Those stores do not have the market share, particularly in managed care, that the company wanted, Thomas Kropf, a Revco spokesman, said. Market share is important in the sale of prescription drugs, which accounts for about one-third of a drugstore chain's profit, according to analysts. **********The expansion -- tenfold in the number of stores in New England -- positions Jean Coutu better to compete with the dominant drugstore chains in the region, the Rite Aid Corporation, which will operate 235 stores in New England after completing its purchase of 72 LaVerdiere Enterprises Inc. drugstores, and CVS, a subsidiary of the Melville Corporation, Rye, N.Y.'High Price' **********Analysts had viewed Rite Aid, Camp Hill, Pa., and CVS as the most likely buyers of the Brooks stores in New England. ""It's a surprise that a domestic company was not a buyer, and it's a surprise that stores were sold for such a high price,"" said Eric Bosshard, an analyst at the Roulston Research Corporation, Cleveland. **********The purchase price is equivalent to about $670,000 for each of the 221 stores. By comparison, he said, Revco paid $600 million, or an average price of $591,793 for each of the 1,150 stores of the Hook-Superx drugstore chain. And the Brooks stores are smaller and have lower sales volume, he said. **********Revco shares closed yesterday at $18.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading, up 62.5 cents."

Traders therefore bid up stock prices, but not by much. **********The bond market dropped a little and so did the dollar. Gold promptly jumped, possibly, some analysts said, on fears the Fed was weakening its inflation-fighting resolve. But it did not break above the important, $400-an-ounce barrier. **********Whether the Fed raises rates in November, as is widely assumed by stock traders, or some time sooner may make little practical difference on the nation's economy, economists say. **********But it is clear the uncertainty will make for a problematic October, a normally volatile month, for a stock market with few factors that could lift prices and many compelling factors to drag them down. **********Stocks budged so little yesterday that the rise was difficult to interpret. About as many stocks advanced as declined on the New York Stock Exchange. But a few stocks did jump sharply. **********Nynex rose 2, to 38, after agreeing to reduce some local-telephone rates in the Northeast over seven years in return for the removal of some regulatory limits on profits. Merck rose 1 1/8, to 36, in part because it is one of seven large drug companies that want to market nonprescription versions of their prescription drugs. **********Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.80 points, to 3,863.04, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.23 points, to 462.05.

The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yesterday marched closer to 8 percent, with the yield rising to 7.84 percent, from 7.79 percent Monday. **********""The whole premise of this long rally in the stock market,"" said Richard Meyer, director of institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann, ""is that there was really nothing that could compete with the stock market. Now, 8 percent is a big number and would have an impact on this market."" **********The Fed may raise rates, and thus bump bonds to 8 percent, at any time. A worrisome rise in August producer inflation, plus subsequent data like factory use, seemed to make a fair argument for raising short-term interest rates yesterday, analysts say. **********But if the Fed wants more ammunition before increasing rates a sixth time, several economic indicators in the next week or so -- including durable goods orders today, factory orders on Oct. 5, and September unemployment on Oct. 7 -- could supply it, analysts say. **********""If the Fed continues to act, we will see a deceleration of growth in 1995,"" predicted John P. Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers. 'Therefore, profit growth in 1995 will be quite lackluster."" **********Thus, the outlook for the three major factors that move markets -- inflation, interest rates and the level of corporate earnings -- looks downbeat. Traders are certain to factor in a November interest-rate increase into current stock prices, for example. **********And how will traders treat third-quarter profits, which will begin to be reported next week? The temptation will be for traders to penalize companies whose earnings do not exceed Wall Street analysts' expectations by a wide margin. In other words, Main Street may have a banner quarter, but Wall Street may send prices plummeting anyway. **********At any rate, a Dow of 4,000 has again eluded the market's grasp and a Dow of 3,600, the bottom of last summer's trading range, is not out of the question, analysts say. **********After coming within a percentage point of establishing records, all three leading stock indexes are backing away from their highs for the year. The Dow's high point for the year is 3,978.36 on Jan. 31. The S.& P. 500's high is 482 on Feb. 2 and the Nasdaq's peak is 803.93 on March 18."

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/11/business/apple-offering-new-system-for-macintosh-pc-s.html,John Markoff,1994-07-11,,725,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Apple Offering New System for Macintosh PC's,Apple Offering New System for Macintosh PC's," **********Stung by a growing industry perception that the Microsoft Corporation is borrowing its best ideas, Apple Computer Inc. has introduced a version of its Macintosh software intended to maintain its lead in the personal computer ease-of-use wars. **********The announcement on Friday came as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit prepared to hear Apple's appeal of a Federal District Court ruling in 1993 that Microsoft and the Hewlett-Packard Company did not unfairly copy the distinctive on-screen appearance and functions of the Macintosh computer. The appeal will be heard on Monday. **********Whatever the outcome in the appeals court, most computer industry executives and analysts believe that Apple has failed to prevent Microsoft from successfully imitating the Macintosh. In recent weeks, Microsoft has demonstrated a new version of its Windows program for personal computers that appears even more similar to the Macintosh than earlier versions of Windows. **********The new Windows, known as Chicago, is expected to ship late this year or in the first half of 1995, offering many features that Macintosh users have taken for granted for years. **********Chicago, for example, will have a 32-bit operating system, which means a PC it operates can process internal operations with 32 pieces of data at a time, as the Macintosh does. Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system and its current Windows 3.1 version are 16-bit applications. **********Chicago will also allow the use of longer file names, replacing the awkward file naming limits that have been much criticized since MS-DOS's 1981 introduction. Chicago also supports a new hardware standard, ""plug and play,"" intended to permit simple system expansion by adding equipment, another feature long available to Macintosh users. **********""This is the end of the era when the Macintosh is the computer industry's gold standard,"" said Jesse Berst, editorial director of Windows Watcher, an industry newsletter published in Redmond, Wash. **********Microsoft officials readily acknowledge that they have taken features from the Macintosh, adding that they have tried to add innovations beyond those Apple has developed. **********""We are trying to learn from the industry experience,"" said Rogers Weed, a product manager at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash. **********Indeed, a comparison of the new Windows and the new Macintosh system reveals striking similarities. In the past, Microsoft programs have needed two separate utilities to manage files and programs. Now Chicago has a single on-screen ""desktop"" like the Macintosh. **********In Chicago, the screen icon that represents a disk drive is in the upper left corner, while the menu bar that gives status and control information runs along the bottom of the screen. The Macintosh places the disk icon in the upper right corner and runs the menu bar across the top of the screen. Macintosh's Latest Innovations **********Apple officials are clearly concerned that the Macintosh will be hurt by the perception that the gap with Microsoft is narrowing. The company held two briefings earlier this year in an effort to show that Apple has a strategy that will continue to offer a better alternative to the personal computer mainstream. **********At the demonstration on Friday of Macintosh System 7.5 at Apple's corporate research and development center in Cupertino, Calif., Apple officials said that in the future their computers would be less expensive than those of their rivals. Neither the Macintosh System 7.5 program nor Microsoft's Chicago software has yet been priced. **********The new Macintosh program will include a graphics system called Quickdraw GX that is intended to increase the power and flexibility of display of graphical images, including onscreen display fonts. **********Apple has also added software, called Active Assistance, that encourages automatic control of basic operating-system functions. When a user, for example, looks for an explanation of how to operate a particular function, the program demonstrates examples, circling areas of the screen much like John Madden diagramming a football play. **********Despite the growing sense that Windows and Macintosh are drawing closer, a number of industry analysts say it will still take several years for the rest of the PC world to catch up with the Macintosh. ""We shouldn't underestimate how big a jump will be required to go from Windows to Chicago from the customer's point of view,"" said Roger McNamee, a general partner of Integral Capital Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif."

A Mix of Traditions **********All the panoply of Western religious liturgy mixed with traditional African customs were on display here, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's birthplace: the stirring music of Handel and Gounod; the undulating music and dance of ancient African rituals; a huge chorus dressed in bright batik dress singing ""laagoh budji gnia,"" the Baoule-language words for ""Lord, it is you who has made all things""; a military honor guard dressed in bright red coats and brandishing glittering swords, and hundreds of village elders, resplendent in huge multi-colored strips of kente and korhogo cloth. **********It was a day carefully designed both as a tribute to the late President and as a showcase for a country on the underside of West Africa's peninsular bulge, but rooted spiritually somewhere between the brutal competitiveness of Western commerce and the brilliantly complex and often mystical culture of ancient Africa. **********Indeed, the Ivory Coast has long regarded itself as an oasis of relative affluence and tranquillity amid the excesses of war, famine, religious and ethnic hatreds and other seemingly intractable problems that have afflicted much of post-independence Africa. **********Mr. Houphouet-Boigny (pronounced oof-WET bwahn-YEE) died on Dec. 7, at the official age of 88, but he was widely believed to be much older. The two-month delay before his burial, which is not uncommon among his ethnic group, the Baoule, allowed time for many ceremonies leading up to today's funeral. **********Like the Egyptian pharaohs, Baoule chiefs are traditionally buried with tools, mementos -- and it is widely rumored, even friends and relatives -- they treasured in life. Mr. Houphouet-Boigny is no exception, but his large extended family, with their penchant for secrecy, has declined to say what, if anything, they will bury with the president. Indeed, it is considered very rude to even pose questions about the custom. Ruled for Over 30 Years **********Mr. Houphouet-Boigny had ruled the Ivory Coast since it gained independence from France in 1960, and at the time of his death he was Africa's longest-serving leader and the third-longest-serving in the world after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea. Still, although Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's funeral attracted representatives of more than 140 countries and international organizations, many Ivorians were privately bewildered and angered because several countries that were considered close allies failed to send what were considered sufficiently high-ranking representatives. **********Ivorians were especially disappointed with the United States, which sent a 15-member delegation that seemed to many a telling illustration of the Clinton Administration's inattention, if not outright indifference, toward Africa. The delegation was led by the Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary and George Moose, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. **********American officials acknowledged that Mrs. O'Leary, who holds Cabinet rank, has little, if any experience in dealing with current African issues. Issue of U.S. Delegation **********Earlier, Daniele Boni Clavarie, the Ivorian Minister of Communication, told reporters that she was disappointed with the size and composition of the United States delegation. ""If we had been sent a vice president, we would have been happier,"" she said. **********By contrast, France, the former colonial ruler of the Ivory Coast, sent a formidable delegation, including President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, six former Prime Ministers and more than 70 other dignitaries. Mr. Houphouet-Boigny had nurtured close personal ties with several generations of French leaders. **********But Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's death is not only the end of a political era here, but perhaps as well the end of the close French-African relationship that he came to symbolize. **********France maintained closer ties, particularly regarding monetary and military matters, with its former colonies in Africa than did many other former imperial powers. **********Many Ivorians were stunned that just a month after the death of their leader in December, France supported the 50 percent devaluation of the C.F.A. franc, the French-backed currency that is used in 14 French-speaking countries, and Equatorial Guinea.  Mr. Houphouet-Boigny had strongly opposed a realignment of the C.F.A. franc, and devaluation has been widely seen as a betrayal by France and a worrying sign of things to come. A Somber Moment **********For the vast throngs outside the basilica, it was, as many of them said, among the most deeply spiritual events in their lives. Tens of thousands had slept in nearby bus stops, soccer fields and schoolyards overnight to be sure of good vantage points. They were in a uniformly somber mood, some singing or praying quietly to themselves, others waving small flags or handkerchiefs with the late President's portrait. **********""He was a great, great man, and I don't see how this country will ever replace him,"" said Coulibaly Ahoussou, a 42-year-old businessman. Nearby, Jean Adouko, a Government clerical worker, mopped his brow with his handkerchief. ""Our father is gone,"" he said. ""May he rest peacefully. Nothing here will ever be the same."" No Serious Incidents **********Several dozen women who wanted to fall on the ground and bury their heads in straw baskets according to traditional mourning customs were persuaded to carry out the ritual elsewhere. **********No serious incidents of any kind were reported. **********Mr. Houphouet-Boigny, who often described himself as a devout Catholic, was tolerant of traditional African religious beliefs, known as animism, which range from a faith in spirits to forms of ancestor worship. In a nation of about 14 million people, only about 15 percent are Catholic, while 40 percent are Muslim, 5 percent Protestant, and the rest animist. **********Still, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's decision to build the basilica, especially with the country in deep recession, was at the time widely derided as a scandalous extravagance. For one thing, its proportions seemed grossly ill-suited for a country of 14 million people: the dome of Our Lady of Peace is twice the size of the dome of St. Peter's basilica in Rome.  An Enormous Edifice **********The church contains 30 acres of marble and four times the amount of stained glass in the French cathedral in Chartres. It is also the world's largest air-conditioned space, and the 7.4-acre esplanade is designed to hold 300,000 people. Nobody but the President seemed to know how much it cost, but estimates by outsiders run into hundreds of millions of dollars, a significant proportion of the country's foreign debt of about $12 billion. **********Mr. Houphouet-Boigny also officially moved the national capital here in 1983, but administrative operations remained in Abidjan. **********Mr. Houphouet-Boigny maintained that the basilica was built on his own land and financed with his own money. But many critics here and abroad questioned that assertion. Today, however, the voices of the President's critics were mostly mute. **********""Nobody can deny that he built one of the most beautiful buildings in the world,"" said Serge Behi, a student at a nearby technical college. ""A hundred, maybe a thousand years from now, people will still be awed by it."" **********After the requiem mass at the basilica this afternoon, Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's body was sent a short distance to his estate where, in a private family ceremony, the man who presided during Africa's most tumultuous era will finally be laid to rest."

Consider this grouping: a First Lady, an Idaho billionaire, two Heisman Trophy winners and a former beauty queen, all connected to a small Texas oil and gas company founded by a former professional football player. **********The company is the Box Energy Corporation, founded by Cloyce K. Box, who played for the Detroit Lions. Because of a decision in December in a lawsuit filed six years ago by dissident shareholders led by J. R. Simplot, the Idaho billionaire, and Mr. Box's unexpected death in October at age 70, some analysts speculate that the company may be ripe for a takeover. In fact, in the final 75 minutes of trading Friday, Box Energy's thinly traded -- and super-voting -- class A shares jumped $5.50 each, to a new high of $26, almost three times the year's low of $9. **********""It's a very complicated situation,"" said George J. Gaspar, a petroleum analyst at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""I don't think there is another company like it right now."" **********The drama pits Mr. Simplot, who made much of his money selling potatoes to McDonald's, against the Box Energy board, which during the last six years has included Phyllis George, a former Miss America who later was a sportscaster for CBS, and E. Doak Walker and Roger Staubach, both Heisman winners. **********(Hillary Rodham Clinton, the most passive of the high-profile actors in the Box drama, could profit from settlement of Mr. Simplot's lawsuit. As of October, she owned $15,000 worth of the stock.) **********The lawsuit began with Mr. Simplot, who took Mr. Box to court for what he saw as self-dealing. After purchasing units of OKC Limited Partnership, the predecessor of Box Energy, in 1987, Mr. Simplot learned that OKC had sold an oil pipeline in 1985 to CKB Petroleum Inc., also controlled by Mr. Box. **********The suit, which was joined by a handful of other shareholders, contended that Mr. Box had breached his fiduciary responsibility and defrauded investors. **********(Mr. Simplot himself is no stranger to controversy. In 1976 he was involved in the biggest default in the history of commodities futures trading in the United States, and was banned from commodities trading for six years. Then again, Mr. Box had an earlier scrape as well. In 1980 he pleaded guilty to violating energy pricing laws, and OKC paid $4.8 million in fines.) **********Box Energy has had operating losses in recent quarters, but it still has plenty of valuable assets. One is a 20-year contract with the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation. Initially negotiated in 1982, when the outlook for oil and natural gas prices was bullish, the contract guaranteed Box gas prices in 1993 of $7.62 per thousand cubic feet, with increases of 10 percent each year after that. ""The price in 1994 will be $8.36, which is four times the spot price for natural gas,"" Mr. Gaspar said. **********Just days before the judge issued his decision in late December, the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service ruled that Box Energy could drastically increase natural gas production under that contract. The company is developing three sites in the Gulf of Mexico that may contain more than 250 million barrels of oil and gas equivalents. Box owns 27 percent of the project in partnership with Marathon Oil, Amerada Hess and Louisiana Land and Exploration. **********""The Minerals Management decision involves hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue,"" Mr. Gaspar said. **********The shareholders' lawsuit, however, makes Box's future uncertain. The dissidents were outraged in 1991, when Mr. Box formed Box Energy and established two classes of stock, relegating most OKC holders to nonvoting status in the new company. Both classes are publicly traded, but only the class A shares have voting rights. At his death, Mr. Box controlled 57 percent of the shares. Mr. Simplot has argued that all Box shareholders should have voting rights. **********After dragging on for years, the lawsuit went to trial in October 1992. The jury heard evidence for a month, and agreed with the dissident shareholders. It awarded Box Energy $28.2 million in damages on their behalf. **********But worried that Federal Judge Robert B. Maloney might not uphold the verdict, the plaintiffs agreed to hold settlement talks with Box Energy. After discussions broke down, Mr. Box and a special committee of Box Energy's board presented a settlement to the court: Mr. Box would transfer to the company 250,000 shares of his personal nonvoting class B stock, which at the time had a market value of about $2.8 million. Box Energy was also to be given an option to buy his stock in CKB Petroleum, the company whose purchase of the pipeline touched off the legal battle. **********Because Mr. Box had longtime relationships with most board members and controlled the voting stock, the plaintiffs argued the board could not arrive at an independent decision. Judge Maloney agreed, finally rejecting the settlement on Dec. 20 and entering the jury's judgment in the books. **********Liability for the claim now falls on Mr. Box's estate, transferring the headache to Thomas D. Box, who became chief executive shortly after his father's death. **********Analysts say Mr. Box has few options. He can present a more attractive settlement. He can appeal, but not without posting a bond equal to the amount of the jury award. Or the estate can surrender control of Box Energy by selling its class A shares. **********Meanwhile, investors seem to be betting on the last option. ""I don't believe there will be a change of control,"" said Mark Kellstrom, an oil and gas analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ""But there are a number of investors who are playing this stock as a takeover play, thinking that Tom Box and his family won't be able to come up with the estate taxes and jury award and that Marathon Oil or Amerada Hess or someone else will buy the company."""

And network experts are worried about the future of this community, whose rapid growth seems to be undermining its tradition of rational self-government and the democratic exchange of ideas. **********A certain frontier freedom has always been part of the allure of computer networks, particularly Usenet, a loose affiliation of thousands of computers and electronic bulletin boards that link some 10 million people around the world. **********But lately, the freedom has seemed more like anarchy. Turks and Armenians have brought their decades-old hatreds onto the digital stage, accusing one another of using electronic mail forgeries and software that seeks and destroys an enemy's messages to the broader community. **********Elsewhere on Usenet, computer programmers are preparing electronic mail ""bombs"" that will be used to knock out the computers of two lawyers intent on flooding the network with unsolicited advertisements. The lawyers received death threats from Usenet users, some of whom have also tried to sabotage their telephone and fax machines. **********The decline of net civilization appears not to be confined to Usenet. On other computer networks, hucksters use phony identities to shill for stocks. Pedophiles are caught trolling local bulletin board systems and national on-line services for young boys. Pornographic pictures are traded in great volume. Virtually every network, large and small, has crackpots and sociopaths who seek to bully others with obscenities and threats. **********Such activities have significance beyond the computer screens because Usenet, the largest subset of the global computer web known as the Internet, has for years been a nearly perfect laboratory for testing the democratic principles of free speech and self-governance. **********""It's the first medium we have seen in which these principles have been allowed to play out unhindered,"" said David Sobel, a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest lobbying group in Washington. ""It really is a free and open marketplace of ideas."" **********The Usenet is perhaps the closest thing the world has ever had to an electronic ""global village."" But longtime citizens of cyberspace, who for more than a decade had the networks to themselves, are gloomy about the prospects of millions of new settlers unsteeped in Usenet tradition. The influx of newcomers is a result of growing public awareness of computer networks, and the mounting popularity of services like Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online, which offer consumers access to the Usenet and Internet. **********""I'm beginning to think this sort of Usenet abuse is going to continue growing exponentially as the medium itself grows,"" Neil K. Guy of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, wrote in an electronic posting to his network colleagues. ""The abuse will continue to grow, various mechanisms to control it will be installed to prevent a collapse of the system, and the openness and freedom of ideas exchanged upon which Usenet was based will become something rather different."" **********The event that seems most likely to touch off open war is the conflict between self-appointed ""protectors"" of the electronic frontier and the two Arizona lawyers, who created a stir last month by posting advertisements throughout the Usenet, soliciting as clients immigrants who wanted legal help in seeking ""green card"" work permits. Last week the lawyers, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, announced that they had formed a company called Cybersell, which will insert ads for itself and clients in every public space in Usenet, regardless of whether the users want to see them. **********Not only have Ms. Siegel and Mr. Canter drawn countless scornful messages -- called ""flames"" on the network -- but they have also been the targets of electronic harassment that has included listing their home address and advocating arson, threats to post their credit report and credit card numbers and numerous suggestions on how to make their lives miserable, such as by forging messages in their names calling for the assassination of President Clinton. Anger to Be Expected **********""I do not condone these things,"" said Jurgen Botz, a computer consultant in Northampton, Mass. ""But disproportionate response or not, they knowingly incited the wrath of the Net community by flagrantly abusing a communal resource shared on a cooperative basis by millions of people all over the world, and did this in such a fashion that the users of that resource felt its existence to be threatened. When you do something like that, a lynch-mob style reaction is to be expected."" **********It was only a matter of time, other experts agree. **********""Their broadcast advertisement is quite precisely what the subculture of net protectors has been worrying would happen,"" said Phil Agre, assistant professor of communication at the University of California at San Diego. ""If such events become routine -- and there's very little technical or legal reason why they won't -- then the whole net will basically collapse through flame-wars, the closing of E-mail discussion groups to outsiders and whatever."" **********The ""whatever"" that network citizens fear most is the possibility that the authorities might try to regulate the network because of the abuses of a small number of extremists, like the Arizona lawyers and the virtual vigilantes who seek to tar, feather and run them out of cyberspace. No Federal Mice Stirring **********Although law enforcement agencies have the right, of course, to control crimes committed within their jurisdictions and the ability to monitor computer bulletin boards for evidence of criminal activity, the Federal Government has a longstanding policy of not attempting to regulate Usenet communications. **********Indeed, Usenet, and the larger Internet web of networks to which it connects, are global communities, not American ones. By the end of this year more than half the networks that make up the Internet will be outside the United States. Thus, the Usenet war is being fought beyond the walls of American law and First Amendment protections. **********The rules of engagement will be on the agenda next month in Prague at the meeting of the international board of directors of the Internet Society, the closest thing to a United Nations in the electronic world community. The group has no enforcement authority, but it can issue guidelines for appropriate network behavior -- and perhaps urge the companies providing access to the Internet to spell out contractual rules governing subscribers' activities. Such rules would enable the service providers to cancel subscribers' accounts if they stray beyond too far. **********In recent months it has become difficult for even network libertarians to argue that the network community can resolve its problems through peer pressure alone.  Trolling by Pedophiles **********Such abuses of the networks are not new. Two years ago the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a man in Sherman Oaks, Calif., who was terrorizing women he met on the networks. More recently, the police in Cupertino, Calif., arrested an engineer who was using the networks to recruit young boys for sex. A similar case has been in the news in Boston. **********Compared with these outrages, the act that some say is most likely to transform the network was relatively tame: the legal posting of an advertisement for the Canter & Siegel law firm in some 6,000 of the 9,000 ""news groups"" that make up Usenet. **********A news group is an electronic bulletin board where people share information on a topic. One news group might be devoted to a type of computer programming, another to a discussion of health care, to medieval history, cats, parenting and so on. **********Most news groups have rules that discourage the posting of items not directly related to their topics. So, the net community was enraged by the indiscriminate and voluminous way in which the lawyers posted their ad. Random Posting, or Spamming **********Among network veterans, such random posting is called ""spamming"" -- a term derived from a brand of pink, canned meat that splatters messily when hurled. **********If the spamming tactic used by the husband-and-wife law firm of Canter & Siegel becomes widespread, ""it will destroy the network,"" said Tony Rutkowski, a lawyer and engineer who is executive director of the Internet Society. ""The Internet allows massive replication and transmission of information, and if everyone engaged in that kind of conduct, it would bring it down to its collective knees."" **********The ads cost Canter & Siegel almost nothing to post, as the recipients bore the cost through network fees for connection time and data storage. **********""It took me longer than an hour to clean up their mess,"" wrote Peter Wayner of Baltimore, adjunct professor of computer science at Georgetown University. ""I rely upon Internet news for many professional tips and bits. They didn't just take away one hour of my leisure time -- they cut me off from my source of news about my work.""  A Journey to the Real World **********The larger question is what happens when spamming by advertisers becomes common, when unsavory business practices flourish outside of official regulation, and when the anger from network actions spills over into the real world. **********""Certainly there will never be any consensus to establish a regulatory body for Usenet,"" Mr. Botz, the computer consultant, wrote in an E-mail message to a reporter. ""And no, the existing defenses are clearly not adequate. So what will happen? The Net as we know it will die."" **********Others say a good defense is the best offense. **********""What people will probably do is invent 'site kill files,' "" wrote David Hayes, a Usenet regular who works for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in an electronic interview. Such files would allow a Usenet administrator or user to block any messages coming from a certain computer or certain parts of the network. **********""My fear is that this will be a cyber-revisiting of the blacklisting that was prevalent in the 50's,"" Mr. Hayes wrote. ""Eventually, I predict that such site kill files will be used to censor politically unpopular views (like mine, for example)."""

When she was named American Ambassador to Paris, though, the French were quite nervous. **********The stories that preceded her arrival here last May focused less on her role as a Washington powerbroker and Friend of Bill than on the rich and powerful men who had shaped her extraordinary life. Even in the large American colony here, eyebrows were raised. **********Was it not odd for the United States to be represented by a 73-year-old British-born aristocrat who was married briefly to Winston Churchill's son, Randolph? She later married and was widowed by Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer, and by Averell Harriman, the former diplomat and Governor of New York? **********Granted, the plum Paris post has often gone to campaign contributors, but was a woman known for presiding over glittering political evenings in her Georgetown home really equipped to run a huge embassy, negotiate complex economic topics and handle the oft-prickly French ? 'I Love Challenges' **********Indeed, in barely seven months, Mrs. Harriman has convinced the ever-squabbling French and Americans that she is after all the right woman for the job. **********""If I'd had time to think about it in depth, I'd have probably been too scared to take the post,"" she said in an interview in her large paneled office beside the Place de la Concorde. ""Obviously, this is the biggest challenge I've ever had."" She added, ""I love challenges."" **********The role of Ambassador to France is not easy to define. It involves presiding over a 1,100-member embassy staff that includes representatives of 20 different Government agencies. At the same time, relations between Washington and Paris are so complex that important issues are often handled directly by the two Governments. **********Almost from the moment she arrived here, though, Mrs. Harriman was drawn into the growing battle between the United States and France over the GATT global trade talks. At loggerheads over farm and audiovisual trade, the two sides had reached rare levels of irritation with each other. **********""I was a sort of messenger going back and forth,"" she said of the final tense weeks of bargaining, ""explaining to Washington why the French think and argue the way they do and also in the other direction, telling the French why our farmers are just as important to us as theirs are to them."" **********The French were soon persuaded to take her seriously. ""She was very helpful,"" one Foreign Ministry official said after the trade package was tied up last month. ""We presume she sent the right messages with the right analysis. We all know she has a direct line to the White House and this is very important. She has weight."" **********For Mrs. Harriman, her Washington contacts are also a key asset, not only because she can telephone President Clinton when necessary (although she refused to say how often she does so), but also because she can promote closer ties between French and American politicians. ""One of the things I've been trying to do is to explain to the French the power of Congress,"" she said. **********On diplomatic matters, she confers regularly with Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser, and Peter Tarnoff, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. But she also keeps in touch with friends in Congress, even joining the Clinton Administration's lobbying effort last year before key votes on the budget and the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********The talents she developed in Washington running her own political action committee -- ""putting people together, maintaining dialogue, keeping channels open,"" as one embassy staffer put it -- have proved useful here, with dinner invitations to her residence now prized by French decision-makers and American residents alike. **********""We love glamorous people,"" one French Government official said with a laugh. ""And her past, well, for us that's a sign of vitality."" **********Then there is her art collection, with every visitor eager to see Van Gogh's ""White Roses"" as well as works by Picasso, Matisse, Cezanne and others. **********""But what I find most useful is that I can speak their language,"" Mrs. Harriman said of her meetings with the French. **********Nor does it do her any harm that she can tell wartime stories about meeting General de Gaulle during his wartime visits to Downing Street where she was living with her in-laws, the Churchills. ""You should see the faces of young Gaullists when she says, 'When I had dinner with General de Gaulle, he said. . . ',"" one embassy official noted. High Marks From Americans **********What appears to have become a non-issue is that she is the first woman to head the United States Embassy here, which also has women in its second and third top posts. ""I think in fact the Europeans are more polite to women than perhaps we are at home,"" she said. **********More important, perhaps, is that the Americans living here have given her high marks. ""I was thrilled to see a qualified woman on top,"" said Phyllis Morgan, who heads a group of Republicans who live in France. ""And I'm happy to say I find her serious. She is very intelligent and full of energy, and she has gained the reputation of being a very solid Ambassador."" **********So, Mrs. Harriman was asked, has she somehow reinvented herself again? ""I think I'm so used to it,"" she said in an American accent that does not disguise its British origins. ""I've had lots of stages in my life. You try and adapt to every one that comes down the pike. Now I'm trying to do what I'm doing to the best of my ability. So I concentrate on today and tomorrow."" **********In her case, though, that still means doing two jobs. She is now preparing for President Clinton's first official visit to France in June to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy. **********But she is also determined not to be forgotten in Washington. ""The habits of 20 years don't change, you know,"" she said. ""Anyway, I'm going back in a few years."""

More than 1 million Rwandan refugees have been living in squalor in Zaire and Tanzania. He is expected to report to the Security Council on Friday. **********One option would be a recommendation discussed in Geneva for the deployment of 4,800 additional troops for as long as a year to protect refugees, supervise the distribution of food in the camps and help the refugees to return home. There are now 5,500 United Nations troops in Rwanda. **********But it is unclear how such a suggestion would be received because some countries that contributed troops to Rwandan peacekeeping operations in the past have indicated that they would not continue to do so. **********In the face of a possible renewal of fighting, United Nations officials may argue that troops were needed to head off the sort of chaos and genocide that took place earlier this year. After intertribal massacres in Rwanda last spring, United Nations officials were severely criticized for moving too slowly to muster forces. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali and his advisers also considered the announcement by the Rwandan Government that it intended to try 30,000 for atrocities inside the country and for crimes outside Rwanda, like the looting of Government funds. Rwanda's delegate, Manzi Bakuramutsa, said these trials would be in addition to those held by the international tribunal approved on Tuesday by the Security Council."

Florsheim makes men's dress and casual shoes. Combined, sales of the two units rose 12 percent, to $576.1 million, for the nine months that ended on Sept 30. **********After the Converse and Florsheim spinoffs, Interco will be the largest publicly traded furniture manufacturer. **********Interco, of which 60 percent is owned by Leon Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond trader, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1992.

But in the first day of Nasdaq trading Tuesday, the stock fell to $7.66, and yesterday it fell again to $7.56. **********For the depositors who bought shares, their losses so far are about $5 million. The savings bank has eight branches, most of them in Harlem and in other heavily black areas, among them Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Jamaica in Queens. **********It is not clear why the offering foundered so badly so quickly. In Tuesday trading, Nasdaq reported volume of 509,900 shares, or more than 20 percent of the shares sold in the initial offering. Volume yesterday was only 60,100 shares. **********""There were a lot of orders from people who bought at $10 to sell for less,"" said L. N. Sampath, a salesman for Capitol Resources of Washington, which managed the offering. ""When that happens, the price can't hold."" **********But Mr. Sampath did not offer a guess as to why so many sold, taking immediate losses on their investments. The shares never traded above $8.25, so even those who got out quickly took sizable losses. **********Officials of the bank, named for the black American chemist George Washington Carver, did not return phone calls yesterday. **********In its offering memorandum, Carver said it was seeking to strengthen its management and was looking for a new chief operating officer. If one is found, it said, its current chief executive, Richard T. Greene, might not stay on in that capacity after the end of the year. **********Carver converted from mutual status, in which a financial institution is owned by its depositors, to stock status, in which shares are purchased by depositors and outside investors. In some cases, such conversions have produced windfall profits for depositors who got in at the offering. In this case, it has been windfall losses. **********Carver officials had worked hard, manning phone banks and placing newspaper ads, to get depositors to vote in favor of the conversion and to buy shares. The offering was for 1.5 million to 2.3 million shares, and the bank ended up selling the maximum. **********Carver, with $253 million of deposits on June 30, has been only a minor force in lending in New York, with total loans of $51 million. Over the years, it has made very few mortgage loans but has recently tried to increase lending. In the year that ended on March 31, it originated $3.8 million in mortgages on one- to four-family homes, up from $1 million the previous year. **********Investors may have also been cautious because much of Carver's profit in recent years has come from mortgage-backed securities, which rose in price as interest rates fell. But the value of those securities has fallen since rates began rising, and the loss in value in the most recently reported quarter, which ended on June 30, was significantly larger than the bank's operating income."

He said opening the door to trade would benefit that still-unfinished search. **********At a White House ceremony this afternoon, Mr. Clinton said he was lifting the trade embargo ""because I am absolutely convinced it offers us the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and about whom we are not sure.""  [ Excerpts, page A8. ] Allowing Liaison Offices **********The step taken by Mr. Clinton stops short of restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam. But it will allow the United States and Vietnam each to open a liaison office in the other's capital, the highest level of ties between them since the long and painful war that left more than 58,000 Americans dead before the United States withdrew from the conflict in 1973. **********The United States informed Vietnam of the decision this afternoon, and the White House said trade between the two countries would resume as soon as the Commerce Department could draft the necessary regulations, probably within the next several weeks. **********The idea of reaching out to Vietnam had been vigorously opposed by the American Legion and others among the nation's leading veterans' groups, making the decision a sensitive one for Mr. Clinton. He had to overcome criticism from them during his presidential campaign for having avoided the military draft during the Vietnam War. Bid to Avoid Political Attacks **********In an effort to avoid a new round of damaging attacks, Mr. Clinton announced his decision this afternoon only after meeting privately with representatives of veterans' organizations. The White House also released a sheaf of endorsements from distinguished Vietnam-era commanders, including Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the former commander of United States forces in Vietnam, and Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, the Navy's top officer in the final years of the war. **********But Mr. Clinton appeared determined to show no great pleasure in his decision, which he announced by reading a passionless statement in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. **********To Mr. Clinton's immediate right was Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Others positioned next to the President were Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who served in Vietnam as a civilian assistant to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, who volunteered for service in Vietnam as a young diplomat. In the audience were Democratic Senators John F. Kerry of Massachussetts, a veteran who had called for an end to the embargo, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who lost a leg and won the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Vietnam. **********While Mr. Clinton has spoken repeatedly of the importance that expanded trade holds for the United States economy, he insisted today that the potential for American economic gains played no part in his decision. But it was greeted with delight and relief by American businessmen who had complained that an anachronistic policy was denying them a share of the Vietnamese market that advocates say could be worth up to $6 billion a year in trade involving American companies. **********The plan to lift the embargo had been unanimously recommended several weeks ago by Mr. Clinton's top Cabinet officers and by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But aides said the President calculated that his position would be strongest if he waited for the endorsement that the Senate provided in a vote last week before making his decision public. 'Get It Over With' **********As late as this morning, White House officials had said that Mr. Clinton had not made up his mind about the embargo and that he would not announce his decision before Saturday. But Administration officials had long since made clear that his commitment was irrevocable, and aides said he had wanted to ""get it over with"" once he finally initialed his approval. **********Officials said Mr. Clinton had not made his decision until he reviewed a final packet of information about the search for American prisoners of war and those missing in action, but they would not be more specific. **********In explaining their decision to go ahead now, Mr. Clinton and his top deputies praised Vietnam today for having been more cooperative last year than in any year since the end of the war in the effort to resolve the mystery about those who are still listed as missing. Some Remains Returned **********Since July alone, Vietnam has returned to the United States the remains of 39 individuals believed to have been American personnel, bringing to 67 the number of sets of remains handed over in 1993. Only three of those sets have so far been conclusively identified as the remains of United States servicemen.  Vietnam has also provided new help in investigating claims of live sightings of missing Americans, and in sharing wartime documents. **********Mr. Clinton, who eased some sanctions against Vietnam on two occasions last year but refused to lift the embargo, said today that the progress met the conditions he had set for a restoration of trade. Without fully explaining his reasoning, he said he had also concluded that an end to the embargo represented ""the best way to continue getting information"" about those Americans who are still missing. **********But that argument has found little resonance among the nation's largest veterans' groups, including the American Legion, whose national commander warned Mr. Clinton in advance of the decision that it would be regarded as ""a betrayal"" of veterans, the missing and their families. Meeting With Veterans **********In a sign of how important the White House regarded their reaction, the veterans' representatives invited on short notice to the White House this afternoon were briefed not just by Mr. Clinton, but also by Mr. Christopher, Mr. Lake, General Shalikashvili and Mr.  Aspin. Both sides described the discussion as cordial, but the veterans said later that it had done nothing to change their minds. **********Larry Rivers, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he and others had told Mr. Clinton that they intended ""to keep him at his word to keep Vietnam accountable."" Ann Mills Griffiths, who heads the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, chose not to attend the meeting and said she believed Mr. Clinton had ""clearly broken his promise"" to maintain pressure on Hanoi. **********But relations between the White House and veterans remain so delicate that even John Wheeler, who led fundraising efforts for the Vietnam Memorial and helped Mr. Clinton during his presidential campaign to deflect criticism from Vietnam veterans, combined his statement of support with one chiding the President for ""an embargo on vets"" within the Administration. White House officials said they could not dispute Mr. Wheeler's assertion that only 8 percent of the men among Mr. Clinton's senior appointees are military veterans. **********With the directive he issued today to the Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, Mr. Clinton set aside the embargo the United States imposed against North Vietnam in 1964 and extended to cover all of Vietnam after the fall of the South Vietnamese Government on April 30, 1975. Other Restrictions Remain **********Administration officials emphasized tonight that the lifting of the embargo would not spell an end to other restrictions imposed by Congress against Vietnam, which will continue to prohibit sales of weapons and some high-technology goods. In an odd twist, they also said the Trading with the Enemy Act would be left in place, although only to insure that Vietnamese assets frozen by the United States remain in American control until the two countries can agree on their disposition. **********The officials also strongly rejected characterizations that the step represented a reward for Vietnamese cooperation, and spoke with some lingering bitterness at a briefing today of the years in which Vietnam had confounded rather than helped the American search for the missing. **********Mr. Clinton, who took extraordinary steps to avoid military service in Vietnam, was in the odd position today as Commander in Chief of marking an end of sorts to a war in which he, unlike many of his contemporaries, did not take part. But he insisted today that his decision had not been complicated by that fact. **********""Everybody my age, whether they were in Vietnam or not, knew someone who died there, knew someone who was wounded there,"" the 47-year-old President said. ""And I think people in our generation are perhaps more insistent on trying to get a full accounting, more obsessed with it, than perhaps people who are younger and people who are older, except those who had children."""

Now, lawyers say, because of continued publicity about problems with derivatives, their phones are still ringing, as investors seek to join the ""classes"" of investors who contend harm was done to them in risky securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations. **********Paine Webber said last week that it would spend an additional $180 million to bail out a mutual fund that was devastated by holdings in exotic mortgage securities known as ""kitchen sink"" bonds. The news, in the wake of an earlier announcement by Paine Webber that it would reimburse customers for some losses in the same fund, is leading more investors to consider suing, lawyers say. Companies Unsure of Liabilities **********With investors continuing to discover that they may have a case against a company or a financial institution, companies are left without a handle on their ultimate liabilities. A rise in interest rates earlier this year made a lot of the complicated investments go sour. **********""I think you're going to see a lot more suits,"" said Steve Berman, a lawyer at the Seattle firm of Hagens & Berman. **********In New York, Mel Weiss of Milberg, Weiss said: ""Lots of people have been contacting my firm -- and I'm sure others -- claiming that the mutual funds they invested in were not supposed to be taking the kinds of risks we now know they were taking."" **********The rush to sue goes beyond mutual fund companies that marketed ""safe"" short-term funds without emphasizing that those funds owned volatile securities, although several such big cases exist. Paine Webber Group Inc., Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund, and Piper Jaffray have all been the targets of class-action suits related to poor performance earlier this year by mutual funds that held derivative and ""exotic"" securities. Brokerage Managers Named **********In addition, investors have cited managements of brokerage firms that sold them risky mortgage securities typically reserved for sophisticated institutional investors, and publicly held companies that have lost money in derivatives. The General Electric Company's Kidder, Peabody unit was hit with a class-action suit in late May, as a result of the scandal in which a top trader was said to have executed billions in phony government bond trades. **********And Salomon Brothers, the brokerage unit of Salomon Inc., has already received arbitration complaints from 10 investors who say they should not have been sold highly risky collateralized mortgage obligations in which they lost millions of dollars this spring -- and potentially millions more because Salomon told them they must ante up ""margin calls"" of three times the amount of their initial multimillion dollar investments. **********David Guin, a lawyer at Ritchie & Rediken in Birmingham, Ala., said he had heard from several individual investors and small banks in recent weeks. They were sold collateralized mortgage obligations and now claim not to have understood the risks. The individuals who have called him ""are not the kind of people who read the business pages every day,"" he said. **********Lawyers say that the companies most vulnerable are those that were less than forthcoming in disclosing their risky securities in the documents they filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********""To tell about derivatives on page 33 of a mutual fund prospectus is not enough,"" said Sam Schwartz of Bezar & Martin. ""Generally investors don't read the prospectus in great detail. Page 1 is generally enough, and they're falling asleep; they hardly ever get to page 33."" **********Similarly, publicly held companies that have been less than forthcoming about their risky securities positions are also vulnerable to suits, Mr. Berman said. ""A meritorious suit would be one in which the company hadn't said much about having made the derivative investments,"" he said. **********And then, added Raymond Peffer, who is representing investors in one of the arbitrations against Salomon, there is the issue of whether the investors had been given the documents. ""My clients didn't get the prospectus,"" he said. ""But even if they did, it would have been difficult even for a sophisticated investor to evaluate the risk."""

Brown was witnessing the signing of 15 business deals that are part of the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy and will mean jobs for Americans. **********By far the largest project is a $35 billion arrangement between Exxon and Pertamina, the Indonesian state oil company, to develop a huge offshore natural gas field.  [ Page D5. ] **********Since May, when the Administration discarded its policy of linking preferential trade benefits to China with an improvement in its human rights performance, the Administration has argued that the best way to spread democracy and improve the way a country treats its citizens is through increasing trade, not curtailing it. **********In his photo session with Mr. Suharto earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton was stone-faced, but in a speech to American and Pacific business executives he did not disguise his glee at the news of the business deals. **********""I know that there is increasing wealth in Indonesia and throughout Asia, but where I come from $40 billion is still real money -- and we're grateful for the business,"" he said. The audience applauded. **********Indeed, two cultural divides over human rights in Indonesia were on display today: one between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Suharto, the other between the foreign and economic policies of the United States **********Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Suharto in the opulent Jakarta Palace showed how resistant foreign leaders can be when the President of the United States comes in and suggests -- however gently -- how things should be done. **********And the differences among Mr. Clinton's Cabinet officials as they sought to explain their messages underscored the tension between the Administration's stated desire to export American values and the need to export American goods. **********Meeting for more than an hour after a summit conference of 18 leaders from Pacific Rim countries, Mr. Clinton told Mr. Suharto that his treatment of his people would inhibit ties between the United States and Indonesia and rob him of the chance to flourish as a world leader, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. **********Mr. Christopher told reporters before meeting with Indonesia's Government-appointed human rights organization that Mr. Clinton had raised human rights ""in firm and forceful terms."" **********""The relationship between the United States and Indonesia can never reach the highest levels if the people of the United States don't have confidence that there is an effort here to respect the human rights of all the citizens,"" Mr. Christopher said. **********Mr. Suharto, who has ruled with an authoritarian grip since the mid-1960's, apparently was not moved. **********When Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Suharto's dialogue with the people of East Timor, the former Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia two decades ago, but said they needed more autonomy, Mr. Suharto balked, Administration officials said. **********""He believes that the Indonesian Government is dealing with the issue fairly,"" a senior Administration official said. **********Over all, Mr. Suharto's remarks on human rights, the official added, ""were along the lines that have been previously expressed by the Indonesian Government."" **********Another senior official said: ""Suharto didn't back down one inch. He gave well rehearsed answers that he is used to repeating."" **********Mr. Suharto learned early this year that he is unlikely to face penalties if he does not bend to Washington's wishes. Shortly after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Mr. Suharto in Jakarta that he had to do more on workers' rights if he wanted to retain his country's preferential trade privileges, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, abruptly suspended the Administration's review of the issue. **********In May, the Administration severed the link between the trade benefits given China and its human rights policies. Since then the Administration has changed its thinking on the best strategy to modify behavior on human rights. The key, officials say, is not punishment but more trade and investment, which they believe will increase economic growth and help spawn a middle class with both consumerism and democracy in mind. **********But the same officials acknowledge that the human rights situation in Indonesia has worsened in recent months with the banning of newspapers and magazines, more harassment of labor activists and new reports of torture by the military and police. **********Along with the talk today about the need for Indonesia to do more on human rights was a message about the joys of trade. Indonesia is expected to spend more than $100 billion to improve its infrastructure by 2000, and the United States is determined to seize a large chunk of the projects. **********Even as Mr. Clinton was mixing tough talk about human rights with happy talk about goals for free trade in the Asia-Pacific region, Secretary Brown was completing arrangements for 15 projects worth $40 billion. **********This morning, seated next to Mr. Christopher as the Secretary of State criticized the Indonesian human rights record, Mr. Brown played good cop to Mr. Christopher's bad one. ""Our strategy of commercial engagement, we believe, is the most effective strategy to have a positive impact on labor rights and human rights,"" he said. **********To illustrate the importance of the economic component of the policy, Mr. Brown sat in on Mr. Christopher's meeting with the official human rights group and ""was very persuasive in saying that we advance our commercial economic interests hand in hand with our human rights concerns,"" a senior Administration official said. **********Mr. Suharto had hoped that as host of this year's meeting of the 18 leaders, known as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, he would focus attention on his country's economic progress and views on free trade. **********Instead the focus was dimmed by demonstrations in Dili, in East Timor, and by a sit-in that began last Saturday at the American Embassy in Jakarta by 29 East Timorese who had demanded a meeting with Mr. Clinton or Mr. Christopher. Neither man nor any other senior Administration official has met with them. **********Today Indonesian officials said that the Government was willing to allow the protesters to leave the country. Portugal has offered them asylum. **********A number of Indonesia's major private rights organizations boycotted a meeting today with Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Stanley Roth, the senior Asia specialist at the White House, and Bowman Cutter, the deputy director of the National Economic Council. **********A letter to Mr. Clinton, signed by leading private human rights groups, said, ""Your unwillingness to meet with non-state actors in the pro-democracy movement seems to be part of the U.S. Government's inconsistency toward the improvement of human rights and democracy in Indonesia."""

Cameron, the chief executive of the banking company, announced a sweeping plan intended to improve the company's efficiency. He said he hoped the cuts would convince Wall Street to raise the value of the company's stock enough to dissuade any hostile takeover efforts. Mr. Cameron said it was the company's policy not to comment on takeover rumors. **********Shares of U.S. Bancorp closed unchanged, at $25.75, in Nasdaq trading today. **********""If Wall Street sees the company do something about cost structure, they will respond favorably,"" Mr. Cameron said. ""They are entitled to wait and see, however."" **********Mr. Cameron said the company was spending too much to earn money. He said its expense ratio was 65.7 percent, and he intended to get it below 63 percent this year, and ultimately below 60 percent. Cost-Cutting Pressure **********Regional banking firms have been under pressure to cut costs. The move follows an announcement last week by Fleet Financial Group Inc., the largest banking company in New England, that it would eliminate 5,500 of its 27,500 jobs to produce $350 million in ""sustainable profit improvements."" **********U.S. Bancorp is the last independent banking company in the Northwest, with assets of $21.4 billion as of Dec. 31. It is one of the 35 largest bank holding companies in the United States, with 420 branches in Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada, Idaho and Canada. **********Mr. Cameron said the staff reductions were intended to make the stock ""less visible"" to any other company that might want to move into the Northwest. He said if the value of the stock were higher, such a company would be ""less inclined to pay a premium for it."" If U.S. Bancorp were taken over, he said, the acquiring company would make the cuts he is making. A $100 Million Charge **********U.S. Bancorp is taking a charge of $100 million against its first-quarter earnings to make the staff reductions. The company began restricting external hirings in February. **********The company is offering early retirement to employees who are older than 50 and have been with the company at least five years as of the end of August. Those workers who accept the offer would be credited with five years of additional service to the company and five years of extra age toward their pensions. Mary B. Ruble, a spokeswoman for the company, said she did not know when the early retirees could begin drawing benefits. There are about 1,300 workers eligible for early retirement. **********The company will then offer voluntary severance, Ms. Ruble said. The company is identifying positions that can be cut, and offering employees an ""enhanced severance package"" if they choose to quit. The workers will receive three weeks of severance for the first through fifth year of service, two weeks for six to 20 years, with a maximum of 45 weeks. **********Mr. Cameron estimated that fewer than half the needed cuts would be attained voluntarily. The company would then begin layoffs. Those workers terminated involuntarily could still get up to 40 weeks of severance, and 60 days' notice. **********Mr. Cameron said that while the bank showed record earnings in 1993, much of those profits came from one-time sales of subsidiary companies.  The company reported net income of $257.9 million by yearend -- the highest in its history and the 11th consecutive year of increased earnings."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/31/world/vigilantes-in-colombia-kill-hundreds-in-a-social-cleansing.html,,1994-10-31,,926,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Vigilantes in Colombia Kill Hundreds in a 'Social Cleansing',Vigilantes in Colombia Kill Hundreds in a 'Social Cleansing'," **********A week ago, a car drove up to a group of young men in the northern city of Medellin. Its four occupants got out, displayed guns and told the men to hand over their documents. **********""We are the law,"" the gunmen said, according to witnesses. The young men were then made to lie down with their hands behind their heads, and 10 were shot and killed. **********The deaths last Sunday were among a recent series of so-called social-cleansing killings in Colombia's major cities. As in the other cases, they remain unsolved. Yet to human rights monitors, they are part of an increasingly vicious crusade aimed at vagrants, criminals, prostitutes, street children and drug addicts, all known as disposables. **********Local justice authorities say the existence of vigilante groups is difficult to detect because they leave few traces and witnesses refuse to talk out of fear of reprisals. **********""What is clear is an organized attempt to attack the most vulnerable sectors of the population as a perceived security measure,"" said Carlos Rojas, a researcher at the Center for Grass-Roots Education and Investigation, a human rights group here. **********According to a study by Mr. Rojas, almost 2,000 people were killed from 1988 to 1993 as a result of what Colombians call limpieza social, or social cleansing. In the first half of 1994, he counted 215 deaths at the hands of vigilante groups. Other human rights organizations estimate that there are 345 such killings in Colombia every year. **********Neighborhoods riddled with petty crime and local merchants whose customers are scared away by the sight of vagrants often band together to eliminate these unwanted people. Human rights monitors and justice officials say that many of the slayings are backed or aided by members of the police and, in some cases, their officers. **********Although members of the security forces have been directly implicated in several killings, the police authorities have denied involvement. **********""The police sometimes deny that 'social cleansing' groups even exist,"" said an official at the Attorney General's Office who spoke in return for anonimity. **********Yet street children say security forces are their worst fear. Jonatan, a 17-year-old who spent three years on the streets, recalled how policemen would take him to an isolated mountain area and demand information on his fellow pickpockets and drug addicts. **********""The police would say, 'This is a cleansing process and you have to collaborate,' "" said Jonatan, who refused to give his last name. **********Antonio Bustos, the Public Defender of Bogota, said there was no evidence that the police supported the vigilante groups. ""There are denunciations that these groups exist but we have no proof of that either,"" Mr. Bustos said. **********The Defense Ministry did not respond to several requests for interviews with the Defense Minister. **********Justice officials say that the vigilantes operate in cycles during which they attack specific groups of people. A recent series of killings of construction workers in the city of Cali are believed to be linked to drug traffickers who hire workers for building projects and then kill them to eliminate traces of their activities. Last year, 235 such workers were found dead in Cali and 113 were reported dead in the first four months of this year. **********Early this month, several killings around Medellin were widely attributed to a group calling itself Death to Car Thieves, which has been blamed for about 50 killings since it first announced itself in March. **********In July, a group calling itself Colombia Without Guerrillas issued a statement saying it was forming to attack anyone connected with left-wing rebel groups. **********""We feel obliged to defend ourselves and to combat those murderers in all of their territory, and with the same method,"" the group's communique said. **********Vigilante groups are common in Bogota, where street children, prostitutes and transvestites say plainclothes policemen have been responsible for a wave of killings. **********""There is evidence that members of the police go to these neighborhoods at night and shoot or burn children alive,"" said the official at the Attorney General's office. ""But I can only go so far in investigating. Beyond that, I will be the dead one."" **********The number of vigilante groups has increased since the mid-1980's in response to rising crime and homelessness. **********""No state is viable with 30,000 homicides per year,"" said Eduardo Pizarro, a political science professor at National University in Bogota. ""Only 3 percent of those crimes go punished. Social-cleansing organizations spring up as a substitute for real justice."" **********Patricia Arango, an assistant to the presidential adviser for human rights, says children are a main target for the vigilante groups. From July of 1993 to July of this year, 200 prostitutes, many of whom were minors, were reported killed or missing in Medellin alone. **********""People know these groups exist but nobody dares to speak out,"" Miss Arango said. **********Attesting to the degree of tolerance for these groups, she added that she sent letters to People's Defense offices around the country this year requesting information about social-cleansing groups. The People's Defense is a Government office that monitors the state's infringement on individuals' rights. **********""They all wrote back saying that they have no evidence of social cleansing, including one who added, almost as an afterthought, 'But we did hear of the murder of 19 young men near here.'

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/30/business/luxury-car-fight-turns-uncivilized.html,James Bennet,1994-08-30,,1782,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Luxury Car Fight Turns Uncivilized,Luxury Car Fight Turns Uncivilized," **********Some blame the sport-utility vehicles, others the higher income taxes on the very wealthy. Some claim ""90's values"" have made the rich self-conscious, while still others argue that fears of health care cost-cutting have made doctors miserly. **********Whatever the reason, the luxury car market, roughly defined as cars costing more than $25,000, or about 13 percent of car sales in the United States, is in turmoil, and the calfskin gloves have come off. **********No longer do the luxury marques attract customers by simply coughing politely and drawing attention to their burled walnut. These days, the once genteel divisions are publicly taking potshots at each other, and even competing -- heavens! -- on price. **********Amid the din, they are rushing to develop less expensive cars, build new plants and branch into new models like fancy trucks and roadsters in a bid to catch up with their customers' rapidly changing tastes. **********""We're in a dogfight,"" said John O. Grettenberger, the vice president for General Motors who is general manager of its Cadillac luxury division, adding a bit archly: ""Some of the competition has gotten down to a level that I would never want to see at Cadillac."" The reason, he said, is simple: ""Everyone's got a lot of cars."" **********Within the luxury segment, in which buyers perhaps most closely identify cars with the nationalities of their makers, the momentum has shifted. As a category, imports are doing well. But after big losses to the Japanese in the late 1980's, the Germans and Swedes have gained back some ground, while some of the Japanese -- in particular Toyota's luxury division, Lexus, and Honda's luxury division, Acura -- have struggled. **********Sales of luxury cars in the United States are up by 4 percent over last year, but they are lagging behind the rest of the robust auto market. In particular, sales of cars costing more than $35,000 are slack, for several reasons. Conspicuous consumption, the luxury car makers grumble, is out. Further, most luxury cars' price tags are too high for executives made anxious by widespread corporate restructuring. **********As a result, less expensive cars with all the options but no luxury badge, like the new Mazda Millenia and the forthcoming Toyota Avalon sedan, are drawing buyers who in the past might have paid $40,000 for a little more prestige. **********The most unexpected blow to luxury sales, however, has been the popularity of four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Ford Explorer. That shift has been a boon to the Big Three auto makers, because they make the most sport-utilities. **********Such vehicles, auto industry analysts say, remain decorous enough for country-club parking lots, while carrying a rough-and-ready, back-to-nature cachet. It does not hurt their appeal that these vehicles cost less than most luxury cars. **********Sales of luxury cars tend to be the most profitable for the auto makers, so the slow pace hurts. In reporting its second-quarter earnings last month, G.M. said slower-than-expected Cadillac sales had undercut the results.  'A Captive Audience' **********The Big Three are still searching for a way to halt the slide in their share of the luxury market. Both Cadillac and the Ford Motor Company's luxury division, Lincoln-Mercury, have had little success attracting younger, more affluent buyers. **********""Their focus has been on a captive audience -- the same captive audience for 20 years,"" said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, a consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J. **********Hit hard by the last recession, older luxury buyers remain more pessimistic about the economy than younger Americans, according to Cadillac's research. Many are retired, so low interest rates have bitten into their incomes. And Cadillac has found that its older buyers are uncomfortable with leasing, which importers have successfully used to prop up their sales. **********Lexus, whose sales and market share have slipped this year despite a jump in July, appears to be a victim of its success at shaking luxury buyers' habits. Many auto makers scoffed in the mid-80's at the idea of a Japanese luxury auto maker, but Lexus quickly proved that customers would flee the traditional luxury marques for cheaper competitors of equal or superior quality. **********""People are less hung up on marque,"" said Maryann N. Keller, auto analyst with Furman Selz in New York. ""Lexus educated them.""  A Climb in Prices **********It also educated the German auto makers. ""When it came to price and value, we were a little out of whack,"" said Michael J. Jackson, executive vice president for marketing, service and sales of Mercedes-Benz of North America. **********But Lexus's prices have climbed steadily, partly because of the strength of the Japanese yen. BMW and Mercedes reacted by lowering or at least maintaining some prices. They also became more sensitive to Americans' tastes -- dampening road noise, for example, and adding cup holders. **********""The industry has had five years to try to match Lexus,"" said George E. Borst, the group vice president for Toyota who is general manager of the Lexus division, in a meeting with reporters here last month. **********But, he acknowledged, ""Our products are priced above where the market is."" Customers want luxury cars priced at or below $35,000, he said. But 60 percent of the Lexus models cost more than that. **********As the 1994 model year comes to an end in September, the lowest-priced Lexus, the ES300, costs $31,200 -- 19.3 percent more than its introductory price of $29,250 in 1992, according to an analysis by Ms. Jacobs. During the same period, the price of the lowest level Mercedes -- the C class -- has risen 2.2 percent, to $29,900, from $29,250, even though Mercedes introduced an all new version for 1994.  'Water Over the Dam' **********To help buyers over the initial price hurdle, Lexus dealers are running advertisements that stress the resale value of the cars. While luxury advertising has traditionally eschewed negative attacks on the competition, one of the new Lexus ads shows a Mercedes atop a dam. **********""European luxury owners are good sports about the high cost of owning their cars,"" the commercial begins. ""To them, it's just water over the dam."" **********The ad goes on to claim that because of its high resale value, a Lexus LS, priced at $51,200, costs at least $14,000 less to own over five years ""than most European competitors in its class."" **********Mr. Borst predicted that vigorous cost-cutting and new products would restore the Lexus price position before long, and no one is counting Lexus out of the market. But some of Mr. Borst's competitors are clearly relishing his predicament, and they are not above delivering the occasional jab at his product line. **********""They're very competent cars, no doubt about it,"" said Victor H. Doolan, president of BMW of North America. ""But are they very exciting cars? I don't think so, and I think the market agrees with that."" **********In addition to fiercer competition from each other, luxury marques are trying to fend off an even stiffer challenge from outside their ranks: the sport-utility vehicle market. ""A lot of the people who moved up into S.U.V.'s are people whose logical next purchase would have been a luxury car,"" Mr. Borst said.  A Move to Practicality **********Further, some luxury car owners are switching their allegiances. Gary Chefetz, a 37-year-old business consultant in Edison, N.J., recently traded in a Mercedes roadster for a Jeep Grand Cherokee with leather seats. **********""It's got all the features of a luxury car and all the abilities of a car of this type,"" he said of the Jeep. After the snows of last winter, he decided he wanted a more practical, four-wheel-drive vehicle. **********""It's not an insult to Mercedes,"" he added. ""They don't have a competing product. If they did, I'd probably buy it."" **********Mercedes is scrambling to halt further defections by building a plant in Tuscaloosa County, Ala., to start producing what the company calls an ""all activity vehicle"" by 1997. Lexus is weighing the idea of a luxury sport-utility, but Mr. Borst said it would not have one before 1996. **********By buying Rover Group of Britain earlier this year, BMW acquired the auto maker's popular line of off-road vehicles, including the new Discovery, with a base price of less than $30,000. Free to focus on its car lineup, BMW is planning to produce a new two-seat convertible roadster at a plant it is building in Spartanburg, S.C. **********Even without luxury sport-utilities, the German and Swedish auto makers have made strong gains in sales and market share this year. A Sleek Sedan **********Sales of Volvos, for example, have shot up almost 20 percent in 1994, as the company has recast its image to draw younger buyers. Volvos lost sales in the late 80's, as customers came to perceive them as safe but dull cars for people long on children or short on imagination. **********Further, because they lacked front-wheel drive, the cars dropped off the list for those faced with the prospect of fishtailing through snowstorms. **********But in late 1992, Volvo introduced a relatively sleek sedan, the 850, with an in-line five-cylinder engine driving the front wheels. The 850, with a base price of about $26,000, is also available as a wagon and now accounts for about 55 percent of Volvo's sales. **********BMW's sales are also up substantially -- 12 percent for the year. The company has gained back share since the beginning of the 1990 model year, when it began paying closer attention to Americans' tastes. **********Moving away from the brooding tones preferred by its home market, BMW began offering brighter colors, both inside and out. Also in deference to American tastes, it added touches of wood and began installing seats with wrinkled, rather than taught, leather. **********But its most aggressive action came in pricing. For the 1990 model year, for example, the price of the 535i sedan, its midsize model, fell to $41,500, from $43,600. Since then, BMW has tried to limit price increases. Five years later, in the 1995 model year, the 535i has been replaced by the 540i, priced at $42,750. **********""There was a change in values from the 80's to the 90's,"" Mr. Doolan of BMW said. ""People are not just buying status."" **********Or, at least, they're not willing to pay quite so much for it. Mr. Doolan expects strong sales in the low- to mid-luxury range, but, he said, ""I don't see a lot of growth over $50,000."""

Dudayev,Man in the News; Chechen Warrior Chief: Soviet Army Credentials -- Dzhokhar M. Dudayev," **********Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, the flamboyant leader of the breakaway Chechen region, was the first Chechen in the history of the Soviet Union to become a general, commanding a strategic bomber wing at the age of 36. **********It was a remarkable rise for a boy whose family was deported in 1944, the year of his birth, to far-off Kazakhstan, along with almost the entire population of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous District. Stalin thought they might collaborate with the Nazis to win independence, and given the long history of enmity between the Chechens and the Russians who colonized them, he might have been right. **********Historians estimate that of the 800,000 people stuffed into railway cars, 240,000 died en route. **********But Mr. Dudayev -- his name is pronounced ZHO-kahr doo-DYE-yev -- seemed the perfect Soviet man, spending his first 13 years in northern Kazakhstan, graduating from elite Soviet military schools and marrying a Russian woman, Alevtina, with whom he has had three daughters and a son. **********He graduated from the Tambov Higher Air Force Engineering School and, in 1974, from the Yuri Gagarin Air Force Academy. He worked his way up to major general, commanding a division of Soviet strategic bombers based near Tartu, Estonia, from 1987 to 1990. **********General Dudayev learned Estonian and showed remarkable tolerance of Estonian nationalism. One holiday, he allowed a parachutist to unfurl an Estonian nationalist banner, later the flag of independent Estonia. More vividly, and bravely, he refused to carry out the orders of the Soviet Government and did not shut down Estonian television and the Parliament. **********After the division was withdrawn from Estonia in 1990, he retired, returning to Grozny, the Chechen capital, where he quickly became leader of the executive committee of the opposition National Congress of the Chechen People, a nationalist organization. **********""The Chechen people bend their heads only when they are working,"" he said then. **********Within two weeks of the abortive coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev in August 1991, Mr. Dudayev deposed the leadership of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic and seized power in Grozny. He became president of the Chechen Republic on Oct. 27, and was elected to that post in November. **********He declared the republic independent from Russia and then faced down Russian Interior Ministry troops who were sent to Grozny by President Boris N. Yeltsin. The Russian legislature demanded their return, and Mr. Yeltsin complied. **********Mr. Dudayev has in his presidential palace a huge painting of Sheik Mansur, an 18th-century Chechen warrior who led an uprising against Russian domination. Russians who know him well, like Leonid V. Smirnyagin, a Yeltsin adviser, say Mr. Dudayev imagines himself a present-day Shamil, who led the revolt against the Russians that was finally put down in 1864. **********""Our independence is forever,"" he has said. ""On that I wager my life."" **********Mr. Dudayev has shown himself to be ruthless, putting down all unrest in Chechnya and surviving a number of assassination attempts. With loyalty from the fierce Chechen militia and army, he has also managed to survive a dedicated Russian effort to subvert and overthrow him. The failure of his opponents to defeat him, even with the help of Russian volunteers and air power, is the main reason for the full-scale Russian invasion now. **********Mr. Dudayev, now 50, says he is a dedicated Muslim who practices karate, likes classical music and lists ""flowers"" as one of his hobbies. He favors an old-style nattiness, wearing pin-stripe suits, a carefully trimmed mustache and well-shaped hats that give him the air of a 1930's matinee idol. **********But it is his military training that matters these days. Sensibly, he is taking his tactics not from the Soviet military but from the old school of Chechen warfare against a larger Russian force. **********""We have to strike them from the rear, deal them a strong blow,"" he said in an interview on Tuesday on Russian television. ""This is the centuries-old tactic of the mountain people. Strike and withdraw, strike and withdraw, to exhaust them until they die of fear and horror."" **********Calling Chechens to arms today on local television, he said, ""The earth should burn under the Russian occupiers."""

But American officials appeared pleased that Mr. Assad had paid serious attention to the Israeli proposal, which Mr. Christopher presented to him in seven hours of talks this weekend. **********The Israeli plan calls for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights over several years, in return for Syrian recognition of Israel and the signing of a peace accord. **********Calling the talks with Mr. Assad ""very serious and substantive,"" Mr. Christopher said at a news conference: ""We have entered a new, more substantive phase of the negotiations. But it is clear there is a good deal of work to be done."" **********[ After the talks between Mr. Christopher and President Assad, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk Sharaa, rejected the offer for a phased withdrawal and reiterated Syria's longstanding demand for a total withdrawal. ] Meeting With Rabin Next **********The Israeli plan and Mr. Christopher's visit seek to end the deadlock in the Syria-Israel peace talks. Mr. Christopher flew to Israel tonight to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to describe the Syrian ideas. In an encouraging note, a senior official traveling with Mr. Christopher said, ""They are discussing the full range of issues that have to be discussed."" **********One of Mr. Christopher's goals on his 10-day trip to the Middle East was to obtain firm dates to resume peace talks in Washington between Israel and Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. He said tonight that no dates had been set, adding that he needed to confer with Russia, which is co-sponsoring the talks, before setting a date. **********One area in which Mr. Christopher reported progress was in his effort to persuade Mr. Assad to allow a high-level American official to examine human rights in Syria. Mr. Christopher said that it would be desirable for John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, to visit Syria, and that he had received some encouraging responses that such a visit might be arranged. **********The stalemate in the Syria-Israel peace talks results from each side's wanting the other to take the first big step. For security reasons, Israel has refused to pull out of the Golan Heights, which it captured in 1967 and annexed in 1981, until Syria signs a peace agreement. Syria opposes a peace deal until Israel unilaterally withdraws from the Golan Heights. **********The plan put together by Mr. Rabin seeks a comprehensive deal in which Israel would withdraw in phases from the heights in perhaps eight years. In return, Syria would establish diplomatic relations with Israel, sign a peace agreement and end its economic boycott of Israel. **********Since Syria used to shell northern Israel from the Golan Heights, Israel is proposing security measures as part of the package. It is calling for demilitarization of the heights and also an international force of peacekeepers to serve as a buffer. **********Neither Mr. Assad nor any other Syrian official made the sort of public, unmistakably positive response to the Israeli plan that Israel officials were hoping for. Israeli officials say that when Mr. Rabin met on Friday in Tel Aviv with Mr. Christopher, the Israeli leader said he was disappointed that Israel had not received any confidence-building measures from Syria after he had outlined a bold, politically risky peace plan. **********There was a flurry of statements from Syrian officials in the news media today that welcomed progress toward peace but reiterated Damascus's demands, sometimes in a slightly tougher formulation than before. **********Mr. Rabin has been subjected to severe fire from the Israeli right for saying he was willing to dismantle settlements in the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. **********Some American officials say Mr. Assad is not inclined to make many concessions, since he believes that he has made many recent gestures to Washington, among them eradicating some poppy cultivation in the Bekaa region of Lebanon, closing two terrorist camps in that country and allowing an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament to visit Syria. **********In the view of some Middle East commentators, Mr. Assad wants normalized relations with the United States even more than he wants peace with Israel and the return of the Golan Heights. **********That is why American officials expected him to ask for some sizable carrots from the United States before he moves substantially forward in the talks with Israel. Among them is having Washington remove Syria from the American list of nations that sponsor terrorism and the list of nations that have failed to do enough to suppress drug trafficking."

For the last three years, the French company, Bertelsmann and Kirch Gruppe have been partners in the Premiere service in Germany, which now has 780,000 subscribers. **********The companies signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture by this summer covering various television concepts - outside of France and Germany - not supported by advertising, such as subscription pay TV, pay-per-view, video-on-demand and home shopping services. **********Manfred Harnyschfeger, spokesman for Bertelsmann, said his company planned to contribute its marketing know-how in book clubs to help sell new pay TV services. **********""We have 30 million households that are members of our book clubs in 20 countries,"" he said. ""It's the same system, whether the product is books, magazines or pay TV."" **********Last week, Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom said they would form a pay TV joint venture for the German market. **********Investment levels in the new joint venture have not been set, but Mr. Harnyschfeger said capital would likely be pledged on a ""step by step"" basis. To set up a pay channel in one country, he said, requires an investment of up to 800 million Deutsche marks ($471 million) over a five-year period. **********Both companies have deep pockets. Bertelsmann last year reported a profit of 660 million DM on sales of 17 billion DM. Canal Plus in 1992 earned 1.1 billion francs ($190 million) on sales of 7.9 billion francs. Sales advanced to 8.67 billion francs last year."

Its parking lot, concession booths, ticket office, picnic areas, and skyboxes are incomplete or unbuilt. The young players on the New York-Penn League teams will find partly finished clubhouses. **********Skylands Park Management Inc., which raised $6.3 million in a public offering last year, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this month, reporting debts of $3.5 million. **********The company, based in Sussex, N.J., is seeking a loan of up to $2 million from Kennedy Funding, a finance company in Hackensack, N.J., that it hopes to repay from the proceeds of a second public offering, which was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 7. **********In its bankruptcy petition, Skylands noted cost overruns of about $1.5 million, which the company attributed to the harsh winter weather that impeded construction at the park. Contractors stopped working on the project when Skylands stopped paying its bills. Unimpressive Results **********Robert A. Hilliard, the president of Skylands, did not return calls seeking comment. **********The start-up company, which was created to build the regional sports and recreation center, has so far posted unimpressive financial results. Revenues, mainly from merchandise and magazine subscriptions, totaled $50,550 in the three months that ended on March 31, and the company had a net loss of $129,184. Since its incorporation in 1991, Skylands has posted $519,969 in total net losses. **********Robert Wolfer, president of Kennedy Funding, said he had issued a commitment for at least $1 million for an 18-month term to complete the stadium, and might loan another $1 million if Skylands required it. The loan would also make Kennedy Funding the first lien holder, putting it ahead of the other creditors. **********If Skylands defaulted on the loan, Kennedy Funding could foreclose and assume ownership of the ballpark.

'Retaliatory' Serbian Attack **********Today, grieving relatives, friends and neighbors reflected on the absurdity of Mrs. Pajic's death and whether the Bosnian Army's efforts to break the Serbian choke hold on this city should go on, even against the odds and even when it is clear that with each attempt the Serbs will bombard civilian targets and kill more people like her. **********Mrs. Pajic died, United Nations officials asserted today, from a ""retaliatory"" Serbian attack on Tuesday that killed 9 people, wounded 60 others and closed the city's airport to humanitarian-aid flights. Hospital officials said tonight that 5 more people were killed and 16 wounded in shelling today. **********Though the International Red Cross spokeswoman, Jessica Barry, said a Serbian shell killed a man outside her office in Sarajevo as early as 9:15 A.M. on Tuesday, the spokesman for the United Nations military force in Bosnia, Lieut. Col. Bill Aikman, told journalists this morning that Bosnian Army mortars opened fire first at about 10 A.M. **********The shell that killed Mrs. Pajic ripped into the sidewalk at about 11 A.M. while she was walking to a nearby Red Cross office with a message for her 18-year-old granddaughter on the Serbian side of the siege line, relatives said. **********The shrapnel tore away the front half of Mrs. Pajic's head, killing her immediately. The message was still in her pocket. **********""Thank God that you are all alive and well, and that we're all alive and well,"" she wrote, asking her granddaughter to send boxes of powdered milk and a picture of her grandson's wedding in a package through the Serbian Orthodox Church's aid organization. ""It would make grandma happier than anything else to see you at least in a picture."" **********Today, the dead woman's half-Serbian, half-Croatian nephew, Slavko Pajic, sipped coffee with friends and neighbors in her second-floor apartment and took calls from relatives. **********""The stupid thing here is that it has come to an ethnic war,"" he said, explaining that his dead aunt's two sons -- both Serbs, both Bosnian Army soldiers -- are married to a Croat and a Muslim, while her two daughters are married to Serbs. **********""Look at how we are mixed,"" he said. ""I stayed here because I'm not a nationalist and 90 percent of my friends are Muslims."" **********""Each side here should admit its mistakes and guilt and end this right now,"" Mr. Pajic said, commenting on the Serbs' retaliations for the Bosnian Army's recent efforts to dislodge them from the gun positions they hold in a sniper-infested neighborhood known as Grbavica. ""The world community could have stopped this if they had acted immediately. Now it is all over. It has become a matter of revenge.""  'Shells Don't Ask' **********""The shells don't ask, 'Who is a Serb? Who is a Croat? Who is a Muslim?' "" said Halil Prutina, one of Mr. Pajic's Muslim friends. ""The Serbs with the guns aren't thinking with their own heads. All of the military activity in Sarajevo should be stopped, on one side and the other."" **********""I know our guys are sometimes attacking,"" said another of Mrs. Pajic's relatives, who asked not to be identified. ""The authorities never admit publicly that we are shooting. On the news it's always 'the Chetniks attacked, the Chetniks shelled.' "" The reference was to the Serbian fighters. **********""Now it has plainly become just a struggle for territory by the three ethnic groups,"" she said, suggesting that she was skeptical of the Bosnian Government's public support for maintenance of a multi-ethnic Bosnian state. **********Outside, on the sidewalk, people hurried by the spot where Mrs. Pajic died as incoming shells exploded nearby. **********""It was peaceful, and then the shells fell all at once -- seven of them,"" said Alija Ceribasic-Begovac, a teacher who lifted Mrs. Pajic's body into a civil-defense car and drove it to the city morgue within minutes of her death. ""She used to walk by the school quite often. This time she was carrying a five-liter plastic water container and a small bag."" **********""As far as I'm concerned, the army of Bosnia and Herzegovina never attacks,"" Mr. Ceribasic-Begovac said. ""The Chetniks started the war."" **********Hebib Zecir, a 53-year-old Bosnian Army soldier, stopped for a minute at the site of Mrs. Pajic's death on his way to a nearby market. 'The Cat Scratches Back' **********""For me it is unthinkable to say that our army is attacking,"" he said. ""We are defending ourselves. When a dog attacks a cat, the cat scratches back."" **********""Let the Serbs shoot at me on the line,"" he continued. ""That is a fight. But shelling civilian areas is simply murder."" **********Esma Besagic, a 42-year-old mother of two, lives in an apartment upstairs from Mrs. Pajic's. **********""The army should attack,"" she said.  ""Let the army at least try to break out of this siege."" **********""The world has shown that it is going to do nothing to liberate us,"" she said, calling the United Nations' efforts hypocritical and scoffing at news reports that NATO had again warned the Serbs that it might undertake air strikes to prevent the ""strangulation"" of the city. ""It will only hurt us if we believe all this talk about air strikes again."" **********""What are we supposed to do,"" she asked, ""surrender and be killed?"""

The P.L.O. broke off the talks after an Israeli settler massacred Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron two weeks ago. **********The agreement that Israel and the P.L.O. signed in Washington in September calls for a Palestinian police force in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, which are now occupied by Israel. **********Under that framework accord, the Israelis pledged to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho, on the West Bank, and to start negotiations for Palestinian self-rule in the entire West Bank. The details were to have been worked out by last December, and the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to have been completed by April 13. But the details proved elusive, and no talks have been held since the massacre in Hebron on Feb. 25. **********One Administration official said Washington was not formally adopting the lastest P.L.O. proposals, but was not averse to them and was urging Israel to consider them. Reviving Talks Stressed **********At today's meeting, Mr. Christopher did not urge Mr. Rabin to accept any specific proposals, but he emphasized that more needed to be done to bring the P.L.O. back to the table, Administration officials said. Mr. Rabin is to meet President Clinton on Wednesday. **********Israeli officials said they were loath to accept preconditions to reopen the talks. But American and Palestinian officials said increased security in Hebron could provide the outline of an agreement to resume the talks. One major remaining disagreement is the P.L.O.'s insistence that Israel disarm many of the 130,000 Israeli settlers. **********Dennis B. Ross, the United States representative at the peace talks, returned from Tunis today after meeting with the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, and American officials said there was some narrowing of the gap between the Israelis and the P.L.O. about restarting the talks. **********In a sign of progress, the United States mission to the United Nations announced today that Washington would allow a Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre to be voted on this Friday. Mr. Arafat has insisted that the Security Council approve such a resolution before he sends negotiators back to the table. **********For more than a week, the United States has blocked the resolution, insisting that the Palestinians first agree to return to the talks. The P.L.O. had not yet agreed to this, and State Department officials said today that setting a date for the vote could push the P.L.O. to do so. Possible Israeli Responses **********Israeli officials said they were reluctant to agree to the Palestinian proposal on a Hebron security force because such a move would force new talks on the declaration of principles signed in September. In addition, disarming Israeli settlers would surely enrage many. **********But, one official involved in the talks suggested, Israel might accept some unspoken preconditions to restart the talks, bargaining later on including them in any final peace treaty. **********P.L.O. officials in Tunis insisted today that Israel had to do more to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, saying Israel's moves to disarm a handful of settlers did not go far enough. **********Marwan Kanafani, a political adviser to Mr. Arafat, said in an interview, ""We are talking about creating the proper environment to keep the process itself alive, which needs a credible set of protective measures."" 'No Time to Waste' **********In a speech today to a pro-Israel lobbying group in Washington, Mr. Rabin urged the P.L.O. to return to the talks, saying a full agreement was the best way to insure security for Palestinians. Israeli officials said Mr. Rabin had made it clear in recent days that he was ready to accelerate the schedule for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. **********Worried that militant Israeli or Palestinian groups might seek to destroy the peace effort, Mr. Rabin warned Mr. Arafat in his speech: ""We have no time to waste. It is possible that the window of opportunity is narrower than we thought."" **********Seeking to underline Israel's seriousness, Mr. Rabin said he was eager to move ahead in talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. One Israeli official suggested that because of the long-standing rivalry between Mr. Assad and Mr. Arafat, any push on talks with Syria might hasten Mr. Arafat's return to the bargaining table. Status of Jerusalem **********Mr. Rabin seemed to indicate that the Security Council resolution, which suggests that Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories, was just language. To thunderous applause, he said, ""Notwithstanding any United Nations resolution, I assure you Jerusalem will remain united under Israel's sovereignty."" **********The Administration has signaled that if the P.L.O. agrees to resume talks, Washington would abstain on the ""Jerusalem language,"" thus letting it go through, in the belief that ignoring objectionable language was worth it if such a step restarts the talks. **********Several senators, led by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, and Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, are circulating a letter that urges President Clinton to veto any resolution that states or implies that Jerusalem is occupied territory. **********""The meaning of Jerusalem will be measured by our acts as a nation, not by our pronouncements,"" the letter says.                    --------------------       Vatican Envoy to Tunis **********ROME, March 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- Two days before Pope John Paul II is to meet Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the Vatican sent a senior envoy to the Middle East today to urge resumption of talks. **********The emissary, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, is to meet Yasir Arafat at the P.L.O. headquarters in Tunis and, in a surprising move, Col. Moammar el-Qaddafi of Libya in Tripoli. **********Since the Vatican and Israel recognized each other on Dec. 30, the Holy See has been anxious to shore up relations with Arab countries. **********The Pope plans to visit Lebanon in May, but there have been mounting worries about his safety since a bomb killed 11 people in a Maronite Christian Church near Beirut shortly after the Hebron slaughter. Vatican officials said there is no intention now to cancel the trip. **********Archbishop Tauran is in charge of the Vatican's relations with other states, in effect, foreign minister. **********Mr. Rabin's visit with the Pope was announced after the Hebron massacre brought peace talks to an abrupt halt. Vatican officials said the meeting had been requested by Mr. Rabin."

For I.B.M. this is a game of catch-up, because its sales of personal computers have fallen behind those of Compaq, Packard Bell and Apple. **********Mr. Finger works the 12-hour night shift, starting at 10 P.M. three or four nights a week, slipping off his loafers, leaning back in his chair with his keyboard on his lap, and playing cat's cradle with rubber bands as he talks soothingly into his headset. **********During his shift the ""lonely hearts"" call -- people who are up late with a frustrating problem they may have worked on all day, or who called early in the day and simply did not have time for extended cyberanalysis. **********At 11 one recent night a graduate student in Manhattan called. She had tried to update the software on her PS/2 model computer and had reduced the machine to a beeping, blinking hulk. ""I think my friend and I really screwed it up when we tried to do this Windows number,"" said the woman, Catherine M. Kassel, who had tried to install a more recent version of Windows so she could run programs that would allow her access to the Internet. But when she put in the newer version, her spreadsheet program quit working. So she tried to reinstall the older version. **********Ms. Kassel said she acquired the machine about five years ago, but Mr. Finger said he thought the model was older than that. He reached for a dusty manual that described her software and he gave precise, step-by-step instructions, but offered only a simple diagnosis: ""It's going crazy."" **********Mr. Finger and his colleagues -- three or four at night and during the day, a number that I.B.M., for competitive reasons, will not disclose -- are ostensibly solving computer problems. But their boss, Larry D. Deaton, director of customer fulfillment at the IBM Personal Computer Company, said that what they were really doing was selling, both individual computers and the company itself. **********The 8,000 to 10,000 calls on a typical day -- up from 2,000 at the beginning of 1992 -- are more than questions about how to make a computer do a specific task; they are I.B.M.'s link to its customers, he said. Computers may become as common a household or business appliance as dishwashers or telephones, but they will require replacement far more often, Mr. Deaton said. **********""We believe the lifetime value of a customer is not one PC but many PC's,"" he said. As the market runs out of first-time buyers, he said, ""the asset becomes who owns the relationship with those customers."" Pursuing Satisfaction **********At PC Magazine, which conducts an annual survey of customer satisfaction, Michael J. Miller, the editor, said: ""A number of hardware vendors have discovered they can use service and support as a way to distinguish themselves. The direct guys figured this out first, the Gateways and the Dells."" After that, companies like I.B.M. and Compaq that do not have many direct sales but work mostly through dealers, stopped referring questions back to the dealers, and jumped in themselves. **********A less-talked-about reason for having support operations is the difficulty of getting various computer components to work together. Hundreds of companies sell computers, modems, printers, sound cards and the like, and an untold number of software titles. **********At I.B.M. and some other companies, computers are shipped with modem software that lets the experts, after a few keystrokes by the owner, take control of the computer over a telephone line and, as the owner watches, rewrite the files. **********More often, experts dictate instructions to customers, but this has its pitfalls. Sometimes they tell a customer to enter a word or group of letters, a space and then another word, but the customer, rather than hitting the space bar, types ""space."" The classic novice is the one who sees the instruction on screen, ""Hit any key to continue,"" and searches in vain for a key marked ""any."" **********John R. McDougall, who teaches a three-hour ""anger diffusion"" session in the I.B.M. training course, preaches total accommodation to customers. Sometimes, he said, a customer will look at the letter in the upper left hand corner of the screen, usually a capital C, and a little angle-shaped character next to it, and ask, ""What's that thing called?"" **********The proper answer, Mr. McDougall said, is, ""Well, we call it a prompt -- but whatever you call it, we'll call it."" Mr. McDougall's trainees must also tactfully determine whether the customer is absolutely sure that the computer is plugged in. **********With more computers being sold directly by manufacturers, or by warehouse stores that stack cartons of computers in an aisle next to condiments and compressors, or by electronics retailers who scream ""LOWEST PRICES"" on everything from boom boxes to video cameras, consumers rely more and more on help from the manufacturer. **********At I.B.M., the world's largest computer company, customer support is complicated. The company, which says it invented the personal computer in 1981, still gets calls about the early dinosaurs, as well as queries on some evolutionary dead ends, like the PC Jr. Other callers have bought PC's at tag sales, or, worse, parts of PC's at tag sales. **********Not that other companies don't have problems. The chairman of the Dell Computer Corporation, Michael Dell, says that if a company builds a computer the wrong way, sells a customer the wrong computer or gives the wrong answer on the first call, ""All of your sins come back to haunt you."" **********I.B.M. has put support for some of its more arcane early products on a $2.95-a-minute ""900"" number. It also maintains a computer bulletin board, where thousands of users call in to retrieve stock answers to common questions, or to leave questions that I.B.M. technicians, or sometimes other users, will answer.  The Team Approach **********Starting late last year the company renovated its help line, dividing its staff into teams of specialists, some for the Think Pad, others for its Value Point personal computers, others for networks. Another team does nothing but check up on the other teams, by calling a sampling of the customers who sought help and asking whether they were satisfied. **********Late last year, I.B.M. began moving the help line from Atlanta to a sprawling building here that is adjacent to the direct-sales office and some assembly lines. The goal was to make better use of information from the calls. **********It worked, executives say. The battery door on the early Think Pads kept falling off, the help-line workers discovered, and that information was quickly transferred to the assembly line, where a $3.80 modification to each unit solved the problem. Another fix, even simpler, was to change the text of the error messages that the computer puts on the screen when something is wrong. The messages used to be just a number, which the user would then have to look up in a book that listed problems; now the messages say what the problem is. **********More often the questions do not result in product changes, but can cement a relationship with the company. Take, for example, Mr. Finger's half-hour cure of the PS/2 owned by Ms. Kassel, the graduate student at Columbia.  Easing Frustration **********Ms. Kassel wanted a new modem program, so she could use the Internet, but Windows 2.11, a program that controls basic functions, was too old to accept the modem program. So Ms. Kassel and a friend installed Windows 3.0, but then Ms. Kassel's spreadsheet program refused to run. So she tried to reinstall Windows 2.11, but erased some crucial files. **********Mr. Finger had her read him the configuration file, which he thought sounded a bit odd. He asked about her operating system, ""What version of DOS are you running?"" **********Version 4.0, she replied. **********DOS 4.0, now six years old, is a sort of Gerald Ford of operating systems, holding sway briefly and unobtrusively between two longer-lasting versions in the lengthy series of DOS programs. **********""I think I'd rather have all my teeth pulled than work on DOS four-oh,"" he said, jovially. But in about 20 minutes, he had the computer up and running again. **********In an interview later, Ms. Kassel said she had been considering a new computer, and while she had not decided what to buy, she had decided the next one would also be an I.B.M. **********""Everybody has clones, and they say, 'You don't want an I.B.M., that's ridiculous,' "" Ms. Kassel said. But, she added, ""their service put me over the edge."""

Without the charge, G.M., the world's largest auto maker, earned $1.6 billion. **********In the first three months of the year, G.M.'s revenues climbed 8.5 percent, to $37.5 billion. Stock Drops, Then Rebounds **********Immediately after G.M. announced its results, its stock slid as much as $2.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange in a frenzy of selling that may have been prompted by confusion over whether the recovering North American operations had performed as well as expected. G.M. shares recovered by midday and closed at $56.75, unchanged. **********The report showed that the North American operations lost $197 million, compared with a loss of $170 million a year earlier. But excluding the one-time accounting charge, the operations earned $511 million on rising sales. **********""The North American turnaround is genuine, and it's very, very good,"" said Wendy Beale Needham, the auto industry analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. **********Reflecting growing confidence at the company, journalists attending the earnings announcement at G.M. headquarters here were pointedly issued green badges, replacing the black badges issued with fourth-quarter earnings and the red ones of previous quarters. **********The profit margin for North American operations improved from eight-tenths of a percent a year earlier to 2.1 percent, before the accounting change. The margin, a measure of G.M.'s success in cutting costs, is still short of the 5 percent goal Mr. Smith has set, said G. Richard Wagoner, the executive vice president who is G.M.'s finance and purchasing chief. ""That's in the right direction, but on a long-term basis nowhere near where we want to go,"" he said. ""We are not at all satisfied with the profitability on our car lines."" **********A shift by buyers during the quarter away from luxury vehicles and toward smaller, less profitable cars like the Chevrolet Cavalier in the United States and the Opel Corsa in Europe also ate into profits, he said. **********But Ms. Needham said that growing margins were already generating a handsome return per vehicle. According to her calculations, the net profit per vehicle in North America, before interest or taxes, jumped from $149 in the fourth quarter of 1993 to $650 in the first quarter. A year ago, G.M. was losing $51 a vehicle, on average, in North America. Ms. Needham said the improvement stemmed from ""cost reduction in terms of material and head count."" Lower Rebates **********G.M. also reduced rebates to its customers and other financial incentives. Incentive costs per vehicle fell 16 percent from a year earlier, to $800. During the fourth quarter of 1993, incentive costs averaged $880. **********G.M.'s international operations contributed $425 million to the bottom line, a threefold increase from a year earlier. Mr. Wagoner attributed the jump in part to surging sales in South America. In Brazil, where auto sales are soaring as customers rush to showrooms to beat inflation, G.M. sales rose 25 percent for the quarter. **********""What continues to surprise me is just how strong the overseas business is,"" said Maryann Keller, an analyst for Furman Selz in New York. **********In the United States. G.M.'s car sales outperformed the industry in the first quarter. Its retail car sales increased nearly 19 percent, to 759,407, according to Ward's Automotive Reports. Its sales of light trucks -- including pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 21 percent, to 463,805. During the quarter, the car market as a whole was up 15.4 percent, and the truck market rose 22.8 percent."

Is Again Raising Prices Of Vehicles in Short Supply,COMPANY NEWS; G.M. Is Again Raising Prices Of Vehicles in Short Supply," **********The General Motors Corporation announced its second round of price increases in a week today by adding as much as $310 to the prices of another group of popular cars and trucks. **********As was the case with the G.M. models whose prices climbed last week, the vehicles included this time -- including the Chevrolet Camaro sports coupe and the GMC Jimmy compact sport utility vehicle -- are in high demand and short supply. **********All three domestic auto makers, as well as the Japanese manufacturers Honda, Nissan and Mazda, raised prices this spring as the recovery in the United States auto market showed signs of durability. While auto industry stock analysts said that the increases were not enough to affect the recovery, some worried that increases by domestic auto makers could undercut their efforts to draw customers away from the imports and regain market share. **********""It does indicate that the U.S. auto makers will be opportunistic,"" said David M. Garrity, an auto industry analyst for McDonald & Company, a securities firm in Jersey City. As prices rise on domestic models, he said, customers who were wavering in their commitment to Japanese-made vehicles could shake the temptation to return to domestic dealers. ""If they're going to continue to raise prices, there's less of an incentive for consumers to do that,"" he said. **********Some dealers said they were not worried about the price increases, which are scheduled to take effect next Monday. ""The imports have taken very significant price increases over the past few years, and they cost much more,"" said John Palermo, general sales manager at Capitol Chevrolet-Geo in Austin, Tex. **********The strong yen has forced Japanese auto makers to raise prices of some cars as much as $2,000 above their domestic competitors, auto industry analysts say. **********G.M. raised prices by $250 to $310 on its Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird sports coupes, and by $200 on its compact sport utility vehicles: the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, GMC Jimmy and Oldsmobile Bravada."

Its nine biological research institutes have long been considered among the finest in the world. Its molecular biologists, protein physiologists and biochemists have published thousands of articles in prestigious journals. **********What better place, then, for an ambitious American high school student to prepare that all-important entry for the Westinghouse Science Talent Search? Who could be a more perfect coach for an eager teen-ager than a world-renowned specialist in the field he wants to enter? **********""In America do you think you could find scientists of this caliber who would spend 12 hours a day working with high school kids on their projects?"" asked a wide-eyed Vinay Gupta, a 16-year-old who attends Half Hollow Hills High School East in Dix Hills, L. I. ""Do you think they'd even learn our names?"" Low Earning Power **********There are a couple of similar programs in the United States, but none that rely on the type of scientific firepower assembled here. And unlike the top researchers in Russia, leading scientists in the United States earn more than $150 a month -- so do the technicians who clean their test tubes. Famous American biologists do not need to learn how to fix old equipment when it breaks. They do not have to rely on municipal fields to grow vegetables to feed their families. They certainly do not need to tutor high school students to supplement their paltry incomes. **********But scientific research -- once the pampered pride of Soviet life -- has taken a particularly hard fall in the new Russia. Many of the scientists who could leave already have; others, working here and throughout the country's basic research centers, consider themselves lucky to keep the electricity on. **********So when teachers from Stuyvesant High School in New York suggested last year that some of the most gifted American students would love to spend a summer month with the Russian scientific elite (and would gladly pay for it in dollars), few people here thought twice about it. **********""Is this what I thought my life would come to?"" asked Viktor Popov, a biologist and for 23 years a reigning expert here in the field of cell biophysics. His salary of nearly $150 a month is three times the average at Pushchino. ""Of course not,"" he said. ""We live extremely difficult lives now. We have no money for equipment, for new journals, for computers. Every day it seems we are on the verge of the end. We don't have 5 percent of the funding we used to have. So yes, the students from America help keep us alive."" A Struggle to Achieve **********It is a bittersweet marriage: the raw youthful talent of the United States and the experienced, beleaguered mentors of Russia. Young people who have it all before them, and aging researchers who never dreamed they would have it so bad. **********Despite their lack of supplies, the grim direction their careers have taken, and their obvious doubts about the future, Russian scientists somehow still manage to turn out important research. Their peers in the United States acknowledge that they still understand as much about theory and the complexity of basic biological problems as anybody. But it is always a struggle. **********""Maybe these kids ought to know that a life in science isn't necessarily one awards ceremony after the next,"" said Mr. Popov. **********Sixteen American high school students are spending five weeks here this year. All applied to the Stuyvesant Center for International Education, which selected those it felt were most promising. Each is assigned to a leading researcher and works with that person all day, every day. The goal of the program, its leaders say, is to help these students develop a project for the Westinghouse Science contest, whose awards are usually announced in March. **********Each scientist who agreed to act as a tutor this summer will earn about $1,000 for the work. None seem bitter or resentful but none pretend they would be doing this if, say, they were tenured professors at Duke or Harvard, earning $80,000 or more a year for similar work. They are aware that their institutes are barely scraping by and they know that attention from the United States can help with funds for research. Mixed Feelings **********""These are remarkably talented youngsters, and as fewer Russian students enter the sciences I think they are the great hope for the future,"" said Oleg A. Kholodkov, a senior scientist in the Institute of Molecular Biology who is working with young Mr. Gupta on his paper, titled ""Cloning and Expression of Regulatory Tet Gene in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (H.I.V.)."" **********""It would be very hard not to be excited by their energy and achievement,"" he said. ""But it doesn't mean I wouldn't rather do my own work."" **********Their own work at the institutes here in the green hills two hours from Moscow has had to take a back seat this summer to the students they have agreed to teach. The students -- who live in graduate student dorms, which have no hot water -- each paid about $3,000 for the five-week program, which includes air fare and some limited sightseeing in St. Petersburg and Moscow. **********The Westinghouse contest is to young scientists what the Tchaikovsky music competition is to emerging musical prodigies: it defines talent and makes careers. **********Last year, the first in which students from the United States worked with professors from Pushchino, the collaboration helped produce one finalist, William Burke-White from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, and two semifinalists, Edward Shen of the Delbarton School in Morristown, N. J., and Brian Herz from Half Hollow Hills High School West in Dix Hills. Mr. Burke-White, whose paper was entitled ""Alternative Translational Initiation of the Maize Transcriptional Activator TnpA Yields Two DNA Binding Proteins,"" has returned to Pushchino for this summer as an aide. A Cultural Experience **********""I tell all these students practically every day that if they are expecting Stockholm to call with that Nobel Prize they are going to have some problems with this program,"" said John Lapolla, the boyish, feverishly energetic Stuyvesant biology teacher who acts as chaperon, lab guide and father confessor. ""These kids are learning amazing things at the hands of amazing people. But the cultural experience has to be at least as valuable. There are other programs that prep kids for Westinghouse. But who wants to be in Texas when you can be in Russia?"" **********Of course, Russia -- and the grueling 12 hours a day of lab work supplemented by lectures on everything from transcriptional analysis of DNA material to electrophoresis -- the migration of certain particles through a fluid or gel subjected to an electric field -- is not for everybody. The food is basic, and the living conditions are less than that. Even the laboratories leave much to be desired. Still, none of these young people seem to have been drawn by the quality of the research tools. **********""Well we might have some equipment that is better or newer than this at school,"" said Thomas Knox, a shy 17-year-old entering his senior year at Phillips Exeter Academy this fall. ""But big deal. These guys are the biggest of the big time. You know, none of our teachers are as experienced as them."""

Couples huddled over the white tablecloths. American and British oil workers polished off lamb chops. And the cream of Algerian society looked out over the whitewashed Mediterranean city they once called their own. **********But dining amid the ornately tiled walls, white marble floors and arabesque alabaster friezes no longer denotes arrival in the haute societe of Algeria. The meals served these days in the capital's most famous hotel are to the condemned. **********""It is a gilded prison,"" said a 40-year-old British oil worker. ""I go to the office or the hotel. I eat from the same menu every day. I drink in the same bar, and at night I go to the same room."" **********The 300-room El Djazair Hotel, built under French colonial rule in 1889 and originally named the St.  George, is one of the last refuges left to foreigners and the ruling elite, all of whom have been targeted for assassination by Islamic militants.  While the capital has three other luxury hotels, including a newly built Hilton on the way to the airport, all are cursed by either poor security or close proximity to volatile neighborhoods where the police and Islamic insurgents frequently engage in gun battles. 290 Foreigners Slain **********In the last five months, 29 foreigners have been killed by Islamic militants, who have warned all foreigners to leave Algeria. **********The violence that has claimed some 2,000 lives is the culmination of two years of fighting by clandestine Islamic groups. The insurgency began after the army's decision in 1992 to cancel parliamentary elections that would have given the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front control of the legislative body. **********Foreign schools and cultural centers have closed. Embassies have reduced their staff, and most foreign businesses -- with the exception of the oil companies, who have invested millions of dollars in Algeria -- have pulled out. Few people venture out after dark. **********The hotel, like all refuges of the elite, has become an armed camp. Guards are stationed at the gates leading up the steep drive. They stop all cars, check identification cards and open trunks. Visitors are frisked with metal detectors, and their handbags are inspected in the lobby. At 11 each night, half an hour before the curfew begins, the gates are bolted shut. **********These men protect another Algeria, one that is swiftly becoming an anachronism. **********Well-coiffured Algerian women, awash in perfume, saunter through the hotel in miniskirts that speak of Paris boutiques. Waiters obsequiously fill glasses with gin and whiskey.  And the hotel's satellite dish beams in 20 channels, including late-night erotic French movies and music videos.  Unlike the rest of Algeria, there is not a veil or a long beard in sight. **********""The hotel has become one of the final symbols of the privilege and the decadence of both the West and the old rulers,"" an Algerian reporter said. **********""Most Algerians are revolted by what it represents."" **********One recent morning, two hotel workers in white coats made their way down the second-floor corridor with a drill. They stopped in front of each room and noisily made a small hole in the wood to insert peepholes. **********Guests, they explained cheerily, could now see who was knocking at the door before opening it. **********Breakfast discussions often include complaints about the rattle of automatic fire that jolts people awake during the night. And one morning haggard diners sipped cafe au lait in large porcelain cups and tried to determine if the explosion that shook the hotel the previous evening had come from a bomb or a rocket-propelled grenade. **********""When they had a slight earthquake in December I thought a bomb had gone off in the lobby,"" a Japanese oil worker said. ""I jumped out of bed."" No Fixed Schedules **********The mundane details of daily life, like being stuck in traffic or getting gas, have become momentous, especially after a British oil worker was shot dead while filling up his car.  Company drivers, who arrive each morning at the hotel, alter their routes. No one has fixed daily schedules. Parties are considered too risky.  Company signs have been taken down. **********""You are always on edge,"" a Korean businessman said. ""You don't sleep well. You are suspicious."" **********Companies are having difficulty getting new workers to come to Algeria, and many of those who remain are hanging on until their contracts expire. One oil company now flies its foreign employees to Paris each weekend. **********""My contract runs out in February,"" said a British oil worker as he nursed a Coke in the bar. ""After that I will get out. I just hope I can hold out until then. No one will replace me."" **********While the shootings and attacks haunt every conversation, it is the boredom that eats away at most who remain. Life for many is a dreary round of work and confinement in the hotel. Trips outside the capital to drilling or exploration sites are taken warily and under guard. **********""There is nothing to do but eat and drink,"" a British businessman said.  ""We don't get exercise. We don't go out. Our only entertainment is the television. I just came back from Paris and it is a hard adjustment.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/business/wall-street-fund-managers-testing-the-rules.html,Susan Antilla,1994-01-23,,989,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Wall Street; Fund Managers Testing the Rules,Wall Street; Fund Managers Testing the Rules," **********MOST securities analysts get to have their cake and eat it too, making money at their day jobs of picking stocks for customers, and trading their personal portfolios on the side. So why not mutual fund portfolio managers? **********Why not, indeed. From the looks of things, a number of mutual fund managers have been as busy at trading their own portfolios as they've been at minding the money of the customers who pay them. It's a God-given right to trade, say proponents of the practice. They argue that trading for one's own account is a perk of the job that a fund had better permit, or risk losing hot money managers to a more permissive fund group down the street. **********But that perk might have to come under closer scrutiny if the mutual fund business, entrusted with $1.4 trillion of investor assets, wants to stretch out its already extended honeymoon with the public. Even though it has been touched by its own smattering of scandals, the fund industry has managed over the years to sell a Mr. Clean image of tightly regulated choirboys and choirgirls who've risen above the fray of insider trading and greedy dealmakers. **********Unstated in all the self-congratulations on honesty, though, was the old financial truism best summed up by Willie Sutton, the bank robber. You rob banks, he said, ""because that's where the money is."" **********Would-be fund raiders can't just hold up the bank, as it were, but they can help themselves through hidden fees, front running -- making a personal trade before the fund does -- and taking favors from people who do trading with the fund. It has recently come to light that the latter practice has occurred at several fund groups around the country, in the form of portfolio managers getting into private placements via the favors of stock promoters. **********Earlier this month, the Invesco Funds Group of Denver fired a fund manager, John Kaweske, after he allegedly violated Invesco's rules on portfolio managers' personal trading. Although Invesco said the violations were technical ones, it turned out that Mr. Kaweske had enjoyed entre into private offerings and public company directorships that raised anything-but-technical questions about just how kosher his behavior had been. **********Even as Mr. Kaweske was being fired, another mutual fund professional, Donald V. Dougherty, was resigning from Putnam Mutual funds in Boston to take a new spot at Essex Investment Management, the Boston-based outfit that runs President Clinton's money. Unlike Mr. Kaweske, however, Mr. Dougherty was leaving the firm after a four-month investigation that Putman says exonerated him. **********Mr. Dougherty, who had been a ""specialty growth"" analyst at Putnam, had come under question for buying private shares of Cardiac Sciences from a stock promoter -- a promoter who also advised him on stocks that might be fit for Putnam's public mutual funds. Even though he broke no written rules at Putnam, management there asked him to depart on a leave-with-pay basis in late September, after Putnam became alarmed over news reports about Rafi Khan, the stock promoter who worked with Mr. Dougherty and others at Putnam. **********By the time management determined that Mr. Dougherty had done nothing illegal, he was resigning. To some, the situation appeared quite unfair: An analyst suffered despite having followed his fund's rules. **********But are the rules enough? Stanley Sporkin, a United States District Court judge who was director of the division of enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1970's, doesn't think so. **********Rather than have mutual funds create codes of ethics that address potential conflicts that arise when portfolio managers trade in their own accounts, Mr. Sporkin would prefer to see no trading at all. ""They should put it in a blind trust,"" he said last week. ""If a person is getting paid well to manage money, that should be his job."" **********The trustees who make up the boards of directors of mutual fund companies are mulling over that and other possibilities, somewhat alarmed by the possibility that the public's trust could be undermined as more revelations about fund manager conflicts are made. John Winthrop, who serves on the boards of Pioneer Funds and Alliance Mutual Funds, said that codes of conduct are coming under more scrutiny by boards. **********Portfolio managers argue that when they own individual stocks that are also in the funds they manage, it's a benefit to their funds because of the extra research they put in, said Andrew Cox, a trustee of the Montgomergy Funds. But Mr. Cox added that it is no favor to investors if stocks in a manager's personal portfolio are getting more attention from the manager than other stocks in the fund. **********As for stocks that a portfolio manager owns personally but has not put in the mutual fund, there are still problems, Mr. Cox added. ""They're spending time analyzing stocks that aren't benefiting the fund,"" he said. ""They can all say, 'I do it at home after my kids are in bed,' but, well, give me a break."" **********To make real changes happen, though, fund trustees will have to incur the wrath of many a fund employee who is making a mint by trading in a personal account. A ban on personal trading was discussed at a trustees' meeting for Pioneer Funds earlier this month, said Mr. Winthrop, but it didn't fall on receptive ears. Indeed, in some quarters, all the questions being raised are being dismissed as much ado about nothing. **********""There has been a tremendous amount of reporting for one situation where a fund manager was fired because he didn't follow the code of conduct,"" said L. Erick Kanter of the Investment Company Institute. The firing of Mr. Kaweske shows ""the system works,"" he added. **********And, in terms of today's rules, he might be right. But that does not mean that those rules should not be reassessed."

In dozens of interviews with Palestinians this week in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, there was nearly universal condemnation of both the P.L.O. chairman and the peace accord he backs. **********""People have turned against not just Chairman Arafat, but anyone associated with the peace process,"" said Saeb Erakat, one of the chief Palestinian delegates to the talks with the Israelis, which have been suspended. ""We promised people that things would get better and instead we have witnessed one of the worst massacres in our history. When I marched with Palestinians last September they all said we should give the negotiations a chance. Now they say that chance is finished."" **********The antagonism comes at a time of extraordinarily high emotions among Palestinians, and it is not clear how long they will remain at that pitch. **********Pictures and posters of the grinning Palestinian leader are often defaced, not by the Israeli authorities, who have given up trying to control graffiti, but by Palestinians themselves. Residents regularly spit on the ground or curse when asked about him. **********Especially disturbing to Arafat loyalists is the defection of many members of the Fatah Hawks, the loosely knit military wing of Al Fatah, Mr. Arafat's faction. The Hawks are to form the backbone of the Palestinian police force after Israelis withdraw, and their defection could further aggravate the anarchy and violence of the occupied territories. **********Mr. Arafat's troubles have also proved politically advantageous to the Islamic militant organization Hamas, which opposes the peace accord. Support for Hamas is clearly on the rise, even within Mr. Arafat's faction. **********Israeli troops brokered an agreement with the Fatah Hawks last November that turned over some areas to the organization. Both sides have since refrained from attacking the other. A Straying of the Hawks **********But many Fatah Hawks are now ready to fight the Israelis again. Since the Hebron attack, gunmen from the Fatah Hawks and Hamas have paraded together through the rutted streets of Gaza, Hebron and Jericho. **********In one such display of solidarity, masked Fatah Hawks, many carrying automatic weapons, entered the street in Gaza with members of the Qassim Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. **********""We are all ready to renew attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers,"" said a leader of the Hawks, as he stood in a garbage-strewn alley among his men. ""We have given up on the peace process and we can't stand by while Israelis massacre our people. Arafat and his people in Tunis tried to make peace, but we are the ones who live here and must protect our people. We have no choice."" **********It is probably premature to write off Mr. Arafat, who has plenty of time to rebound before the Palestinian elections set for July but likely to be postponed. But if the peace talks remain stymied, and violence continues, it could strengthen the hand of Hamas. **********""The people here see nothing good from this agreement,"" said Sami Abu Samhadaneh, who recently resigned from the P.L.O. steering committee in the Gaza Strip. ""They are furious at Arafat for making concessions while the Israelis continue the occupation and the murder of Palestinians. They don't see him appointing the right people. They don't see improvements. Disillusionment is total."" **********In Hebron, now closed and under nearly constant curfew, Palestinian flags have been replaced by black flags of mourning. When a car entered the city with the Palestinian flag in the window, a crowd made the driver remove it. **********""That is Arafat's flag,"" said one young man derisively. Little Faith in Peace **********Jabrin Natsheh, whose brother was killed in the massacre, stood at a reception hall in Hebron receiving visitors who were expressing condolences. **********""The P.L.O. no longer represents us,"" he said. ""It does not ask us our opinion. It carries out talks while we live in a prison. I don't believe this peace settlement will ever happen."" **********Mr. Arafat suspended the talks after the massacre and called for international protection for the Palestinians and the disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers. He has called for the dismantling of ""provocative"" settlements set up in the heart of Palestinian cities. **********But even the measures demanded by the P.L.O., which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin appears unwilling to accept, may not be enough to bridge the gap between the aging Palestinian leaders and the bitter young men who throng the streets in Gaza and the West Bank. **********""There are deep divisions now between the leadership, which comes from an older generation that often lives outside the country, and the young people who sacrificed and carried out the uprising,"" said Ihab al-Ashkar, another former member of the P.L.O. steering committee in Gaza. ""The leadership has lost touch, and because it has lost touch it is losing control. Many mistakes have been made. Many people have been neglected."" **********The young men's frustration was fed by recent P.L.O. appointments that went to Arafat cronies. **********In the large yellow stucco house in Gaza City that is home to the local P.L.O. headquarters, officials played down the disenchantment. **********""These posters of Chairman Arafat were defaced by children,"" said Sobeh K. Masri, a P.L.O. official. ""Most people are still behind him."" But even Mr. Masri admitted Mr. Arafat could find himself deserted by some of his rank and file. **********""It may be impossible to stop our young men from resuming violent attacks against the settlers if the Israelis do not disarm them,"" said Mr. Masri, ""especially if the Israelis also continue to delay the withdrawal. There is only so much we can do."" **********In the sprawling market in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, vendors stood over wooden carts piled with green chili peppers, eggplants and tomatoes. In the crush of shoppers it was hard to find anyone who had good words for the P.L.O. chief. **********""Every young man now has a duty to get himself a gun and shoot Israelis,"" said Abu al-Abed, 40, a beefy man in an old green overcoat. ""We have had enough of Arafat's talk. What has it given us? More dead, more suffering and more occupation."""

The United States also objected to a ban on the ability of developing countries to trade hazardous materials among themselves. **********At first, Germany, Canada and Australia supported the United States in its reservations but they eventually went along with the total ban. **********Today's action bans sending hazardous wastes produced in any of the 24 Western industrialized countries that belong to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, except the United States, for final disposal in a nonmember country of that organization. It takes effect immediately. **********But exporting wastes for ""recycling or recovery"" from the 24 Western industrialized countries, which is believed to account for about 90 percent of all such waste sales, will only become illegal after Dec. 31, 1997. **********The agreement was reached at the end of a five-day meeting of industrialized and developing countries that have signed or ratified the so-called 1989 Basel Convention on toxic waste disposal. **********That treaty, which 64 countries have now ratified, originally only required Western industrialized countries to get advance consent from a developing or East European country's government before sending industrial waste there for disposal or treatment. **********The United States is the only member of the 24-member group of Western industralized countries that has not yet ratified the Basel Convention. **********The Clinton Administration has sent legislation to Congress to bring American waste disposal legislation into line with Basel Convention rules and permit ratification by effectively banning hazardous waste exports to countries other than Canada, which belongs to the group of Western industralized countries, and Mexico, which joins the organization next year. **********But it is unclear whether today's revision of the convention to include an outright ban on all waste sales outside the Western industrial world will make it easier or more difficult to obtain Congressional ratification. **********Today's agreement represents a victory for environmental groups and for many developing countries who have argued that much of the waste sent to the third world is disposed of dangerously or not properly recycled, thus creating a growing hazard to public health and increasing environmental pollution. **********The environmental organization Greenpeace called the agreement ""a striking victory for global environmental justice"" but said that America's ""credibility as an environmental leader had been diminished"" by its opposition to the ban."

Along the horizon from the Jordanian side and the Israeli side, I see only a desert. There is almost no life here. There is no water, no well and not a spring -- only minefields. Such were the relations between Israel and Jordan during the last 47 years, a desert; no one green leaf, no trees, not even a single flower. **********There comes a time when there is a need to be strong and to make courageous decisions to overcome the minefields, the drought, the barrenness between our two peoples. We have known many days of sorrow. You have known many days of grief. But bereavement unites us, as does bravery. And we honor those who sacrificed their lives. We both must draw on the springs of our great spiritual resources to forgive the anguish we caused to each other, to clear the minefields that divided us for so many years and to supplant it with fields of plenty. **********For nearly two generations, desolation pervaded the heart of our two peoples. The time has now come not merely to dream of a better future, but to realize it. Leaders should clear the path, should show the way. But the road itself must be paved by both peoples. I don't believe that we would have reached this great moment without the desire for peace in the hearts of both peoples, in the hearts of the soldiers and the intellectuals, in the hearts of the farmers and of the lorry drivers who drive to the Arabat highways in Jordan and Israel, in the hearts of teachers and of the little children. Both nations were determined that the great revolution in the Middle East would take place in their generation. Peace Between Peoples **********From this podium, I look around and I see the Arabat and I see you, our generation and the next. We are the ones who will transform this barren place into a fertile oasis. The drab browns and the dull grays will burst forth in vibrant greens. **********Your Majesty, peace between states is peace between peoples. It is an expression of trust and esteem. I have learned to know and admire the quiet and the smiling power with which you guard your nation and the courage with which you lead your people. It is not only -- it is not only our states that are making peace with each other today, not only our nations that are shaking hands in peace here in the Arabat. You and I, Your Majesty, are making peace here, our own peace, the peace of soldiers and the peace of friends. **********President Clinton, thank you for your tremendous support throughout the entire process, which was vital for the achievement of this final result. I would like to thank many others on the Israeli side, on the Jordanian side, that worked very hard, day and night, that we will be allowed to reach this great moment -- the foreign minister of Israel, the head of our team, Eliakim Rubinstein, Ephraim Levy and many others that no doubt contributed a lot to this great achievement. . . .  KING HUSSEIN **********Peace be upon you all. God's peace. The greeting with which Muslims and Arabs receive their guests, exchange amongst each other, the greeting that has been taken to every part of the world of our long and cherished history and past. **********It is with a sense of enormous pride, a sense of fulfillment that I stand here before you today -- together with President Clinton, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, President Weizman, and all our distinguished colleagues and friends. An unusual day. A day like no other in terms of the hopes, in terms of the promise, and in terms of the determination. God willing, and with God's blessing of us all to remember this day as long as we live and for future generations -- Jordanians, Israelis, Arabs, Palestinians -- all children of Abraham to remember it as the dawning of the new era of peace. Mutual respect between us all, tolerance, and the coming together of people, of generations to come beyond this time to build and achieve what is worthy of them. **********We will always cherish the memory and honor all those who have fallen over the years from amongst all of our peoples. I believe they are with us on this occasion and at this time, as we come together to insure -- God willing -- that there will be no more death, no more misery, no more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty of what each day might bring, as has been the case in the past. **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and I had the honor of signing the Washington Declaration with President Clinton -- our partner and our friend. And we took it upon us -- Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and myself -- to shepherd the process of negotiations to a successful conclusion. I believe that both of us share in this moment of achievement and pride and relief -- for, hopefully, we have contributed towards a better future of our peoples for all times to come. . . . **********This is peace with dignity. This is peace with commitment. This is our gift to our peoples and the generations to come. It will herald the change in the quality of life of people. It will not be simply a piece of paper ratified by those responsible, blessed by the world. It will be real, as we open our hearts and minds to each other, as we discover a human face to everything that has happened and to each other -- for all of us have suffered for far too long. . . . PRESIDENT CLINTON **********King Hussein, today in this arid place, you bring to full flower the memories of the man who taught you to seek peace, your grandfather, King Abdullah. When he was martyred four decades ago, he left you with a great burden and a great dream. He believed that one day on both sides of the river Jordan, Arab and Jew would live in peace. How bravely you have shouldered that burden and carried that dream. Now after so much danger and so much hardship, your majesty, your day has come. Truly you have fulfilled your grandfather's legacy. **********Prime Minister Rabin, you have spent a lifetime as a soldier, fighting first to establish your country and then, for so long, to defend it. For a lifetime you have fought with skill and tenacity and courage simply to achieve a secure and lasting peace for your people. Now you have given them the hope of life after the siege. In your own words, you have now given them the challenge to furnish the house of Israel and make it a home. As a general, you have won many battles through strength and courage, but now, through strength and courage, you command the army of peace and you have won the greatest victory of all. We salute you. **********As has been said before, this treaty is the product of many hands.  Crown Prince Hassan and Foreign Minister Peres know better than any of us that spring -- that peace does not spring full-grown. It requires cultivation; it requires patience and care. We salute their devotion and persistence and the wise and determined counsel of Secretary Christopher. We are in all their debt and we thank them. Heal the Wounds **********I say to the people of Israel and Jordan, now you must make this peace real. To turn no-man's land into everyman's home; to take down the barbed wire; to remove the deadly mines; to help the wounds of war to heal; open your borders, open your hearts. Peace is more than an agreement on paper, it is feeling, it is activity, it is devotion. **********The forces of terror will try to hold you back. Already they take deadly aim at the future of peace in their zeal to kill hope and keep hatred alive, they will deny all that peace can bring to your children. We cannot, we must not, we will not let them succeed. **********The United States stands with you.  Since President Truman first recognized Israel, we have wished for worked for comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors. On behalf of all Americans, including millions of Jewish and Arab- Americans for whom this day means so much, I thank you for trusting America to help you arrive at this moment. The American people are very proud of the opportunity that we have had. **********And now let the work of progress bear fruit. Here at the first of many crossing points to be opened, people from every corner of the earth will soon come to share in the wonders of your lands. There are resources to be found in the desert, minerals to be drawn from the sea, water to be separated from salt and used to fertilize the fields. Here, where slaves in ancient times were forced to take their chisels to the stone, the earth, as the Koran says, will stir and swell and bring forth life. The desert, as Isaiah prophesied, shall rejoice and blossom. **********Here, you people will drink water from the same well and savor together the fruit of the vine. As you seize this moment, be assured that you will redeem every life sacrificed along the long road that brought us to this day. You will take the hatred out of hearts and you will pass along to your children a peace for the generations. **********Your Majesty, Mr. Prime Minister, here in the great Rift Valley, you have bridged the tragic rift that separated your people for too long. Here in this region which is the home of not only both your faiths, but mine, I say blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the earth."

And, true, his radio persona is modeled on Dom DeLuise's hyperventilated watchdog reporter in the movie ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."" **********But none of that dampens Watchdog Bob's earnestness about the legal battle he is fighting -- an effort that appears likely to end with him in prison testing the limits of the First Amendment. Mr. Jankovics is one of those personalities who come along in journalism every now and again, who seem bent on trying to put their names on court decisions involving collisions of prosecutors and the press. **********The short version of his unusual story is that Federal prosecutors are investigating accusations of police wiretapping violations in this city 60 miles north of Manhattan. They want him to tell a grand jury the name of the person who played a tape for him. The tape, secretly recorded at the police station here, was of a confidential conversation between an arrested city official and his lawyer. **********The prosecutor, Steven M. Witzel, an assistant United States attorney, says the courts have been clear. ""Reporters should be treated like other citizens,"" he said, ""and must respond to questions put to them by a grand jury investigation."" **********Citing the First Amendment, Mr. Jankovics refused. He said ""whistle-blowers"" would no longer trust Watchdog Bob if he named his source. He feared losing a pipeline to exposes for his year-and-a-half-old weekly show on WKIP-AM, a talk-radio station and ABC affiliate here. **********First Amendment lawyers say the law is fairly well settled and is weighted heavily against Mr. Jankovics's position. But he says he is nevertheless fighting for journalists everywhere. ""If I were to be found guilty,"" he said with fervor, ""no reporter -- including '60 Minutes' or whoever -- would be protected and they would have to divulge their sources."" **********Mr. Jankovics was found in contempt by a Federal district judge and threatened with prison. He appealed to the Federal appeals court in New York. That court, one of the most influential in the country on news media issues, quickly dismissed his appeal on Friday. **********The case is now expected to return to the district court for sentencing, but Mr. Jankovics vowed Friday night to keep fighting. ""Apparently we're destined to go to the Supreme Court,"" he said. **********His case has been something of a sensation here for several months. But only now has the small community of national advocates for the press begun to take note. And what some of them have noted is that Mr. Jankovics could either become a hero or a scoundrel to reporters everywhere because of his stubborn insistence on taking his case as far as he can. **********""That could be good for the press, or it could be very bad for the press,"" depending on whether the Supreme Court even agrees to hear the case and whether it is sympathetic or hostile, said Jane E. Kirtley, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press in Washington. **********The legal problem is that the Supreme Court devastated the news media with a landmark ruling in 1972, Branzburg v. Hayes. The decision declared that reporters do not have an absolute privilege to refuse to answer grand jury questions when they have evidence of criminal wrongdoing. That has sometimes meant they must turn over the names of people to whom they had promised anonymity. **********State legislatures, including New York's, have enacted shield laws to create protections for reporters. But in recent years, a handful of reporters have been jailed for refusing to provide testimony sought by prosecutors. Lawyers for news organizations say reporters have been subpoenaed more than ever, especially in Federal courts, where state shield laws are often of no help. **********Against that backdrop, many lawyers for established news organizations have shied away from pursuing appeals when faced with grand jury subpoenas, preferring to avoid the risk that the courts might further limit reporters' protection. **********Also against that backdrop, Watchdog Bob arrived. Mr. Jankovics, who is 49, is something of an unusual journalist. He owns a big insurance agency in an old bank building downtown; he also owns real estate, pay telephones, vending machines and a nearby resort. He is also a partner in a private investigation firm. **********He says he has a long history of standing up to local officials and local business executives who are unethical or ""not quite up to snuff."" Until recently, he also ran a much-advertised travel agency and worked part time as a local police officer. But, as he says, that is another story. **********To people around here, Mr. Jankovics has long been seen as outspoken. ""He's a publicity hound,"" said Joseph H. Chiseri, the city manager. ""He likes to see his name."" **********In the fall of 1992, the ""morning man"" on WKIP, John Steffanci, heard that other local radio talk show hosts were developing investigative segments like the consumer-oriented reports on television news. **********Mr. Steffanci spoke to Mr. Jankovics, who was a big advertiser on the station for his travel and insurance businesses. Mr. Steffanci said Mr. Jankovics jumped at the chance by referring immediately to the ""Best Little Whorehouse"" character who hounded the legendary Chicken Ranch out of existence. The watchdog of the film was the kind of guy who insisted that peanut candy bars contain whole nuts, and not, in Mr. DeLuise's words, nut chips, half-nuts or nut bits. **********Mr. Steffanci said that when he brought up the idea of a local investigative report, Mr. Jankovics said: ""Did you ever see 'The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas?' I want to be that guy.""' **********Watchdog Bob was born. The station owner agreed to give him free advertising for his other businesses in exchange for his work. **********The program went on the air. Watchdog Bob asked whistle-blowers to call him. **********He told listeners about what he called consumer ""scams"" involving roofers and carpet installers. He also began getting secret information from city workers. ""We found things were not quite up to snuff with the political leadership of the city,"" the Watchdog said. **********And then, in the early morning hours last March 30, the city manager at the time, William Theysohn, was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving and given a speeding ticket. From the police station, the city manager called his lawyer, who also happened to be an alderman. Their conversation, the content of which has never been disclosed, was captured by a hidden police tape recording system. The charges against Mr. Theysohn were later dismissed, though he resigned and is now suing the city, saying his ability to earn a living has been impaired. **********The rest is history. By the time Watchdog Bob got to his insurance office the morning after the incident, it appears that two separate informants had provided him with the recording. **********He never used the tape on the air. But he never denied that he had it. And he says he will never tell who gave it to him. **********He said he is focused on his legal case, and feels that he is in good hands. His lawyer, Thomas P. Halley, is a former assistant corporation counsel for Poughkeepsie. But Mr. Halley also has a role of his own on the Watchdog Bob show. Mr. Halley is sometimes the co-host, a sort of junior Watchdog Bob. On the air, Watchdog Bob has a name for him. **********The lawyer is known as the Watch Puppy."

Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the National Economic Council and the chief negotiator. **********And when Morihiro Hosokawa, a young politician preaching change, became Prime Minister in August, the Clinton Administration grew even more confident that the old pattern of bitter disputes and meager results was a thing of the past. It was just a matter of hammering out the details with a like-minded Government, the Administration seemed to say. Talks Going Nowhere, U.S. Says **********Such buoyant expectations made the spectacle to which the Japanese were treated this week that much more telling. Sounding both angry and befuddled, senior Administration officials complained here that the follow-up talks to the basic agreement were going nowhere, even as Japan's surplus with the United States was rising. It was more than $50 billion in 1993. **********Discussions about getting Japan to buy more American automobiles, auto parts, medical and telecommunications equipment and insurance policies ""haven't moved an inch,"" said Jeffrey E. Garten, Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade. **********It has been a harsh lesson in the tenacity of Japan's bureaucracy, which manages the negotiations. It also points to the fundamental differences between the two economies, a gulf that warm feelings between two young leaders cannot paper over. **********President Clinton is to meet Mr. Hosokawa on Feb. 11 in Washington to sign the next phase of their trade deal. But the American negotiators say the two sides remain so far apart that they are still battling over the concepts rather than the details. Following Old Pattern **********Perhaps their most painful admission was that despite the new ""framework,"" the negotiations are following the old pattern of struggling down to the wire and concluding an ambiguous truce. Even the efforts by the American officials to apply pressure on the Japanese by going public with their grievances follow the old style. **********""We had thought this framework was different in several ways,"" lamented Joan E. Spero, Undersecretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs. ""We really saw this Government as moving toward the same kinds of goals as we were. We feel disappointed. We are back to the old formula."" **********Of the continuing debate over what methods to use to attack Japan's surpluses, Mr. Garten commented: ""We've been having a sterile, metaphysical debate. We want results."" **********The Administration describes its approach as results-oriented rather than focused purely on opening markets and letting the chips fall. **********The Japanese agreed that future trade agreements would use ""objective criteria"" like measurements of market share or import levels to guarantee that, one way or another, more American goods would be purchased and the surpluses would decline. At least, that is the American interpretation. Another Point of Frustration **********What the negotiators have discovered is that the ""results-oriented"" approach represents just one point on a continuum of trade frustration, no matter how much rapport President Clinton felt the two leaders shared. **********In their more candid moments, negotiators from both sides concede that some kind of agreement is still likely to be produced come Feb. 11, but they also agree that an accord is likely to retain much of the ambiguity that President Clinton had vowed was a thing of the past. **********At the core of the dispute is what American officials had regarded as the major innovation -- the agreement to set explicit goals for Japanese imports of various American products and services. The basic agreement refers to ""objective criteria"" to measure progress. It also commits Japan to take measures to bring about a ""highly significant"" reduction of its trade surplus ""over the medium term."" **********Even while the Americans were crowing about these inclusions last July, the Japanese were making it clear that, in their reading, they had certainly not agreed to set targets for future purchases of American-made goods. That approach has been rejected by the Japanese as a brutish attempt to interfere in the workings of the marketplace. **********""Our understanding is that that understanding is not included"" in the framework, said Sozaburo Okamatsu, the Deputy Minister for International Trade and Industry. He explained that the only ""objective criteria"" Japan would permit would be evaluations of past data to determine whether progress has been made, not to set goals for importing American goods. Kantor Blames Bureaucracy **********The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, wrote a letter last month to a Japanese newspaper in which he sought to blame the bureaucracy for the stalemate, thereby deflecting attention from Mr. Hosokawa. **********But that seems like wishful thinking. Mr. Hosokawa was reported in recent days to have told the heads of the country's most influential business lobbying groups that he would not budge on the question of import targets. **********The American side has responded by banning the word target from its vocabulary, arguing that its position is being distorted by the Japanese. **********The Japanese bureaucracy has gone further, though, arguing that Japan's economy is more open than that of the United States and that it is Washington that must open up. **********In a paper issued last week, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry created a sort of parallel universe, suggesting that the low market share for imported goods and the minuscule level of direct business investment by foreign companies in Japan were signs of how well the free market is operating here. **********Claiming the moral high ground, the Japanese Government has seized on Washington's insistence on setting import goals to declare that Japan is resisting not American imports but an attempt to thwart the free market. **********Such intransigence is standard in important negotiations, especially when billions of dollars in sales and perhaps even jobs are at stake. **********In fact, that is how President Clinton himself has characterized the new world order. Whether or not he has persuaded other Americans of this, his trade negotiators have learned that the Japanese Government never lost sight of that reality."

A huge fire of unknown origin in May engulfed thousands of acres of trees, farms and fruit orchards near here. **********Yet the latest satellite data suggest that when forests in most developing countries are diminishing, those in India are growing. The satellite data is from Landsat, which beams high-resolution pictures to this country's premier forest institute, the Forest Survey of India, which has been using such material since 1987. **********Among the reasons for the forest growth are better protection measures and the success of private plantations. The Government has encouraged the planting of quick-growing cash-crop trees and shrubs like eucalyptus in the plains. **********It is in the plains, where access to roads is easy, that the ecological destruction is worst. In the hills, timber rustlers would have difficulty transporting the trees because of the lack of roads. **********Here in the Garhwal hills, about 200 miles north of New Delhi, the lack of development works to the advantage of the foresters. **********About 20 years ago a conservation drive by villagers in the region had echoes across India and led to an official ban on cutting by private lumberers. Village women clung to trees to prevent the lumberers' axes from destroying their source of fuel and livelihood. **********But if environmental protection has seemed to work here, it has not in other Himalayan foothills. **********In Jammu and Kashmir State, northwest of here, an insurgency has led to large-scale deforestation in areas where the administration's grip is weak. Rebels are raising money through timber sales, officials say. **********In Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, hills are crisscrossed with ugly gashes where tree groves once stood. **********Across India the story is much the same. In the northeastern state of Assam, tribal rebels seeking a separate homeland have driven foresters out of a sanctuary. Forests have been destroyed and thousands of wild animals have been butchered. **********An area that has caused much worry among foresters is the remote Northeast, where as much as 26,458 acres of woods were cut in the last two years. **********The gains in these Garhwal hills have been quiet and solid, but population pressures on land and wood, both for fuel and building, continue. **********Environmentalists say the Government's entry into the sector in the 1980's, when state-run corporations took over the felling of timber, has fed corruption. They say that local forest officials are hand in glove with timber gangs and politicians, with each group taking a slice of the proceeds. **********Small staffs and a lack of essential equipment are other problems. **********Daulat Singh Panwar, the most senior of the handful of junior foresters in this area, said there were six forest guards to patrol some 37,000 acres of forest. They have no guns to ward off gangs, no equipment to battle forest fires and virtually no transport, he said."

Being Pressed To Change Its Mission,O.E.C.D. Being Pressed To Change Its Mission," **********Long respected as a low-profile ""think tank"" that monitors and forecasts the economic performance of the industrialized world, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is under pressure to broaden its horizons by opening its doors to more members and involving itself in shaping global economic policy. **********As a result, the organization's annual ministerial meeting, which usually only interests economists, has assumed special importance. At stake when it opens here Tuesday is whether the 25-nation organization can adjust to the changing global economy. **********In recent years, this economy has changed significantly, with the emergence of fast-growing Asian economies, the adoption of free market systems by the former Soviet bloc, the creation of a single European market and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And these changes now affect the O.E.C.D. **********The United States is leading the drive to modernize the Paris-based body, from the largely monitoring role it now fills to one carrying more influence with the making of global economic policy. In an address here on Wednesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to detail how the Clinton Administration believes the O.E.C.D. can become more relevant today. **********Its readiness to change will become apparent in the coming months in its choice of the organization's next Secretary General. The current office-holder, Jean-Claude Paye, who has already served two five-year terms, is seeking re-election, but the United States feels it is time for new blood. Postwar Roots **********Created in 1948 as the Organization for European Economic Cooperation to help enact the Marshall Plan, the O.E.C.D. assumed its present name and began taking in new non-European members in 1961. But after New Zealand joined in 1973, the ""rich man's club"" admitted no new member for the next 21 years. **********This year, after strong lobbying from the United States, Mexico became its 25th member. But some members like Portugal, Greece and Mexico have lower per-capita income than several Asian countries like South Korea, which now seek a place in the organization. **********The O.E.C.D. already considers Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to be ""partners in transition"" since, as democracies with market economies, they have met the basic conditions of membership. And, on Wednesday, the ""club"" will for the first time sign a cooperation agreement with Russia. **********Russia will be able to participate in some committees and benefit from the O.E.C.D.'s expertise through regional and country-specific reports. But the new link is also of symbolic importance. For some experts, it was Moscow's decision to withdraw from the Marshall Plan organization that set the stage for the cold war. **********""You could say that this agreement closes the final pages of the final chapter of the cold war,"" an American official said. ""Russia is not yet a major world economic player, but it won't be long before it is. We will now be able to see this frontier economy in action."" **********The United States also hopes to turn the O.E.C.D.'s attention toward the trade issues of the 1990's so that the many economists on its 1,900-member staff can support the work of the World Trade Organization, which will succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on Jan. 1. **********Washington's insistence that the new trade body debate the links between trade and the environment and between trade and labor rights has met strong opposition from many developing countries, notably in Asia, which fear moves toward nontariff protectionism. **********By encouraging the O.E.C.D. to study these and other trade-related issues, such as competition and investment, the United States and some European countries hope to develop what one American official called ""objective criteria"" that could influence the World Trade Organization. **********A more immediate problem facing the O.E.C.D. member countries is the unemployment that now affects 35 million of their residents. The problem of joblessness has dominated a series of recent summit meetings of the European Union and the Group of Seven industrialized nations without any solution emerging. **********In its own two-year study of the problem, the O.E.C.D. focused primarily on whether high unemployment is structural or cyclical and concluded that it has elements of both conditions. Its 50-page report, ""Growth and Employment,"" is to be presented to economic ministers meeting here on Tuesday. **********Many of its ideas seem likely to be addressed to the 12-nation European Union. Western Europe's current 11.2 percent unemployment rate, compared with 6 percent in the United States, is widely attributed to minimum wage laws and generous unemployment and other social benefits that inflate the cost of creating jobs. **********""It is much better to have people on a salary, perhaps not a very high one, than to have people unemployed,"" Mr. Paye said last week. **********But the key question this week is whether individual countries will agree to enact recommendations that are often fraught with political risks. And it is here that the O.E.C.D.'s future may be defined. ""We want it to address itself more to policy makers and political leaders than to bureaucrats,"" one American official said. **********For this reason, then, the United States believes a ""new"" O.E.C.D. needs a new leader. And it is backing the candidacy of Donald Johnston, a Canadian who served in Pierre Trudeau's Cabinet and is a former leader of Canada's Liberal Party. **********Washington hoped a decision would be made this week, but European governments have asked for more time. France is backing Mr. Paye, whose current term ends on Sept. 30; Britain has put forward the candidacy of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher, and Germany has proposed its former GATT negotiator, Lawrence Schomerus."

Unsexy though it may sound, they insist there is real money to be made from sweeping shop floors and cleaning airport toilets. **********Nonetheless, skepticism abounds. ""It is very difficult to make any sort of reasonable profit margin in traditional cleaning,"" a London analyst insisted. **********He said that although the company had grown at a 15 percent annual rate in recent years, to revenue of $2.1 billion last year, most of the growth has come through acquisitions. **********Even Waldemar Schmidt, the head of ISS's London- based European division, concedes the constant threat posed to the company by smaller firms trying to muscle in and clean up. **********""The industry is relatively new, and there are a lot of cowboys out there who tender at one-third of the highest bid,"" said Mr. Schmidt, who was recently designated to take over the head of ISS in two years. **********With 125,000 mostly part- time workers in 18 countries, the company is struggling to expand into higher-margin areas. Topping the list are hospitals and food manufacturers, whose standards of cleanliness, and willingness to pay for them, far exceed the norm. **********What is more, Mr. Schmidt sees his company increasingly using its big cleaning contracts as mere starting points. ""Our strategy is cleaning- led,"" he said. He explained that once it was on site, ISS sought other labor-intensive services it could add to its basic cleaning contract. **********A case in point is one of the company's largest single European contracts. It began four years ago with a deal to clean 11,000 staircases in a sprawling group of apartment blocks in Berlin. That contract has since grown to encompass everything from building maintenance to snow removal at a price of 20 million Deutsche marks ($13 million) a year. **********Similarly, ISS is planning to build on its $45 million-a- year airport cleaning business by branching into the supply and maintenance of luggage trolleys. In its hospitals division, the company has already moved into catering and portering. **********""It is easy to say that anyone can clean and that ISS faces no end of competition from one-man companies, but they have managed to demonstrate that they can produce growing earnings,"" said Frans Hoyer, an analyst for S.G. Warburg & Co. in Stockholm. **********The company that mops up the mess at, among others, the houses of Parliament in London and the Sears Tower in Chicago, has elevated cleaning to a science. For senior managers it even has created its own university. **********ISS says it hopes that such polishing will also help it overcome its biggest problem - staff turnover in an industry that averages 100 percent turnover a year. **********Mr. Schmidt credits his company's success in reducing annual turnover to 70 percent to a more rigorous screening of applicants and special training. The company also pays more than its peers and lets workers buy company stock after they have been on the job more than one year."

""It's hard for me to think the rest of the industry won't do well when microprocessors are this strong,"" he said. **********Advanced Micro's profit of $84.6 million, or 85 cents a share, for the first quarter, was up 38 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Many analysts had been expecting only marginally higher earnings. Revenues increased 26 percent, to $513.1 million from $407.4 million a year earlier. **********Shares of Advanced Micro fell 25 cents today, to $31, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of the Intel Corporation, its much larger direct competitor, closed at $67.25, also down 25 cents, in Nasdaq trading. Brisk Sales of 486 Clone **********Advanced Micro attributed its strong earnings to unexpectedly brisk sales of its AM486 chip, a clone of Intel's 486 microprocessor, which is at the heart of most of today's best-selling personal computers. **********But sales of the earlier generation 386 chip also remained strong, an indicator of healthy demand in developing countries for computers based on older technology, analysts said. The company also cited improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. **********""Improving yields and shorter cycle times enabled A.M.D. to increase unit volumes of AM486 microprocessors more rapidly than expected early in the quarter,"" W. J. Sanders 3d, Advanced Micro's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ""Increased production, combined with a richer product mix, resulted in a sharp increase in sales of AM486 devices.""  Last month, Advanced Micro won a jury verdict in its long-running litigation with Intel that appeared to remove the threat of a court order blocking sales of the AM486 chip. Intel said it would appeal. Earlier in the quarter, the Compaq Computer Corporation confirmed that it would use Advanced Micro chips, the largest personal computer maker yet to adopt them. 'They Are Right on Course' **********""Clearly they are right on course and feeling very strong,"" said Millard J. Phelps, an industry analyst with the brokerage firm Hambrecht & Quist. ""The average selling price on 486's held up much better than any of us thought."" Mr. Phelps said he had expected an average price of $165 a chip, and Advanced Micro was able to get $200. And he noted that faster versions of the chip would be available later this year and that the company would have additional manufacturing capacity in place. **********""They've got a pretty solid year this year,"" he said, ""and something like a 20 percent earnings growth next year, at our first cut."" **********Advanced Micro said it also had strong sales of communications chips and recovering sales of programmable logic chips. But these were offset by lower sales of programmable ""flash memory"" products at sharply reduced prices."

The new Young Investor Fund, sponsored by Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago, aims to make investing easy for children 10 years and older by providing them with a whole load of educational materials and by putting their money into companies that touch their lives, like Coca-Cola and Microsoft. **********The concept is good. It's important to learn about investing because ""maybe our parents don't know how to do it,"" said Julieanne Hersk, 10 1/2. Besides, ""it's easier to learn when you're young,"" said Dawn DelValle, 14. **********This fund may be a good starting point. But investing is tricky, and parents should expect to be very involved in the learning process, I discovered by conducting an informal exercise with six campers at the Berkeley Carroll Creative Arts Program in Brooklyn. **********The fund is the second phase of the Liberty Financial Young Investor Program, introduced by Stein Roe's parent company in 1993. It follows a nationwide survey of 1,389 students in grades 8 through 12, in which 55 percent of the respondents said they would like to learn about investing (26 percent would not, 19 percent were ""not sure""). Not surprisingly, the survey also found that older students were more interested. Nearly 90 percent of all students surveyed planned to attend college; 30 percent said they and their parents were saving money for that. **********Hence, the Young Investor Fund. ""We want to light up the interest and imagination of young investors and earn a superior return over time,"" said Kenneth W. Corba, manager of the fund. The no-load fund now has 1,029 young investors, with about half between 11 and 15 years old. **********A $2,500 investment in the new fund ($1,000 in custodial accounts) brings the young investor a welcome kit. There's a young investor certificate and a large wall poster for tracking investments in the fund -- the date shares are bought or sold, dollar amount of the sale, number of shares and so on. There is also an activity book, ""You and Your Money,"" with mazes and other instructional activities, which is geared to kids under 7. **********By far the most important tool is the ""Owners Manual for Young Investors."" It explains the difference between saving and investing, defines stocks and bonds and mutual funds and untangles ideas like diversification and dollar-cost averaging. **********The six campers (out of 174) who volunteered for the exercise to evaluate the fund materials ranged in age from 10 1/2 to 14, and their reactions to the manual varied. Brian Oppenheim, 10 1/2, said, ""I thought that stocks and bonds were clearly explained."" When quizzed on the difference between a stock and a bond, he wrote, ""With a bond, the company has to pay you back. With stocks, you don't get paid."" **********On the other hand, three 11-year-olds said they couldn't understand most of the materials. Dawn, the 14-year-old, said she found the Owners Manual easy to read and understand. **********The concepts are not easy -- none of the five younger students grasped what ""diversification"" meant, for example. And the writing in the manual seems generally too sophisticated -- even for young teen-agers. **********Stein Roe has also set up a young-investors hot line with a toll-free number. When Julieanne called, she was given a second number; they told her they would mail her some information. Ginger Norling, 11, said, ""They didn't answer my question, and they said they'd mail me something."" **********A portfolio game that came in the packet asks the new young investors to match companies like Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola with the products they make (software, soap, soft drinks); all the campers could do this. **********The first issue of the fund's quarterly newsletter, a colorful four-page publication called Dollar Digest, includes an article ""How to Make More Money,"" a company profile (P.& G.) and a ""savvy consumer"" quiz. In a group interview, the campers agreed with Pauline Celano, 11, who said the newsletter would be better for ""younger kids,"" and several said the materials encompassed too many age ranges. **********The ""Young Investor Fund Activity Guide"" cites 17 activities to help parents and children learn about investing, ranging from having a child calculate the cost of a college education to paying family bills together to offering a matching investment program. **********The fund's prospectus may be easier to read than some, but it's certainly not easy. The fund's basic description includes: ""The fund is designed for long-term investors who are willing to accept the investment risk and volatility of equity-type securities."" **********The fund's top five holdings are Motorola, Microsoft, P.& G., Coca-Cola and Carnival, the cruise ship operator. **********The fund's annual expenses are temporarily capped at 0.99 percent; otherwise, they would equal 1.65 percent, compared with 1.32 percent for the average growth fund. **********A less expensive way to have children start learning to invest is to call Stein Roe's hot line -- (800) 403-KIDS -- and ask for a free copy of Liberty Financial's 50-page ""Parent's Guide to Teaching Your Children About Investing."" **********Is the Young Investor Fund gimmicky?  Sure. Will it teach children about money? Yes, if they are motivated and parents put a lot of effort into it with them. But because it's brand new, the fund's investment performance is something you'll have to take a chance on."

The executives were asked to observe a news blackout on the first hours of action on the ground in Haiti, but they declined. They said the agreement to keep quiet about the start of the invasion was consistent with longstanding policy not to jeopardize American troops. **********The White House officials ""had about seven different things they wanted to discuss with us,"" said one senior network news executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We only agreed to keeping off the news that the planes were in the air. We were not going to be held to any other arbitrary limitations."" **********Mr. Venardos said that after Rita Braver, the White House correspondent for CBS, reported that there had been a breakthrough in the talks in Haiti at 8:14 Sunday night, the network asked the Pentagon whether it could show the pictures of the planes taking off in North Carolina, and it received permission. Before President Clinton's address at 9:30 P.M., CBS, CNN and ABC had all broadcast pictures of the planes leaving the runway. NBC had word that the planes had taken off but had no pictures. **********About 8:45 P.M. Sunday, the four network anchors were briefed on the terms of the agreement in a conference call with a senior White House official."

Indeed, in most countries, the elections are seen as more of a plebiscite on national governments than a gauge of attitudes toward Europe. **********Voting took place in Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland today and will be held elsewhere on Sunday, with 10,600 candidates from 97 parties vying for 567 seats, which are distributed among union members proportionally. All the resultsare to be announced on Sunday. **********Under the European Union Treaty, which took effect last November, the Parliament won new powers to veto some laws, to check the union's budget and to reject nominations to the 17-member commission. **********Nonetheless, the commission alone can initiate European legislation. And it was through his domination of the commission that Mr. Delors was able to lead Europe to a single regional market and, more recently, toward a single currency. Mr. Delors, a Socialist, is to step down on Dec. 31, and may run in France's presidential elections next April. **********Until this spring, the departing Dutch Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, seemed best placed to succeed Mr. Delors, while the European trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, had Britain's backing. **********But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany had reservations about Mr. Lubbers, with whom he had clashed in the past. Instead, he favored Mr. Dehaene and, during the last two weeks, the German leader has won both French and Spanish support for the Belgian's candidacy.  A Decision at Dinner **********The showdown is expected to take place over dinner in Corfu on the evening of June 24, with a decision on the commission post certain to be accompanied by a decision on whom the Europeans will back for other top posts in international organizations. **********If Britain goes along with Mr. Dehaene, for example, France may not support its own Jean-Claude Paye in his bid for re-election as secretary general of the O.E.C.D. And as part of a deal, the union may back Britain's candidate, Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer. **********But the United States and several non-European countries are promoting a Canadian official, Donald Johnston, for the O.E.C.D. post. And this could lead to cross-bargaining for the top job at the new World Trade Organization, with Europeans offering to back an American choice. **********Further complicating the debate, the top position at the Western European Union, a nine-nation defense group, will also come open soon. And although Manfred Worner of Germany was re-elected secretary general of NATO only last year, he is not well and bargaining about his successor has already begun."

Worseck, chief economist for A. G. Edwards & Sons, a brokerage house in St. Louis. ""The pattern shows broad growth,"" he added, typical of this point in the business cycle, when expansion is well established.  But others pointed to what they considered somewhat unnerving signs of a slowdown and faster inflation. **********More than half the March advance was accounted for by a huge jump in the length of the average factory workweek that more than offset a big decline in February caused by exceptionally harsh winter weather. At 42.2 hours, the workweek is at the highest level since World War II. **********The second-biggest contributor to the rise in the index was higher prices for materials especially sensitive to the level of business activity. This component, taken partly from the Labor Department's indexes of producer prices and partly from direct gauges of the spot market, has climbed four consecutive months, with each increase bigger than its predecessor.  That indicated more rapid inflation ahead, said Russell G. Redenbaugh of Kairos Inc., a financial management strategy concern in Philadelphia, a prospect that could help sustain a slackening economy as consumers buy in anticipation of still higher prices. Mr. Redenbaugh noted price increases announced this week by the Ford Motor Company. **********Seven other components also helped push the index higher, but none was decisive. They were a rise in building permits, lower first-time claims for unemployment benefits, a smaller decline in factory backlogs for durable goods, a rise in new factory orders, higher orders for plant and equipment, a rise in consumer expectations and an enlarged money supply. **********The only restraining forces were vendor performance -- a smaller proportion of companies reported slower deliveries from suppliers -- and stock prices, which declined by 1.6 percent in March as gauged by the Standard & Poor's Corporation's 500-stock index. **********One sign the economy may be slowing is that the leading index, though at a record high, rose by 1.1 percent in the first quarter, a bit less than its gain of 1.3 percent in the final three months of 1993. 'A Decent Clip' **********""We're still coasting at a decent clip,"" said Carl Palash of MCM Money Watch, a New York market advisory firm, ""but the foot's off the accelerator."" **********A wide variety of analysts continued to predict that the Federal Reserve would decide at its meeting on May 17 to raise short-term interest rates again, with some saying the case was bolstered by the report today. **********David Bostian, a New York economist, said the very long workweek and higher sensitive materials prices ""probably could be read as justification to support the hawkish view"" against inflation. Mr. Bostian constructs his own predictive index for the economy, which this month was unchanged. **********Companion Commerce Department indexes on coincident and lagging economic indicators were mixed in March. The coincident index, gauging current conditions, rose by four-tenths of 1 percent after a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in February and a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in January. **********The lagging index, composed of indicators that usually turn after the economy overall does, edged down by one-tenth of 1 percent in March after falling four-tenths of 1 percent in February and rising three-tenths of 1 percent in January. Ratio Cited **********The ratio of the coincident to the lagging index -- regarded by many as a better predictor than the leading index -- rose to 116.8 in March from 116.1 in February and 114.8 in January. **********Another private forecasting index, compiled by Safian Investment Research in White Plains, rose by nine-tenths of 1 percent in March, to 206.81. Of its 24 components, 14 rose and 10 fell. **********The index still points to business expansion, according to Kenneth Safian, but the severe winter has clouded projections. ""While there are no indications that a slowdown is developing,"" he said, ""some individual series and the changed monetary policy point to a reduced pace of growth later this year."""

Getting the Fish Out of Water"," **********WORRIED about their professional futures as the military industry was shrinking, two middle managers at Lockheed's Missiles and Space division in Austin, Tex., took a day off together in May 1993 to fish and find solace in the waters of nearby Lake Travis. **********Sitting on an abandoned pier, Jerry Jones and Dave Brundage discussed their concerns as their employer prepared for a series of layoffs. But their conversation soon gave way to the inadequacies of their bait nets. **********In the hot sun, shad minnows, which the men planned to use as bait to catch bass, practically boiled to the surface of the lake. But when Mr. Jones and Mr. Brundage dipped their aluminum- and wood-rimmed nets into the water, the minnows skittered away. **********""It was the same when we used our cast nets because the mesh was colored,"" Mr. Jones said, referring to nets that are thrown into the water and retrieved on a line. ""They could see it coming and swam out of the way. It was so frustrating. Here we had all this bait perfect for white and striped bass and no way to catch it."" **********After returning home empty-handed because of their inability to catch the bait fish, the two men became obsessed with developing a net that fish could not see. They bought a turkey at a local supermarket, removed the clear netting and attached the netting to an unstrung racquetball racquet. **********Back at Lake Travis, Mr. Brundage said he and his partner found that ""it worked better, but we decided that if we could make the whole thing clear, rim and all, we'd have the ultimate not only for catching bait but for landing fish, because they wouldn't be spooked by a net they couldn't see."" **********After months of tinkering with a variety of transparent materials in Mr. Brundage's garage, they came up with a net they called Clear Catch in the fall of 1993. It is made of one-eighth inch woven polypropylene, the same see-through substance that corsets turkeys and hams in grocers' freezers. The frame is clear polycarbonate tubing into which water flows freely through an opening at the juncture of the rim and the handle. **********""It takes on the color of the water,"" Mr. Jones said. ""Fish can't see it. They swim in and out like nothing is there."" **********Mr. Jones and Mr. Brundage received a patent for their clear net concept last month, 60 days after they were laid off by Lockheed. They have since founded the Clear Concepts Company, which has already declared profits from the sale of 1,000 Clear Catch nets, produced in Mr. Brundage's garage, to tackle stores in Austin. **********Mengo Industries, a private manufacturer of marine and pool supplies in Kenosha, Wis., took note of Mr. Jones and Mr. Brundage in July at the International Fishing Expo in Dallas, where Clear Concepts had a hastily assembled booth. The two companies hope to soon close a five-year, multimillion-dollar licensing agreement, under which Mengo will have the exclusive rights to manufacture the Clear Catch nets. **********""I've never seen anything like it in the industry,"" said Gerald Mengo, president of Mengo. ""And we expect it to bring very large sales in this market,"" though he declined to give sales projections. **********The nets will sell for $29.95 -- competitive with the price of conventional nets -- and will be in stores and sporting goods catalogues by January. The men also hope to develop other types of nets, including cast nets, using the transparent materials. **********""It's pretty amazing the good that can come out of a fishing trip,"" Mr. Jones said.KATE MURPHY"

Members of the National Alliance, which is led by neo-Fascists, run five ministries in the Italian Government. **********""We should explain to Jewish high finance that Fini is increasingly distant from a nostalgic right,"" Mr. Mastella added, in a reference to Gianfranco Fini, leader of the party on which the alliance is based. **********Mr. Mastella issued a formal apology after several newspapers reported today that he had made the remark. But the incident further undermined confidence in the Government of Mr. Berlusconi, a television and advertising magnate whose overwhelming victory in elections in March has rapidly been eclipsed by the spectacle of his lurching from one crisis to another. **********The lack of confidence in a Government that seems split on issues ranging from graft investigations to Mr. Berlusconi's holdings has been reflected most vividly on the financial markets, where dealers have pushed the lira far below the psychological barrier of 1,000 lire to the German mark. Today, the Italian currency hit a historic low of 1,030 lire to the mark before rising to 1,026 amid nervous selling on the Italian stock and Government bond markets. In New York, the lira closed at 1,026 to the mark. **********""Italians asked us to govern, not to fight,"" said Pierferdinando Casini, the leader of the Christian Democratic Center, a small faction of the former Christian Democrats that campaigned with Mr. Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. ""Instead, many of the partners are being irresponsible."" **********One of Mr. Berlusconi's principal coalition partners, Umberto Bossi, the leader of the separatist-minded Northern League, has clashed vigorously with the Prime Minister. **********The Prime Minister's standing has also been weakened by judicial investigations of allegations that executives from his Fininvest corporation bribed Government tax inspectors to secure favorable audits. Mr. Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, is awaiting trial on corruption charges. **********Mr. Berlusconi acknowledged in an interview published today that his company had paid bribes to tax officials but said they were ""ridiculously small."" He said he had ""no personal involvement"" in the affair and condemned the payment of bribes. **********In interviews tonight on Italian state and private television channels, some of which he owns, Mr. Berlusconi brushed aside the mood of crisis. **********Nonetheless, the infighting -- and the speculation about the Government's ability to survive its quarrels -- has obliterated the market enthusiasm that initially greeted Mr. Berlusconi's rise to political power from the ranks of the business elite."
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/22/business/dramatic-rise-and-a-nasty-fall.html,Sylvia With,1994-04-22,,1723,,The New York Times,Business Day,Biography,article,"Dramatic Rise, and a Nasty Fall","Dramatic Rise, and a Nasty Fall"," **********To all appearances, Joseph Jett's life was a Horatio Alger tale for the 1990's. Studious, from a small town in the Midwest and armed only with brains and drive, he pulled himself to the top of Wall Street, commanding a trading desk and earning $9 million in a single year. **********The fact that this dramatic rise was by an outsider in the clubby world of finance made his story even more of a classic tale of individual triumph. But this week the plot took a nasty twist. **********Mr. Jett was publicly stripped of his job as a managing director and head of the Government trading desk at Kidder, Peabody & Company. The firm's executives accused the 36-year-old trader, honored in January as Kidder's employee of the year in 1993, of executing an elaborate scheme to create $350 million in phantom profits, inflate his own bonus and conceal $100 million in losses. A Mystery Figure **********Despite his widely publicized fall from grace, Mr. Jett has remained a mystery figure. He has refused to comment and did not answer the doorbell at his loft in Manhattan's trendy TriBeCa district. **********However, interviews in recent days with colleagues, classmates and former teachers portray him as a loner who had soared to stardom with little experience and less supervision. **********""He's pretty isolated,"" a lawyer close to the case said. **********Few of these people were willing to allow their names to be used and few were willing to step forward in his defense. Even his father said he was waiting to hear from his son before discussing the allegations. **********""As soon as he tells us whatever he tells us, I'll have something to say,"" the elder Mr. Jett said in a telephone interview. **********While officials at Kidder and its parent, the General Electric Company, have sought to place all the blame for the reported scheme on Mr. Jett, executives at competing houses harshly criticized management controls at Kidder. Several longtime traders said Kidder bore moral responsibility for granting so much power to someone with so little experience. **********Since first disclosing the allegations earlier this week, Kidder officials have refused to answer detailed questions about the hiring and supervision of Mr. Jett. Those questions about Kidder's supervision took on a more compelling nature as former associates suggested that Mr. Jett had performed poorly in junior positions at two previous brokerage houses, Morgan Stanley & Company and CS First Boston Inc. **********The portrait that emerges of Mr. Jett in recent years contrasts sharply with the image of the young man who left a small suburb of Cleveland nearly two decades ago.  In Wickliffe, Ohio, where he grew up, Mr. Jett is still known by his first name, Orlando, and by his success. He is the local youth who made good, the one who got a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went on to the Harvard Business School and Wall Street. **********""Orlando is a high achiever,"" Grace Alexander, a longtime neighbor of the Jett family, said. ""Everybody is real proud of him."" **********The son of a local insurance business owner and a schoolteacher, Mr. Jett graduated near the top of his high school class and was a member of the school's academic team. Teachers and classmates remember him as soft-spoken and low-key, with an engaging manner. His teachers also remember him as someone who got along well with the other students at Wickliffe High School, where he was one of about 20 blacks in a graduating class of more than 400. **********""For me, he was an extremely good student, straight A's in my math classes,"" Alex Bezjak, the chairman of the mathematics department at the high school, said. **********At M.I.T., where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1980 and a master's degree in 1982, Mr. Jett left a similar impression. Deliberate and purposeful, he majored in chemical engineering and performed well enough to be accepted in the advanced master's degree program. **********""He just seemed like a very well-motivated and directed guy,"" Jefferson W. Tester, a professor of chemical engineering, said. **********It was at Harvard Business School, where he headed after three years at General Electric Plastics, that Mr. Jett's persona seemed to change. Although he dropped Orlando and began going by Joseph, his middle name, that was not the biggest change. **********Classmates at Harvard say they encountered an angry young man. According to several, who declined to allow the use of their names, Mr. Jett complained loudly and abrasively that he had been held back at G.E., that his talents had been ignored. **********""He seemed pretty impressive in the classroom,"" said Charles N. Hassen, another G.E. engineer who wound up in the same class at Harvard. ""I remember him as quite intelligent and outspoken."" **********While at Harvard, Mr. Jett immersed himself in body building and martial arts. He struck some of his classmates as theatrical, as well as strident about his conservative politics. He said he had been harassed by police and often lectured fellow black students about the necessity of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps, without help from others. Denied Degree **********Harvard said Mr. Jett fulfilled the requirements for an M.B.A. in 1987, but he was denied the degree. James Aysner, a Harvard spokesman, refused to say why Mr. Jett did not get his degree, but he did say the reason did not have anything to do with bad conduct. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Jett was hired after graduation as a junior trader in mortgage-backed securities by Morgan Stanley, the blue-chip investment house. Former colleagues, who refused to allow their names to be used, said Mr. Jett did not perform well and that he did not have the sophisticated arbitrage experience he claimed in later job interviews. **********A trader who sat near Mr. Jett at Morgan Stanley described him as ""a smart guy"" who spent a good part of the day reading Kung Fu comic books and Muscle magazine. **********In 1989, he was let go along with a number of other employees in a cutback. **********Mr. Jett was out of work for several months, but eventually landed a job at CS First Boston, another top-tier firm. A colleague there remembered him as someone who pushed himself hard, but insisted on operating on his own in a manner that sometimes disturbed his fellow employees. Reaction to Anger **********By this time, colleagues said, Mr. Jett was spending two hours a night working out at a gym. Sometimes when angered, as when someone said he could not do something he wanted to do, they said, he would become very still, then arch his back and let out a fearsome roar. **********According to former First Boston colleagues, who refused to allow their names to be used, other traders discovered that Mr. Jett sometimes concealed vital information from other traders, such as misstating the profitability of a deal. He lasted only 14 months at First Boston, leaving after having risen no higher than junior trader. **********Young traders often try several jobs before they find the right fit. For Mr. Jett, the third time appeared to be a charm. Following another period of unemployment, Mr. Jett was hired in July 1991 as a trader on the Government bond desk at Kidder, Peabody. **********After recovering from the insider-trading scandal of the 1980's, Kidder was the leader in mortgage-backed securities. In 1991, the firm was trying to diversify its profit stream by hiring aggressive young traders to help build its Government bond group and other operations. Unusual Freedom **********Mr. Jett thrived, getting the opportunity for individual initiative he had so long sought. In less than two years -- and without prior experience trading Government bonds -- he rose to chief of the Government trading desk and a managing director, supervising 16 traders and apparently operating with unusual freedom. **********Former colleagues at Morgan Stanley and First Boston, along with some of his Harvard classmates, said they were not surprised that Mr. Jett was hired at Kidder. But they said they were astonished that he was promoted so quickly to head of Government trading and managing director, responsibilities for which he seemed too inexperienced. **********In the loosely structured environment on Kidder's trading floor, Mr. Jett had the freedom to expose the firm's capital to risks at levels normally reserved for the most seasoned and trusted traders at other firms. **********To Kidder's managers, the returns seemed to justify their faith in Mr. Jett. His desk reported profits of hundreds of millions of dollars, earning Mr. Jett his $9 million bonus last year. **********But last Sunday, after an internal investigation and a session in which senior managers questioned Mr. Jett, his meteoric rise was over. Kidder executives claimed that the profits never existed. Instead, executives said, the trades were merely computer entries, possibly designed to cover up losses of $90 million to $100 million. **********Mr. Jett was immediately dismissed and six other employees, who have not been named, were suspended. On Wednesday, General Electric took a charge of $210 million, or 25 cents a share, to cover inflated profits at Kidder related to the fictitious trades. **********The long-term damages are unknown. A Kidder spokeswoman said yesterday that officials would not respond to further questions. Many financial experts say General Electric clearly has the capital and the cash flow to survive the losses, even if they were to grow. They also speculated that the full extent of losses remained uncertain. But Wall Street sources said the episode could erode Kidder's relationship with lenders and institutional customers. **********What seems clear, however, is that the actions blamed on a single young trader threaten to undermine Kidder's struggle to reinvigorate the firm and have raised new questions about its overall management. **********""As a manager, you have to be willing to look when you go from making no money to making a lot of money,"" said Lesley Daniels, who heads global risk management at Chemical Bank and ran trading desks at two other banks. ""You cannot just sit on your hands and hope that it's real."""

""I believe that today we are not simply naming Dallas as the headquarters of the Nafta Secretariat,"" said Representative John Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, at a local news conference. ""We are today announcing Dallas as the capital of North America."" Approval Expected Monday **********Technically, today's announcement only means that Dallas has President Clinton's support. But Representative Bryant said that approval by the labor secretaries and ministers of the three nations on Monday appeared to be a formality. **********Mr. Bryant, who announced his support for Nafta shortly before the vote, stopped short of confirming that he had sought the Administration's promise of the labor office for Dallas in return. But he noted, ""If you're asking for something as vigorously as you can, and they understand they need you before and after, you're highly likely to succeed."" **********Other points in Dallas's favor, Washington officials said, included an airport within four hours of Washington, Ottawa and Mexico City, an abundance of vacant office space and a friendly impression made when serving as host to 400 trade negotiators two years ago. **********Dallas, a hub for transportation and business services, has proclaimed itself the trade pact's major beneficiary in the region.

Go Figure.  At last we see what the financial markets wanted! It clearly wasn't the water-drip torture of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates a quarter point at a clip, as it did earlier this year, always hinting of more to come. But last week it moved decisively, not only raising the Federal funds rate by half a point, but also lifting the discount rate the same amount after leaving it unchanged for nearly two years, and banks quickly lifted prime rates, too. The markets loved this decisiveness, with the Dow industrials soaring 95 points in four days and long-bond yields falling. Perverse? Not really. If short-term rates reach a level the markets can live with, the thinking goes, then investors won't worry about long-term inflation. ""We have gotten the dark cloud of uncertainty from over our heads,"" said one economist. (If the winds change, of course, economists will be glad to come up with some seemingly opposite rationale.) **********He Who Steals My Trash . . .  Is nothing simple these days? We often hear of towns choking on more garbage than they can handle. But now towns are desperate to keep garbage -- and the courts won't let them. It works like this: a town builds a costly, bond-financed sorting and recycling center, pledging town garbage to keep it humming. But along comes someone who will haul trash away for less, and the equation falls apart. One town went to court to hang onto its old tires, broken toys and junk mail, but last week the Supreme Court turned it down, ruling that towns can't ""hoard a local resource."" So are fancy trash centers doomed? The Court offered one recourse: subsidize them to keep fees low. What's a civic-minded citizen to do now? Throw out even more stuff? Who Wants to Be No. 2 Anyway?  The winter's incessant ice, apparently, was the last straw: in January, the Census Bureau said last week, Texas edged past New York to become No. 2 in population (California's still safely No. 1; in 1970 it passed New York, which had ranked first since 1810). We knew this was coming, of course, as the nation steadily tilts south and west. But let's put one rumor to rest right now: the Brooklyn Bridge is not being dismantled and shipped to Dallas. Tinkering With Perfection  A good tomato is an elemental joy, a pure and elegant basic of nature. You tinker with it at your peril. But another force is equally basic: the unstoppable march of science. The two collided last week, and science won this round, as the F.D.A. approved the sale of tomatoes genetically altered to keep them firm and fresh. Critics abounded, mainly complaining that no labels are required on these tomatoes. ""Consumers have a right to know,"" one said. But a trade group representative insisted, ""It isn't something frightening or mysterious."" It is big business: the nation's fresh-tomato market is worth $3 billion or so annually, and Calgene, which developed the altered tomato, stands to get a sizable payoff. Warning Flag on Derivatives  Depending on whom you talk to, financial derivatives are either the greatest thing since take-out coffee or a loaded gun that will end civilization as we know it. For two years the General Accounting Office, which scouts things out for Congress, pondered the matter. And last week it came down squarely on the side of those who see danger, calling for broad new regulation of the companies that create and use these complex financial products. ""They identified a regulatory black hole,"" said Representative Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat, who had asked for the report. But a group of banks and brokerages fired back in a single voice that derivatives are ""a critically important risk-management tool."" Swindled? Here's the Tax Bill  It's bad enough to lose money in an investment scam, but the final insult would be if, when the smoke cleared, you owed back taxes too. That's what may face investors in something called City-Equity Group. Last week prosecutors charged that Gary Lefkowitz, head of City-Equity, had embezzled up to $130 million that was earmarked for low-income housing projects. Since low-income housing is one of last refuges of those seeking tax shelters, some investors may have claimed tax credits they weren't entitled to. And having just lost your shirt may be no excuse. INTERNATIONAL Just What Albania Needs?  Albania, where the average monthly wage is less than $30, was in the Stalinist dark ages until recently. By U.N. designation, it is the only ""least developed nation"" in Europe. So, naturally, what it needs is . . . Coke. And that's what it got last week, as Coca-Cola opened a $10 million bottling plant, adding Albania to the long list of countries where that all-American drink is made. (No, it's not everywhere; a few countries, like Libya, Iraq and Cuba, still ban it.) ""It may not be what they need the most,"" said one observer, but it is still an odd sort of ticket into the family of nations.  Trade Gap: It's Mostly Japan  Any talk of this nation's trade deficit quickly zeroes in on Japan, and last week's numbers clearly show why. Yes, the March deficit shrank as exports soared, but of the $7.5 billion deficit that remained, more than three-quarters of it -- $5.8 billion -- was with Japan. That, in fact, is the third-biggest monthly deficit ever with Japan. True, Japan is buying more from the United States, but our economy is so strong that we're buying even more from Japan. So once again America and Japan hit the negotiating table to see if Japan's doors could be pried open a bit wider, and there was talk of ""detailed, serious proposals."" The tune sounds familiar. COMPANIES The Abortion Pill Is Coming  Given the passions on both sides, no truce is imminent in the abortion war. But at least some battlefields may now change. Last week, under pressure from the Clinton Administration, Roussel Uclaf, the French maker of the abortion pill RU-486, turned over the patent rights and technology to a New York group, the Population Council, which will conduct tests, find a manufacturer and try to get it to American women by 1996. So now abortion clinics, easy protest targets, can be replaced by scattered doctors' offices. The manufacturer will certainly be a small one; no large drug maker would open itself to boycotts. Abortion-rights leaders were elated, seeing an end to the ""tyranny of anti-choice extremists,"" while one abortion foe called the pill a ""human pesticide."" The war goes on. Is That the TV Ringing?  It's enough to make a technophobe weep. First came the idea of phone companies offering cable programming. Then last week regulators opened the way for a Time Warner cable system to compete for local phone service in Rochester. And don't worry: you can still call all your friends (and telemarketers can still call you). Part of the deal is that rivals can connect to the existing network. What does Rochester Telephone get out of it? More freedom to retain profits earned through efficiency. And the consumer? Lower rates, probably, but perhaps higher confusion. Still Betting on Cable  Bell Atlantic isn't letting the collapse of its linkup with T.C.I. keep it from dreaming of cable television's possibilities. That was clear last week when it chose AT&T and General Instrument to build an advanced video and data network to bring goodies like interactive television and movies on demand to 8.5 million mid-Atlantic homes. So there's old, established AT&T at the center of this high-tech onslaught. It regularly battles local phone companies, but it has made similar deals with such companies to build networks in Connecticut and California. This data highway clearly makes for interesting bedfellows.  As the Haft Family Turns  The Haft family has performed a worthy service by bringing a soap-opera tingle to the business pages. Herbert Haft, the patriarch at 73, ousts his son Robert from the Dart Group board and replaces him with his other son, Ronald. Herbert's wife, Gloria, sides with Robert, and she too is history. She seeks a legal separation. The lawsuits fly. But last week the Hafts settled, and while no specifics were disclosed, Mr. Haft and Ronald seem to have bought out Mrs. Haft and Robert. Oh, well, there may be some ""Dallas"" reruns around."

The deceased lucky fellow is Caleb Quine, a fictional Nathan Hale-type who may have been done in by the British during the American Revolution and who is currently starring in his own novel in the pages of The Courant. **********Three times a week, Mr. Quine and a cast of Connecticut characters that includes an evil businessman, a group of plotting C.I.A. retirees and a love-struck duck (don't ask) are trying to revive a newspaper tradition that flourished in the 19th century: the serialized novel. **********All of this is the quirky creation of Colin McEnroe, a Courant writer, who is pounding out Mr. Quine's tale in the best newspaper tradition: on deadline, which, during a brief break from writing in the newsroom here, the author described as living with perpetual ""gnawing fear."" **********Mr. McEnroe, whose most recent Courant assignment was humor columnist, is supposed to be working on next week's Caleb Quine installments as you read this. He has already weaved into his fictional world things that are happening out here in the real world. If it snows out here soon, he said, it is likely to snow in there, too. **********Being just about three episodes ahead of his readers does bring certain worries with it, the deadline novelist said. What would happen, he was asked, if the writer should fall ill? ""A good flu,"" he admitted thoughtfully, ""can cause a lot of problems."" **********But after mulling the question, he came up with a solution that is rarely available to ordinary newspaper writers. ""Maybe I'll give all the characters the flu,"" he said brightly. **********Mr. McEnroe came up with the idea for ""The Resurrection of Caleb Quine,"" a six-month project that began last month. But the editor of The Courant, Michael E. Waller, said it fitted in with efforts at The Courant and many other dailies to offer readers unexpected things to rekindle flagging interest in newspapers. **********Across the country, newspaper editors are trying all sorts of offerings, including new sections aimed at young people, ""interactive"" coverage that lets readers register their opinions electronically and planned adventures by reporters that are then described to readers. **********In the 1970's, The San Francisco Chronicle drew attention with ""Tales of the City,"" a series of columns by Armistead Maupin about a group of fictional characters. This spring, New York Newsday serialized ""Streets of Fire"" a novel by Soledad Santiago, a novelist. **********Thus, Mr. Waller said, when Mr. McEnroe started talking about his idea for a serialized novel, editors were receptive. ""It fit in with something we've been trying to experiment with: new forms of content that appeal to readers, with the idea that newspapers can be boring as hell,"" Mr. Waller said. **********After 18 years in the newspaper business, the 40-year-old Mr. McEnroe suggested that he agreed with his boss' concern. Would a fictional story help address the boredom problem? **********Mr. McEnroe said he was especially interested because The Courant's audio-text telephone system allows readers to call in to get recorded story updates if they miss the printed version. And readers can participate by offering story suggestions and criticism via voice mail. **********Each of the novel's chapters in the newspaper is accompanied by instructions for readers to call in. Mr. McEnroe admitted that some of his worst moments on the novel-writing beat have involved this interactivity. **********There were, for example, a few too many people who left messages after the first few chapters suggesting he return to column writing immediately, he said. **********Mr. McEnroe said he had plenty of experience dealing with people who have unpleasant assessments of his worth. He moonlights as a radio talk-show host on WTIC-AM in Hartford, and he says this experience has hardened him. **********His daily show is broadcast just before Rush Limbaugh's. That scheduling coincidence may draw particularly vociferous critics because Mr. McEnroe, a real-life Yale graduate and self-described bleeding heart, is prone to refer to himself on the air as a ""wiseacre, pansy-cake, liberal-college-punk host."" **********Still, Mr. McEnroe said, some of the novel-reading callers to the paper have seemed unnecessarily cruel. As evidence, he allowed a visitor to listen to the Caleb Quine line. **********But, if truth be told, the recorded messages there appeared to include more suggestions about the story than nasty criticisms. A woman in Suffield raised a good point about why people in the novel had such strong feelings about one character. Another caller encouragingly urged: ""Let's get a good story in there. You're capable of it, Colin."" **********As Mr. McEnroe put it before he went back to Caleb Quine's world, a deadline novelist is subject to more instant criticism than, say, John Updike. Mr. Updike, Mr. McEnroe suggested, may never have had the character-building experience of taking a call while working on chapter nine from a disgruntled reader of chapter six who suggests that the author does not know how to write and should go open a Burger King. **********Mr. McEnroe declared himself satisfied with the experiment. ""I can't even figure out how people write novels the other way,"" he said. ""What? You go in a room and write and write and write and nobody sees it until you're done?"""

But with Serbia's political opposition in disarray, the army appears to have become the single strongest source of dissent to President Milosevic's policies. **********In part, this dissent reflects widespread dismay among officers at Mr. Milosevic's abrupt abandonment of the Bosnian Serbs three months ago after they refused to accept an international peace agreement. Although the Yugoslav Army formally left Bosnia in May 1992, its logistical and sometimes direct support was long crucial to the Bosnian Serb forces, whose cause was espoused by many Serbian officers. **********""Among officers with family or relatives in Bosnia, there is a feeling that Milosevic has committed an act of gross betrayal,"" said one army member who insisted on anonymity. ""Among officers with no family there, feelings do not run so high. This causes divisions and awkwardness. Overall there is a feeling of bitterness."" **********Apparently aware of this, Mr. Milosevic made a rare public appearance this month at army exercises in Zrenjanin, 40 miles north of Belgrade. His presence suggested a man trying to mend fences with an institution he has tended to ignore. **********Miroslav Lazanski, a journalist with close ties to the army, said: ""Probably nobody in the Yugoslav Army is personally happy with President Milosevic's blockade of the Bosnian Serbs. But the fact is the army must obey, and many officers are more angry about the economic situation of the armed forces than about Bosnia."" **********Some officers have publicly warned that the unsatisfactory wages carry risks, while others have drawn pointed comparisons with the more favorable treatment of the police, an institution the President has armed and cosseted as an apparent counterweight to the army. **********A recent army statement said, ""The problems connected with the financing of the army have become chronic and, in the future, may be the cause of certain strictly individual actions."" **********What such actions might be was not specified, but the statement looked like a thinly veiled warning that disobedience or insurrections were possible if pay did not improve. **********The army declined a request for an interview. But one army employee with a master's degree in psychology said she was earning 350 dinars a month, or about $230, compared with more than $1,000 a month at the beginning of the Bosnian war. Junior officers also earn about $230 a month, she said, while a colonel probably earns about $550. **********In an article titled ""Honorable Poverty"" in the army magazine Vojska, Col. Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, an army spokesman, speculated recently that low pay could continue because ""various interests are colliding and the realization of some ambitions requires a poorly placed army."" **********It was a typically veiled statement from an institution intensely wary of direct criticism of President Milosevic. But the editor of Vojska was more direct in August, noting that Serbian police salaries represented an annual budget of $238.6 million, while the budget for army pay and allowances was $147.7 million. **********The editor, Milorod Patnelic, was promptly dismissed. But the growth in the size of the Serbian police force, its pay and its weapons has certainly not been lost on the army. **********""The army is very demoralized,"" one senior Western diplomat said. ""It is underpaid and overshadowed by the enormous power placed in the police by Milosevic. Indeed, one of the reasons the army is probably in no position to express its disgruntlement is that some of the police are better armed."" **********Mr. Lazanski, the army expert, said the strengthening of the police had been undertaken partly to insure that any uprising by the Albanian ethnic majority in the southern province of Kosovo could be quashed by the Serbian police, without having to take the politically delicate step of bringing in the army. **********But it also appears clear that President Milosevic, with typical caution, has built a system in which his own power is guaranteed by more than one armed force. **********The rancor of the army has been reported to be growing for some time. Its withdrawal, amid bloodshed, from Slovenia, then Croatia and finally Bosnia was seen by many officers as an ignominious abandonment of the Yugoslav idea. How exactly this took place is still the object of debate, as an army that numbered 240,000 before Yugoslavia's disintegration and now has just 100,000 men under arms assesses its future. **********More than 100 generals have been dismissed or retired in the last two years in purges of non-Serbs, Communists nostalgic for the Yugoslav idea and those judged to be too zealously tied to the nationalist goal of a ""Greater Serbia"" embracing parts of Bosnia and Croatia. **********Amid all this change, the position of the current chief of the general staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, remains unclear. General Perisic was in Bosnia at the beginning of the war there in April 1992 and is said to have strong feelings about backing the Bosnian Serbs in the conflict. But persistent rumors of his resignation in recent weeks have been denied by the army. **********""There's a feeling that we do not know who is in control,"" a member of the army said."

Buffett, get his financial insights? From his dog, for one. Mostly friendly, the animal shows a rare ferocity if someone pulls an item from its mouth. This ""take-away syndrome"" arises in investors, too -- as a costly resistance to selling at a loss, Mr. Munger says. **********Mr. Munger, vice chairman of Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, is a student of such foibles. ""The mind has certain standard inanities,"" he said, and investor patterns prove the point. **********True, perhaps, but isn't such talk suited to psychiatry, not portfolios? No, say financial experts who gathered recently to discuss the topic at a meeting co-sponsored by the Cambridge, Mass., Center for Behavioral Studies. Know the enemy, they say, and you can outflank it. **********""Closing the barn door after the horse is gone,"" or taking action too late to matter, is one psychological peril, said Richard Zeckhauser, a Harvard economist in attendance. While many investors sold stocks after the 1987 crash from fear of further losses, others had more emotional reasons -- to pretend to themselves they foresaw the crash, or to remove evidence they did not. Either way, the reflex was costly. **********Investor inaction can be costly, too. Mr. Zeckhauser has studied the tendency to do today exactly what one did yesterday, or the status quo bias, in the T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. pension fund from 1981 through 1986. **********Under the rules then, fund participants allocated contributions between mostly fixed-income investments (T.I.A.A.) and mostly equity ones (C.R.E.F.). Despite large variations in those investments' returns, however, collective allocations were nearly unaltered during the six years. The portion of investors with 50 percent in T.I.A.A., for instance, held steady at 22 to 24 percent. **********These tendencies, their students say, are solid science, drawn from experts like Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner and backed by hard numbers. Take the ""loss aversion"" of Mr. Munger's dog. ""Experiments prove,"" Mr. Munger said, ""that people hate losing a dollar about twice as much as they like gaining one."" **********This dislike, said Drazen Prelec of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is why investors hold losing stocks. Selling a loser, he said, ""is like pulling off a Band-Aid."" His tip: Fool yourself by pairing a losing sale with a winning one, for a net gain. **********Conversely, people tend to be too flip with profits. ""Gamblers often put winnings in a separate pocket and bet them more riskily, even though that makes no sense,"" said Richard Thaler, a Cornell economist. Similarly, he said, ""some pension funds that have made great gains invest more in stocks than do funds without such gains."" **********""Mental accounting"" is the term for this placement of fungible funds into different ledgers. And it is powerful, Mr. Prelec said. ""If you wreck an unpaid-for car, don't you feel worse than if it was paid for? Even though the cost is the same?"" **********For Mr. Munger, a very insidious habit is ""to get so hooked by an idea that you ignore disconforming evidence."" The bullish, for instance, may suppress bearish news. **********For this pitfall, Darwin offers some help. ""He forced himself to be objective by looking at conflicting evidence extra hard,"" Mr. Munger said. ""Investors should, too."" **********The Darwinian exercise can overcome another problem. Imagine three buckets of water: one cold, one hot and one at room temperature, Mr. Munger said. If a person puts a hand in the cold and hot containers, and then plunges both in the third bucket, the ""cold"" hand will sense the water to be colder and the ""hot"" hand will feel it as hotter. **********In the same way, people habitually form frames of reference, which ""greatly influence their market perceptions,"" Mr. Munger said. A standard ploy of real estate brokers is to show a client a few very overpriced houses, and then show the less over-priced places they hope to sell. **********And, he added, investors overreact to quick changes and underreact to slow ones. ""A friend told me,"" he said, ""that if you put a frog in hot water he'll jump out immediately, but if you put him in and heat the water gradually, he'll stay until he dies. **********""I have no idea if this is true of frogs. But it's true of people."" **********To quiet all these nettlesome reflexes, know where your impressions come from, Mr. Munger advised, and rely only on germane data. Rather than be swayed by the costly houses, the home buyer should get house-sales reports. To avoid the frog's fate, dwell on the long term, not daily ups and downs. ""Keep a log of your aims,"" Mr. Prelec said. **********More broadly, ""Investors can train themselves out of these tendencies,"" Mr. Munger said. As for those who dismiss the subject as too fuzzy, he cites a weighty authority. ""As Buffett says, in investing it's not the learning. It's the unlearning."""

For whites, the increase was 17.1 percent. **********Loan applications were denied less often last year than in 1992 for all ethnic groups, the council said. Blacks remained twice as likely as whites to be denied home loans, and Hispanics were one and a half times as likely. But the gap narrowed slightly in each case. **********Even when income differences were taken into account, blacks and Hispanics remained substantially more likely than whites to be denied loans, the council said.

Puts Electric Car to Test","Expecting a Fizzle, G.M. Puts Electric Car to Test"," **********General Motors is preparing to put its electric vehicle act on the road, and planning for a flop. **********With pride and pessimism, the company, the furthest along of the Big Three in designing a mass-market electric car, says that in the face of a California law that requires that 2 percent of new cars be ""zero emission"" vehicles beginning in late 1997, it has done its best but that the vehicle has come up short. It will cost too much and will not go very far between lengthy visits to a charging station. **********Now it hopes that lawmakers and regulators will agree with it and postpone or scrap the deadline. **********Hoping to prove its point, starting in April the nation's No. 1 auto maker will roll out 50 electric cars, zippy two-seater models called the Impact, on two-week loans to 1,000 households around the country. **********G.M. says its goal is to study customer reaction. But to the horror of regulators and other electric-car promoters, G.M. appears to be counting on the test to demonstrate that nobody really wants a car that will cost considerably more than a comparable gasoline-powered vehicle and will go only about 100 miles before it needs to be plugged in for several hours. **********""The Impact has pushed the horizon,"" said Dennis Minano, the G.M. vice president for energy and environment, in an interview in his office here. But the last few years have taught his company to stay close to the customer, he added, and the main question is, ""Is it what our customer wants?"" **********G.M., along with Ford and Chrysler, does not come out and say flatly that electric cars are impossible, only that current battery technology will not allow the production of a desirable car at a desirable price. Robert J. Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, put it another way. ""The question is whether the market is ready for the product,"" he said. At the Detroit Auto Show this month, Mr. Eaton said, ""If the law is there, we'll meet it."" But he added, ""At this point in time, nobody can forecast that we can make it.""  The problem with electric cars is that today's battery technology will not permit a vehicle with the characteristics that people take for granted, Detroit says. Storing enough energy to travel 300 miles or so -- a gas tank's worth -- would require so many pounds of batteries that the car could not move at all. A Question of Price **********How much a consumer would pay for a General Motors Impact is not clear, and the company will not talk about price. In a questionnaire distributed to people who applied to test-drive the car, G.M. asked if they would be willing to pay amounts ranging from $16,000 to $22,000. (G.M. has not disclosed the survey results.) **********Despite G.M.'s qualms, initial interest in taking the Impact for a buzz has been overwhelming. The loaner program is being run through electric utilities, which put fliers into their bills late last year asking for volunteers. In Los Angeles, G.M. expected 4,000 responses and received 9,300; in New York, the company expected fewer than 5,000 but got 14,000 and stopped recruiting a month earlier than planned. **********""But just because we've got all these calls does not necessarily mean that they're all buyers,"" said Sean P. McNamara, manager of market planning for electric vehicles at G.M. **********To be selected, volunteers must have a carport or garage where the local electric company can install a charging unit that delivers large amounts of current. Volunteers will pay only for the electricity, which costs far less than gasoline per mile. But people who own electric cars would have to buy new batteries when the old ones no longer hold a charge, G.M. points out. No one is certain how many rechargings the batteries will take in everyday use.  G.M. has not said explicitly that the Impact will fail its road test. But William J. O'Neill, a G.M. spokesman, said at the auto show: ""Clearly, the consumer is going to decide what the future of the Impact is. **********""It is not going to help if we build 'X' number of units to satisfy the mandate, and then don't sell them."" **********That point of view frustrates and infuriates advocates of electrics. ""Their position is unbelievably curious,"" said Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation for New York State, which has adopted the California emission program. That means that New York, like California, will require that in the 1998 model year 2 percent of all cars sold must be electric. **********Consumers, he said, have demonstrated tremendous interest in electric cars, and suppliers keep coming up with technologies -- some complex but some as simple as aluminum frames -- that Detroit rejects, he said. The real reason, he contends, is that auto makers do not want to make obsolete their multibillion-dollar investments in technology for the internal-combustion engine. Converted Geo Metros **********Another group arguing that the electric car is real are the manufacturers already selling them. The Solectria Corporation of Wilmington, Mass., converts Geo Metros to electric power and sells them for $25,000 and up, depending on the battery and propulsion system. Arvind V. Rajan, vice president of the company, said he was certain G.M. could do the job for less. Among Solectria's handicaps, he said, is that it must buy the complete Geo Metro and discard the engine, fuel tank, fuel pump, exhaust system, radiator and various other parts worth $3,000 or so. **********Solectria is tiny; its production since it was founded in 1989 is about 60 cars. It has 52 orders in hand. But if the company could sell 10,000 units a year, Mr. Rajan said, the price would be less than $15,000 each. **********U.S. Electricar/Solar Electric Engineering Inc. of Sebastopol, Calif., asserts that it is the leading producer of electric vehicles, with more than 200 cars in service. These include converted Geo Prizms and Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks, which use drive systems provided by Hughes Power Control Systems, a G.M. subsidiary. **********Advocates suggest that the big auto makers, to get the ball rolling and build sales volume that would cut costs, could charge a little extra for gasoline models and subsidize the electrics. Advocates point out that the auto companies already do this for unpopular models, slashing prices to sell them while making higher profits on popular vehicles. **********G.M., however, says that if it makes electrics artificially cheap in California and internal-combustion models more expensive there, it would cause disadvantages for some dealers. People from around the country who really want an electric car will go to California to buy one, and dealers in Las Vegas and Seattle will be flooded with Californians buying gasoline models to bring home, which would not carry the California premium needed to subsidize electric cars. Counting On the Japanese **********California is supposed to sort out these arguments later this year, in a review that was scheduled when the low-emission vehicle plan was adopted. One hope, said William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board in Sacramento, is that foreign auto makers will say they can produce marketable cars. State officials are optimistic about the Japanese manufacturers, which have not disclosed much detail about their electric projects. **********The same issue -- whether the car is possible -- is a main focus of debate in the intense politicking now taking place in the Northeast, where 12 states and the District of Columbia are discussing whether they should ask the Environmental Protection Agency to impose the California rules on them. New York and Massachusetts have already adopted the rules, and environmental officials in the District of Columbia and the 10 other states agreed to adopt them, but in many cases state lawmakers balked; some legislatures have made approval contingent on adoption of the rules by neighboring states. The 13 jurisdictions will meet in Washington on Tuesday to vote. **********Mr. Sessa insisted that Detroit could build an electric car. Market acceptance, he said, is not something his agency can legislate, but something car sellers must compete for. ""If one makes a car that is not acceptable, others will make one that meets public acceptance, and that's how new technology comes into the market,"" he said."

Although the International Business Machines Corporation and the Amdahl Corporation have seen some resurgence in mainframe sales, Unisys has not, analysts said. **********""They are being forced to transform themselves faster than they previously expected because the cash cow, the mainframe business, has not been as benign as they thought it would be,"" said Michael J. Geran, an analyst with the Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********""This is the second wave of a reorganization begun two years ago, when they should have done more,"" he said. ""What they're doing now is accepting reality, rather than assuming they could manage through this transition."" **********A Unisys spokesman said the job cuts would be evenly split between the United States and Europe, but it was unclear whether they would be done through layoffs, early retirements or attrition. The company currently employs 33,000 people in the United States and 13,900 abroad. **********Formed eight years ago by the merger of Burroughs and Sperry, Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., has struggled as the computer industry's growth has shifted from proprietary mainframe systems to networks of smaller machines available from many manufacturers. The company lost nearly $2.5 billion from 1989 to 1991, and has cut more than half of its work force since 1988. Sales fell from a 1990 peak of $10.1 billion to $7.7 billion last year. **********James A. Unruh, Unisys's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that while the company had achieved growth in the second half of this year in information services and smaller computers, a slowdown in its traditional hardware and maintenance businesses had led to disappointing financial results in 1994. ""To improve operating results going forward, we have decided to take some near-term steps to accelerate our successful transition into a services-led company,"" he said. **********Unisys expects departmental servers, which are computers used on networks, desktop machines and services, to account for more than half of revenues in 1995. ""As they become an ever larger part of the total company, the traditional infrastructure must be far more streamlined and efficient,"" Mr. Unruh said. **********Daniel Mandresh, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that Mr. Unruh deserved credit for improving Unisys's profit margins from 27 percent in 1991 to 37 percent in 1993 but that more work was needed now to stop them from slipping. ""He did a great job for two years of getting gross margins up by taking capacity out,"" he said. ""It was enough for then; it's not enough for now."""

Often, he said, buyers were attracted by the word ""government"" in fund names. In fact, Treasury prices have been volatile. **********""It seems to me it's not a bad time to be buying longer bond funds,"" he said. ""An 8 percent yield is a lot better than 6 percent,"" the rate at the beginning of the year. If the Federal Reserve pushes rates up further, of course, principal will erode more.

https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/29/world/china-migrants-economic-engine-social-burden.html,Patrick Tyler,1994-06-29,,1725,,The New York Times,World,News,article,"China Migrants: Economic Engine, Social Burden","China Migrants: Economic Engine, Social Burden"," **********With his possessions bundled in plastic and hung from his shoulders, and his trousers rolled up to beat the heat, 30-year-old Ren Jun drifted into Beijing this month, part of a migrant tide of 50 million peasants that is threatening to swamp China's urban landscape. **********To the Communist Party leadership, they are the engine of China, an inexhaustible supply of cheap labor, a floating population helping to build the country. They are one reason that 5,000 factories can be simultaneously under construction in China's coastal provinces. **********But they also are becoming a huge and at times unstable and exploited force rampant on the fringes of China's overcrowded and polluted urban centers, where crime, corruption and unemployment threaten stability. **********The migrants are easy to spot. Most large cities along China's coast have a million or two living in shanty towns, dormitories or public spaces. At Beijing's main railway station, a thousand migrants an hour pass through the green metal gates. And vast numbers of laborers like Mr. Ren appear each morning here at an impromptu labor market, hoping local coal-mine supervisors will pick them to work. 'A Positive Development' **********""So far, I think it has been quite a positive development,"" said Fan Gang, a leading economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""It has helped to transfer wealth from rich to poor areas of the country."" **********Richard Baum, a political science professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, called the mobile population ""a shock absorber"" that can flow from one sector of the fast-changing economy to another ""to cushion the transformation of the Chinese economy."" **********At the same time, today's migration could be the harbinger of an even greater one to come, Chinese and Western specialists say. With 130 million surplus workers in China's farm belt and a surge in population growth that will push that number to 200 million by 2000, China's migrants are an X factor in China's future. **********""In five years, this could become a very big problem,"" Professor Fan said.  Estimate of 70 Million **********In March, Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang estimated that 50 million peasants had left their farms in 1993 to seek employment in the cities, more than double the 24 million who set off for the cities in 1992. **********Some estimates put the ""floating population"" at 70 million to 100 million, said Dorothy Solinger, a China scholar at the University of California at Irvine. She also argued that the migrant problem ""may not be as bleak as it is made out to sound."" **********""First, they are not all going to the big cities,"" she said. Many migrants simply move off farms into township enterprises nearby, or even far away, but not necessarily to large cities. **********Second, she argued, where migrants do cluster, crime is the largest potential worry, not political rebellion. She pointed out that the Mayor of Zhuhai, the special economic zone adjoining Macao, recently said 75 percent of the crime in his city could be attributed to migrants. **********But much is simply unknown, she said. The growth of the migrant phenomenon came from nowhere in a country that enforced rigid residency rules just a decade ago, making it impossible for peasants or city dwellers to stray from their work units. **********What seems undisputed is that Pearl River delta in Guangdong Province has the largest concentration of migrants, an estimated 10 million. At least 500,000 are child laborers, Chinese surveys have shown; many work in sweatshop conditions. Dangers of a Downturn **********In Jiangxi Province, the outflow of farmers leaped from 200,000 in 1991 to more than 3 million last year. Shanghai's 13 million residents are now supporting 2.5 million rural workers attracted from all over the Yangtze valley to construction work on the city's vast redevelopment. **********As long as China's economic growth gallops along at more than 10 percent a year, this floating population is likely to remain relatively well employed, prosperous and stable. But an economic downturn or recession could easily leave the migrants stranded and aggrieved. **********""This is the labor of an exploited class,"" said a longtime Western diplomat here. ""There are no wage laws to protect them, and they can be fired on a whim."" **********Professor Baum added: ""It is a double-edged sword to be sure. They may be an efficient buffer helping to transform the economy, but they are also a large pool of marginal people subject to the vagaries and insecurity of having no rice bowl they can count on. They are dying in grotesque industrial accidents, they are locked in the dormitories at night, and they create a pocket of potential human misery wherever they cluster."" Building Subways and Hotels **********Farmers from Sichuan Province are building Beijing's new subway, just as peasants from Zhejiang Province are building new freeways, hotels, office buildings and ministries. Many leave their villages because $1.25 a day on a sweltering construction site is more than they can earn working the land. **********Others are ""environmental refugees"" from northern and western China where the land has just given out from degraded soil, dried up water resources or the relentless advance of the Central Asian deserts. **********Many go home with money in their pockets, but many also go home nurturing grievances. **********On a recent afternoon, six unkempt men lying on bedrolls in Beijing's main railway station explained why they were returning to Jiangsu Province after less than a month at work here. Their spokesman was a 24-year-old farmer named Liu with a face lined by weather and worry. **********""We just don't want to work here any more,"" he said. ""We left our construction team yesterday without notifying the boss. It serves him right."" **********The construction boss had come to Mr. Liu's hometown and promised to pay the villagers $1.72 a day to lay bricks and pour concrete. He said he would also pay for their train tickets. But when they got to the site, near Beijing's international airport, the boss cut their wages to 57 cents a day and told them they would have to pay for their own train tickets. The Uses of Money **********Their tempers simmered for a month before they decided to head back to the farm, where their wives were looking after the rice crop. **********Speaking in a tone that reflected their intimidation in the big city, Mr. Liu said: ""We dare not walk in Beijing alone. We are new here. Some people might find faults with us, or fine us."" **********Remittances from peasants who do find work are dramatically redistributing the new wealth. **********Professor Fan said that in one county in Sichuan Province, migrants remitted $138 million last year, more than the total economic output of the county, which was $115 million. A recent study of China's rural economy said migrant farmers from Anhui Province sent home $862 million, which exceeded the provincial government's annual revenue by $230 million. **********What is most remarkable, however, is the sheer mass of migration. **********During Lunar New Year celebrations, when all 1.2 billion Chinese are drawn home to their families, train stations became encampments for hundreds of thousands of travelers a day, Woodstock-sized crowds of peasants waiting for trains in dozens of rail hubs. 52 Trampled to Death **********At the New Year in February, China's overburdened rail system pressed special freight trains into service, each one bulging with human cargo packed so tightly that some passengers became hysterical with claustrophobia. In one accident, 52 people were trampled to death when 10,000 migrants were herded onto a freight train in Hunan Province. **********Mr. Ren arrived recently in Beijing hoping to land a job in the local coal mines. He made his way to the labor market, becoming one face in a sea of laborers for hire. **********Alarmed at the rapid growth of Beijing, the municipal authorities have posted signs saying the market has been closed. This has not stopped the peasants from coming, nor has it stopped gangs of criminals from prowling the market, looking for women and children to abduct and sell into China's booming trade in prostitutes and wives for sale. From One City to Next **********Policemen on foot patrols often scatter the workers like so many chickens. **********One laborer who kept well away from the police was Wang Xinmin, 24, who has migrated from one city to another since he left Henan Province at 17. Too much work on not enough land put him on the road, he said. **********He has worked in the far south, at a garment factory in the special economic zone of Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, but it did not last. **********""The local people there bullied us because we were from the countryside,"" he said. And the factory boss, who had promised high wages, delivered only half of that on payday. **********""The working conditions were really unsafe and chaotic,"" he said, ""and though we were supposed to work eight hours a day, actually we had to work much longer."" **********Having lost his most recent job, as a busboy, Mr. Wang said he would try for two more weeks to land another job in Beijing before heading home. Farming 'Not Worth It' **********Mr. Wang sat cross-legged under a pine tree near the labor market, and when he finished telling his story, he listened to one from Mr. Ren, who comes from a line of farmers in the hardscrabble hills of Hebei, 120 miles northwest of Beijing. **********""People like me don't want to work on the land anymore,"" Mr. Ren said. ""It's backbreaking work. I've tried it. The land is not fertile, and it is far from any water. It's just not worth it."" **********If he stayed home and worked the land, Mr. Ren said, he might earn $345 a year if rain were plentiful. But working in a Beijing coal mines, he might take home nearly $700. **********In either case, it is not enough to get a wife these days. ""I would like to have a wife,"" he said. ""But the dowry demands of girls are very high,"" higher even than the wages of a migrant coal miner."

At the end of the month, P.& G., the household products giant, will begin shipping bottles of Top Job that carry labels bearing the new name, Mr. Clean Top Job. To accentuate the change, the bald, earring-bedecked Mr. Clean character will be added, too. **********For those who have not mopped their floors lately, Top Job, which P.& G. introduced in 1963, is a green-colored liquid cleaner with ammonia, while Mr. Clean, introduced in 1957, is a yellow-colored liquid cleaner without ammonia. **********If those distinctions seem minute, remember that P.& G. attained its hegemony in consumer products precisely by developing a multiplicity of brands that were subtly different from each other and continually promoted as ""New!"" and ""Improved!"" As these variations on a theme filled grocers' shelves -- 11 brands of laundry detergents, 8 brands of bar soap, 6 brands of hair-care products -- they left little room for whatever P.& G.'s competitors were marketing. **********But consumers are no longer interested in spending time comparing seemingly similar brands of prosaic products -- particularly when, in categories like diapers, a P & G mainstay, they find cheaper store brands to be perfectly satisfying alternatives. And retailers, determining there are limits to what once looked like endlessly expandable shelf space, are demanding that marketers reduce the bewildering array of brands and package sizes they produce. **********As a result, even companies like P.& G., keen to purvey a panoply of products, realize they must rationalize their lineups. Top executives of P.& G. have acknowledged the company has too many struggling brands and could cut costs by concentrating on its stronger names and eliminating the poorer performers. **********Top Job is certainly in the latter category. The brand, which is sold in eastern and central parts of the United States, was No. 8 among liquid nondisinfectant cleaners in supermarkets for the 52 weeks ended Sept. 11, according to Nielsen Marketing Research, with sales of $13.3 million, down 18.5 percent from the previous 52 weeks. **********Mr. Clean, by comparison, was ranked third, with sales of $34.2 million, down 2 percent. P.& G. sees the Mr. Clean line as a potential growth vehicle, adding in the last year products called Mr. Clean Bathroom, a pourable liquid cleaner, and Mr. Clean Glass and Surface, a spray; still to come is a Mr. Clean with pine and a Mr. Clean with bleach. **********Lynn Hailey, a spokeswoman at P.& G. in Cincinnati, said that ""merging Top Job into Mr. Clean is an effective and an efficient way to meet the needs of both Mr. Clean and Top Job consumers and customers,"" the latter meaning retailers. **********The company began advising them of the impending change during the last couple of months, she added, by affixing stickers to Top Job bottles promoting the Mr. Clean Top Job name. An advertisement in free-standing coupon inserts in Sunday newspapers also declares: ""Top Job is joining the Mr. Clean family! We're changing the name to Mr. Clean Top Job, but it's still the same great product!"" **********Ms. Hailey said the consolidation ""isn't part of an overall company strategy, if you will,"" adding, ""Each brand makes its own decisions, based on customer and consumer needs."" **********Still, Top Job is the sixth P.& G. brand in the last year and a half to lose its independence or be discontinued. White Cloud bathroom tissue, Solo liquid detergent and Puritan cooking oil were all merged with stronger-selling sibling brands. The company shut down a subsidiary selling Citrus Hill juices and is eliminating the Clarion cosmetics line. **********Despite its also-ran status, Top Job was an unexpected victim of the P.& G. paring knife. Articles in the trade publications Adweek and Brandweek, speculating on potential casualties of P.& G. consolidations, listed brands like Dreft, Gain and Oxydol detergents; Fisher nuts, and Joy dishwashing liquid -- but not Top Job. **********Top Job's advertising has been handled by Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor Inc. in New York, a main P.& G. agency that also handles brands including Bounty towels and Zest soap. The account has been inactive of late. Competitive Media Reporting in New York, which tracks ad spending, showed no spending on Top Job during the first 11 months of 1993, compared with $277,900 in the corresponding period a year earlier. **********Ms. Hailey said advertising for Mr. Clean Top Job would be handled by the Mr. Clean agency, Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago, another main P.& G. shop that also handles brands including Coast soap and Head & Shoulders shampoo. (Ken Laird, the art director on the Mr. Clean account at Tatham's predecessor, Tatham Laird & Kudner, first drew the Mr. Clean character.) **********During the first 11 months of 1993, Competitive Media Reporting said, Mr. Clean ad spending soared to $18.3 million, from $900,900 during the corresponding period a year earlier."

Oxman, the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs and a close friend of President and Mrs. Clinton, that he would soon be relieved of his post, senior Administration officials said today. **********Richard C. Holbrooke, a former career Foreign Service officer who has been Ambassador to Germany for only eight months, will replace him, the officials said. Security Aide Replaced **********The White House has recently announced the replacement of Jennone Walker as its top Western European specialist on the National Security Council. Senior White House officials said the move had been in the works for a number of months and was unrelated to the impending dismissal of Mr. Oxman. **********Mr. Lake did not dismiss her, however. Rather, she will soon begin language training in preparation for becoming Ambassador to the Czech Republic next year. **********The personnel changes reflect frustration in both the White House and State Department over developing and articulating a coherent strategy toward Europe in general and toward Bosnia in particular. **********Mr. Oxman, a Wall Street lawyer and investment banker, was a friend of the Clintons at Yale Law School and was Mr. Christopher's executive assistant in the Carter Administration. A Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Oxman holds a doctorate from Oxford in diplomatic history. **********Mr. Oxman will be offered an ambassadorship in Europe, but not Bonn, senior officials said. Decision to Make Change **********The decision was made after Mr. Christopher and Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott, with strong support from the White House, concurred that a change was necessary. **********""The Secretary is absolutely determined to get the best people in senior jobs,"" a senior State Department official said. ""It's part of a larger strategy to strengthen his Department with a view toward the future. There was a sense that given the complications of this job -- not only with the Bosnia policy, but with other places as well -- that we could do better."" **********But the Oxman dismissal is the latest of several in the State Department in recent months. Since last November, Mr. Christopher has removed Clifton R. Wharton Jr. as his deputy, Samuel Lewis as his director of policy planning and Lawrence Pezzullo as his special envoy to Haiti. **********In addition, Thomas W. Simons Jr., a career Foreign Service officer and former Ambassador to Poland, is about to be replaced as special coordinator for assistance to the former Soviet Union. **********The European bureau, which is responsible for 38 countries and relationships with NATO, the European Union and other international organizations, is the largest bureau in the State Department. **********Mr. Oxman did not return phone calls. Mr. Holbrooke, reached by telephone in Berlin, said, ""I do not have any comment at all."""
